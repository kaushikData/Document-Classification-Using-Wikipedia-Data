The '''1996 Parliament House riot''' (also called the '''Canberra riot''') involved a physical attack on [[Parliament House, Canberra]], Australia, on 19 August 1996, when protesters broke away from the "Cavalcade to Canberra" rally organised by the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU) and sought to force their way into the national [[Parliament of Australia]], causing property damage and attacking police.

==Overview==
[[File:Parliament House Canberra (706422542).jpg|thumb|The entrance to [[Parliament House, Canberra]] - scene of the 1996 riot.]]

The [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] called the "cavalcade to Canberra" rally to protest against the industrial relations reform agenda of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National]] Coalition [[Howard Government]]. The protest began with senior Australian Trade Union officials including ACTU President [[Jennie George]] and Assistant Secretary [[Greg Combet]], as well as senior members of the [[Australian Labor Party]] rallying demonstrators from a  podium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/jennie-george-bids-farewell-to-politics/1682568.aspx?storypage=2 Jennie George bids farewell to politics - Local News - News - General - Illawarra Mercury]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/nation-today-with-malcolm-farr/story-e6frg15u-1226027256101 |title=The nation today - live with Malcolm Farr &amp;#124; Perth Now |access-date=24 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609143104/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/nation-today-with-malcolm-farr/story-e6frg15u-1226027256101 |archive-date=9 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to then [[President of the Australian Senate|President of the Senate]], [[Margaret Reid (politician)|Margaret Reid]], the initially peaceful protest deteriorated into violent action when a new group of demonstrators arrived in the early afternoon and, joined by people from the main protest, attacked the entrance to Parliament. Around 90 personnel were injured —including lacerations, sprains, and head and eye injuries. Damage to the forecourt and foyer of Parliament was initially estimated at $75,000 and the Parliamentary shop was looted. Nine rioters were arrested and charged with a variety of offences.&lt;ref name="aph1"&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds200896.pdf Hansard of the Australian Senate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216215833/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds200896.pdf |date=16 February 2012 }} 20 Aug 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Before the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 Australian Federal election]], ACTU Secretary, [[Bill Kelty]], had threatened 'industrial war' if a Coalition Government tried to challenge union power.&lt;ref name="anu1"&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/riot.htm The Parliament House riot of 1996] by Luke Deer, published by [[Australian National University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following their 1996 election victory, the [[Howard Government]] proposed to balance the [[Australian federal budget]] by means of extensive budget cuts, and introduced a draft Workplace Relations Amendment Bill which proposed to curtail '[[closed shop|compulsory unionism]]' and to introduce a more decentralised bargaining structure to the Australian work place. Both endeavours were opposed by Trade Unionists who organised a campaign of protest to culminate on the eve of the federal budget, 19 August 1996 with a protest rally on the lawns of the Federal Parliament, called the "Cavalcade to Canberra".&lt;ref name="anu1"/&gt;

==The protest and riot==

On 4 July 1996, the [[A.C.T. Trades and Labour Council]] advised the Speaker and President of the Parliament that a rally would be held at Parliament House on Monday, 19 August and requested permission to conduct a march around the Parliament building. The march was approved for between 1.35&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 2.25 p.m, provided adequated marshalling was organised and that the demonstration did not obstruct access to Parliament. Subsequent discussions were also conducted with the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]] and the indigenous representatives and all agreed to these parameters for the demonstration. On the day of 19 August, The protest rally remained peaceful until about 12.20&amp;nbsp;p.m. at which point a separate group of demonstrators entered the parliamentary precinct. The following day, the [[President of the Australian Senate]] outlined to Parliament the events that followed thus:&lt;ref name="aph1"/&gt;

{{quote|[T]his group refused to accept police direction, forced a breach in police lines and ran towards the main front entrance of Parliament House. Unfortunately, it was apparent that some of these demonstrators were affected by alcohol. This group was supported by participants from the more general demonstration who were incited to join those involved in riotous conduct by a speaker from the official platform.

Police formed a protective line along the perimeter of the Great Verandah which was subsequently forced back to the main doors. The police line was withdrawn from this area due to the level of violence being experienced by officers and was redeployed to an area inside the front doors in support of parliamentary security personnel. This deployment stabilised the situation for a short period. However, demonstrators using increasing force broke through the first line of doors.

Once inside this area, demonstrators used weapons, including a large hammer, a wheel brace, a steel trolley and a stanchion torn from the external doors to break open the internal doors. Simultaneously, a second group of demonstrators used other weapons to break into the Parliament House shop, but were held at the internal doors. The shop was ransacked by demonstrators and major damage was caused by persons who subsequently occupied the area. After some two hours, the demonstrators were finally repelled from Parliament House and driven back onto the forecourt area and, shortly afterwards, they dispersed.

In addition to the events which took place at the front entrance to the building, incidents also occurred on the Members Terrace, the roof of the Great Verandah and the Queens Terrace. There were 197 Australian Federal Police on duty at the start of the demonstration, in addition to the Australian Protective Service officers and parliamentary security personnel. A further 60 Australian Federal Police reinforcements were called out under established contingency plans.
}}

During the course of the riot, unionist Davie Thomason, of the [[CFMEU]], took the podium at the official rally with a bloodied face and spoke while shaking a police riot shield, saying to cheers from other protesters:&lt;ref name="anu1"/&gt;

{{quote|[T]he CFMEU and other organisations from the construction division, 100 of us have got into our House. And look what we got from the coppers. And we have to remember it's going to be a long haul but these people up here will never defeat us, we have to remember that ... Workers, united, will never be defeated.
}}

Addressing the Senate the following day, Senator [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], leader of the Government in the Senate, described the event as "very sad day in the history of the Australian political process", and his opposition counterpart Senator [[John Faulkner]] condemned the "appalling violence" on behalf of the opposition. Senator [[Cheryl Kernot]] for the [[Australian Democrats]] said she "condemned" the violence and "I deplore the actions of those who, in my opinion, selfishly and deliberately chose to distract from discussion of the issues". Senator [[Dee Margetts]], speaking for the [[Greens Western Australia]] said that "the Greens WA do not associate ourselves with the violent action" but that "there are obviously some in the Greens movement who have differing opinions about that".&lt;ref name="aph1"/&gt; In the House of Representatives, Opposition Leader [[Kim Beazley]] called the rioters "lunatics" and "louts" who had distracted from a "peaceful and lawful" protest, while Prime Minister [[John Howard]] described the violence as "thuggery" and said that the ACTU should accept some responsibility for the riot:&lt;ref name="aph1"/&gt;

{{quote|Those who organise demonstrations have a responsibility to stop them getting out of hand, and it is utterly disingenuous of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to pretend that it can accept no responsibility at all for what happened yesterday.

'''Amishi Jha''' is an associate professor of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Miami]] whose research on [[attention]], [[working memory]], and [[mindfulness]] has investigated the neural bases of [[executive functioning]] and mental training using various cognitive neuroscience techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/system/files/2007_JCogNeurosci_Sreenivasan%2526Jha.pdf/ University of Pennsylvania]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625211241/http://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/system/files/2007_JCogNeurosci_Sreenivasan%26Jha.pdf/ |date=June 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past studies have focused on the method by which attention selects information as relevant or irrelevant and how working memory then allows that information to be manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/assets/pdf/2002_CogBrainRes_Jha.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Jha's most recent research has examined mindfulness training with soldiers in the U.S. military with the Strong Projects as a tool in improving situational awareness and reducing stress measured through brainwave activity and cognitive behavioral tools. Her work has been featured in numerous publications, popular press articles, she has spoken at the [[World Economic Forum]], the [[Aspen Institute]], and the NY Academy of Sciences and has presented her research to the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Mind and Life Institute]], and Poptech.

==Education and career==
Jha received her B.S. in Psychology from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1993, and her PhD in Psychology from the [[University of California-Davis]] in 1998. During her graduate school she worked with [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and Ron Mangun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/mangun/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010208/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/mangun/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2001 she completed her post-doctoral training in [[Neuroimaging]] and Functional MRI ([[fMRI]]), at [[Duke University]] with Gregory McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.yale.edu/faculty/gregory-mccarthy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000757/http://psychology.yale.edu/faculty/gregory-mccarthy |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 to 2010 she worked as an assistant professor at [[University of Pennsylvania]] at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and Department of Psychology. In 2010 she joined the [[University of Miami]] as an associate professor in the Department of Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/ajha/ University of Miami Faculty Page]&lt;/ref&gt; Since arriving at the University of Miami, she has co-founded the Mindfulness Research and Practice Initiative and serves as the Director of Contemplative Neuroscience for that effort.

==Research==
Jha has examined the executive functioning mechanisms of the brain such as [[attention]], and [[working memory]], utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging, [[event related potential]], [[electroencephalography]], signal detection and behavioral methods. Her lab has investigated [[mindfulness]] training as a route to strengthen attentional processes as well as reduce perceived stress, and improve mood. Jha published one of the first studies on how attention may be modified by mindfulness training, and the first study of how mindfulness may protect against degradation in working memory in high stress groups, specifically military cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/JFQ_Mind_Fitness.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231803/http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/JFQ_Mind_Fitness.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research has followed two parallel lines of questioning – one seeking to determine the neural mechanisms of executive functioning and the other developing and evaluating ways to bolster executive functioning through training.

===Findings===
Jha's research into mindfulness-based training seeks to determine the benefits of mindfulness training and how this training changes cognitive and affective processes at neural and behavioral levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/wp-content/uploads/jha_stanley_etal_emotion_2010.pdf] Jha, A.P., Stanley, E.A., Kiyonaga, A., Wong, L., &amp; Gelfand., L. (2010). Examining the Protective Effects of Mindfulness Training on Working Memory and Affective Experience. Emotion, 10(1), 54–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Her findings have consistently shown that mindfulness training improves numerous aspects of both cognitive and emotional health. As well, she has demonstrated that there may be a dose-response effect of mindfulness training, so that greater benefits are observed with greater time spent engaging in mindfulness exercises.

====Military====
[[File:STRONG.jpg|thumb|STRONG Project logo]]Exposure to significant and potentially traumatizing stress is pervasive for military personnel during times of war. Such stress can lead to a degradation of psychological health with potentially dire consequences for the individual (e.g. [[PTSD]]), mission (e.g. impaired judgment), and family (e.g. divorce), amongst others. In some of the first studies of mindfulness training in the military, Jha partnered with the Mind Fitness Training Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/ Mind Fitness Training Institute (MMFT)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102091949/http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/ |date=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and training developed and delivered by Dr. Elizabeth Stanley of [[Georgetown University]]. An 8-week mindfulness training course was offered to [[Marines]] preparing to deploy to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=46897/ Georgetown University News: Interview with Elizabeth Stanley]&lt;/ref&gt; She found that the more time Marines spent engaging in mindfulness exercises outside of the classroom, the more they improved in their working memory and mood. Jha suggested that working memory capacity may be a core cognitive capacity necessary to preserve psychological resilience in high stress cohorts. These findings suggest that even in individuals facing extraordinary levels of stress, mindfulness training may help improve overall mental health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/JFQ_Mind_Fitness.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231803/http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/JFQ_Mind_Fitness.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }} Joint Force Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teachers====
In a recent study with teachers, Jha and collaborators looked at whether mindfulness training would be effective at improving the mental well-being of elementary and secondary school teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/wp-content/uploads/Jha_MindfulnessTrainingAndReductionsInTeacherStress_Apr2013.pdf] Roeser, R. W., Schonert-Reichl, K. A., Jha, A. P., Cullen, M., Wallace, L., Wilensky, R., Oberle, E., Thomson, K., Taylor, C., &amp; Harrison, J. (2013). Mindfulness Training and Reductions in Teacher Stress and Burnout: Results From Two Randomized, Waitlist-Control Field Trials. Journal of Educational Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of the 8-week mindfulness training course, teachers reported less occupational stress, less occupational burnout, as well as lower symptoms of both depression and anxiety, while increasing their working memory capacity. Importantly, teachers who received mindfulness training continued to improve on all four measures over the three-month period following the completion of the course. This finding suggests that not only does mindfulness training have an immediate positive impact on emotional health but that the effects persist, providing long-term improvements in several aspects of well-being.

====Children====
Many types of contemplative practices, including mindfulness, train individuals to learn to control their attention, critical to success in a variety of settings, including school. In a recent study, Jha and colleagues sought to determine whether, and if so, how, concentrative meditation training can affect attentional processing in school age children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/wp-content/uploads/Davidson_etal_2012.pdf] Davidson, R., Dunne, J., Eccles, J. S., Engle, A., Greenberg, M., Jennings, P., Jha, A. P., Jinpa, T., Lantieri, L., Meyer, D., Roeser, R. W., &amp; Vago, D. (2012). Contemplative Practices and Mental Training: Prospects for American Education. Child Development Perspectives. 6(2): 146-153.
&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicated that even in children as young as 13, meditation training improved children's ability to achieve and maintain alertness. Additionally, training improved children's ability to resolve conflicts between divergent actions, which may improving their ability to complete tasks as instructed. These findings suggest that meditation training may improve academic performance.

In another study in children who are part of the juvenile justice system, Jha and [[NYU]] collaborators investigated if mindfulness training vs. an active comparison training might protect against degradation in attention that may accompany being incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/wp-content/uploads/Jha_MindfulnessTrainingImprovesAttentionalTaskPerformance_Nov2013.pdf] Leonard, N. R., Jha, A. P., Casarjian, B., Goolsaran, M., Garcia, C., Cleland, C. M., Gwadz, M. V., &amp; Massey, Z. (2013). Mindfulness Training Improves Attentional Task Performance in Incarcerated Youth: A Group Randomized Controlled Intervention Trial. Frontiers in Psychology.
&lt;/ref&gt; While those in the active comparison group degraded in their attention over a several month interval of being incarcerated, those in the mindfulness group did not. Again, Jha suggests that attention may serve as a core cognitive capacity necessary for resilience. In addition, attention is necessary for effective decision making under stress and regulation of behavior. Greater access to these capacities with mindfulness training may help promote resilience and reduce recidivism in children who have entered the juvenile justice system.

{{Hinduism_small}}
The [[Katha Upanishad]] (1.12-13) mentions aa  ''puruṣa'' (man, being) of the size of the thumb (''aṅgúṣṭha'') enshrined in the interiors of the heart (''hridaye guhaayaam'' "cave of the heart") of a human being.

:"The  purusha, who is of the size of a thumb, resides in the body.
:The purusha who is the size of a thumb is a light (jyoti) without smoke."

Certain other Upanishads describe the purusha to be of a golden (hiranmaya) hue and the purursha as a golden being (hiranmaya purusha). The purusha is seated inside the cave of the human heart. As per [[Hindu]] religious beliefs, the heart is identified as the abode of divinity within the body. In [[Bhagavat Gita|Gita]], Lord Krishna enunciated that he stays within heart of each human being.

This "being" dwelling inside the heart has been equated with the ‘jiva’ or the ‘self’ which carries the consciousness and a meta-physical body (prakriti), also termed as the ''karana sharira''. The ''karana sharira'' has most transcendental existence and accumulates the experiences of the physical, earthly life. This 'jiva' is a spark of divinity, and its place in the body is the heart region.(Heart means not the physical heart But the spiritual heart or the heart chakra.)

As per Sri [[Aurobindo]], the angustha purusha is made up of elements of ''chaitya'' (''chetna''), ''i.e.'' the angustha purusha is a being existing at the psychic (Chetas) sphere. Sri [[Aurobindo]] mentions that behind the ordinary [[chakra]] of the human heart region, inside a deep cave ''nihite guhayam'' as described by the Upanishads, is the center where a divine spark is present. This thumb-sized purusha is the bird in the twin-bird analogy of the [[Rigveda]] and [[Sankhya]] (''dvau suparna sayuja sakhaya'') which actually gets involved in the [[prakriti]] and suffers and/or enjoys the fruits of its [[Karma]].

As per Upanishads, the ''hiranmaya angustha purusha'' embodies the karana sharira. This ''hiranmaya angustha purusha'' is the vehicle of transmigration of soul among births.

The visualizations regarding the size of the 'self' has been of great significance in the Upansihads. The [[Brhadaranyaka]] Upanishad in V. 5.6.1 and the [[Chandogya]] Upanishad in V.3.14.3 maintain the size of the self to be equal to a seed. The  Shatapata Brahmana, V.10.6.3, mentions that the self:&lt;br&gt;
...in the interior of my heart, is as tiny like a rice or barley or millet seed and golden like a smokeless light (or flame).

The ''angustha purusha'' is indestructible and resplendent and is contra-distinct from the [[Purusha sukta#Purusha|purusha]] of the [[Purusha sukta]]. The ''angustha purusha'' is individualistic ''jivaatma'' while the primeval ''purursha'' of the [[purusha sukta]] is the collective ''paramatma''.

Big History arose from a desire to go beyond the specialized and self-contained fields that emerged in the 20th century. It tries to grasp history as a whole, looking for common themes across multiple time scales in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History |first=David |last=Christian |page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Changing Image of the Sciences |first=Ida H. |last=Stamhuis |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional history typically begins with the invention of writing, and is limited to past events relating directly to the [[human race]]. Big Historians point out that this limits study to the past 5,000 years and neglects the much longer time when humans existed on Earth. Henry Kannberg sees Big History as being a product of the [[Information Age]], a stage in history itself following speech, writing, and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kannberg| first1=Henry| title=Optimism| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/197069825/OPTIMISM-optitunity| website=Scribd| accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big History covers the formation of the universe, stars, and galaxies, and includes the beginning of life as well as the period of several hundred thousand years when humans were hunter-gatherers. It sees the transition to civilization as a gradual one, with many causes and effects, rather than an abrupt transformation from uncivilized static cavemen to dynamic civilized farmers.&lt;ref name=tws2M23/&gt; An account in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' describes what it [[polemic]]ally asserts to be the conventional "history" view:

{{Quote|Early humans were slump-shouldered, slope-browed, hairy brutes. They hunkered over campfires and ate scorched meat. Sometimes they carried [[spear]]s. Once in a while they scratched pictures of [[antelope]]s on the walls of their caves. That's what I learned during elementary school, anyway. History didn't start with the first humans - they were [[cavemen]]! The [[Stone Age]] wasn't history; the Stone Age was a preamble to history, a [[dystopia]]n era of stasis before the happy onset of civilization, and the arrival of nifty developments like chariot wheels, gunpowder, and Google. History started with agriculture, nation-states, and written documents. History began in [[Mesopotamia]]'s [[Fertile Crescent]], somewhere around 4000 BC. It began when we finally overcame our savage legacy, and culture surpassed biology.|Anthony Doerr reviewing ''On Deep History and the Brain'' by Daniel Lord Smail, 2007&lt;ref name=tws2M23&gt;{{cite news

Big History, in contrast to conventional history, has more of an interdisciplinary basis.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; Advocates sometimes view conventional history as "microhistory" or "shallow history", and note that three-quarters of historians specialize in understanding the last 250 years while ignoring the "long march of human existence."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; However, one historian disputed that the discipline of history has overlooked the big view, and described the "grand narrative" of Big History as a "cliché that gets thrown around a lot."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that conventional history had the "sense of grinding the nuts into an ever finer powder."&lt;ref name=tws2M14&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes long-term trends and processes rather than history-making individuals or events.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; Historian [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]] of the [[University of Chicago]] suggested that Big History was less politicized than contemporary history because it enables people to "take a step back."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; It uses more kinds of evidence than the standard historical written records, such as fossils, tools, household items, pictures, structures, ecological changes and genetic variations.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

Critics of Big History, including sociologist [[Frank Furedi]], have deemed the discipline an "[[anti-humanist]] turn of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big History narrative has also been challenged for failing to engage with the methodology of the conventional history discipline. According to historian and educator Sam Wineburg of [[Stanford University]], Big History eschews the interpretation of texts in favor of a purely scientific approach, thus becoming "less history and more of a kind of [[evolutionary biology]] or [[quantum physics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the mix of individual action and social and environmental forces, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; While conventional history might see an invention such as sharper spear points as being deliberately created by some smart humans, and then copied by other humans, a Big History perspective might see sharper spear points as accidental, and then natural evolutionary processes enabled their users to be better hunters, even if they did not understand why this was the case.&lt;ref name=tws2M22/&gt; It seeks to discover repeating patterns during the 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, one pattern is that "chaos catalyzes creativity", such as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|asteroid impact]] wiping out the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;

===Time scales and questions===
Big History makes comparisons based on different time scales, or what David Christian calls "the play of scales", and notes similarities and differences between the human, geological, and cosmological scales. Christian believes such "radical shifts in perspective" will yield "new insights into familiar historical problems, from the [[nature versus nurture|nature/nurture debate]] to [[environmental history]] to the fundamental nature of change itself."&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; It shows how human existence has been changed by both human-made and natural factors: for example, according to natural processes which happened more than four billion years ago, [[iron]] emerged from the remains of an exploding star and, as a result, humans could use this hard metal to forge weapons for hunting and war.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt; The discipline addresses such questions as "How did we get here?," "How do we decide what to believe?," "How did Earth form?," and "What is life?"&lt;ref name=tws2M31/&gt; It offers a "grand tour of all the major scientific paradigms."&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; According to one view, it helps students to become [[scientific literacy|scientifically literate]] quickly.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

===Cosmic evolution===
{{Nature timeline}}
[[Cosmic Evolution (book)|Cosmic evolution]], the scientific study of universal change, is closely related to Big History (as are the allied subjects of the [[epic of evolution]] and [[astrobiology]]); some researchers regard cosmic evolution as broader than Big History since the latter mainly (and rightfully) examines the specific historical trek from Big Bang → [[Milky Way]] → Sun → Earth → humanity. Cosmic evolution, while fully addressing all complex systems (and not merely those that led to humans), which is also sometimes called cosmological history or [[universal history]], has been taught and researched for decades, mostly by [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysicists]]. This Big-Bang-to-humankind scenario well preceded the subject that some historians began calling Big History in the 1990s. Cosmic evolution is an intellectual framework that offers a grand synthesis of the many varied changes in the assembly and composition of radiation, matter, and life throughout the history of the universe. While engaging the time-honored queries of who we are and whence we came, this interdisciplinary subject attempts to unify the sciences within the entirety of [[natural history]]—a single, inclusive scientific narrative of the origin and evolution of all material things over ~14 billion years, from the origin of the universe to the present day on Earth.

The roots of the idea of cosmic evolution extend back millennia. Ancient Greek philosophers of the fifth century BCE, most notably [[Heraclitus]], are celebrated for their reasoned claims that all things change. Early modern speculation about cosmic evolution began more than a century ago, including the broad insights of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Lawrence Henderson]]. Only in the mid-20th century was the cosmic-evolutionary scenario articulated as a research paradigm to include empirical studies of galaxies, stars, planets, and life—in short, an expansive agenda that combines physical, biological, and cultural evolution. [[Harlow Shapley]] widely articulated the idea of cosmic evolution (often calling it "[[cosmography]]") in public venues at mid-century,&lt;ref&gt;Palmeri, J., "Bringing Cosmos to Culture: Harlow Shapley and the Uses of Cosmic Evolution," in ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', Dick, S.J and Lupsella, M.L. (eds.), NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]] embraced it in the late 20th century as part of its more limited [[astrobiology]] program. [[Carl Sagan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, C., ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]'', Random House, 1980, {{ISBN|0-394-50294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Chaisson]],&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E., ''Cosmic Dawn: The Origins of Matter and Life'', [[Atlantic Monthly]]/[[Little, Brown]], 1981, {{ISBN|0-316-13590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubert Reeves]],&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, H., ''Patience dans l'azur: L'evolution cosmique'', [[Éditions du Seuil]], 1981&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich Jantsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Jantsch, E., ''The Self-Organizing Universe'', [[Pergamon Press|Pergamon]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Preston Cloud]],&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, P., ''Cosmos, Earth, and Man'', [[Yale Univ. Press]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; among others, extensively championed cosmic evolution at roughly the same time around 1980. This extremely broad subject now continues to be richly formulated as both a technical research program and a scientific worldview for the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], [[Harvard Univ. Press]], 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S.J., and Lupsella, M.L., ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S. and Strick, J., ''The Living Universe'', [[Rutgers University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-8135-3733-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution can elicit controversy for several reasons: [[evolution]] of any kind inherently attracts detractors, especially among religious [[fundamentalists]]; cosmic evolution addresses universal and human origins, which often elevate emotions; it challenges age-old ideas about life's sense of place in the cosmos; it embraces change, which many people dislike or distrust; it welcomes a broad interpretation of the concept of evolution, replacing the idea of evolution exclusive to life, which some biologists prefer; it proposes a sweeping, interdisciplinary worldview based on [[rationality]] and [[empiricism]], which, despite its experimental tests, some find intellectually arrogant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

One popular collection of scholarly materials on cosmic evolution is based on teaching and research that has been underway at [[Harvard University]] since the mid-1970s&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/AnthologyBH_article.pdf "Researching and Teaching Cosmic Evolution,"] in ''From Big Bang to Global Civilization: A Big History Anthology'', Rodriguez, Grinin, Korotayev, (eds.), [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity, energy, thresholds===
Cosmic evolution is a quantitative subject, whereas big history typically is not; this is because cosmic evolution is practiced mostly by natural scientists, while big history by social scholars. These two subjects, closely allied and overlapping, benefit from each other; cosmic evolutionists tend to treat universal history linearly, thus humankind enters their story only at the most very recent times, whereas big historians tend to stress humanity and its many cultural achievements, granting human beings a larger part of their story. One can compare and contrast these different emphases by watching two short movies portraying the Big-Bang-to-humankind narrative, one animating time linearly, and the other  capturing time (actually look-back time) logarithmically; in the former, humans enter this 14-minute movie in the last second, while in the latter we appear much earlier—yet both are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These different treatments of time over ~14 billion years, each with different emphases on historical content, are further clarified by noting that some cosmic evolutionists divide the whole narrative into three phases and seven epochs:
::'''Phases''': physical evolution → biological evolution → cultural evolution
::'''Epochs''': particulate → galactic → stellar → planetary → chemical → biological → cultural
This contrasts with the approach used by some big historians who divide the narrative into many more thresholds, as noted in the discussion at the end of this section below. Yet another telling of the Big-Bang-to-humankind story is one that emphasizes the earlier universe, particularly the growth of particles, galaxies, and large-scale cosmic structure, such as in [[physical cosmology]].

Notable among quantitative efforts to describe cosmic evolution are [[Eric Chaisson]]'s research efforts to describe the concept of energy flow through open, [[thermodynamic]] systems, including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 16, p.27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_II_galley_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density. II. Probing Further a New Complexity Metric,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 17, p.44, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The observed increase of [[energy rate density]] (energy/time/mass) among a whole host of complex systems is one useful way to explain the rise of complexity in an [[expanding universe]] that still obeys the cherished [[second law of thermodynamics]] and thus continues to accumulate net [[entropy]]. As such, ordered material systems—from buzzing bees and redwood trees to shining stars and thinking beings—are viewed as temporary, local islands of order in a vast, global sea of disorder. A recent review article, which is especially directed toward big historians, summarizes much of this empirical effort over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v. 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912.&lt;/ref&gt;

One striking finding of such complexity studies is the apparently ranked order among all known material systems in the universe. Although the ''absolute'' energy in astronomical systems greatly exceeds that of humans, and although the mass densities of stars, planets, bodies, and brains are all comparable, the energy rate ''density'' for humans and modern human society are approximately a million times greater than for stars and galaxies. For example, the Sun emits a vast luminosity, 4x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (equivalent to nearly a billion billion billion watt light bulb), but it also has a huge mass, 2x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; g; thus each second an amount of energy equaling only 2 ergs passes through each gram of this star. In contrast to any star, more energy flows through each gram of a plant's leaf during photosynthesis, and much more (nearly a million times) rushes through each gram of a human brain while thinking (~20W/1350g).&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/unifying_concept_for_astrobio.pdf "A unifying concept for astrobiology,"] ''International Journal of Astrobiology'', Vol. 2, p.91, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution is more than a subjective, qualitative assertion of "one damn thing after another". This inclusive scientific worldview constitutes an objective, quantitative approach toward deciphering much of what comprises organized, material Nature. Its uniform, consistent philosophy of approach toward all complex systems demonstrates that the basic differences, both within and among many varied systems, are of degree, not of kind. And, in particular, it suggests that optimal ranges of energy rate density grant opportunities for the evolution of complexity; those systems able to adjust, adapt, or otherwise take advantage of such energy flows survive and prosper, while other systems adversely affected by too much or too little energy are non-randomly eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/ASUessay_revised_for_CUP.pdf "Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,"] in ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time: What is Complexity?'', Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), [[Cambridge Univ. Press]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Spier is foremost among those big historians who have found the concept of energy flows useful, suggesting that Big History is the rise and demise of complexity on all scales, from sub-microscopic particles to vast galaxy clusters, and not least many biological and cultural systems in between.&lt;ref&gt;Spier, F., ''Big History and the Future of Humanity'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian describes each stage in the progression towards greater complexity as a "threshold moment" when things become more complex, but they also become more fragile and mobile.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt; Some of Christian's threshold stages are:

[[File:SN 1997D.jpg|thumb|right|In a [[supernova]], a star which has exhausted most of its energy bursts in an incredible explosion, creating conditions for heavier elements such as [[iron]] and [[gold]] to form.]]
# The universe appears, incredibly hot, busting, expanding, within a second.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars are born.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars die, creating temperatures hot enough to make complex chemicals, as well as rocks, asteroids, planets, moons, and our solar system.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Earth is created.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Life appears on Earth, with molecules growing from the [[Goldilocks conditions]], with neither too much nor too little energy.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Humans appear, language, collective learning.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Christian elaborated that more complex systems are more fragile, and that while collective learning is a powerful force to advance humanity in general, it is not clear that humans are in charge of it, and it is possible in his view for humans to destroy the [[biosphere]] with the powerful weapons that have been invented.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

In the 2008 lecture series through ''[[The Great Courses|The Teaching Company's Great Courses]]'' entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', Christian explains Big History in terms of eight thresholds of increasing complexity:&lt;ref name=ttc&gt;{{cite book

===Goldilocks conditions===
[[File:Solar sys.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Earth]] is ideally located in a [[Goldilocks principle|Goldilocks condition]]—being neither too close nor too distant from the Sun.]]
A theme in Big History is what has been termed Goldilocks conditions or the [[Goldilocks principle]], which describes how "circumstances must be right for any type of complexity to form or continue to exist," as emphasized by Spier in his recent book.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; For humans, bodily temperatures can neither be too hot nor too cold; for life to form on a planet, it can neither have too much nor too little energy from sunlight. Stars require sufficient quantities of [[hydrogen]], sufficiently packed together under tremendous gravity, to cause [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

Christian suggests that the universe creates complexity when these Goldilocks conditions are met, that is, when things are not too hot or cold, not too fast or slow. For example, life began not in solids (molecules are stuck together, preventing the right kinds of associations) or gases (molecules move too fast to enable favorable associations) but in liquids such as water which permitted the right kinds of interactions at the right speeds.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Somewhat in contrast, [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson]] has maintained for well more than a decade that "organizational complexity is mostly governed by the ''optimum'' use of energy—not too little as to starve a system, yet not too much as to destroy it" (italics in the original published paper&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/complexity_santafe_j.pdf "Complexity: An Energetics Agenda,"] ''Complexity'', v9, p14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;). Neither maximum energy principles nor minimum entropy states are likely relevant, and appeals to "Goldilocks principles" (or other such fairy tales) are unnecessary to appreciate the emergence of complexity in Nature writ large.

===Other themes===
[[File:FISHtechniqueInt.JPG|thumb|right|Big Historians use information based on scientific techniques such as [[gene mapping]] to learn more about the origins of humanity.]]
Advances in particular sciences such as [[archaeology]], [[gene mapping]], and [[evolutionary ecology]] have enabled historians to gain new insights into the early origins of humans, despite the lack of written sources.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that proponents of Big History were trying to "upend" the conventional practice in [[historiography]] of relying on written records.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

Big History proponents suggest that humans have been affecting [[climate change]] throughout history, by such methods as [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, although past modifications have been on a lesser scale than in recent years during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

A book by Daniel Lord Smail in 2008 suggested that history was a continuing process of humans learning to self-modify our mental states by using stimulants such as [[coffee]] and [[tobacco]], as well as other means such as [[religious rite]]s or [[romance novel]]s.&lt;ref name=tws2M22&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that culture and biology are highly intertwined, such that cultural practices may cause human brains to be wired differently from those in different societies.&lt;ref name=tws2M22/&gt;

===Presentation by web-based interactive video===
[[File:ChronoZoom Timeline Project.jpg|thumb|[[ChronoZoom]] is a free open source project that helps readers visualize time at all scales from the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago to the present.]]
Big History is more likely than conventional history to be taught with interactive "video-heavy" websites without textbooks, according to one account.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; The discipline has benefited from having new ways of presenting themes and concepts in new formats, often supplemented by Internet and computer technology.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, the [[ChronoZoom]] project is a way to explore the 14 billion year history of the universe in an interactive website format.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2M18&gt;{{cite news

==History of the field==

===Early efforts===
[[File:AvHumboldt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1843]]
[[File:Carl Sagan Planetary Society.JPG|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]]]]
While the emerging field of Big History in its present state is generally seen as having emerged in the past two decades beginning around 1990, there have been numerous precedents going back almost 150 years. In the mid-19th century, [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s book ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'', and [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers']] 1844 book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; were seen as early precursors to the field.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In a sense, Darwin's [[theory of evolution]] was, in itself, an attempt to explain a biological phenomenon by examining longer term cause-and-effect processes. In the first half of the 20th century, secular biologist [[Julian Huxley]] originated the term "evolutionary humanism",&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; while around the same time the French Jesuit paleontologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] examined links between [[cosmic evolution]] and a tendency towards complexification (including human consciousness), while envisaging compatibility between cosmology, evolution, and theology. In the mid and later 20th century, ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' by [[Jacob Bronowski]] examined history from a multidisciplinary perspective. Later, [[Eric Chaisson]] explored the subject of [[Cosmic Evolution (book)|cosmic evolution]] quantitatively in terms of [[energy rate density]], and the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] wrote ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; [[Thomas Berry]], a cultural historian, and the academic [[Brian Swimme]] explored meaning behind myths and encouraged academics to explore themes beyond [[organized religion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|The famous ''[[Earthrise]]'' photo may have stimulated, among other things, an interest in interdisciplinary studies.]]
The field continued to evolve from interdisciplinary studies during the mid-20th century, stimulated in part by the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]]. Some early efforts were courses in ''Cosmic Evolution'' at [[Harvard University]] in the [[United States]], and ''Universal History'' in the [[Soviet Union]]. One account suggested that the notable [[Earthrise]] photo, taken during a lunar orbit by the spacecraft [[Apollo 8]], which showed Earth as a small blue and white ball behind a stark and desolate lunar landscape, not only stimulated the [[environmental movement]] but also caused an upsurge of interdisciplinary interest.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; The [[France|French]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]] examined daily life with investigations of "large-scale historical forces like geology and climate".&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; Physiologist [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' examined the interplay between geography and human evolution;&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; for example, he argued that the horizontal shape of the [[Eurasia]]n continent enabled human civilizations to advance more quickly than the vertical north-south shape of the American continent, because it enabled greater competition and information-sharing among peoples of the relatively same climate.

In the 1970s, scholars in the United States including geologist [[Preston Cloud]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], astronomer G. Siegfried Kutter at [[Evergreen State College]] in Washington state, and [[Harvard University]] astrophysicists [[George B. Field]] and [[Eric Chaisson]] started synthesizing knowledge to form a "science-based history of everything", although each of these scholars emphasized somewhat their own particular specializations in their courses and books.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1980, the Austrian philosopher [[Erich Jantsch]] wrote ''The Self-Organizing Universe'' which viewed history in terms of what he called "process structures".&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; There was an experimental course taught by John Mears at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, and more formal courses at the university level began to appear.

In 1991 [[Clive Ponting]] wrote ''A Green History of the World: The Environment and the Collapse of Great Civilizations''. His analysis did not begin with the Big Bang, but his chapter "Foundations of History" explored the influences of large-scale geological and astronomical forces over a broad time period.

Sometimes the terms "Deep History" and "Big History" are interchangeable, but sometimes "Deep History" simply refers to history going back several hundred thousand years or more without the other senses of being a movement within history itself.&lt;ref name=tws2M25&gt;{{cite news

===David Christian===
One exponent is [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] of [[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian was also affiliated with [[San Diego State University]] in [[California]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf San Diego State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209212647/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He read widely in diverse fields in science, and believed that much was missing from the general study of history. His first university-level course was offered in 1989.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; He developed a college course beginning with the [[Big Bang]] to the [[present day|present]]&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; in which he collaborated with numerous colleagues from diverse fields in science and the humanities and the social sciences. This course eventually became a [[Teaching Company]] course entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', with 24 hours of lectures,&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; which appeared in 2008.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

Since the 1990s, other universities began to offer similar courses. In 1994 at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], college courses were offered.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1996, Fred Spier wrote ''The Structure of Big History''.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; Spier looked at structured processes which he termed "regimes":

{{Quote|I defined a regime in its most general sense as 'a more or less regular but ultimately unstable pattern that has a certain temporal permanence', a definition which can be applied to human cultures, human and non-human physiology, non-human nature, as well as to organic and inorganic phenomena at all levels of complexity. By defining 'regime' in this way, human cultural regimes thus became a subcategory of regimes in general, and the approach allowed me to look systematically at interactions among different regimes which together produce big history.|Fred Spier, 2008&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;}}

Christian's course caught the attention of philanthropist [[Bill Gates]], who discussed with him how to turn Big History into a high school-level course. Gates said about David Christian:

{{Quote|He really blew me away. Here's a guy who's read across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences and brought it together in a single framework. It made me wish that I could have taken big history when I was young, because it would have given me a way to think about all of the school work and reading that followed. In particular, it really put the sciences in an interesting historical context and explained how they apply to a lot of contemporary concerns.|Bill Gates, in 2012&lt;ref name=tws2M31&gt;{{cite news

===Educational courses===
By 2002, a dozen college courses on Big History had sprung up around the world.&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; [[Cynthia Stokes Brown]] initiated Big History at the [[Dominican University of California]], and she wrote ''Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/dominican-professor-examines-big-history.html |title=Dominican Professor Examines Big History |publisher=Dominican University of California |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Dominican University of California launched the world's first Big History program to be required of all first-year students, as part of the school's general education track. This program, directed by Mojgan Behmand, includes a one-semester survey of Big History, and an interdisciplinary second-semester course exploring the Big History metanarrative through the lens of a particular discipline or subject.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/academics/advising/firstyearprograms/general-education-ge.html |title=General Education (GE) Requirements |publisher=Dominican University of California |date=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A course description reads:

The Dominican faculty's approach is to synthesize the disparate threads of Big History thought, in order to teach the content, develop critical thinking and writing skills, and prepare students to wrestle with the philosophical implications of the Big History metanarrative. In 2015, [[University of California Press]] published ''Teaching Big History'', a comprehensive pedagogical guide for teaching Big History, edited by Richard B. Simon, Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke, and written by the Dominican faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Richard B., Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke.

By 2011, 50 professors around the world have offered courses. In 2012, one report suggested that Big History was being practiced as a "coherent form of research and teaching" by hundreds of academics from different disciplines.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

[[File:Bill gates portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Philanthropist [[Bill Gates]] is a major advocate of encouraging instruction in Big History.]]
There are efforts to bring Big History to younger students.&lt;ref name=tws2M12/&gt; In 2008, Christian and his colleagues began developing a course for secondary school students.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 2011, a pilot high school course was taught to 3,000 kids in 50 high schools worldwide.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; In 2012, there were 87 schools, with 50 in the United States, teaching Big History, with the pilot program set to double in 2013 for students in the ninth and tenth grades,&lt;ref name=tws2M31/&gt; and even in one middle school.&lt;ref name=tws2M34&gt;{{cite news

There are initiatives to make Big History a required standard course for university students throughout the world. An education project founded by [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Bill Gates]] from his personal funds was launched in Australia and the United States, to offer a free online version of the course to high school students.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt;

Currently, Big History is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new views and epistemological approaches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean, whose [[decolonial]] vision of history, economics and science has opened new questions. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. This transdisciplinary vision integrates and unifies diverse [[episteme]]s that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, it includes ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach. In approaching the Big History from the [[complexity]] sciences, the transdisciplinary methodology seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos,&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Bioethics as a Transdisciplinary Science of Complexity: A Co-evolutionary Introduction since the Big History |journal=Revista Colombiana de Bioética |volume=11 |issue=1 |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. The common denominator of all indigenous and aboriginal ancestral worldviews is the spiritual and ecological conception that structures their social organizations, which are in harmony and respect with the different forms of life that exist on our planet.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt; In the same way that [[Fritjof Capra]] carried out an analysis of the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, the teaching of the Big History in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] is nourished by the [[worldview]] of their [[ancestor]] to analyze the parallels between the scientific discoveries and the original knowledge of the native and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt;

Brown''' (1839–?) was an American educator and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights activist]] who was one of the first to legally challenge [[racial segregation in the United States]] when she filed a lawsuit against a streetcar company in [[San Francisco]] in the 1860s after she was forcibly removed from a segregated streetcar.

==Family and early life==

[[File:Pioneers of Negro Origin cropped Cover.jpg|thumb|220px|Cover of Pioneers of Negro Origin in California, by Sue Bailey Thurman]]

Brown was born in [[Maryland]] in 1839, the daughter of James E Brown, who was born [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved,]] and Charlotte Brown, a free seamstress. The elder Charlotte Brown purchased her husband's freedom and in 1850 they were living as [[Free people of color]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, with several children, including Charlotte.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Elinson, [http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/San-Francisco-s-own-Rosa-Parks-2554060.php San Francisco's own Rosa Parks, San Francisco Chronicle, January 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1850 Census, Baltimore, Maryland, Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; Some time between 1850 and 1860 they moved their family to San Francisco, which was booming as a result of the [[California Gold Rush]], and became a part of that city's burgeoning black middle class.&lt;ref&gt;1860 Census, San Francisco, California, Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurman, Sue Bailey.

==Streetcar incident==

[[File:Horse-drawn streetcar San Francisco 1860's.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Horse-drawn streetcar San Francisco 1860's]]

At 8PM on April 17, 1863, Charlotte Brown took a seat on a [[Horsecar|horse-drawn streetcar]] one block from her home on Filbert Street in San Francisco. She was on her way to see her doctor. The streetcar was owned by the Omnibus Railroad Company. When the streetcar conductor approached her and asked her to leave, Brown said she "had a right to ride" and had no intention of leaving the car.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In her courtroom testimony, she stated:

"The conductor went around and collected tickets and when he came to me I handed him my ticket and he refused to take it. It was one of the Omnibus railroad tickets, one that I had purchased of them previous to that time. He replied that colored persons were not allowed to ride. I told him I had been in the habit of riding ever since the cars had been running. I answered that I had a great ways to go and I was later than I ought to be."&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

The conductor, Thomas Dennison, asked her several times to leave, and each time she refused. Finally, when a white woman objected to her presence, he grabbed her by the arm and escorted her off the car.&lt;ref&gt;Quintard Taylor, Shirley Ann Wilson Moore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uwKuLlDDT-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=african+american+women+confront+the+west&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_-4XNgI3OAhVD8WMKHTfsCtkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=african%20american%20women%20confront%20the%20west&amp;f=false African American Women Confront the West, 1600-2000, University of Oklahoma Press, 2008], p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charlotte Brown vs. Omnibus Railroad==

[[File:Orville C. Pratt.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Judge Orville C. Pratt ruled in Brown's favor, calling streetcar segregation "a relic of barbarism"]]

Brown's civil case was tied up in [[appeal]]s for the next two years. In one appeals trial, the jury awarded Brown only five cents, the price of the streetcar ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Sacramento Daily Union, November 14, 1863&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, just three days after the first trial, Brown was ejected from yet another streetcar and brought a second suit against Omnibus, this time for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Quintard Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=W-iKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Quintard+Taylor+In+Search+of+the+Racial+Frontier+Charlotte+Brown&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp4t3xgo3OAhUD5GMKHVoWA5kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Quintard%20Taylor%20In%20Search%20of%20the%20Racial%20Frontier%20Charlotte%20Brown&amp;f=false In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West , W. W. Norton &amp; Company,  1999], p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in October, 1864, her case was tried in a higher court. In his judgment of October 5, 1864, Judge [[Orville C. Pratt]] of the 12th District Court upheld the earlier verdict in favor of Brown, ruling that excluding passengers from streetcars because of their race was illegal. He had no desire, he said in his ruling, to "perpetuate a relic of barbarism":

"It has been already quite too long tolerated by the dominant race to see with indifference the negro or mulatto treated as a brute, insulted, wronged, enslaved, made to wear a yoke, to tremble before white men, to serve him as a tool, to hold property and life at his will, to surrender to him his intellect and conscience, and to seal his lips and belie his thought through dread of the white man's power", Judge Pratt stated.&lt;ref&gt;lElaine Elinson and Stan Yogi, Wherever There’s a Fight: How Runaway Slaves, Suffragists, Immigrants, Strikers, and Poets Shaped Civil Liberties in California, Chapter Four, Heyday Press, 2010, Chapter Four&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 1865, a jury awarded Brown $500.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, In Search of the Racial Frontier, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The Omnibus Railroad Company appealed the verdict but was refused another trial.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction==

[[File:Charlotte Brown Editorial Cartoon.jpg|350px|thumb|Racist editorial cartoon published in 1864 after Charlotte Brown won a lawsuit against a segregated San Francisco streetcar company]]

After the first trial, [[African-American newspapers|the black-owned newspaper]] the ''Pacific Appeal'' noted that the verdict in her favor "establishes the right, by law, of colored persons to ride in such conveyances".

"While the law recognizes and gives us the right to ride in such conveyances," the editorial continued, "there are a certain number of the employees of this Company, who, if a colored person attempts to cross the street while their car is passing, are seized with a sudden fit of Negrophobia, which is generally manifested by pulling their alarm bell violently, as if some danger was imminent, so afraid are they that some other of our respectable females might attempt to exercise the right that Miss Brown has just won. So long as we have law, justice and right on our side, we want no pity."&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, Number 34, November 1863&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Pratt's 1864 ruling was derided in an editorial cartoon by a local white-owned newspaper that showed blacks and whites riding side by side. Using a racial epithet, it accused Pratt of being partial to African Americans, and questioned whether the light-skinned Brown was really black, or just filing suit for the monetary award.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Moore, African-American Women Confront the West, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; A white editor of ''The Sacramento Daily Union'', on the other hand, said of Pratt's decision, "his argument is lucid, and his decision, we believe, chimes in with the sentiment of the people".&lt;ref&gt;Sacramento Daily Union, Volume 28, Number 4225, 5 October 1864&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charlotte Brown case paved the way for other cases brought by San Francisco African Americans like William Bowen and [[Mary Ellen Pleasant]] that challenged the "whites-only" practices of the privately owned streetcars.&lt;ref&gt;Elinson, Elaine, "San Francisco's Own Rosa Parks" San Francisco Chronicle, January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Lynn Marie, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Making_of_Mammy_Pleasant.html?id=S2YvRVIou3cC The Making of "Mammy Pleasant": A Black Entrepreneur in Nineteenth-century, University of Illinois Press], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 streetcar segregation was officially outlawed on statewide streetcars by the California legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Degraaf and Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qa_tAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=Seeking+El+Dorado+Charlotte+Brown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sQzcLJNKQk&amp;sig=G1MO6ZXUF1tpFakp-Fk-M0XP6RI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi15-X7hY3OAhVK3WMKHcWMDjsQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Seeking%20El%20Dorado%20Charlotte%20Brown&amp;f=false Seeking El Dorado], African Americans in California, University of Washington Press, 2001, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

After Charlotte Brown won her case, Senator [[Charles Sumner]] invoked the case in [[United States Congress|Congress]] as setting an important precedent for racial equality when he argued in favor of integrating streetcars in [[Washington, D.C.|the nation's capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zTqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA544&amp;lpg=PA544&amp;dq=journal+of+the+civil+war+era+charlotte+brown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jidsmI_QG8&amp;sig=nKTqk0UPyjMCYqMMUpp02jaRmg8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9s8aDh43OAhUBTGMKHSh1BPEQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=journal%20of%20the%20civil%20war%20era%20charlotte%20brown&amp;f=false Journal of the Civil War Era: Winter 2011 Issue], p 544&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

[[File:Sepia Palace-Hotel-black-workers-1882-from-Bonanza-Inn.jpg|thumb|Brown's husband James Riker worked at San Francisco's Palace Hotel]]

In 1867, Charlotte Brown opened a school for young children at 10 Scotland Street in San Francisco, offering "all the branches of primary education" as well as music and embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, Elevator, Number 14, 5 July 1867&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, she married James Henry Riker,&lt;ref&gt;The Elevator,  January 27, 1874&lt;/ref&gt; another prominent African American activist of San Francisco, who had worked as a live-in personal servant to [[William Chapman Ralston]] and was employed as a steward at the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace Hotel]] during their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Herald, Vol 11, Number 128, 30 April 1879&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elevator, No. 15, 14 July 1865&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elevator, Number 52, 4 April 1874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1870 Census, San Francisco, Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Voter Registration Lists 1870 and 1880, Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Riker, along with Brown's father, was one of the organizers of the 1865 California State Convention of Colored Citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The Elevator, June 16, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; The society pages of the black newspaper ''The Elevator'' printed an announcement in 1877 of a surprise party for a fellow steward at the Palace Hotel that was given by Charlotte and James H Riker in their residence on 1018 Powell Street in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Elevator, Number 52, 31 March 1877&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Charlotte Brown Riker's life after that time.

==Historical context==

[[File:Rosa parks human rights museum memphis 2.jpg|thumb|left|Image of Rosa Parks from Memphis Civil Rights Museum]]

The Charlotte Brown lawsuit was one of the first of several actions that were brought by black activists in both [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Northern United States|Northern]] cities throughout the United States to protest exclusion and [[Segregation in the United States|segregation]] on public transportation in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Blair L. M. Kelley. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Right_to_Ride.html?id=Rt8jwoFxsxEC Right to Ride: Streetcar Boycotts and African American Citizenship in the Era of Plessy v. Ferguson]. John Hope Franklin Series in African American History and Culture. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, [[Elizabeth Jennings Graham|Elizabeth Jennings]] successfully filed suit against the Third Avenue Railway Company in [[New York City]] after she had been ejected from a streetcar there because of her skin color.&lt;ref&gt;Greider, Katharine, '[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/nyregion/thecity/the-schoolteacher-on-the-streetcar.html?_r=0 'The Schoolteacher and the Streetcar,'' The New York Times, Nov 13, 2005'']&lt;/ref&gt; In Philadelphia in 1865, a "Mrs. Derry" won a civil suit and $50 in damages after a streetcar conductor threw her off the bus and kicked her when she and a group of women were returning from tending to Civil War soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sojourner Truth]], [[Ida B. Wells]], and [[Frances Harper|Frances Watkins Parker]] also lobbied actively for streetcar integration after being refused ridership on streetcars in Washington, D.C., Memphis, and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saintssistersandsluts.com/10-women-who-refused-to-give-up-their-seats-before-rosa-parks/ Ten Women Who Refused to Give Up Their Seats Before Rosa Parks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though streetcars in the north were largely de-segregated by the end of the 19th century, segregation on public transportation [[Plessy v. Ferguson|became the official policy]] in many cities of the South.&lt;ref&gt;Blair L. M. Kelley. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Right_to_Ride.html?id=Rt8jwoFxsxEC Right to Ride: Streetcar Boycotts and African American Citizenship in the Era of Plessy v. Ferguson]. John Hope Franklin Series in African American History and Culture. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, women like [[Irene Morgan]] and [[Mary Louise Smith (civil rights activist)|Mary Louise Smith]] continued to battle segregation on public transportation. In 1954, [[Rosa Parks]] challenged the practice in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], launching a [[Montgomery bus boycott|citywide bus boycott]] and helping to start the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and '60s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/rosa-parks&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''African American Women Confront the West'', scholars Quintard Taylor and Shirley Ann Wilson Moore analyze the Charlotte Brown case and other 19th-century streetcar desegregation lawsuits brought by black women as they relate historically to both race and gender. They noted that it was frequently women who filed these lawsuits because of prevailing ideas of public vs. private space, and white views of black gender roles:

"Activist black men were keenly aware of the power of black women to go, where they, as men, could not," they write. "Relying on the wedge of gender, black women's lawsuits against streetcar companies ultimately assured the right to travel of blacks generally ... the declaration of law was a general one that applied not simply to Charlotte Brown or to Mary Pleasant, but to all blacks as well."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Moore, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5257">'''Conflict avoidance''' is a method of reacting to conflict, which attempts to avoid directly confronting the issue at hand. Methods of doing this can include changing the subject, putting off a discussion until later, or simply not bringing up the subject of contention. Conflict prevention  can be used as a temporary measure to buy time or as permanent means of disposing of a matter. The latter may be indistinguishable from simple acquiescence to the other party, to the extent that the person avoiding the conflict subordinates their own wishes to the party with whom they have the conflict. However, conflict prevention  can also take the form of withdrawing from the relationship. Thus, avoidance scenarios can be either win-lose, lose-lose or possibly even win-win, if terminating the relationship is the best method of solving the problem.

The term "conflict avoidance" is sometimes used to describe [[conflict prevention]]. Bacal criticizes this use of terms by asking, {{cquote|Is there a difference between preventing contracting AIDS by the use of appropriate precautions, and avoiding or not seeking treatment if one has contracted it? Of course there is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.work911.com/conflict/carticles/conav.htm Is Conflict Prevention The Same As Conflict Avoidance?], Bacal.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Turner and Weed classify concealment as one of the three main types of responses to conflict, describing concealers as those who take no risk and so say nothing, concealing their views and feelings. Concealers are further divided into three types; namely:&lt;ref&gt;Conflict in organizations: Practical solutions any manager can use; Turner, Stephen P. (University of South Florida); Weed, Frank; 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Feeling-swallowers who swallow their feelings. They smile even if the situation is causing them pain and distress. They behave thus because they consider the approval of other people important and feel that it would be dangerous to affront them by revealing their true feelings.
*Subject-changers who find the real issue too difficult to handle. They change the topic by finding something on which there can be some agreement with the conflicting party. According to Turner and Weed, this response style usually does not solve the problem; instead, it can create problems for the people who use this and for the organization in which such people are working.
*Avoiders who go out of their way to avoid conflicts.

==Controversy==
The [[Thomas–Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument|Thomas-Kilmann grid]] views avoidance as a lose-lose proposition since it does not address the issue at hand. But other sources view avoidance as a useful means of disposing of  very minor, non-recurring conflicts whose resolution would expend excessive amounts of time or resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comraded.org/timor/peacebuild/manconflict.html Timor-Australia Friendship Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317131906/http://www.comraded.org/timor/peacebuild/manconflict.html |date=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality psychology research==
Research in [[personality psychology]] has indicated that the personality trait of [[agreeableness]]--one of the [[Big Five personality traits|five identifiable dimensions of personality]]--correlates with proclivity toward conflict avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |author1=Jensen-Campbell L. A. |author2=Graziano W. G. | year    = 2001

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict avoidance in the workplace==
In the workplace, managers sometimes avoid directly dealing with [[Workplace conflict|conflict among co-workers]] by simply separating them. In workplaces and other situations where continued contact with a person cannot be severed, workers may eschew confrontation as being too risky or uncomfortable, opting instead to avoid directly dealing with the situation by venting to others or engaging in [[passive aggressive]] methods of attack such as [[gossip]]. Unresolved conflict in the workplace has been linked to miscommunication resulting from confusion or refusal to cooperate, increased stress, reduced creative collaboration and team problem solving, and distrust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/337162_workcoach29.html Workplace Coach: Companies pay the price when managers avoid dealing with conflict], Maureen, Moriarty, [[Seattlepi]], Oct. 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an East Bay Business Times article, some possible results of conflict-averse senior executives may include {{cquote|poor-performing executives can survive because the president doesn't investigate or act on employee complaints; conflict can become malignant between departments, because there is no tie breaker to force resolution; and ineffective managers are passed from one department to the next, because the senior executive would rather play 'pass the turkey' than cook the goose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastbay.bizjournals.com/extraedge/consultants/at_work/2003/06/16/column67.html?market=eastbay Confronting a leader's conflict avoidance], Joan Lloyd.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

}}
'''Darwin's World''', created by [[Dominic Covey]], is a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[role-playing game]] first published under the [[d20 System|d20]] [[Open Game License]] in 2001.  Originally designed as a quick adaptation of the 3rd Edition [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] rules, the game has since been greatly expanded and revised and now utilizes the [[d20 Modern]] rules.  Several ''Darwin's World'' books and supplements have seen print, though most support for the game is still only available in [[PDF]] format. In 2010, RPGObjects began producing game books using [[Pinnacle Entertainment Group|Pinnacle]]'s [[Savage Worlds]] system.

''Darwin's World'' was nominated for an [http://www.ennieawards.com/2002.html Ennie award] (Best d20 Game) in 2002.

The online [[online magazine|e-zine]], '''''Post Apocalyptic Dispatch''''', continues to provide short articles that support game play for both gamemasters and players alike. The game is still heavily supported with new material coming out on a regular basis.

==Mature Themes==
Unlike many existing post-apocalyptic role-playing games, ''Darwin's World'' is often described as a darker and more "realistic" game system.  In specific, its use of real-life deformities and genetic diseases to portray character defects, as well as issues like [[slavery]], racism, and drug use give it a grittier quality than most post-apocalyptic [[RPGs]], which often have a fantastic or "comic book" feel that requires a broader willingness to suspend disbelief.

==Versions 2.0 and 2.5==
While the original ''Darwin's World'' books clearly put forth a timeline and history, the second edition (and most recent edition, v2.5) has a broader focus intending to provide rules, suggestions, and guidelines for any kind of post-apocalyptic [[campaign setting]]. The default setting remains a wasteland created by global [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]/[[Biological warfare|biological]]/[[chemical warfare]], however (See [[Weapon of mass destruction]]). There is a strong focus on regions that once constituted the [[Midwest]] and [[Western United States]]; numerous [[Adventure (role-playing games)|modules]] published for the game are nominally set in "desert" or "wasteland" areas. More specific locations include the desert trade town of [[Tucumcari, New Mexico|Tucumcari]], the sunken city of [[Bakersfield]] and its strange subterranean monsters, the overgrown [[ruins]] of [[Los Angeles]], a [[San Francisco]] overrun by anti-technology zealots, and a decadent society thriving in the futuristic [[domed cities]] of the Midwest.  One supplement went into great detail exploring the fate of the [[Pacific Northwest]].

==Game Supplements==
A wide range of supplements, [[sourcebook]]s, and modules are available for ''Darwin's World''.

* ''Darwin's World 2: Survivor's Handbook''.  The current edition of the basic rules.
* ''Cave of Life''.  A low-level adventure detailing an abandoned missile silo.
* ''The Lost City/Return To The Lost City''.  A journey to a monster-infested city sunken beneath the earth.
* ''Death By Corium Light''.  High-level adventure detailing the ''corium'' mines of Little Vegas.
* ''The Foundationists''.  A sourcebook detailing the setting's premier technology-crazed faction.
* ''Metal Gods''.  Rules for [[robot]]s and making [[Android (robot)|android]]s and [[cyborg]]s as [[player character|characters]].
* ''The Lost Paradise''.  A regional sourcebook detailing the Pacific Northwest.
* ''Terrors of The Lost Paradise''.  A sourcebook presenting new monsters.
* ''Against The Wastelords''.  A low-level adventure involving a desperate race to find a [[nuclear missile]].
* ''New World Order''.  A mid-level adventure that involves the characters in a war against a strange new enemy.
* ''The Last God''.  A high-level adventure pitting the characters against an animate and intelligent bioweapon that pre-dates the Fall.
* ''High Road To Hell''. [[Gen Con]] 2004 adventure.  A mid-level adventure utilizing a time limit mechanic.
* ''One Man's Garbage/Another Man's Treasure''. [[Gen Con]] 2005 adventure.  A mid-level adventure in which characters struggle to find the legendary "Mount of Thorns".
* ''Humanity In A Bottle''.  Boxed set sourcebook/module describing in detail a [[dystopian]] society long forgotten by the inhabitants of the world.
* ''The Broken and The Lost''.  A sourcebook presenting new rules for [[Primitive culture|savage]] characters, tribes, and societies.
* ''The Ruin at The End of The World''.  A sourcebook/module detailing the ruins of Los Angeles; also the first ''Darwin's World'' supplement to make use of [[supernatural]] story elements.
* ''Bad News In Bugtown''. [[Gen Con]] 2007 adventure.  A low-level adventure set in the ruins of [[Amarillo]].
* ''Halidom''.  Boxed set module detailing an epic [[Campaign (Role-playing games)|campaign]] against a notorious raider army, the "Doomriders".
* ''Secrets of The Mind Masters''.  A high-level adventure pitting the player characters against the super-psychics known as the "Savants".

==Real-Life Inspiration==
Numerous adventures written for ''Darwin's World'' either briefly feature, reference, or center around real-life places and events.  These include:

* The adventure, ''Cave of Life'', describes an old and abandoned Titan missile silo, accurately detailed.
* In ''The Last God'', the real-life town of Center, Colorado, is re-imagined as a covert biological weapons plant disguised as a small backwater town. The map used in the adventure is precisely modeled on the actual town.
* The "Mount of Thorns" that is the object of the player character's quest in ''Another Man's Garbage'' is the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]].
* ''The Ruin at The End of The World'' features numerous Los Angeles landmarks. The [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] Arboretum is filled with giant mutant plants, the L.A. city library is inhabited by a mysterious [[vampire]], City Hall is a haunt for a gang of thugs, and the ruins of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] are now home to a fledgling empire of half-man, half-beast creatures.
* The monument at [[Mount Rushmore]] plays a major role in the campaign adventure, "Halidom".
* Certain details of the [[Philadelphia Experiment]] are mentioned (and play an important role) in ''Secrets of The Mind Masters''.

==Related Works==
* ''Darwin's World'' was originally based on a [[play-by-email]] ("PBEM") game titled ''Necropolis'' (on which much of the material in ''Ruin at The End of The World'' is based).  A second ''pbem'' game (''Shadow of The Savants'') further fleshed out some of the background material for the game's ''Twisted Earth'' setting.
* ''Burning Lands'' is a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[science-fiction]] novel set some three centuries after [[World War III]], making use of the "Twisted Earth" setting.

'''Difficulty of engagement''' is a notion in the ''Campbell Paradigm'', a model of behavior change with person-independent difficulty.

== Motivation ==

Difficulty is considered a key predictor of behavior in [[psychology]] and is included in most recognized models of behavior change, such as the [[theory of planned behavior]]. Most of these models rely on people's perceptions and estimates of behavioral difficulty. That is, difficulty is considered to be subjective and person-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrka|first=Katarzyna|date=2009|title=Attitude-behavior consistency: Campbell's paradigm in environmental and health domains|url=http://repository.tue.nl/642840|journal=Ph.D. Thesis, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven|volume=|issue=|doi=10.6100/ir642840|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, perceived difficulty varies by individual. 

A more objective measure of difficulty is desirable, e.g., for [[environmental policy|environmental]] or [[energy policy]], because people may misperceive the difficulty of behaviors, possibly because affected by mood or current circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lerner|first=Jennifer S.|last2=Keltner|first2=Dacher|date=2001|title=Fear, anger, and risk|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.146|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=81|issue=1|pages=146–159|doi=10.1037//0022-3514.81.1.146|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Campbell Paradigm ==

The ''Campbell Paradigm'' was proposed by Kaiser et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Florian G.|last2=Byrka|first2=Katarzyna|last3=Hartig|first3=Terry|date=2010|title=Reviving Campbell’s Paradigm for Attitude Research|url=http://psr.sagepub.com/content/14/4/351|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=351–367|doi=10.1177/1088868310366452|issn=1088-8683|pmid=20435803|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a model of behavior change with person-independent difficulty. The model treats the likelihood of individual behavior as a function of attitude and of the difficulty of engaging in this behavior. The more demanding these barriers{{clarify|date=November 2016|What barriers?}} are, the more favorable attitude towards a general goal, such as environment protection. The relation between difficulty of behaviors, attitudes and behaviors can be computed using a one-parameter logistic [[Rasch model]] and yield the proportion of persons that engage in a given behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrka|first=Katarzyna|last2=Jȩdrzejewski|first2=Arkadiusz|last3=Sznajd-Weron|first3=Katarzyna|last4=Weron|first4=Rafał|date=2016|title=Difficulty is critical: The importance of social factors in modeling diffusion of green products and practices|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211630096X|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=62|issue=|pages=723–735|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.063|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1704">A '''digital print matrix''' is the digital state from which a print art object can be instanced with original intent.

The traditional term  ''[[print matrix]]'' is the physical surface from which an image is printed, [[Woodcut|woodblock]], plate, [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[Screen-printing|screen]].&lt;ref name="Wye_2004"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Wye |author-first1=Deborah |author-last2=Figura |author-first2=Starr |author-last3=Hecker |author-first3=Judith |date=2004-04-02 |title=Artists &amp; prints: Masterworks from the Museum of Modern Art, New York |publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]], New York; [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], London |isbn=978-0-87070125-2 |id={{ISBN|0-87070125-8}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these may in themselves be produced digitally they comprise a traditional (physical) matrix. A digital matrix however is a repository of material which, stored digitally, is combined by the artist’s hand and instanced with original intent; Philip George’s “fluid diary” providing an early example.&lt;ref name="George_2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=George |author-first=Philip |date=April 2002 |title=Mnemonic Notations: A Decade of Art Practice within a Digital Environment. |publisher=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |volume=35 |number=2 |pages=121–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically the digital matrix comprises stable [[digital storage]] mechanisms (which retain the data when switched off) rather than volatile [[random access memory]]. Conceptually as there is no need for this storage to be in the physical presence of the artist then [[online]] and remote storage (including the [[Internet]]) may form as a whole or in part the digital matrix.

'''Donkey punch''' is a [[slang]] term for the [[Human sexual activity|sexual practice]] of inflicting [[blunt trauma|blunt force trauma]] to the back of the head or lower back of the receiving partner during [[anal sex|anal]] or vaginal sex as an attempt by the penetrating partner to induce involuntary tightening of [[internal anal sphincter|internal]] or [[external anal sphincter]] muscles or vaginal passage of the receiving partner.&lt;ref name="AETC"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tate2007"/&gt; According to Dr. Jeffrey Bahr of [[Medical College of Wisconsin]], there is no reflex in humans that would cause such tensing in response to a blow on the head, although striking a partner on the back of the neck or head could cause severe, even lethal injury.&lt;ref name=savage&gt;{{cite news |title=Donkey See, Donkey Doo |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=93682 |newspaper=The Stranger |date=October 26, 2006 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urban legend ==
Sex columnist [[Dan Savage]] has discussed the alleged practice on several occasions. In 2004, Savage referred to the donkey punch as "a sex act that exists only in the imaginations of adolescent boys,"&lt;ref name="savage2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=No Shit? |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20179&amp;mode=print |newspaper=The Stranger |date=December 23–29, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding "no one has ever attempted "[[Pirate (sexual slang)|the Pirate]]," just as no one has ever performed a [[Hot Karl (slang)|Hot Karl]], delivered a Donkey Punch, or inserted an Icy Mike. They’re all fictions."&lt;ref name="savage2004"/&gt; Responding to an enquiry from Wikipedia editors, he again discussed the donkey punch urban legend in his "[[Savage Love]]" column in 2006. He wrote, "attempting a Donkey Punch can lead to ... unpleasant outcomes," including "injury, death or incarceration"; he also pointed out that it "doesn't even work." He quoted Jeffrey Bahr, a faculty member at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]],&lt;ref name=savage/&gt;
{{quote|To the best of my knowledge, there is no definitive reflex in the human neurophysiology that induces involuntary tightening of the anal sphincter after receiving blunt force trauma to the occiput, or back of the head. ... Trauma to any part of the head can have serious ramifications. Pain, intracranial hemorrhage, memory loss, neck injury, and possibly some related sensory deficits in the arms and legs. A strong enough blow to the back of an unsuspecting person's head could result in a vertebral fracture which, I hope most people know, could cause paralysis or even death.}}
Jordan Tate, commenting in ''The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms'' (2007) on the "almost purely theoretical nature" of the term, claimed,&lt;ref name="Tate2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan Tate|title=The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aclMh6SB1ngC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=15 February 2012|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-36298-0|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The donkey punch originated in the late twentieth century sometime after the sexual revolution, when the empowerment of women was threatening the place of men in contemporary society. This shift in gender paradigms left men feeling threatened, and to reassert their authority, they created and popularized these theoretical and violent euphemisms. ... The secondary reward of the donkey punch is the creation, or reinforcement, of the ideal power structure, or solidifying existing gender roles.}}

== Gay sex ==
''The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English'' (2007) defines the term as follows:&lt;ref name="PartridgeDalzell2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Partridge|author2=Tom Dalzell|author3=Terry Victor|title=The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCVnlIUTpg4C&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=10 February 2012|date=1 November 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-21259-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|... during homosexual anal intercourse, a sharp blow given by the active partner to the passive partner's kidneys. The sudden pain from the blow causes a clenching of the buttocks and tightening of the rectal passage, thereby enhancing the pleasure of the penetrating participant. &lt;small&gt;''UK 2005''&lt;/small&gt;}}

== Pornography ==
[[File:Gia Paloma, September 2006.JPG|thumb|Gia Paloma is credited as the first recipient of a donkey punch in a pornographic film]]
The adult film star credited as the first known recipient of a donkey punch is Gia Paloma, who had the act performed on her by [[Alex Sanders (pornographic actor)|Alex Sanders]] in the 2004 film ''Gutter Mouths 30''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avn.com/porn-stars/Gia-Paloma-263487.html|title = Gia Paloma|publisher = Adult Video News|website = avn.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Donkey Punch (pornographic film)|Donkey Punch]]'', a pornographic film premised around the act, was released by [[JM Productions]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{iafd title|Donkey+Punch|2005|Donkey Punch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film consists of four scenes in which the male actors engage in [[rough sex]] with their female co-stars, punching them repeatedly in the head and body throughout. In response to her experience on the set, performer Alex Divine allegedly stated "''Donkey Punch'' was the most brutal, depressing, scary scene that I have ever done,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.xbiz.com/articles/15635|title = Hardcore Content: 1|last = Cachapero|first = Joanne|publisher = [[XBIZ]]|date = 22 June 2006|website = xbiz.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented that "I actually stopped the scene while it was being filmed because I was in too much pain."

The viciousness of the film prompted Peter van Aarle of Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews to forego covering any further releases from JM, while Zack Parsons of [[Something Awful]] (which awarded ''Donkey Punch'' a score of -49, where -50 is the worst score possible) wrote that the film was "one of the most morally repugnant pornographic movies I have seen" and "is the sort of movie that the government would cite when trying to arrest pornographers and outlaw pornography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cavr.com/xxx17944.htm|title = ''Donkey Punch''|publisher = Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews|date = 12 September 2005|website = cavr.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.somethingawful.com/horrors-of-porn/donkey-punch/|title = ''Donkey Punch''|last = Parsons|first = Zach|publisher = [[Something Awful]]|date = 22 June 2006|website = somethingawful.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enron scandal ==
"Donkey punch" was one of several slang terms used by [[Enron]] traders to refer to their [[price gouging]] methods.&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;{{cite news |title=When Enron pushed, utility pushed back |author=Carolyn Said |url=http://www.chron.com/business/enron/article/When-Enron-pushed-utility-pushed-back-1676193.php |newspaper=[[The Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 27, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During investigations into the 2004 [[Enron scandal]] over manipulation of the electricity market in [[California]], recordings of Enron traders were uncovered dating from 2000 and 2001.

The term received extensive coverage online after it was mistakenly given as an answer on the January 16, 2012 broadcast of the American game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. The prompt was "A blow to the back of the neck is the punch named for this animal"; the correct answer was [[rabbit punch]], a dangerous boxing move.

{{Merge from |The Estates|date=September 2017}}

[[Image:Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg|thumb|250px|A 13th century French representation of the tripartite social order of the [[middle ages]] – Oratores: "those who pray", Bellatores: "those who fight", and Laboratores: "those who work".]]
The '''estates of the realm''', or '''three estates''', were the broad orders of social hierarchy used in [[Christendom]] (Christian Europe) from the [[medieval period]] to [[early modern Europe]]. Different systems for dividing society members into estates developed and evolved over time.

The best known system is the French ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' (Old Regime), a three-estate system used until the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799). Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of [[clergy]] (the First Estate), [[nobles]] (the Second Estate), and [[peasant]]s and [[bourgeoisie]] (the Third Estate). In some [[region]]s, notably [[Scandinavia]] and Russia, [[Grand Burgher|burgher]]s (the urban merchant class) and rural commoners were split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights. In England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and clergy into one lordly estate with "commons" as the second estate. This system produced the two [[houses of parliament]], the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility (princes and high clergy), ''[[ritter]]s'' (knights), and burghers was used.

Today the terms ''three estates'' and ''estates of the realm'' may sometimes be re-interpreted to refer to the modern [[separation of powers]] in government into the legislature, administration, and the judiciary. Additionally the term ''[[fourth estate]]'' usually refers to forces outside the established power structure (evoking medieval three-estate systems), most commonly in reference to the independent press or media. Historically, in Northern and Eastern Europe, the Fourth Estate meant rural commoners.

==Social Mobility==
During the [[Middle Ages]], advancing to different social classes was uncommon and very difficult.

The medieval Church was an institution where social mobility was most likely up to a certain level (generally to that of [[vicar general]] or [[abbot]]/[[abbess]] for commoners). Typically, only nobility were appointed to the highest church positions (bishops, archbishops, heads of religious orders, etc.), although low nobility could aspire to the highest church positions. Since clergy could not marry, such mobility was theoretically limited to one generation. [[Nepotism]] was common in this period.

Another possible way to rise in social position was due to exceptional military or commercial success. Such families were rare and their rise to nobility required royal patronage at some point. However, because noble lines went extinct naturally, some ennoblements were necessary.

==Dynamics==

"Medieval political speculation is imbued to the marrow with the idea of a structure of society based upon distinct orders," [[Johan Huizinga]] observes.&lt;ref name=huiz&gt;Huizinga ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919, 1924:47).&lt;/ref&gt; The virtually synonymous terms ''estate'' and ''order'' designated a great variety of social realities, not at all limited to a class, Huizinga concluded applying to every social function, every trade, every recognisable grouping.

{{quote|There are, first of all, the estates of the realm, but there are also the trades, the state of matrimony and that of virginity, the state of sin. At court there are the 'four estates of the body and mouth': bread-masters, cup-bearers, carvers, and cooks. In the Church there are sacerdotal orders and monastic orders. Finally there are the different orders of chivalry.&lt;ref name=huiz/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

This static view of society was predicated on inherited positions.&lt;!--where? While several of the various realms inverted the relative prominence of the first two orders--&gt; Commoners were universally considered the lowest order. The higher estates' necessary dependency on the commoners' production, however, often further divided the otherwise equal common people into [[bourgeoisie|burghers]] (also known as [[bourgeoisie]]) of the realm's cities and towns, and the [[peasant]]s and [[serfdom|serf]]s of the realm's surrounding lands and villages. A person's estate and position within it were usually inherited from the father and his occupation, similar to a [[caste]] within [[Caste system|that system]]. In many regions and realms there also existed population groups born outside these specifically defined resident estates.

[[Legislature|Legislative]] bodies or advisory bodies to a [[monarchy|monarch]] were traditionally grouped along lines of these estates, with the monarch above all three estates. Meetings of the estates of the realm became early legislative and judicial [[parliament]]s. Monarchs often sought to legitimize their power by requiring oaths of fealty from the estates. Today, in most countries, the estates have lost all their legal privileges, and are mainly of historical interest. The nobility may be an exception, for instance due to legislation against [[false titles of nobility]]; similarly British government well maintains the distinction- witness its House of Lords, and the House of Commons.

One of the earliest political pamphlets to address these ideas was called "[[What Is the Third Estate?]]" (French: Qu'est-ce que le tiers-état?) It was written by [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]] in January 1789, shortly before the start of the French Revolution.

==Background==
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], numerous geographic and ethnic kingdoms developed among the endemic peoples of Europe, affecting their day-to-day secular lives; along with those, the growing influence of the [[Catholic Church]] and its [[Papacy]] affected the ethical, moral and religious lives and decisions of all. This led to mutual dependency between the secular and religious powers for guidance and protection, but over time and with the growing power of the kingdoms, competing secular realities increasingly diverged from religious idealism and Church decisions.

The new lords of the land identified themselves primarily as warriors, but because new technologies of warfare were expensive, and the fighting men required substantial material resources and considerable leisure to train, these needs had to be filled. The economic and political transformation of the countryside in the period were filled by a large growth in population, agricultural production, technological innovations and urban centers; movements of reform and renewal attempted to sharpen the distinction between clerical and lay status, and power, recognized by the Church also had their effect.

In his book ''The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined'', the French [[medievalism|medievalist]] [[Georges Duby]] has shown that in the period 1023-1025 the first theorist who justified the division of European society into the three estates of the realm was [[Gerard of Florennes]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|bishop of Cambrai]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Duby]], ''The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined'', Part 1&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Investiture Controversy]] of the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the powerful office of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] lost much of its religious character and retained a more nominal universal preeminence over other rulers, though it varied. The struggle over investiture and the reform movement also legitimized all secular authorities, partly on the grounds of their obligation to enforce discipline.&lt;ref name="EB tp2tm"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe "History of Europe – Middle Ages – From territorial principalities to territorial monarchies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th and 12th centuries thinkers argued that human society consisted of three orders: those who pray, those who fight, and those who labour. The structure of the first order, the clergy, was in place by 1200 and remained singly intact until the [[Reformation|religious reformations]] of the 16th century. The very general category of those who labour (specifically, those who were not knightly warriors or nobles) diversified rapidly after the 11th century into the lively and energetic worlds of peasants, skilled artisans, merchants, financiers, lay professionals, and entrepreneurs, which together drove the European economy to its greatest achievements. The second order, those who fight, was the rank of the politically powerful, ambitious, and dangerous. Kings took pains to ensure that it did not resist their authority.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe "History of Europe – Middle Ages – From territorial principalities to territorial monarchies – The three orders"]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century, most European political thinkers agreed that monarchy was the ideal form of governance. This was because it imitated on earth the model set by God for the universe; it was the form of government of the [[Judaism|ancient Hebrews]] and the Christian Biblical basis, the later Roman Empire, and also the peoples who succeeded Rome after the 4th century.&lt;ref name="EB tp2tm"/&gt;

==Kingdom of France==
{{Main|Ancien Régime}}
France under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' (before the [[French Revolution]]) divided society into three estates: the '''First Estate''' ([[clergy]]); the '''Second Estate''' ([[French nobility|nobility]]); and the '''Third Estate''' ([[commoner]]s). The king was considered part of no estate.

[[File:Ständeordnung.jpg|250px|thumb|The First Estate (Fr. ''premier état'') was the [[clergy]].]]

===First Estate===
The First Estate comprised the entire clergy, traditionally divided into "higher" and "lower" clergy. Although there was no formal demarcation between the two categories, the upper clergy were, effectively, clerical nobility, from the families of the Second Estate. In the time of Louis XVI, every bishop in France was a nobleman, a situation that had not existed before the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 1961, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other extreme, the "lower clergy" (about equally divided between parish priests, monks, and nuns) constituted about 90 percent of the First Estate, which in 1789 numbered around 130,000 (about 0.5% of the population). {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Second Estate===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ancien Régime]] --&gt;
The Second Estate (Fr. ''deuxieme état'') was the [[French nobility]] and (technically, though not in common use) [[Royal family|royalty]], other than the [[monarch]] himself, who stood outside of the system of estates.

The Second Estate is traditionally divided into ''[[noblesse d'épée]]'' ("nobility of the sword"), and ''[[noblesse de robe]]'' ("nobility of the robe"), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government.

The Second Estate constituted approximately 1.5% of France's population.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Under the ''ancien régime'' ("old rule/old government"), the Second Estate were exempt from the ''[[corvée]] royale'' (forced labour on the roads) and from most other forms of taxation such as the ''[[gabelle]]'' (salt tax) and most important, the ''[[taille]]'' (the oldest form of direct taxation). This exemption from paying taxes led to their reluctance to reform.

===Third Estate===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ancien Régime]] --&gt;
{{Ancien Régime}}

The Third Estate comprised all of those who were not members of the above and can be divided into two groups, urban and rural, together making up 98% of France's population.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The urban included wage-labourers. The rural included free peasants (who owned their own land) who could be prosperous and [[Villein (feudal)|villeins]] (serfs, or peasants working on a noble's land). The free peasants paid disproportionately high taxes compared to the other Estates and were unhappy because they wanted more rights. In addition, the First and Second Estates relied on the labour of the Third, which made the latter's unequal status all the more glaring.

There were an estimated 27 million people in the Third Estate when the French Revolution started.

They had the hard life of physical labour and food shortages.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Most were born within this group and died as a part of it, too. It was extremely rare for people of this [[ascribed status]] to make it out into another estate. Those who did so managed as a result of either being recognized for their extraordinary bravery in a battle or entering religious life.&lt;ref name=estatehem/&gt; A few commoners were able to marry into the second estate, but this was a rare occurrence.&lt;ref name=estatehem&gt;{{cite book|last=Henslin|first=James M.|title=Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach|year=2004|publisher=[[Allyn &amp; Bacon]]|isbn=0205407358|page=225|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estates General===
{{main|French Estates General|Estates General of 1789}}
The first Estates General (not to be confused with a "class of citizen") was actually a general citizen assembly that was called by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] in 1302.

In the period leading up to the [[Estates General of 1789]], France was in the grip of an unmanageable public debt (nearly 3.56 million livres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/frenchrev/section1.html|title=France's Financial Crisis: 1783–1788|accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1776, finance minister [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] was dismissed, after failing to enact reforms. The next year, [[Jacques Necker]], a foreigner, was appointed [[Comptroller]]-General of Finance. He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant.&lt;ref name="Hib35"&gt;Hibbert, pp. 35, 36&lt;/ref&gt;), terrible inflation and widespread food scarcity (a huge famine in the winter of 1788-89). This led to widespread popular discontent and produced a group of Third Estate representatives (612 exactly) pressing a comparatively radical set of reforms, much of it in alignment with the goals of Finance Minister [[Jacques Necker]], but very much against the wishes of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s court and many of the hereditary nobles forming his Second Estate allies (at least allies against taking more taxes upon themselves and keeping the unequal taxation on the commoners).

When he could not persuade them to rubber-stamp his 'ideal program', Louis XVI sought to dissolve the Estates-General, but the Third Estate held out for their right to representation. The lower clergy (and some nobles and upper clergy) eventually sided with the Third Estate, and the King was forced to yield. Thus, the Estate-General meeting was an invitation to revolution.

By June, when continued impasses led to further deterioration in relations, the Estates-General was reconstituted first as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] (June 17, 1789) seeking a solution for the realm independent of the King's management of the meetings of the Estates General which occasionally continued to meet. These self-organized meetings are today defined as the [[epoch event]] beginning the historical epoch (era) of the [[French Revolution]], during which – after several more weeks of civil unrest – the body assumed a new status as a revolutionary legislature, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] (July 9, 1789).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Terror, Reign of"; ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;

This unitary body composed of the former representatives of the three estates stepping up to govern along with an emergency committee in the power vacuum existing after the [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon monarchy]] fled Paris. Among the Assembly was [[Maximilien de Robespierre]], an influential member of the [[Jacobin]]s who would years later become instrumental in the turbulent period of violence and political upheaval in France known as the [[Reign of Terror]] (5 September 1793 – 28 July 1794).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{details|Parliament of the United Kingdom}}
Whilst the estates were never formulated in a way that prevented social mobility, the English (subsequently the British) parliament was long based along the classic estate lines being composed on the "Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons". The tradition where the Lords Spiritual and Temporal sat separately from the Commons began during the reign of [[Edward III]] in the 14th century.

Notwithstanding the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], the British Parliament still recognises the existence of the three estates: the Commons in the House of Commons, the nobility (Lords Temporal) in the House of Lords, and the clergy in the form of the Church of England bishops also entitled to sit in the upper House as the [[Lords Spiritual]].

===Scotland===
{{Main|Parliament of Scotland}}
The members of the Parliament of [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as the '''Three Estates''' ([[Older Scots]]: Thre Estaitis), also known as the community of the realm, and until 1690 composed of:
*the '''first estate''' of [[prelate]]s ([[bishop]]s and [[abbot]]s)
*the '''second estate''' of [[laird]]s ([[duke]]s, [[earl]]s, [[parliamentary peers]] (after 1437) and [[Laity|lay]] [[tenants-in-chief]])
*the '''third estate''' of [[burgh commissioners]] (representatives chosen by the [[royal burghs]])

The First Estate was overthrown during the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the accession of [[William III of England|William III]].&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, Colin ''Subverting Scotland's Past: Scottish Whig Historians and the Creation of an Anglo-British Identity 1689–1830'' Cambridge University Press (2003) pp133&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Estate was then split into two to retain the division into three.

A ''[[Shire Commissioner]]'' was the closest equivalent of the [[England|English]] office of ''[[Member of Parliament]]'', namely a [[commoner]] or member of the lower nobility. Because the Parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same [[Chambers of parliament|chamber]], as opposed to the separate English [[House of Lords]] and [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

The Parliament also had [[University constituency|University constituencies]] (see [[Ancient universities of Scotland]]). The system was also adopted by the [[Parliament of England]] when [[James I of England|James VI]] ascended to the [[English throne]]. It was believed that the universities were affected by the decisions of Parliament and ought therefore to have representation in it. This continued in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] after [[Acts of Union 1707|1707]] and the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Alastair, "A Brief History of an Ancient Institution: The Scottish Parliament", ''Scottish Parliamentary Review'', Vol. I, No. 1 (June, 2013) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden and Finland==
The Estates in [[Sweden]] (including [[Finland]]) and later also Russia's [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] were the two higher estates, [[nobility]] and [[clergy]], and the two lower estates, [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] and land-owning [[peasants]]. Each were free men, and had specific rights and responsibilities, and the right to send representatives to the [[Riksdag of the Estates]]. The Riksdag, and later the [[Diet of Finland]] was [[Tetracameralism|tetracameral]]: at the Riksdag, each Estate voted as a single body. Since early 18th century, a bill needed the approval of at least three Estates to pass, and constitutional amendments required the approval of all Estates. Prior to the 18th century, the King had the right to cast a deciding vote if the Estates were split evenly.

After Russia's conquest of Finland in 1809, the estates in Finland swore an oath to the Emperor in the [[Diet of Porvoo]]. A [[Finnish House of Nobility]] was codified in 1818 in accordance with the old Swedish law of 1723. However, after the Diet of Porvoo, the [[Diet of Finland]] was reconvened only in 1863. In the meantime, for a period of 54 years, the country was governed only administratively.

There was also a population outside the estates. Unlike in other areas, people had no "default" estate, and were not peasants unless they came from a land-owner's family. A summary of this division is:
*Nobility (see [[Finnish nobility]] and [[Swedish nobility]]) was exempt from tax, had an inherited [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|rank]] and the right to keep a [[fief]], and had a tradition of military service and government. Nobility was codified in 1280 with the Swedish king granting exemption from taxation (''frälse'') to land-owners that could equip a cavalryman (or be one themselves) for the king's army. Around 1400, [[letters patent]] were introduced, in 1561 the ranks of [[Count]] and [[Friherre|Baron]] were added, and in 1625 the House of Nobility was codified as the First Estate of the land. Following [[Axel Oxenstierna]]'s reform, higher government offices were open only to nobles. However, the nobility still owned only their own property, not the peasants or their land [[serfdom|as in much of Europe]]. Heads of the noble houses were hereditary members of the assembly of nobles. The Nobility is divided into [[titled nobility]] ([[count]]s and [[baron]]s) and lower nobility. Until the 18th century the lower nobility was in turn was divided into [[Knight]]s and [[Esquire]]s such that each of the three classes would first vote internally, giving one vote per class in the assembly. This resulted in great political influence for the higher nobility.
*Clergy, or priests, were exempt from tax, and collected [[tithe]]s for the church. After the [[Swedish Reformation]], the church became [[Lutheran]]. In later centuries, the estate included teachers of universities and certain state schools. The estate was governed by the [[state church]] which consecrated its ministers and appointed them to positions with a vote in choosing diet representatives.
*Burghers were city-dwellers, tradesmen and craftsmen. Trade was allowed only in the cities when the [[mercantilism|mercantilistic]] ideology had got the upper hand, and the burghers had the exclusive right to conduct commerce within the framework of [[guild]]s. Entry to this Estate was controlled by the autonomy of the towns themselves. Peasants were allowed to sell their produce within the city limits, but any further trade, particularly foreign trade, was allowed only for burghers. In order for a settlement to become a city, a royal charter granting [[market right]] was required, and foreign trade required royally chartered [[staple port]] rights. After the annexation of Finland into Imperial Russia in 1809, mill-owners and other proto-industrialists would gradually be included in this estate.
*Peasants were land-owners of land-taxed farms and their families, which represented the majority in medieval times. Since most of the population were independent farmer families until the 19th century, not serfs nor villeins, there is a remarkable difference in tradition compared to other European countries. Entry was controlled by ownership of farmland, which was not generally for sale but a hereditary property. After 1809, Swedish tenants renting a large enough farm (ten times larger than what was required of peasants owning their own farm) were included as well as non-nobility owning tax-exempt land. Their representatives to the Diet were elected indirectly: each municipality sent electors to elect the representative of an electoral district.
*To no estate belonged propertyless [[Serfdom|cottagers]], [[villein]]s, [[Tenant farmer|tenants]] of farms owned by others, farmhands, servants, some lower administrative workers, rural craftsmen, travelling salesmen, vagrants, and propertyless and unemployed people (who sometimes lived in strangers' houses). To reflect how the people belonging to the estates saw them, the Finnish word for "obscene", ''säädytön'', has the literal meaning "estateless". They had no political rights and could not vote. Their mobility was severely limited by the policy of "legal protection" (Finnish: ''laillinen suojelu''): every estateless person had to be employed by a taxed citizen from the estates, or they could be charged with [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and sentenced to forced labor. In Finland, this policy lasted until 1883.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.narc.fi/portti/index.php/Teema:_Irtolaisuus&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, the Riksdag of the Estates existed until it was replaced with a bicameral Riksdag in 1866, which gave political rights to anyone with a certain income or property. Nevertheless, many of the leading politicians of the 19th century continued to be drawn from the old estates, in that they were either noblemen themselves, or represented agricultural and urban interests. Ennoblements continued even after the estates had lost their political importance, with the last [[ennoblement]] of explorer [[Sven Hedin]] taking place in 1902; this practice was formally abolished with the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Sweden|Constitution]] January 1, 1975, while the status of the [[Swedish House of Nobility|House of Nobility]] continued to be regulated in law until 2003.

In Finland, this legal division existed until 1906, still drawing on the Swedish constitution of 1772. However, at the start of the 20th century most of the population did not belong to any Estate and had no political representation. A particularly large class were the rent farmers, who did not own the land they cultivated but had to work in the land-owner's farm to pay their rent (unlike Russia, there were no slaves or [[serf]]s.) Furthermore, the industrial workers living in the city were not represented by the four-estate system.

The political system was reformed as a result of the [[Finnish general strike of 1905]], with the last Diet instituting a new constitutional law to create the [[Eduskunta|modern parliamentary system]], ending the political privileges of the estates. The post-independence constitution of 1919 forbade ennoblement, and all tax privileges were abolished in 1920. The privileges of the estates were officially and finally abolished in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1995/19950971 Original Act 971/1995]&lt;/ref&gt; although in legal practice, the privileges had long been unenforceable. As in Sweden, the nobility has not been officially abolished and records of nobility are still voluntarily maintained by the [[Finnish House of Nobility]].

In Finland, it is still illegal and punishable by jail time (up to one year) to defraud into marriage by declaring a false name or estate (Rikoslaki 18 luku § 1/Strafflagen 18 kap. § 1).

==Low Countries==
The [[Low Countries]], which until the late sixteenth century consisted of several counties, prince bishoprics, duchies etc. in the area that is now modern [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]], had no States General until 1464, when [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Duke Philip of Burgundy]] assembled the first States General in [[Bruges]]. Later in the 15th and 16th centuries [[Brussels]] became the place where the States General assembled. On these occasions deputies from the States of the various provinces (as the counties, prince-bishoprics and duchies were called) asked for more liberties. For this reason, the States General were not assembled very often.

As a consequence of the [[Union of Utrecht]] in 1579 and the events that followed afterwards, the States General declared that they no longer obeyed [[King Philip II of Spain]], who was also [[Lord|overlord]] of the Netherlands. After the reconquest of the [[southern Netherlands]] (roughly Belgium and Luxemburg), the States General of the Dutch Republic first assembled permanently in [[Middelburg]], and in [[The Hague]] from 1585 onward. Without a king to rule the country, the States General became the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] power. It was the level of government where all things were dealt with that were of concern to all the seven provinces that became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the United Netherlands]].

During that time the States General were formed by representatives of the States (i.e. provincial parliaments) of the seven provinces. In each States (a [[plurale tantum]]) sat representatives of the nobility and the cities (the clergy were no longer represented; in [[Friesland]] the peasants were indirectly represented by the ''[[Grietman]]nen'').

In the Southern Netherlands, the last meetings of the States General loyal to the Habsburgs took place in the [[Estates General of 1600]] and the [[Estates General of 1632]].

As a government, the States General of the Dutch Republic were abolished in 1795. A new parliament was created, called ''Nationale Vergadering'' (National Assembly). It no longer consisted of representatives of the States, let alone the Estates: all men were considered equal under the 1798 Constitution. Eventually, the Netherlands became part of the French Empire under [[Napoleon]] (1810:'' La Hollande est reunie à l'Empire'').

After regaining independence in November 1813, the name "States General" was resurrected for a legislature constituted in 1814 and elected by the [[States-Provincial]]. In 1815, when the Netherlands were united with Belgium and Luxemburg, the States General were divided into two chambers: the First Chamber and the Second Chamber. The members of the First Chamber were appointed for life by the King, while the members of the Second Chamber were elected by the members of the States Provincial. The States General resided in The Hague and Brussels in alternate years until 1830, when, as a result of the [[Belgian Revolution]], The Hague became once again the sole residence of the States General, Brussels instead hosting the newly founded [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian Parliament]].

From 1848 on, the Dutch Constitution provides that members of the Second Chamber be elected by the people (at first only by a limited portion of the male population; universal male and female suffrage exists since 1919), while the members of the First Chamber are chosen by the members of the States Provincial. As a result, the Second Chamber became the most important. The First Chamber is also called Senate. This however, is not a term used in the Constitution.

Occasionally the First and Second Chamber meet in a ''Verenigde Vergadering'' (Joint Session), for instance on [[Prinsjesdag]], the annual opening of the parliamentary year, and when a new king is [[Inauguration|inaugurated]].

==Holy Roman Empire==
The [[Holy Roman Empire]] had the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (''Reichstag''). The clergy was represented by the independent [[prince-bishop]]s, prince-archbishops and [[prince-abbot]]s of the many [[monastery|monasteries]]. The nobility consisted of independent aristocratic rulers: secular [[prince-elector]]s, kings, dukes, margraves, counts and others. Burghers consisted of representatives of the independent [[Free imperial city|imperial cities]]. Many peoples whose territories within the Holy Roman Empire had been independent for centuries had no representatives in the Imperial Diet, and this included the [[Imperial Knight]]s and independent villages. The power of the Imperial Diet was limited, despite efforts of centralization.

Large realms of the nobility or clergy had estates of their own that could wield great power in local affairs. Power struggles between ruler and estates were comparable to similar events in the history of the British and French parliaments.

The [[Swabian League]], a significant regional power in its part of Germany during the 15th Century, also had its own kind of Estates, a governing Federal Council comprising three Colleges: those of Princes, Cities, and Knights.

==Russian Empire==
{{Main|Social estates in the Russian Empire}}
In the late [[Russian Empire]] the estates were called ''[[sosloviye]]s''. The four major estates were: nobility (''[[dvoryanstvo]]''), [[clergy]], rural dwellers, and urban dwellers, with a more detailed stratification therein. The division in estates was of mixed nature: traditional, occupational, as well as formal: for example, voting in [[Duma]] was carried out by estates. [[Russian Empire Census]] recorded the reported estate of a person.

==Catalonia==
{{Main|Catalan Courts}}
The [[Catalan Parliament|Parliament of Catalonia]] was first established in 1283 as the Catalan Courts (''Corts Catalanes''), according to American historian [[Thomas Bisson]], and it has been considered by several historians as a model of medieval [[parliament]]. For instance, English historian of constitutionalism [[Charles Howard McIlwain]] wrote that the General Courts of Catalonia, during the 14th century, had a more defined organization and met more regularly than the parliaments of England or France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joaquim Albareda]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20040103005104/http://www.uvic.es/central/campus/gabinet/aulass/ca/albareda.html "Estat i nació a l'Europa moderna"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of the parliament institution in Catalonia are in the Sanctuary and Truce Assemblies (''assemblees de pau i treva'') that started in the 11th century.
The members of the parliament of Catalonia were organized in the Three Estates (Catalan: ''Tres Estats''):
*the "military estate" (''polígons militars'') with representatives of the feudal nobility
*the "ecclesiastical estate" (''eclesiàstica arrels'') with representatives of the religious hierarchy
*the "royal estate" (''real estate'') with representatives of the free municipalities under royal privilege
The parliament institution was abolished in 1716, together with the rest of institutions of Catalonia, after the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">In [[mathematics]], an '''exponentially closed field''' is an [[ordered field]] of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; which has an order preserving [[isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; of the additive group of  &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; onto the multiplicative group of positive elements of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; such that 
&lt;math&gt;1+1/n&lt;E(1)&lt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; for some natural number &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Isomorphism &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; is called an exponential function in &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* The canonical example for an exponentially closed field is the ordered field of real numbers; here &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; can be any function &lt;math&gt; a^x\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;1&lt; a\in F&lt;/math&gt;. 

==Properties==
* Every exponentially closed field &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is ''root-closed'', i.e., every positive element of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; has an &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt;-th root for all positive integer &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; (or in other words the  multiplicative group of positive elements of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Divisible group|divisible]]). This is so because &lt;math&gt;E\left(\frac{1}{n}E^{-1}(a)\right)^n=E(E^{-1}(a))=a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. 
* Consequently, every exponentially closed field is an [[Euclidean field]]. 
* Consequently, every exponentially closed field is an ordered [[Pythagorean field]].
* Not every [[real-closed field]] is an exponentially closed field, e.g., the field of real [[algebraic number]]s is not exponentially closed.  This is so because &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; has to be &lt;math&gt;E(x)=a^x\,&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;a\in F\,&lt;/math&gt; in every exponentially closed subfield &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; of the real numbers; and &lt;math&gt;E(\sqrt{2})=a^\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is not algebraic if  &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic by [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]].
* Consequently, the class of exponentially closed fields is not an [[elementary class]] since the field of real numbers and the field of  real algebraic numbers are [[elementarily equivalent]] structures. 
* The class of exponentially closed fields is a [[pseudoelementary class]]. This is so since a field &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is  exponentially closed iff there is a surjective function &lt;math&gt;E_2:F\rightarrow F^+&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E_2(x+y)=E_2(x)E_2(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2(1)=2&lt;/math&gt;; and these properties of &lt;math&gt;E_2\,&lt;/math&gt; are axiomatizable.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}
{{Writing systems sidebar}}
In a '''featural [[writing system]]''', the shapes of the symbols (such as letters) are not arbitrary but encode [[distinctive feature|phonological feature]]s of the phonemes that they represent.  The term '''featural''' was introduced by [[Geoffrey Sampson]] to describe the [[Hangul|Korean alphabet]]&lt;ref name="Sampson"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-8047-1756-4|title=Writing Systems|first=Geoffrey|last=Sampson|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1990|ref=Sampson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}} and [[Pitman shorthand]].&lt;ref name="Sampson" /&gt;{{rp|40}}

Joe Martin introduced the term '''featural notation''' to describe writing systems that include symbols to represent individual features rather than phonemes. He asserts that "alphabets have no symbols for anything smaller than a [[phoneme]]".&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://www.signwriting.org/archive/docs1/sw0032-Stokoe-Sutton.pdf|title=A  Linguistic  Comparison:  Two  Notation  Systems  for  Signed  Languages|first=Joe|last=Martin|year=2000|ref=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

A ''featural'' script represents finer detail than an [[alphabet]]. Here symbols do not represent whole phonemes, but rather the elements (features) that make up the phonemes, such as [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] or its [[place of articulation]]. Theoretically, each feature could be written with a separate letter; and [[abjad]]s or [[abugida]]s, or indeed [[syllabary|syllabaries]], could be featural, but the only prominent system of this sort is the Korean alphabet, also known as hangul or chosŏn'gŭl. In the Korean alphabet, the featural symbols are combined into alphabetic letters, and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks, so that the system combines three levels of phonological representation.

Many scholars, e.g. [[John DeFrancis]], reject this class or at least labeling the Korean alphabet as such.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Korean script is a conscious script creation by literate experts, which Daniels calls a "sophisticated [[grammatogeny]]".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} These include [[stenography|stenographies]] and [[constructed script]]s of hobbyists and fiction writers (such as [[Tengwar]]), many of which feature advanced graphic designs corresponding to phonologic properties. The basic unit of writing in these systems can map to anything from phonemes to words. It has been shown that even the Latin script has sub-character "features".&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation |first=Beatrice |last=Primus |title=A featural analysis of the Modern Roman Alphabet |journal=Written Language and Literacy |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=235–274 |url=http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/IDSLI/dozentenseiten/artikel_primus/Primus_Featural_Analysis_2004.pdf |accessdate=2015-12-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of featural systems==
This is a small list of examples of featural writing systems by date of creation. The languages for which each system was developed are also shown.

===15th century===
*'''[[Korean alphabet|Chosŏn'gŭl/Hangul]]''' — [[Korean language|Korean]]

===19th century===
*'''[[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]]''' — several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]] and [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] languages 
*'''[[Gregg shorthand]]''' — many languages from different families
*'''[[Duployan shorthand]]''' — originally French, later English, German, Spanish, Romanian, [[Chinook Jargon]] and others
*'''[[Visible Speech]]''' (a phonetic script) — no specific language; developed to aid the deaf and teach them to speak properly

===20th century===
*'''[[Shavian alphabet]]''', '''[[Quikscript]]''' — English
*'''[[Tengwar]]''' (an artificial script invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]) — fictional languages from Tolkien's novels; English
*'''[[SignWriting]]''' —  sign languages; featural notation&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;{{rp|5}}
*'''[[Physioalphabet]]''' —  featural international phonetic alphabet based on and depicting the human physiology of speech production

===21st century===
*'''Isibheqe Sohlamvu/[[Ditema tsa Dinoko]]''' — [[Southern Bantu languages]]
&lt;!-- Please do not add these unless there is already a correspondent article or citation 
*'''[[Physioalphabet]]''' (an alphabet based on human physiology)
*'''[[SpeechWriting]]''' (Mundbildschrift: a script for writing mouth movements of voiced words)
*'''[[IsiBheqe SoHlamvu]]''' (an script for writing [[Southern Bantu languages]], also called ''Ditema tsa Dinoko'') --&gt;

==Semi-featural systems==
Other scripts may have limited featural elements. Many languages written in the [[Latin alphabet]] make use of [[diacritic]]s, and those letters using diacritics are sometimes considered separate letters within the language's alphabet. The [[Polish alphabet]], for example, indicates a [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] articulation of some consonants with an acute accent. The [[Turkish alphabet]] uses the presence of one or two dots above a vowel to indicate that it is a [[front vowel]]. The Japanese [[kana]] syllabaries indicate [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants with marks known as [[dakuten]]. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) also has some featural elements, for example in the hooks and tails that are characteristic of implosives, {{IPA|ɓ ɗ ʄ ɠ ʛ}}, and retroflex consonants, {{IPA|ʈ ɖ ʂ ʐ ɳ ɻ ɽ ɭ}}. The IPA [[diacritic]]s are also featural. The [[Fraser alphabet]] used for [[Lisu language|Lisu]] rotates the letters for the [[tenuis consonant]]s ꓑ {{IPA|/p/}}, ꓔ {{IPA|/t/}}, ꓝ {{IPA|/ts/}}, ꓚ {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and ꓗ {{IPA|/k/}} 180° to indicate [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]].

== Feminist Bookstores ==
{{See also|Independent bookstore}}
[[File:Antigone_Books,_Fourth_Avenue,_Tucson_(5620719647).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Antigone_Books,_Fourth_Avenue,_Tucson_(5620719647).jpg|thumb|One of the oldest feminist bookstores, Antigone Books.]]
[[Feminist bookstore]]s hold a part of the second-wave feminism movement inside their stores, with expansion of the bookstores beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/business-feminism/#!|title=Business Feminism - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 there were around 100 bookstores located in North America, which created over $400 million in sales annually.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are still 13 feminist-run bookstores in the world today.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; There is only one in Canada and the rest are spread throughout the United States, with the oldest bookstore, Antigone Books, in [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; The 13 book stores host feminist events to support feminism as well as carry books about the topics of [[Queer theory|queer theories]], [[animal rights]], lesbian fiction, gay studies, and also information about different cultures.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

The decline in feminist bookstores is due to the competition of E-Books, corporate chains, online stores, and the presence of Amazon.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvardpolitics.com/online/fall-bookstores/|title=Brick and Mortar: Lessons About the Future of Bookselling  {{!}}  Harvard Political Review|website=harvardpolitics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These competitors make independent bookstores face financial difficulties.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Recent studies show that consumers still want both the hard copy and digital copy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Besides big corporations coming in and taking business, it was also hard for feminist bookstores to keep up with the competitions distribution, publishing, as well as the ability to sell books to a wider audience.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Notable stores include [[Amazon Bookstore Cooperative]] and [[Silver Moon Bookshop]].

== Feminist Economic Alliance ==
During the Thanksgiving of 1975, the founding women of the Feminist Economic Alliance (FEA) met in Detroit, Michigan at a conference to discuss the problems women faced with money.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/wlmpc_wlmms01003/|title=Feminist Economic Alliance Formed to Aid New Sister Credit Unions|website=Duke Digital Collections|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two leading women for the alliance in 1975 were [[Susan Osborne]] and Linda Maslanko, both from New York.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They were the spokeswomen for FEA and educated the public on what the alliance meant and what the future of FEA looked like after splitting into eight geographic regions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Feminist Economic Alliance was created to aid new sister credit unions as well as allowing any women to become economically powerful, independent, or grow as an individual.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This independence for women was going to be achieved by encouraging, assisting, and promoting the women of feminist credit unions and feminist enterprises.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The main idea behind this new alliance was that older sister credit unions could help the new developing credit unions by sharing research, resources, and guidance in the process.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Feminist Credit Unions ==
In the 1970s during the second wave feminist movement, women had the urge to fight unequal credit so they created their own non-profit, financial institutions so that men were no longer in control of their money.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/27/archives/feminists-open-own-credit-union-slew-haven-office-for-loans-ends.html|title=Feminists Open Own Credit Union|last=Knight|first=Michael|date=1974-08-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-manager of the union, Susan Osborne, was creating an environment for women to save money as well as help other women in need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By creating their own credit unions, women were able to avoid being discriminated based on their gender even though the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 banned credit unions from discriminating potential customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebhc.org/financial-feminism-credit-unions-women%E2%80%99s-movement-1970s|title=Abstract: Financial Feminism: Credit Unions in the Women's Movement of the 1970s {{!}} The Business History Conference|website=thebhc.org|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women being excluded from receiving loans despite the law in place, were divorced women, low-income women, women needing legal money or women on welfare.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Establishing feminist credit unions meant that they would now be able to receive loans hassle free, save their money, and gain money management counseling.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19760109&amp;id=XXQjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=V40EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7255,1595578&amp;hl=en|title=Sarasota Journal - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When receiving credit, women are viewed by their individual character rather than if they were married or single.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A woman no longer has to be the co-signer, she can now be in control of her money.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The unions run no differently than any other union, in fact, the feminist credit unions are governed by the same laws as the normal credit unions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Detroit, Michigan branch ===
In 1982, the Detroit, Michigan branch, the last feminist credit union, was dissolved due to financial problems and also the reconstruction of the unions language change.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcul.org/industry-and-program-resources/publications-and-multimedia/news?article_id=27153|title=Forty-Four Years Ago a Female-Run Credit Union Paved the Way for Women's Financial Independence|work=Michigan Credit Union League|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language was suggested to be changed to include both genders, not just female.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Michigan Credit Union League saw the feminist credit unions as bias towards men and suggestions of equal consideration for males in a female position were to be given resulting in it being dissovled.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Feminist Mail-Order Magazines ==

=== History ===

The feminist mail-order magazine came from Great Britain around the 1970s and lasted until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/spare-rib/articles/feminist-collectives|title=Feminist collectives|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collectives were notable for allowing women to take equal parts in the creation of the magazine in all areas including: copy typing, design, layout or interviewing.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; By allowing women the equal chance at learning, women were developing their creativity and gaining new skills.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Women were allowed to fight back at the patriarchal system by voicing their opinions and allowing women who were excluded also have a platform.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Excluded women during that time were black, lesbian, working class, or single mothers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Popular magazines at the time were [[Spare Rib]], Scarlet Woman, Catcall, and Outwrite.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The magazines were not afraid to comment about inequalities the women were facing or issues that needed to be addressed.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6bhrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=scarlet+woman+magazine+1970#v=onepage&amp;q=scarlet%20woman%20magazine%201970&amp;f=false|title=Magazine Movements: Women's Culture, Feminisms and Media Form|last=Forster|first=Laurel|date=2015-02-26|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781441172631|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist activities were also talked about in the magazines creating networks, reformation, expressing opinions or attitudes relating to a certain topic.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Mail-order magazines were a way for women to become educated on feminism and how to join the movement.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Magazines ===

==== Spare Rib ====

[[Spare Rib]] ran from 1972–93 and was an active part in the Women's Liberation movement.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/spare-rib|title=Spare Rib|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine covered issues regarding stereotypes women face as well as issues women face in the world and realistic solutions to the problems.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Scarlet Woman ====

In April 1975, the first issue of Scarlet Woman was published by Sydney SW Collective.&lt;ref name="vwllfa.org.au"&gt;http://www.vwllfa.org.au/bios-pdf/arch91-SW.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was created to be a socialist feminist magazine and included articles dealing with money, lesbians, health and more.&lt;ref name="vwllfa.org.au"/&gt;
[[File:Ms. magazine Cover - Spring 1972.jpg|thumb|Ms. Magazine Cover - Spring 1972.]]

==== Ms. Magazine ====

In 1972, [[Gloria Steinem]] created the first magazine that was specifically for women, created by an entire team of women in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.makers.com/blog/making-history-gloria-steinem-creates-ms-magazine|title=MAKING HISTORY: Gloria Steinem Creates Ms. Magazine|last=MAKERS|website=MAKERS|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms. Magazine]] was the first magazine to address domestic violence, speak about politics, or discuss topics men thought were unnatural for women, motivating the feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/ms-magazine-2011-11/|title=How Do You Spell Ms|website=NYMag.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloria Steinem was also the co-founder of [[Women's Action Alliance|Woman's Action Alliance]] and [[National Women's Political Caucus]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; [[Brenda Feigen]], co-founder of the Woman's Action Alliance with Steinem, was an attorney activist who helped Steinem brainstorm ideas for the magazine as well as held meetings in her apartment.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Today, Ms. Magazine is published by Liberty Media for Women, LLC, owned by Feminist Majority Foundation, that is based in Arlington, Virginia and Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/contact.asp|title=Ms. Magazine Online|website=msmagazine.com|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist Restaurants ==
The earliest form of feminist restaurants took shape in suffrage restaurants, tea rooms, or lunch rooms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefeministrestaurantproject.com/|title=Women’s restaurants|last=|first=|date=2013-06-18|work=Restaurant-ing through history|access-date=2018-04-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food was sold at a low cost of five or ten cents and men were permitted to eat, in hopes of women persuading men to support a certain political cause.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These restaurants suffered from conflicts dealing with the founders and donators.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Alva Belmont]], a wealthy socialite, was the founder of a suffrage restaurant that was known for strict rules and a fast pace.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ideas and motives behind these suffrage restaurants in the 1910s were the foundations for the feminist restaurants in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In April 1972, the first feminist restaurant, Mother Courage, was founded by [[Dolores Alexander]] in New York.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Feminist restaurants are used more as a place to gather and socialize rather than eating.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The restaurants were used to share ideas, literature, educate one another and to promote the feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Guest speakers, political speakers, poets, or musicians would come to the restaurants to promote issues or spread awareness.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefeministrestaurantproject.com/|title=The Feminist Restaurant Project|website=thefeministrestaurantproject.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee houses and cafes are also popular among the feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Restaurants offered same pay to every staff member, which was entirely women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The style was simple and supported the movements that were occurring during that time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They support other occupations by avoiding certain products such as lettuce and grapes for the farmers or boycotting orange juice for the anti-gay campaign.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Feminist restaurants were also notable for treating women or lesbians with respect in a non-hostile environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A women who is dining with a man will be given a wine sample as well as the check at the end of the meal.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; That was typical not the case in restaurants that were not catered to feminism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Feminist Businesses Today ==

In today's society, feminist businesses look different besides the few bookstores left in the world.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; There are over hundreds of companies created by women, that have a purpose besides making money such as changing our society, impacting employers and the consumers they reach.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bi-100-the-creators-women-2016-6|title=22 successful women-led companies that prove there's much more to business than profits|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One famous company started by a woman that has been successful is [[Tory Burch]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; She created the store from nothing and has been able to create a multibillion-dollar business as well as a foundation called the Tory Burch Foundation in 2009, to help empower women and female entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Today feminist business are about empowering women in the shape of products sold, campaigns run, and businesses created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/298982|title=Redefining Modern Feminism in the World of Business|last=Shah|first=Ameera|date=2017-08-18|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''genealogy''' is a [[history|historical]] technique in which one questions the commonly understood emergence of various philosophical and social beliefs by attempting to account for the scope, breadth or totality of [[discourse]], thus extending the possibility of analysis, as opposed to the [[Marxist]] use of the term [[ideology]] to explain the totality of historical discourse within the time period in question by focusing on a singular or dominant discourse (ideology). Moreover, a genealogy often attempts to look beyond the discourse in question toward the conditions of their possibility (particularly in Foucault's genealogies). It has been developed as continuation of the works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. For example, tracking the lineages of a concept such as 'globalization' can be called a 'genealogy' to the extent that the concept is located in its changing constitutive setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Steger | first2= Manfred B. | title= A Genealogy of Globalization: The Career of a Concept | url= http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rglo20/11/4#.VR0vDzuUdPM | journal= Globalizations | volume=  11 | issue=  4 | pages= 424}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This entails not just documenting its changing meaning (etymology) but the social basis of its changing meaning.

==Nietzsche==
Nietzsche criticized "the genealogists" in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' and proposed the use of a historic philosophy to critique modern [[morality]] by supposing that it developed into its current form through [[power relations]]. But scholars note that he emphasizes that, rather than being purely necessary developments of power relations, these developments are to be exposed as at least partially contingent, the upshot being that the present conception of morality could always have been constituted otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=di Georgio|first1=Paul|title=Contingency and Necessity in the Genealogy of Morality|journal=TELOS|date=2013|volume=2013|issue=162|pages=97–111|doi=10.3817/0313162097|url=http://journal.telospress.com/content/2013/162/97.extract|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the philosophy of Nietzsche has been characterized as genealogy, he only uses the term in ''On the Genealogy of Morals.'' The later philosophy that has been influenced by Nietzsche, and which is commonly described as genealogy, shares several fundamental aspects of Nietzschean philosophical insight. Nietzschean historic philosophy has been described as "a consideration of oppositional tactics" that embraces, as opposed to forecloses, the conflict between philosophical and historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foucault's Discipline |last=Ransom |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham |isbn=0-8223-1878-4 |pages=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foucault==
In the late twentieth century, [[Michel Foucault]] expanded the concept of genealogy into a counter-history of the position of the subject which traces the development of people and societies through history.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Lectures At The College de France Society Must Be Defended'' 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  His genealogy of the subject accounts "for the constitution of knowledges, discourses, domains of objects, and so on, without having to make reference to a subject which is either [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] in relation to the field of events or runs in its empty sameness throughout the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential Foucault: Selections from Essential works of Foucault, 1954-1984 |last=Foucault |first=Michel |year=2003 |publisher=The New Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=1-56584-801-2 |page=306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Foucault discussed in his essay "Nietzsche, Genealogy, History", Foucault's ideas of genealogy were greatly influenced by the work that Nietzsche had done on the development of morals through power. Foucault also describes genealogy as a particular investigation into those elements which "we tend to feel [are] without history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews |last=Foucault |first=Michel |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1980 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=0-8014-9204-1 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would include things such as sexuality, and other elements of everyday life.  Genealogy is not the search for origins, and is not the construction of a [[linear]] development.  Instead it seeks to show the plural and sometimes contradictory past that reveals traces of the influence that power has had on truth.

As one of the important theories of Michel Foucault,  genealogy deconstructs truth, arguing that truth is, more often than not, discovered by chance, backed up by the operation of [[Power/knowledge]] or the consideration of interest. Furthermore, all truths are questionable. Pointing out the unreliability of truth, which is often accused as "having tendency of relativity and nihilism",{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} the theory flatly refuses the uniformity and regularity of history, emphasizing the irregularity and inconstancy of truth and toppling the notion that history progresses in a linear order.

The practice of genealogy is also closely linked to what Foucault called the "archeological method:"

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, it seems that from the empirical observability for us of an ensemble to its historical acceptability, to the very period of time in which it is actually observable, the analysis goes by way of the knowledge-power nexus, supporting it, recouping it at the point where it is accepted, moving toward what makes it acceptable, of course, not in general, but only where it is accepted. This is what can be characterized as recouping it in its positivity. Here, then, is a type of procedure, which, unconcerned with legitimizing and consequently excluding the fundamental point of view of the law, runs through the cycle of positivity by proceeding from the fact of acceptance to the system of acceptability analyzed through the knowledge-power interplay. Let us say that this is, approximately, the archaeological level [of analysis].&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "What is Critique?" in ''The Politics of Truth'', Ed. Sylvère Lotringer. New York: Semiotext(e), 2007, pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Heart corazón.svg|thumb|A conventional heart symbol]]
The '''heart shape''' ({{red|♥}}) is an [[ideograph]] used to express the idea of the "heart" in its [[heart (metaphor)|metaphorical]] or [[symbol]]ic sense as the center of [[human emotion|emotion]], including [[affection]] and [[love]], especially [[romantic love]].

The "wounded heart" indicating [[lovesickness]] came to be depicted as a heart symbol pierced with an arrow ([[Cupid]]'s), or heart symbol "broken" in two or more pieces.

==History==

===Origins of symbol===
Greek. In the 6th-5th century BC, the heart shape was used to represent the heart-shaped fruit of the plant [[Silphium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Favorito|first=E. N.|last2=Baty |first2=K.|date=February 1995|title=The Silphium Connection|journal=Celator|volume=9|issue=2|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a plant possibly used as a contraceptive&lt;ref name ="Straight Dope"&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/061013.html ''Did the ancient Romans use a natural herb for birth control?''], [[The Straight Dope]],  October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many species in the [[Apiaceae|parsley family]] have [[estrogen]]ic properties, and some, such as [[wild carrot]], were used to induce abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance|first1=John M.|last1=Riddle|pp=58|publisher=harvard university press|year=1994|isbn=978-0674168763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver coins from Cyrene of the 6–5th BC bear a similar design, sometimes accompanied by a silphium plant and is understood to represent its seed or fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buttrey |first=T. V. |date=Spring–Summer 1992 |url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/34-1-2/Buttrey.pdf |title=The Coins and the Cult |journal=Expedition |volume=34 |issue=1–2 |pages=59–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that the heart symbol was found in devotion to God. The symbol appears as one rights themselves up, after having prayed with one's head to the ground. The hands form the symbol as one is in the process of standing up. 

===Earliest use===
[[File:Roman de la poire heart metaphor.jpg|thumb|The earliest known visual depiction of a heart symbol, as a lover hands his heart to the beloved lady, in a manuscript of the ''[[Roman de la poire]]'', mid-13th century.]]
The combination of the heart shape and its use within the heart metaphor developed at the end of the [[Middle Ages]], although the shape has been used in many ancient epigraphy monuments and texts.  With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp (2011), 96–99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of ivy and of the water-lily. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's "sweet gaze" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel.  The heart here resembles a pine cone (held "upside down", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into "Novel Of The Pear" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.&lt;ref name="Vinken 2001"&gt;Vinken (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held "upside down"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Vinken 2001"/&gt;

The "scalloped" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''Documenti d'amore ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459–70, fol 192v. Royal Library of Belgium). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.&lt;ref&gt;Vinken (2001): "The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since."&lt;/ref&gt; The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various hypotheses attempted to connect the "heart shape" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.&lt;ref name="mcdonell"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.  Specific suggestions include: the shape of the seed of the [[silphium]] plant, used in ancient times as an [[herbal contraceptive]],&lt;ref name="mcdonell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/sowing-the-seeds-of-love-20060212-ge1qsr.html|title=Sowing the seeds of love|first=Luke|last=Benedictus|date=12 February 2006|website=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stylized depictions of features of the human female body, such as the female's [[breasts]], [[buttocks]], [[mons pubis|pubic mound]], or spread [[vulva]].&lt;ref&gt;proposed by [[Gloria Steinem]] in the 1998 introduction to the ''[[Vagina Monologues]]'' [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/random043/97029393.htm online copy]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; "For example, the shape we call a heart—whose symmetry resembles the vulva far more than the asymmetry of the organ that shares its name—is probably a residual female genital symbol. It was reduced from power to romance by centuries of male dominance.", based on an earlier suggestion by Tanzer (1969) that the shape was used as a symbol indicating brothels in ancient Pompeii. Tanzer (1969). ''The Common People of Pompeii. A study of the graffiti. With illustrations and a map ''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Empress Zoe mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumbnail|Mosaic of the Empress Zoe in the Hagia Sophia, 1239]]
Heart shapes can be seen on the [[Bible]] Jesus holds in the [[Zoë Porphyrogenita|Empress Zoë]] mosaic in the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]], but a reference to the organ was probably not intended.  It probably dates from 1239.

Likewise, heart shapes can be seen on various [[stucco]] reliefs and wall panels excavated from the ruins of [[Ctesiphon]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] capital (circa 90 BC – 637 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Roundel with radiating palmettes.

The [[Luther rose]] was the [[seal (device)|seal]] that was designed for [[Martin Luther]] at the behest of Prince [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick]], in 1530, while Luther was staying at the [[Coburg]] Fortress during the [[Diet of Augsburg]]. Luther wrote an explanation of the symbol to [[Lazarus Spengler]]: "a black cross in a heart, which retains its natural color, so that I myself would be reminded that faith in the Crucified saves us. 'For one who believes from the heart will be justified' ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 10:10)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/Playing%20Cards/decks/france/index.html gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010201917/http://gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/Playing%20Cards/decks/france/index.html |date=2006-10-10 }}, [http://i-p-c-s.org/faq/history_6.php i-p-c-s.org] {{cite web |url=http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/p-11469.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927130238/http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/p-11469.jpg |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }} [http://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/a-history-of-wood-engraving.htm antiquemapsandprints.com], obviously more research is needed here. {{unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aorta]] remains visible, as a protrusion at the top centered between the two "chambers" indicated in the symbol, in some depictions of the Sacred Heart well into the 18th century, and is partly still shown today (although mostly obscured by elements such as a crown, flames, rays, or a cross) but the "hearts" suit did not have this element since the 15th century.

The heart symbol reached Japan with the [[Nanban trade]] of 1543 to 1614, as evidenced by an [[Edo period]] [[Samurai armor|Samurai]] helmet (dated c. 1630), which includes both the rounded and indented forms of the heart symbol, representing the heart of [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marishiten]], goddess of archers.&lt;ref&gt;Samurai helmet representing the flaming jewel, by Unkai Mitsuhisa ca 1630, Ann and Gabriel Barbier-Mueller Collection, exhibited at Boston Fine Arts Museum,  April–August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
Since the 19th century, the symbol has often been used on [[Valentine's Day]] [[greeting card|cards]], [[candy]] boxes, and similar [[popular culture]] artifacts as a symbol of [[romantic love]].

The use of the heart symbol as a [[logograph]] for the English verb "to love" derives from the use in "[[I ♥ NY]]," introduced in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;"Subsequently the heart symbol became a shorthand for enthusiasm for everything form software to Yorkshire terriers. It was a stamp that validated lifestyles. People could ♥ their grandchildren or line dancing or Buddha." Stephen Amidon, Thomas Amidon, ''The Sublime Engine: A Biography of the Human Heart'' (2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart symbols were used to symbolize [[Health (gaming)|"health" or "lives"]] in [[video game]]s; influentially so in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986). ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (1987, 1988) had a "life bar" composed of [[hexagon]]s, but in 1990s remakes of these games, the hexagons were replaced by heart shapes. Since the 1990s, the heart symbol has also been used as an ideogram indicating health outside of the video gaming context, e.g. its use by restaurants to indicate heart-healthy nutrient content claim (e.g. "low in [[cholesterol]]"). A copyrighted "heart-check" symbol to indicate heart-healthy food was introduced by the [[American Heart Association]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;"the heart-check mark that began to appear on a wide array of food packaging in 1995. The symbol consists of a heart branded with a bold, efficient check mark. It is copyrighted by the American Heart Association (AHA) which licences it for a nominal fee to companies whose products meet the organization's criteria for saturated fat and cholesterol content." Stephen Amidon, Thomas Amidon, ''The Sublime Engine: A Biography of the Human Heart'' (2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest heart-shaped charges in heraldry appear in the 12th century; the hearts in the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] go back to the royal banner of the kings of Denmark, in turn based on a seal used as early as the 1190s. However, while the charges are clearly heart-shaped, they did not in origin depict hearts, or symbolize any idea related to love. Instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the [[Nuphar|water-lily]]. Early heraldic heart-shaped charges depicting the leaves of water-lilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline (''e.g.'' [[Flags of Frisia]]).

Inverted heart symbols have been used in heraldry as stylized [[testicle]]s (''coglioni'' in Italian) as in the [[canting arms]] of the [[Colleoni]] family of Milan.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, John and George Burnett (1969).

The authenticity of this seal is "very questionable",&lt;ref&gt;McAndrew, ''Scotland's Historic Heraldry'', 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QFkI3G31HTMC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. it could possibly date to the late 14th or even the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;McAndrew 2006, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic charges actually representing hearts became more common in the [[early modern period]], with the [[Sacred Heart]] depicted in [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], and hearts representing love appearing in bourgeois coats of arms. Hearts also later became popular elements in municipal coats of arms.

==Botanical symbolism==
{{Main|Silphium}}
There has been some conjecture regarding the link between the traditional heart symbol and images of the fruit of Silphium, a (probably) extinct plant known to [[classical antiquity]] and belonging to the genus [[Ferula]], used as a condiment and medicine, (the medicinal properties including [[contraceptive]] and [[abortifacient]] activity, linking the plant to sexuality and love).&lt;ref&gt;Favorito, E. N.; Baty, K. (February 1995). "The Silphium Connection". Celator. 9 (2): 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver coins from the ancient Libya of the 6th - 5th BC bear images strongly reminiscent of the heart symbol, sometimes accompanied by images of the Silphium plant.&lt;ref&gt;T.

In [[Code page 437]], the original character set of the IBM PC, the value of 3 (hexadecimal 03) represents the heart symbol. This value is shared with the non-printing [[End-of-text character|ETX]] control character, which overrides the glyph in many contexts.

The Unicode character of the letter ''ghan'' of the [[Georgian alphabet]] ([[wikt:ღ|ღ]]) has seen some use as a surrogate heart symbol in online communication.{{according to whom|date=November 2013}}{{year needed|date=November 2013}}

==Parametrisation==
A number of [[parametrisation]]s of approximately heart-shaped [[mathematical curve|curves]] have been described.
The best-known of these is the [[cardioid]], which is an [[epicycloid]] with one [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric W. Weisstein|Weisstein, Eric W.]], "[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cardioid.html Cardioid]" from [[MathWorld]].&lt;/ref&gt; though as the cardioid lacks the point, it may be seen as a stylized water-lily leaf, a so-called [[seeblatt]], rather than a heart. Other curves, such as the [[Level set|implicit curve]] (x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;−x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;y&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=0, may produce better approximations of the heart shape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric W. Weisstein]], [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html "Heart Curve."] From [[MathWorld]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2691">'''Implied powers''', in the [[United States]], are powers authorized by the Constitution that, while not stated, seem implied by powers that are expressly stated. When [[George Washington]] asked [[Alexander Hamilton]] to defend the constitutionality of the [[First Bank of the United States]] against the protests&lt;ref&gt; they implied powers into the united states.......[http://courses.pasleybrothers.com/texts/Jefferson_on_BUS.htm Against the Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States], Thomas Jefferson.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and Attorney General [[Edmund Randolph]], Hamilton produced what has now become the classic statement for implied powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bank-ah.asp For the Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States], Alexander Hamilton.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamilton argued that the sovereign duties of a government implied the right to use means adequate to its ends.  Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies.  Hamilton noted that the "[[Taxing and Spending Clause|general welfare clause]]" and the "[[Necessary_and_Proper_Clause|necessary and proper clause]]" gave elasticity to the Constitution. Hamilton won the argument with Washington, who signed the bank bill into law.

Later, directly borrowing from Hamilton, Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] invoked the implied powers of government in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]''. In 1816, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation creating the [[Second Bank of the United States]].  The state of Maryland attempted to tax the bank.  The state argued the [[United States Constitution]] did not explicitly grant Congress the power to establish banks.  In 1819, the Court decided against the state of Maryland. Chief Justice Marshall argued that Congress had the right to establish the bank, as the Constitution grants to Congress certain implied powers beyond those explicitly stated.

In the case of the United States Government, implied powers are powers Congress exercises that the Constitution does not explicitly define, but are necessary and proper to execute the powers.

==Notes==
Implied powers are those that can reasonably be assumed to flow from express powers, though not explicitly mentioned. The legitimacy of these powers is derived from the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]], the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]], and the [[Commerce Clause]].

{{UML diagram types}}
'''Interaction Overview Diagram''' is one of the fourteen types of [[diagram]]s of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), which can picture a control flow with nodes that can contain [[interaction diagram]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rtnlhelp/v6r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.xtools.modeler.doc/topics/rdiagtype.html Types of modeling diagrams]. Retrieved 12 Sept 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The interaction overview diagram is similar to the [[activity diagram]], in that both visualize a sequence of activities. The difference is that, for an interaction overview, each individual activity is pictured as a frame which can contain a nested [[interaction diagram]]. This makes the interaction overview diagram useful to "deconstruct a complex scenario that would otherwise require multiple if-then-else paths to be illustrated as a single sequence diagram".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altova.com/features_interaction_overview_diagram.html UModel Interaction Overview Diagrams]. Retrieved 12 Sept 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other notation elements for interaction overview diagrams are the same as for activity diagrams. These include initial, final, decision, merge, fork and join nodes. The two new elements in the interaction overview diagrams are the "interaction occurrences" and "interaction elements."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/resources/uml2_tutorial/uml2_interactionoverviewdiagram.html Sparx Systems - UML 2 Tutorial - Interaction Overview Diagram].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4888">The '''interstimulus interval''' (often abbreviated as '''ISI''')  is the temporal interval between the offset of one [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] to the onset of another. For instance, [[Max Wertheimer]] did experiments with two stationary, flashing lights that at some interstimulus intervals appeared to the subject as moving instead of stationary. In these experiments, the interstimulus interval is simply the time between the two flashes. The ISI plays a large role in the [[phi phenomenon]] (Wertheimer) since the illusion of motion is directly due to the length of the interval between stimuli. When the ISI is shorter, for example between two flashing lines alternating back and forth, we perceive the change in stimuli to be movement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Wertheimer discovered that the space between the two lines is filled in by our brains and that the faster the lines alternate, the more likely we are to perceive it as one line moving back and forth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When the stimuli move fast enough, this creates the illusion of a moving picture like a movie or cartoon. Phi phenomenon is very similar to [[beta movement]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cummins, E. (n.d.). The Phi Phenomenon: Definition &amp; Example. Retrieved May 03, 2016, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-phi-phenomenon-definition-lesson.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As it applies to [[classical conditioning]], the term interstimulus interval is used to represent the gap of time between the start of the conditioned stimulus and the start of the unconditioned stimulus.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning and Memory: From Brain to Behavior|last=Gluck|first=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|publisher=Worth Publishers|date=January 7, 2013|isbn=1429240148|location=New York, NY|pages=124–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be the case of [[Pavlov's dogs|Pavlov's dog]], where the time between the [[unconditioned stimulus]], the food, and the [[Classical conditioning|conditioned stimulus]], the bell, is considered the ISI. More particularly, ISI is often used in [[eyeblink conditioning]] (a widely studied type of classical conditioning involving puffs of air blown into the subject's eyes) where the ISI can effect learning based on the size of the time gap.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; What is of interest in this particular type of classical conditioning is that when the subject is conditioned to blink after the conditioned stimulus (tone), the blink will take place within the time period between the tone and the air puff, making the subject's eyes close before the puff can reach the eyes, protecting them from the air.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The timing between the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus is important. There are two types of approaches for eye blink conditioning when it comes to timing between the stimuli. The first is called delay conditioning, which is when the conditioned stimulus (tone) starts, then continues until the unconditioned stimulus (air puff) is released after a delay, then they both suspend at the same time.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The other is called trace conditioning, where the conditioned stimulus (tone) is shorter and stops before the unconditioned stimulus (air puff) begins, leaving a gap between the two stimuli.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This type of conditioning forces the subject, in this particular example, a bunny, to remember to link the conditioned stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The distinction between the two types of conditioning is of importance because the difference in the interstimulus interval (ISI) can have major effects on learning.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; For example, it has been shown that the length of the ISI, as well as the variability, changes habituation in subjects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Davis, M. (1970). Effects of interstimulus interval length and variability on startle-response habituation in the rat. ''Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology'', ''72''(2), 177-192. doi:10.1037/h0029472&lt;/ref&gt; When ISI is short and constant, habituation will happen more rapidly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The changes in the gap of time can be minuscule, from tens of milliseconds to several seconds long, and the effects it will have will still be important.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Buonomano, D. V., Bramen, J., &amp; Khodadadifar, M. (2009). Influence of the interstimulus interval on temporal processing and learning: Testing the state-dependent network model. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,'' ''364''(1525), 1865-1873. doi:10.1098/rstb.2009.0019&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory and motor tasks are among the elements that can be enhanced or hindered based on timing, like speech processing, which can be influenced by "the ability to discriminate the interval and duration of sounds."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''invariant mass''', '''rest mass''', '''intrinsic mass''', '''proper mass,''' or in the case of bound systems simply '''mass,''' is the portion of the total mass of an [[physical body|object]] or [[physical system|system]] of objects that is independent of the overall motion of the system.  More precisely, it is a characteristic of the system's total [[energy]] and [[momentum]] that is the same in all [[frames of reference]] related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s.&lt;ref name="LawrenceS"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA1073 Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Volume 2, page 1073] - Lawrence S. Lerner - Science - 1997&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[center of momentum frame]] exists for the system&lt;!-- note there are massless particles --&gt;, then the invariant mass of a system is equal to its total mass in that "rest frame". In other reference frames, where the system's momentum is nonzero, the total mass (a.k.a. [[relativistic mass]]) of the system is greater than the invariant mass, but the invariant mass remains unchanged.

Due to [[mass-energy equivalence]], the '''rest energy''' of the system is simply the invariant mass times the [[speed of light]] squared.  Similarly, the total energy of the system is its total (relativistic) mass times the speed of light squared.

Systems whose [[four-momentum]] is a [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|null vector]] (for example a single photon or many photons moving in exactly the same direction) have [[zero]] invariant mass, and are referred to as [[massless particle|''massless'']]. A physical object or particle moving faster than the speed of light would have space-like four-momenta (such as the hypothesized [[tachyon]]), and these do not appear to exist. Any time-like four-momentum possesses a reference frame where the momentum (3-dimensional) is zero, which is a center of momentum frame. In this case, invariant mass is positive and is referred to as the rest mass.

If objects within a system are in relative motion, then the invariant mass of the whole system will differ from the sum of the objects' rest masses. This is also equal to the total energy of the system divided by [[speed of light|''c'']]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. See [[mass–energy equivalence]] for a discussion of definitions of mass. Since the mass of systems must be measured with a weight or mass scale in a center of momentum frame in which the entire system has zero momentum, such a scale always measures the system's invariant mass. For example, a scale would measure the kinetic energy of the molecules in a bottle of gas to be part of invariant mass of the bottle, and thus also its rest mass. The same is true for massless particles in such system, which add invariant mass and also rest mass to systems, according to their energy.

For an isolated ''massive'' system, the center of mass of the system moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal [[velocity]] (with a velocity depending on the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] used to view it). Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the [[center of momentum frame]], the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being "at rest" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which exists under these assumptions, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This total energy in the center of momentum frame, is the '''minimum''' energy which the system may be observed to have, when seen by various observers from various inertial frames.

Note that for reasons above, such a rest frame does not exist for single [[photon]]s, or rays of [[light]] moving in one direction. When two or more photons move in different directions, however, a center of mass frame (or "rest frame" if the system is bound) exists. Thus, the mass of a system of several photons moving in different directions is positive, which means that an invariant mass exists for this system even though it does not exist for each photon.

== Sum of rest masses ==
Because the invariant mass includes the mass of any kinetic and potential energies which remain in the center of momentum frame, the invariant mass of a system can be greater than sum of rest masses of its separate constituents.{{clarify|date=January 2013|It an electric field in a hydrogen atom a "separate constituent"? And which is its mass: positive or negative?}} For example, rest mass and invariant mass are zero for individual photons even though they may add mass to the invariant mass of systems. For this reason, invariant mass is in general not an additive quantity (although there are a few rare situations where it may be, as is the case when massive particles in a system without potential or kinetic energy can be added to a total mass).

Consider the simple case of two-body system, where object A is moving towards another object B which is initially at rest (in any particular frame of reference). The magnitude of invariant mass of this two-body system (see definition below) is different from the sum of rest mass (i.e. their respective mass when stationary). Even if we consider the same system from center-of-momentum frame, where net momentum is zero, the magnitude of the system's invariant mass is '''not equal''' to the sum of the rest masses of the particles within it.

The kinetic energy of such particles and the potential energy of the force fields increase the total energy above the sum of the particle rest masses, and both terms contribute to the invariant mass of the system. The sum of the particle kinetic energies as calculated by an observer is smallest in the center of momentum frame (again, called the "rest frame" if the system is bound).

They will often also interact through one or more of the [[fundamental forces]], giving them a potential energy of interaction, possibly [[negative number|negative]].

For an isolated ''massive'' system, the center of mass moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal [[velocity]]. Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the [[center of momentum frame]], the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being "at rest" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which always exists, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

== As defined in particle physics ==
In [[particle physics]], the '''invariant mass''' {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equal to the [[mass]] in the rest frame of the particle, and can be calculated by the particle's [[energy]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|E}} and its [[momentum]]&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''p'''}} as measured in ''any'' frame, by the [[energy–momentum relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; m_0^2 c^2 = \left( \frac{E}{c} \right) ^2 - \left\| \mathbf{p} \right\| ^2 &lt;/math&gt;

or in [[natural units]] where {{math|1=''c'' = 1}},

:&lt;math&gt; m_0^2 = E^2 - \left\| \mathbf{p} \right\| ^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

This invariant mass is the same in all [[frame of reference|frames of reference]] (see also [[special relativity]]). This equation says that the invariant mass is the pseudo-Euclidean length of the [[four-vector]] {{math|(''E'', '''p''')}}, calculated using the [[pseudo-Euclidean space|relativistic version of the Pythagorean theorem]] which has a different sign for the space and time dimensions. This length is preserved under any Lorentz boost or rotation in four dimensions, just like the ordinary length of a vector is preserved under rotations. In quantum theory the invariant mass is a parameter in the relativistic [[Dirac equation]] for an elementary particle. The Dirac quantum operator corresponds to the particle four-momentum vector.

Since the invariant mass is determined from quantities which are conserved during a decay, the invariant mass calculated using the energy and momentum of the decay products of a single particle is equal to the mass of the particle that decayed.
The mass of a system of particles can be calculated from the general formula:

: &lt;math&gt; \left( W c^2 \right) ^2= \left( \sum E \right) ^2 - \left\| \sum \mathbf{p} c \right\| ^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the invariant mass of the system of particles, equal to the mass of the decay particle.
: &lt;math&gt;\sum E&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the energies of the particles
: &lt;math&gt;\sum \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector sum of the [[momentum]] of the particles (includes both magnitude and direction of the momenta)

The term invariant mass is also used in inelastic scattering experiments. Given an inelastic reaction with total incoming energy larger than the total detected energy (i.e. not all outgoing particles are detected in the experiment), the invariant mass (also known as the "missing mass") {{mvar|W}} of the reaction is defined as follows (in natural units):

: &lt;math&gt; W^2 = \left( \sum E_\text{in} - \sum E_\text{out} \right) ^2 - \left\| \sum \mathbf{p}_\text{in} - \sum \mathbf{p}_\text{out} \right\| ^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

If there is one dominant particle which was not detected during an experiment, a plot of the invariant mass will show a sharp peak at the mass of the missing particle.

In those cases when the momentum along one direction cannot be measured (i.e. in the case of a neutrino, whose presence is only inferred from the [[missing energy]]) the [[Transverse mass]] is used.

==Example: two-particle collision==

In a two-particle collision (or a two-particle decay) the square of the invariant mass (in [[natural units]]) is
::{|
|&lt;math&gt;M^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = ( E_1 + E_2 ) ^2 - \left\| \textbf{p}_1 + \textbf{p}_2 \right\| ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= m_1^2 + m_2^2 + 2 \left( E_1 E_2 - \textbf{p}_1 \cdot \textbf{p}_2 \right) .&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Massless particles ===
The invariant mass of a system made of two massless particles whose momenta form an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;
has a convenient expression:
::{|
|&lt;math&gt; M^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = (E_1 + E_2) ^2 - \left\| \textbf{p}_1 + \textbf{p}_2 \right\| ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = [ ( p_1 , 0 , 0 , p_1 ) + ( p_2 , 0 , p_2 \sin \theta, p_2 \cos \theta ) ] ^2 = ( p_1 + p_2) ^2 - p_2 ^2 \sin^2 \theta - ( p_1 + p_2 \cos \theta ) ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = 2 p_1 p_2 ( 1 - \cos\theta ) .&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Collider experiments ===
In particle collider experiments, one often defines the angular position of a particle in terms of an azimuthal angle&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; and [[pseudorapidity]] &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt;. Additionally the transverse momentum, &lt;math&gt; p_{T} &lt;/math&gt;, is usually measured. In this case if the particles are massless, or highly relativistic ( &lt;math&gt; E &gt;&gt; m&lt;/math&gt;,) then the invariant mass becomes:
::{|
|&lt;math&gt;M^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 2 p_{T 1} p_{T 2} ( \cosh(\eta_1 - \eta_2) - \cos (\phi_1 - \phi_2) ) .\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Rest energy ==
The '''rest energy''' &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; of a [[Elementary particle|particle]] is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ E_0=m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light|speed of light in vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2006/066063.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In general, only differences in [[energy]] have physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modell|first=Michael|author2=Robert C. Reid|title=Thermodynamics and Its Applications |publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]]|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |date=1974 |isbn=0-13-914861-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of rest energy follows from the [[special theory of relativity]] that leads to Einstein's famous conclusion about equivalence of energy and mass. See [[Mass–energy equivalence#Background|background for mass–energy equivalence]].

On the other hand, the concept of the equivalent Dirac invariant rest mass may be defined in terms of the self energy corresponding to the product of a geometric matter current and a generalized potential &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=González-Martín |first= Gustavo R.|date=1994 |title=A geometric definition of mass. |journal=Gen. Rel. Grav. |volume=26 |pages=1177 |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/k7436p075454jtg5/ |bibcode = 1994GReGr..26.1177G |doi = 10.1007/BF02106710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a [[mass#single definition of mass|single definition of mass]] in a geometric unified theory.

In journalism, '''jet set''' was a term for an international social group of [[wealth]]y people who travelled the world to participate in social activities unavailable to ordinary people. The term, which replaced ''[[café society]]'', came from the lifestyle of travelling from one stylish or exotic place to another via [[jet plane]].

The term "jet set" is attributed to [[Igor Cassini]], a reporter for the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' who wrote under the pen name "Cholly Knickerbocker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=[Oleg Cassini] and his younger brother Igor (who became the Hearst newspaper gossip columnist 'Cholly Knickerbocker' and coined the phrase 'jet set')…|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/oleg-cassini-470646.html|title=Oleg Cassini - Obituaries|work=[[The Independent]]|date=20 March 2006|first=Tom|last=Vallance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although jet passenger service in the 1950s was initially marketed primarily to the rich, its introduction eventually resulted in a substantial democratization of [[air travel]]. Hence though the term "jet set" is still in some use, its literal meaning of those who travel by jet is no longer relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=...air travel has been transformed from a luxury good to a mass-market product.|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/in_praise_of_cheap_flights/14440|title=In praise of cheap flights|work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|date=19 December 2013|author=Niemietz, K}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues however to refer to those who have the independent wealth and time to travel frequently and widely for pleasure.

==History==
[[BOAC]] inaugurated the world's first commercial scheduled jet service on 2 May 1952, using the [[DH106 Comet|de Havilland Comet]], followed by the introduction of the Comet 4 in 1958 after a series of accidents in 1953-1954. The first successful service, from October 1958, was the typical "jet set" route, [[London]]&amp;ndash;[[New York City]]. [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] followed suit with the [[Boeing 707]], making its first scheduled flight between New York City and Paris on 26 October 1958.

Other cities on the standard jet set routes were [[Las Vegas]], [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Athens]], [[Madrid]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Tokyo]]. Jet set resorts, invariably with white sand and salt water, were circumspect by modern standards; [[Acapulco]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] with [[Huntington Hartford]]'s new [[Paradise Island]] (opened in 1962) were taking the place of [[Bermuda]]. Meanwhile, [[Cannes]], [[Capri]], [[St. Tropez]], [[Marbella]], [[Portofino]],&lt;ref&gt;"Portofino has long been fashionable with what we once called 'the jet set'." {{cite web |url=http://www.knowital.com/history/liguria/liguria-history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429213627/http://www.knowital.com/history/liguria/liguria-history.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and selected small towns on the [[French Riviera|French]] and [[Italian Riviera|Italian]] Riviera were on the jet set itinerary. Greek Islands such as [[Mykonos]] were included in the loop around 1974.

The original members of this elite, free-wheeling set were those "[[socialite]]s" who were not shy about publicity and entertained in semi-public places like restaurants and in [[night club]]s, where the "[[paparazzi]]" &amp;ndash; a jet set phenomenon &amp;ndash; photographed them. They were the first generation that might weekend in Paris or fly to Rome just for a party. The jet set was celebrated in popular culture, for example, [[Federico Fellini]] captured their lifestyle in ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960), and many record albums of the era promoted flying to foreign lands for honeymoons and getaways, such as Capitol Records ''Honeymoon in Rome'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958205262|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|oclc=958205262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sign that "jet set" had lost its glamorous edge was ''[[Vogue Magazine]]'''s coinage of the term ''the Beautiful People'' in the spring of 1962, an expression that initially referred to the circle that formed around [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Readers of the 15 February 1964 ''Vogue'' could learn "What the beautiful people are doing to keep fit." The two phrases ran for a time in tandem; in 1970, [[Cleveland Amory]] could fear "that the Beautiful People and the Jet Set are being threatened by current economics."&lt;ref&gt;''Vogue'' 15 February 1964:49 and ''[[The Ladies Home Journal]]'' September 1970:81, noted [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/beautiful_people/ Barry Popik, "Beautiful people"].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more serious economic threat was the [[1973 oil crisis]], which cast a pall over the idea of jetting about for pleasure. A sign that "jet set" had passed from urbane use was the 1974 [[country music|country]] song "(We're Not) The Jet Set", in which [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]] claim they are "the old [[Chevrolet]] set," as opposed to leading a glamorous, "jet-setting" lifestyle. books and movies about or referencing to this class include ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1973 novel, 1975 film) and the 1986 [[teen film]] [[drama]], ''[[Fire with Fire (1986 film)|Fire With Fire]]'', the latter movie consisting of jet set parents who sent their daughter to a [[convent school]] and were planning to send her to a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[finishing school]] after graduation from the convent's high school, further depriving her of normal adolescent [[rites of passage]] and family contact.

The flagging "jet set" gained its second wind with the introduction in 1976 of the supersonic [[Concorde]]. Scheduled flights began on 21 January 1976 on the London-[[Bahrain]] oil executive route and the distinctly jet-set Paris-[[Rio de Janeiro]] (via [[Dakar]]) route. From November 1977 the Concorde was flying between standard ''jet set'' destinations, London or Paris to New York City; passenger lists on initial flights were gossip-column material. The Concorde restored the term's cachet: "From rock stars to royalty, the Concorde was the way to travel for the jet set," according to the Nova retrospective special "Supersonic Dream".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3203_concorde.html On-line NOVA transcript] (18 January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Concorde was doomed by its [[sonic boom]], inability to achieve global fly-over rights because of the boom, its huge thirst for jet fuel, and a [[Air France Flight 4590|disastrous crash]]. The aircraft was retired in 2003. Meanwhile, the [[Boeing 747]], densely packed with passengers, was the craft that took over and dominated air travel by reducing travel cost and increasing airport capacity, accelerating the social changes already brought about by the jet age.

Where English is a second language the term has seen continued usage - in the early 1980s, the Argentinian rock band [[Soda Stereo]] recorded a successful song "¿Por qué no puedo ser del Jet Set?" ("Why can't I belong to the jet set?"), and in 2000 the French comedy ''[[Jet Set (film)|Jet Set]]'' made fun of this ''art de vivre''.  The TV series Mad Men featured an episode titled "Jet Set".

'''John William Money''' (8 July 1921 – 7 July 2006) was a [[Psychology|psychologist]], [[Sexology|sexologist]] and author, specializing in research into [[sexual identity]] and [[Sex determination and differentiation (human)|biology of gender]].  He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of "gender" affect an individual. Recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of [[David Reimer]]&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;Diamond M, Sigmundson HK (1997).

==Biography==
Born in [[Morrinsville]], New Zealand, to a family of English and Welsh descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexualhealth.umn.edu/education/john-money/bio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724204551/http://www.sexualhealth.umn.edu/education/john-money/bio |archivedate=24 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Money initially studied [[psychology]] at [[Victoria University of Wellington]],&lt;ref name="nzhobit"&gt;(10 July 2006) [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=204&amp;ObjectID=10390550 Kiwi sexologist dies in US hospital], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''&lt;/ref&gt; graduating with a double master's degree in psychology and education in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Money, PhD|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/John+Money,+Ph.D.-a0168586760|publisher=Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality|accessdate=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money was a junior member of the psychology faculty at the [[University of Otago]] in Dunedin, but in 1947, at the age of 26, he emigrated to the United States to study at the Psychiatric Institute of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He left Pittsburgh and earned his PhD from [[Harvard University]] in 1952. He was married briefly in the 1950s but had no children.

Money proposed and developed several theories and related terminology, including [[gender identity]], [[gender role]],&lt;ref name="diamond2"&gt;Diamond, Milton. (2004). "Sex, gender, and identity over the years: a changing perspective", ''Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America''. 13: 591–607. {{PMID|15183375}} [http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/historical/OverTheYears.htm Full text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203153327/http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/historical/OverTheYears.htm |date=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gender-identity/role, and [[lovemap]]. He coined the term ''paraphilia'' (appearing in the [[DSM-III]]) to replace ''perversions'' and introduced the term ''sexual orientation'' in place of ''sexual preference'', arguing that attraction is not necessarily a matter of free choice.&lt;ref name="John Money, Ph.D"/&gt; 
Money was a professor of [[pediatrics]] and [[medical psychology]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1951 until his death. He also established the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic in 1965 along with [[Claude Migeon]] who was the head of pediatric endocrinology at Johns Hopkins. The hospital began performing sexual reassignment surgery in 1966.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Sex Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bullough|first1=Vern|title=The Contributions of John Money: A Personal View|publisher=Taylor and Francis, Ltd.|jstor=3813317}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Johns Hopkins, Money was also involved with the Sexual Behaviors Unit, which ran studies on [[sex-reassignment surgery]]. He received the [[Magnus Hirschfeld Medal]] in 2002 from the [[German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research]].

Money was an early supporter of New Zealand's arts, both literary and visual. He was a noted friend and supporter of author [[Janet Frame]]. In 2002, as his [[Parkinson's disease]] worsened, Money donated a substantial portion of his art collection to the [[Eastern Southland Art Gallery]] in [[Gore, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="sunobit"&gt;Brewington, Kelly (9 July 2006).

==Sexological books==
Money was the co-editor of a 1969 book "Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment", which helped bring more acceptance to [[sexual reassignment surgery]] and [[transgender]] individuals.

===Sexual identity, gender identity and gender roles===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
{{further|Sexual identity|Gender identity|Gender role}}
Money introduced numerous definitions related to gender in journal articles in the 1950s, many of them as a result of his studies of Hermaphroditism.

Money's definition of [[gender]] is based on his understanding of sex differences among human beings. According to Money, the fact that one sex produces [[ovum|ova]] and the other sex produces [[sperm]] is the irreducible criterion of sex difference. However, there are other ''sex-derivative differences'' that follow in the wake of this primary dichotomy.

These differences involve the way [[urine]] is expelled from the human body and other questions of [[sexual dimorphism]]. According to Money's theory, ''sex-adjunctive differences'' are typified by the smaller size of females and their problems in moving around while [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] infants. This then makes it more likely that the males do the roaming and hunting.

''Sex-arbitrary differences'' are those that are purely conventional: for example, color selection (baby blue for boys, [[Pink#The 20th century|pink for girls]]).  Some of the latter differences apply to life activities, such as career opportunities for men versus women.

Finally, Money created the now-common term ''[[gender role]]'' which he differentiated from the concept of the more traditional terminology ''sex role''.  This grew out of his studies of hermaphrodites.  According to Money, the genitalia and erotic sexual roles were now, by his definition, to be included under the more general term "gender role" including all the non-genital and non-erotic activities that are defined by the conventions of society to apply to males or to females.

In his studies of hermaphrodites, Money found that there are six variables that define sex.  While in the average person all six would line up unequivocally as either all "male" or "female", in hermaphrodites any one or more than one of these could be inconsistent with the others, leading to various kinds of anomalies. In his seminal 1955 paper he defined these factors as:&lt;ref name=MHH-1955&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |url= |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=301–19 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# assigned sex and sex of rearing
# external genital morphology
# internal reproductive structures
# hormonal and secondary sex characteristics
# gonadal sex
# chromosomal sex

and added, {{quote|"Patients showing various combinations and permutations of these six sexual variables may be appraised with respect to a seventh variable:
7. Gender role and orientation as male or female, established while growing up."&lt;ref name=MHH-1955 /&gt;}}

He then defined gender role as {{quote|"all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively.  It includes, but is not restricted to sexuality in the sense of eroticism.  Gender role is appraised in relation to the following:  general mannerisms, deportment and demeanor; play preferences and recreational interests; spontaneous topics of talk in unprompted conversation and casual comment; content of dreams, daydreams and fantasies; replies to oblique inquiries and projective tests; evidence of erotic practices, and, finally, the person's own replies to direct inquiry."&lt;ref name=MHH-1955 /&gt;}}

Money made the concept of ''gender'' a broader, more inclusive concept than one of masculine/feminine. For him, gender included not only one's status as a man or a woman, but was also a matter of personal recognition, social assignment, or legal determination; not only on the basis of one's genitalia but also on the basis of somatic and behavioral criteria that go beyond genital differences.

In 1972, Money presented his theories in ''Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl'', a college-level, mainstream textbook. The book featured David Reimer (see below) as an example of gender reassignment.

===''Gay, Straight and In-Between: The Sexology of Erotic Orientation''===
{{format footnotes|date=March 2015}}
{{Confusing section|reason=there are terms in this section that require explanation as they are technical jargon used in Money's theoretical conceptualizing and do not have broad understanding|date=March 2016}}
In this book (Oxford 1988: 116), Money develops a conception of '[[bodymind]],' as a way for scientists, in developing a science about sexuality, to move on from the platitudes of dichotomy between [[nature versus nurture]], innate versus the acquired, biological versus the social, and psychological versus the physiological. He suggests that all of these capitalize on the ancient, pre-Platonic, pre-biblical conception of body versus the mind, and the physical versus the spiritual. In coining the term "bodymind", in this sense, Money wishes to move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology.

Money also develops here (Oxford 1988: 114–119) a view of "Concepts of Determinism," which, transcultural, transhistorical, and universal, all people have in common, sexologically or otherwise. These include pairbondage, troopbondage, abidance, ycleptance, foredoomance, with these coping strategies: adhibition (engagement), inhibition, explication.

Money suggests that the concept of threshold (Oxford 1988: 115) – the release or inhibition of sexual (or other) behavior – is most useful for sex research as a substitute for any concept of motivation. Moreover, it confers the distinct advantage of having continuity and unity to what would otherwise be a highly disparate and varied field of research. It also allows for the classification of sexual behavior. For Money, the concept of threshold has great value because of the wide spectrum to which it applies. "It allows one to think developmentally or longitudinally, in terms of stages or experiences that are programmed serially, or hierarchically, or cybernetically (i.e. regulated by mutual feedback)." (Oxford 1988: 116)

==Controversies==

===Sex reassignment of David Reimer===
{{Main|David Reimer}}
During his professional life, Money was respected as an expert on sexual behavior, especially known for his views that gender was learned rather than innate. However, it was later revealed that his most famous case of [[David Reimer]] was fundamentally flawed.&lt;ref name="Dr. Money And The Boy With No Penis"&gt;[http://documentarystorm.com/health/dr-money-and-the-boy-with-no-penis/ Dr. Money And The Boy With No Penis] Retrieved 24 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, a botched [[circumcision]] left eight-month-old Reimer without a penis. Money persuaded the baby's parents that [[sex reassignment surgery]] would be in Reimer's best interest. At the age of 22 months, Reimer underwent an [[orchidectomy]], in which his testicles were surgically removed. He was reassigned to be raised as female and given the name Brenda. Money further recommended hormone treatment to which the parents agreed. Money then recommended a surgical procedure to create an artificial vagina, which the parents refused. Money published a number of papers reporting the reassignment as successful.

For several years, Money reported on Reimer's progress as the "John/Joan case", describing apparently successful female gender development and using this case to support the feasibility of [[Sex reassignment therapy|sex reassignment]] and [[Sex reassignment surgery|surgical reconstruction]] even in non-[[intersex]] cases. Notes by a former student at Money's laboratory state that, during the yearly follow-up visits, Reimer's parents routinely lied to staff about the success of the procedure. Reimer's twin brother, Brian, later developed [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="bbc-horizon-tv-followup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dr_money_prog_summary.shtml |title=Dr Money and the Boy with No Penis |date=2005 |website=BBC |series=Horizon |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Money argued that media response to the exposé was due to right-wing [[media bias]] and "the antifeminist movement". He said his detractors believed "masculinity and femininity are built into the genes so women should get back to the mattress and the kitchen".&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (24 May 2004).

===Pedophilia opinions===
John Money was critical in debates on [[chronophilia]]s, especially [[pedophilia]]. He stated that both sexual researchers and the public do not make distinctions between affectional pedophilia and [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadistic]] pedophilia. Money asserted that affectional pedophilia was about love and not sex.

{{quote|If I were to see the case of a boy aged ten or eleven who's intensely erotically attracted toward a man in his twenties or thirties, if the relationship is totally mutual, and the bonding is genuinely totally mutual ... then I would not call it pathological in any way.&lt;ref name="paidika"&gt;Interview: John Money. ''PAIDIKA: The Journal of {{Not a typo|Paedophilia}}'', Spring&amp;nbsp;1991, vol.&amp;nbsp;2, no.&amp;nbsp;3, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Story of John / Joan"&gt;Cited online in John Colapinto,[http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall06/yoonh/psy3135/articles/Colapinto_1997_part2.pdf 'The True Story of John / Joan',] ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' December&amp;nbsp;1997: 54–97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Money held the view that affectional pedophilia is caused by a surplus of parental love that became erotic, and is not a behavioral disorder. Rather, he took the position that [[heterosexuality]] is another example of a societal and therefore superficial, ideological concept.&lt;ref name="paidika"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Story of John / Joan"/&gt;

'''Just in sequence''' ('''JIS''') is an inventory strategy that matches [[Just in time (business)|just in time]] (JIT) and complete fit in sequence with variation of assembly line production. Components and parts arrive at a production line right in time as scheduled before they get assembled. Feedback from the manufacturing line is used to coordinate transportation to and from the process area. When implemented successfully, JIS improves a company's [[Return on assets|return on assets (ROA)]], without loss in flexibility, quality or overall efficiency. JIS is mainly implemented with automobile manufacturing.

JIS is sometimes called '''in-line vehicle sequencing''' ('''ILVS''').

== Just In Sequence is Just In Time ==
Just in Sequence (JIS) is just one specialised strategy to achieve [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] (JIT). The process concept of JIT sees buffers at the production line as waste in capital bound. The aim is to eliminate buffers as much as possible at expense of stability when disturbances arise. Just In Sequence is one of the most extreme applications of the concept, where components arrive Just In Time and sequenced for consumption.

The sequencing allows companies to eliminate supply buffers as soon as the quantity in component part buffers necessary is reduced to a minimum. If not sequencing according to scheduled variety of production, all required components must be stocked in buffers. For flexible production lines, such as a modern automotive assembly line, the variety is an option to produce directly on customer orders. As soon as the next order arrives at the work center, the scheduler distributes the supply orders inline with the production sequence of the final production line.

=== Displacement of buffers upwards to suppliers ===

However, with JIS the buffer quantities are displaced upward in material flow to the components suppliers. It is a misinterpretation of JIS to assume that all buffers will be eliminated. Hence just the cost for buffer inventory becomes re-allocated to the producers of the supplies. Sequencing eliminates buffers in the final assembly line by consolidating all similar components into distributed and sequenced buffers, which partly reside on the paths of transportation to final assembly. This strategy thus reduces the line-side inventory buffer. However, the effect is worse when the sequence does not get correctly scheduled upwards or when the transportation line gets congested.

=== Introduction of JIS concepts ===

Just In Sequence processes are typically implemented only after the company has achieved a high degree of competency on Just In Time processes. The first step for the organization is to implement JIT processes to synchronize all manufacturing and material departments inside the plant and to collaborate with suppliers, customers, and sub-contractors to reduce inventory buffers to within a few hours. This process typically uncovers deep manufacturing and logistic issues that are not easy to overcome (see [[Just In Time (business)#Implementation|JIT Implementation]] for more details). The manufacturing company can only benefit from sequencing items once these problems have been resolved successfully and components are delivered Just In Time.

Sequencing can be implemented in a Just In Time supply operation at many levels, bringing ever-higher inventory reduction and financial benefits:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Just In Sequence Process
! Description
! Impact
|-
| '''Pick-to-sequence'''
| Items are picked from an on-site buffer, sequenced, and delivered to production
| Reduces buffers in production area, improving wip and cycle time
|-
| '''Ship-to-sequence''' then &lt;br /&gt;'''Receive-to-sequence'''
| Items are sequenced at the supplier (internal or external), delivered in sequence, and taken directly to the production line
| Reduces the amount of component and semi-finished goods inventory overall in the plant, freeing up cash, and reducing carrying costs
|-
| '''Make-'''&lt;br /&gt;'''Assemble-'''&lt;br /&gt;'''Build-to-sequence'''
| Items are built according to the sequence in which they will be required by the customer or downstream departments
| Reduces the amount of finished goods or semi-finished goods in inventory, freeing up additional cash, and reducing carrying costs
|}

== Implementing JIS concepts ==

Just In Sequence implementations introduce a number of new process requirements on top of Just In Time practices. A production sequence or final assembly sequence must be shared upwards to suppliers and sub-contractors. Feedback to customers must be organized according to the scheduled output to earn all positive financial effects. For these and other reasons, the actual production sequence must be "broadcast" out to all relevant parties once it is firm. This "broadcast" can be done over the phone, paper, email, or other automated IT system. [[EDIFACT|UN/EDIFACT]] supports an [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] message standard called [http://search.unece.org/cgi-bin/query?keys=DELJIT&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 DELJIT] as one standardized way to communicate this information.

Once the sequence is broadcast, each party must immediately take action to deliver sequenced parts in time. In many cases the turn-around time from broadcast to final assembly is less than 2 hours, with some components required in 30 minutes or less. With this time frame, there is little room for errors. In addition, quality inspection and [[poka-yoke]] must be implemented in the sequencing step to guarantee that the sequenced components match the assembly sequence perfectly. In many cases, suppliers must manage periodic sequence reversals, for example, when loading racks into a truck, since the first rack into the truck is the last one to come out. Employees and systems must also properly manage exceptional scenarios, such as re-processing damaged items after initial sequencing, skipping slots for scrapped items, etc. Just In Sequence implementations can only be successful if all of these processes are implemented correctly and all people involved understand what is at stake.

=== Limitations ===
In many manufacturing operations, the actual production sequence cannot be planned ahead of time with enough certainty to enable sequencing. The main reason is that some manufacturing processes require re-work frequently so that a scheduled sequence becomes irrelevant. For example, painting operations in an automotive plant can have re-work levels of up to 20% (USA, Southern Europe).

[[File:Mary Agnes Chase Collecting Plants, Brazil, Image ID 96-548.tif|thumbnail|left|upright|Mary Agnes Chase collecting plants in Brazil, 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_9227 |title=Mary Agnes Chase Collecting Plants, Brazil |work=Smithsonian Institution Archives |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Chase was born in [[Iroquois County, Illinois]] and held no formal education beyond grammar school. Chase made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois.&lt;ref name="SIA" /&gt; She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North and South America. Her field books from 1897 to 1959 are archived in the [[Smithsonian Institution Archives]].

In 1893, Mary had visited the Colombian Exposition in Chicago with her nephew, who was a botanist, and this had inspired her to study plants in Northern Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Chase, Mary Agnes (1869-1963)|url=http://plants.jstor.org/stable/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000001409|language=en|publisher=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] under [[Charles Frederick Millspaugh]], where her work was featured in two museum publications: [http://www.worldcat.org/title/plantae-utowanae/oclc/81635904 ''Plantae Utowanae''] (1900) and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/plantae-yucatanae-regionis-antillanae-plants-of-the-insular-coastal-and-plain-regions-of-the-peninsula-of-yucatan-mexico-1-compositae/oclc/165891529 ''Plantae Yucatanae''] (1904).&lt;ref name="notewomen"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sicherman |editor-first=Barbara |title=Notable American women: The modern period: A biographical dictionary |year=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=146–148 |author=Carol Hurd Green, ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Chase joined the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) as a [[botanical illustrator]] and eventually became a scientific assistant in [[Agrostology|systematic agrostology]] (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under [[A. S. Hitchcock|Albert Spear Hitchcock]]. Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing (''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/north-american-species-of-panicum/oclc/3764987 The North American Species of Panicum]'' [1910]).&lt;ref name="SIA" /&gt;

Following Hitchcock's death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[United States National Museum]] (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939 but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963.

==Women's Suffrage Movement==

Chase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition's benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men.&lt;ref name=AfterVote&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Katherine H. |title=After the vote was won: The later achievements of fifteen suffragists |year=2010 |publisher=McFarland |pages=73–74 |author2=Michael L.

In 1918, she was arrested at the [[Silent Sentinels]] rally picketing the [[White House]]; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed.&lt;ref name=AfterVote /&gt; The USDA accused her of "conduct unbecoming a government employee," but Hitchcock helped her keep her job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henson |first=Pamela M. |year=2003 |title='What holds the earth together': Agnes Chase and American agrostology |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=36 |issue=3 | doi = 10.1023/b:hist.0000004568.11609.2d |pages=437–460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18979">'''Medical Neutrality''' refers to a principle of noninterference with medical services in times of armed conflict and civil unrest: [[physicians]] must be allowed to care for the sick and wounded, and soldiers must receive care regardless of their political affiliations; all parties must refrain from attacking and misusing medical facilities, transport, and personnel. Concepts comprising the principles of medical neutrality derive from [[international human rights law]], [[medical ethics]] and [[humanitarian law]].  Medical neutrality may be thought of as a kind of social contract that obligates societies to protect medical personnel in both times of war and peace, and obligates medical personnel to treat all individuals regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or political affiliation.  Violations of medical neutrality constitute crimes outlined in the [[Geneva Conventions]].

==Historical Background==
The principle of medical neutrality has roots in many social traditions. 
*The Hippocratic Oath, which requires physicians to practice medicine ethically, dates back to the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Edelstein. ''The Hippocratic oath: text, translation and interpretation''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The idea of ‘do no harm’ has histories in “Jewish and Islamic, as well as Chinese and Indian medicine”&lt;ref&gt;Sheila McLean, ''First Do No Harm: Law, Ethics, and Healthcare'', at 83 (Ashgate Publishing, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Geneva Conventions]] (the core of international humanitarian law, supported and protected by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]):
**The [[First Geneva Convention]] was written by Henri Dunant in response to seeing such the difficulty of treating wounded soldiers at the Battle of Solferino.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sperry | first = C.S. | title = The Revision of the Geneva Convention, 1906 | journal = Proceedings of the American Political Science Association | year = 1906 |volume = 3 | page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**The first and the following [[Geneva Conventions]] created the [[Red Cross]], outline the protections of medical personnel in times of war, codify the protections of citizens, soldiers, medical personnel, etc. 
**The [[First Geneva Convention]] states that there should be no “obstacle to the humanitarian activities”  and that wounded and sick “shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.”&lt;ref name="Convention I"&gt;”Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field. Geneva, 12 August 1949.” International Committee of the Red Cross. http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/365?OpenDocument. Retrieved February 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
**Article 19 demands that medical units, i.e. hospitals and mobile medical facilities, may in no circumstances be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;”Article 19, First Geneva Convention.” Library of Congress. https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/GC_1949-I.pdf. Retrieved February 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
**The [[Declaration of Geneva]] was created as an amendment to the Hippocratic Oath in 1948, a response to the human experimentation on Nazi prisoners.

==Violations of Medical Neutrality==
Medical neutrality is violated when health care professionals, facilities, or patients come under attack, or when medical professionals are not allowed to provide treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. "The Principle of Medical Neutrality." http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/multimedia/principle-of-medical-neutrality.html. Retrieved February 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include:&lt;ref name="Convention I"/&gt;
*Attacks on hospitals
*Attacks on patients
*Attacks on medical personnel
*Attacks on medical transport
*Misuse of medical facilities
*Breaches of medical ethics by medical personnel
*Using the hospital/Medical facilities in order to attack, fire/ fire rockets e.j., to civilians from the medical facilities
*Using the medical facilities in order to house weapons or soldiers
*Using the medical facilities for purposes other than medical assistance and/or aid to the public

==Recorded Historical Violations of Medical Neutrality==

===Afghanistan (2015)===
On 3 October 2015, U.S. airstrikes killed 42 people and destroyed the MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières - Doctors Without Borders) trauma hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan (See [[Kunduz hospital airstrike|main article]]). Many patients in the hospital burned alive in their beds as a US AC-130 gunship made multiple passes firing upon the hospital from overhead. MSF's request for an independent inquiry was never honoured. The U.S. military investigated itself, eventually taking disciplinary action against a dozen servicemembers. No criminal prosecutions followed. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msf.org/en/article/one-year-after-kunduz-battlefields-without-doctors-wars-without-limits "One year after Kunduz: Battlefields without doctors, in wars without limits"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/29/kunduz-hospital-attack-msf-us-military-charges "Kunduz hospital attack: MSF's questions remain as US military seeks no charges"], ''The Guardian'', 29 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahrain===
The Bahraini government’s crackdown on the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahrain uprising]] in 2011 and 2012 included extensive violations of medical neutrality. An investigative report released by [[Physicians for Human Rights]] revealed that many doctors were attacked or incarcerated. Furthermore, Bahraini security forces have seized control of medical facilities, prevented patients from receiving treatment, misused ambulance services, and violently interrogated wounded patients.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights, Do No Harm: A Call for Bahrain to End Systematic Attacks on Doctors and Patients, http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/issues/persecution-of-health-workers/bahrain/&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2011, 20 medical workers in Bahrain were [[Bahrain health worker trials|sentenced]] to up to 15 years in prison for treating protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/world/middleeast/bahrain-court-hands-down-harsh-sentences-to-doctors-and-protesters.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig "Bahrain Court Hands Down Harsh Sentences to Doctors and Protesters"].

Retrieved February 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt (2011)===
In 2011, during political unrest, state security forces directly attacked protestors and field clinics, injuring and killing numerous people.  A state security officer even dressed himself as a doctor and administered fatal shots to those injured in a field clinic outside of Tahrir Square.{{Failed verification|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref name= Tahrir&gt;Amani Massoud, A brief history of field hospitals in Tahrir Square, AlMasry Alyoum, November 27, 2011, http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/521861.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical supplies were confiscated by “military officers and field hospital tents were burned down during a Tahrir raid.”&lt;ref name= Tahrir /&gt;

===El Salvador (1980-1992)===
In the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], many field clinics were attacked by guerillas. Patients were commonly abducted from hospitals, and government forces greatly limited the movements of health workers. Medical transports were also attacked, in some cases resulting in the deaths of medical workers.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. “El Salvador: Health Care Under Siege”. https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/el-salvador-health-care-under-siege.pdf.

In June 2008, Iranian authorities detained [[Kamiar and Arash Alaei incident|Dr. Arash Alaei and Dr. Kamiar Alaei]], two well-known Iranian physicians and leaders in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The physicians, who are brothers, were held in Tehran’s notorious [[Evin prison]] for over six months without being charged or tried.  On December 31, 2008, a one-day, closed-door trial was held, in which the brothers were tried as conspirators working with an “enemy government” to overthrow the government of Iran.

===Panama (1988)===
Civil unrest and demonstrations began in Panama in June 1987. During the unrest, human rights groups such as [[Physicians for Human Rights]] documented a variety of human rights abuses and violations of medical neutrality. The military blocked access to hospitals and interfered with provision of medical care, took control of ambulance services for military purposes, and interrogated wounded patients.  In addition, Panamanian physicians were kidnapped, beaten, and tortured for speaking out against government policies which prevented them from providing their patients with adequate care.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. “Panama 1987: Health Consequences of Police and Military Actions.” https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/panama-1987-health-cons.pdf.

A '''medium of instruction''' (plural: usually '''mediums of instruction''', but the archaic '''media of instruction''' is still used by some) is a [[language]] used in teaching. It may or may not be the [[official language]] of the country or territory. If the [[first language]] of students is different from the official language, it may be used as the medium of instruction for part or all of schooling. [[Bilingual education|Bilingual or multilingual education]] may involve the use of more than one language of instruction. UNESCO considers that "providing education in a child's [[mother tongue]]  is indeed a critical issue".&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001540/154007e.pdf Results of the 7th consultation of member states on the implementation of the Convention and Recommendation against discrimination in education.

'''Meninism''' is term used which has been used to describe various groups, including the [[men's rights movement]], and [[Pro-feminism|male feminists]]. The term is sometimes used sincerely to challenge social issues facing men, and sometimes satirically or semi-satirically as a word-play on [[feminism]]. Members of these groups are known as '''meninists'''.

==History==
The term meninism was used in the early 2000s to describe [[Pro-feminism|male feminists]] who opposed [[sexism]] and supported women's right for equality in [[society]], [[politics]] and at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MENININST: MEN SUPPORTING THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/links/men.htm|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=feminist.com|date=8 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kay|first1=Tom Zatar|title=Out if the Box|date=2003|publisher=Xlibris|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=1-4134-1757-4|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldrick-Jones|first1=Amanda|title=Men who Believe in Feminism|date=2002|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-96822-7|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next decade, the term was used on [[social media]] to make jokes which mocked and criticised [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zand|first1=Benjamin|title=#BBCtrending: Feminism v Meninism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25462758|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daubney|first1=Martin|title=Will 2015 be the year of meninism?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11308455/Will-2015-be-the-year-of-meninism.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[BBC]] reported that the hashtag #MeninistTwitter was being used on [[Twitter]], first to share jokes about [[feminism]], but later to share more serious difficulties facing modern men.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; In 2015, Nolan Feeney of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that those who used meninist hashtags "generally fall in two camps: people who use the term to call out ways they believe they’ve been victimised by feminism, and people who make fun of the first group for not understanding what feminism means in the first place".&lt;ref name=time /&gt; Antifeminism is also associated with terms like Meninism

==Meaning==
The term has partially evolved into a movement promoting awareness of the issues which the movement perceives as affecting men, opposition to the perceived oppression men face in the 21st century, opposition to the way some perceive that men are victimised by modern-day feminism, and occasionally violence against men.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feeney|first1=Nolan|title=This Is What Happens When You Show Off Your 'Meninist' T-Shirt|url=http://time.com/3673614/meninist-meninism-t-shirts-hashtag/|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=TIME|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women also identify as meninists.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=metro&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Alison|title=Women disillusioned with feminism are turning to meninism|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/25/women-disillusioned-with-feminism-are-turning-to-meninism-5265103/|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Metro|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Daubney]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', some meninists have used the term to discuss serious issues affecting men, such as [[domestic violence against men]]; [[fathers' rights]] and [[divorce]] issues; and disproportionate male prison sentences, [[suicide]] rates, and rates of homelessness.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; According to Radhika Sanghani of ''The Telegraph'', the hashtag is most commonly used on Twitter to mock feminism, but has also been used as a way to draw attention to men's issues, similar to "The Red Pill" forum on [[Reddit]]. Sanghani says that the movement's reaction to feminism is based more on the label than feminism's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghani|first1=Radhika|title=Feminists v Meninists: The labels we could all afford to ditch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11380282/Feminists-v-Meninists-The-labels-we-could-all-afford-ditch.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abigail James writing for ''Catholic Online'' said that while meninism raises legitimate issues which should be taken seriously, its heart is based on a misinterpretation of the meaning of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Abigail|title=Feminism takes a sharp hit as men fight back with Meninism|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/family/story.php?id=58102|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Catholic Online|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminism is also associated with the Meninist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lin|first=Jie Liang|title=Antifeminism Online: MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way)|date=2017|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv1xxrxw.9|work=Digital Environments|pages=77–96|series=Ethnographic Perspectives Across Global Online and Offline Spaces|publisher=Transcript Verlag|isbn=9783837634976|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

Mintified, an India-based media website, started the #BlameOneNotAll hashtag to discourage generalisations of men. According to Victoria Richards of ''[[The Independent]]'', the campaign was  part of the meninist movement. The campaign received backlash for shifting focus away from the victims of rape and implying that basic decency should be rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richards|first1=Victoria|title='Don't blame all men for rape' campaign backfires spectacularly|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/blameonenotall-the-meninist-rape-campaign-that-spectacularly-backfired-10278297.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion piece for ''[[The Economic Times]]'' Shephali Bhatt criticised the use of the movement and [[International Men's Day]] to sell deodorant, saying "...for an initiative to become a social phenomena, it needs to be rooted in truth. And the truth is that [men are] a sufficiently privileged gender, comparatively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhatt|first1=Shephali|title=How meninism campaigns can explain gender inequality against men better|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-11-26/news/56490134_1_international-men-harsh-agarwal-feminism|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Economic Times|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hashtags have also been used for T-shirts and similar, with self-portraits of people wearing the clothes widely shared on social media. Several outlets reported that the clothes and images were widely mocked, and often Photoshopped sarcastically.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;&lt;ref name=metro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warren|first1=Rossalyn|title=People Are Wearing Anti-Feminist "Meninist" T-Shirts And The Internet Has Responded Amusingly|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/people-are-wearing-anti-feminist-meninist-t-shirts-and-the-i|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[Buzzfeed]]|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Lucia|title=#Meninist T-Shirts Got a Photoshop Makeover Thanks to Twitter, and It's Glorious|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/59653-meninist-t-shirts-got-a-photoshop-makeover-thanks-to-twitter-and-its-glorious|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[Bustle.com]]|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral philosophy includes moral [[ontology]], which is the origin of morals; and [[moral epistemology]], which studies the knowledge of morals. Different systems of expressing morality have been proposed, including [[Deontological ethics|deontological ethical]] systems which adhere to a set of established rules, and [[Normative ethics|normative]] ethical systems which consider the merits of actions themselves. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the [[Golden Rule]], which states that: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself."&lt;ref name = "Flew"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy | publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]] | year = 1979 | location = London | page = 134 | isbn = 9780333262047|quote=The maxim 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'.

He posits that it "express[es] the essence of a universal morality." The rationale for this distinction occupies much of his book ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937). {{cite book | last = Stace | first = Walter T. | title = The Concept of Morals | publisher = The MacMillan Company; reprinted by Peter Smith Publisher Inc, January 1990 | date = 1937 | location = New York | page = 136 | isbn = 0-8446-2990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immorality]] is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is [[good]] or right), while [[amorality]] is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards or principles.&lt;ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Ethics&lt;!--'Morality and ethics' redirects here--&gt;===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] introduced the [[categorical imperative]]: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law".]]
{{Main|Ethics}}
{{see also|Sittlichkeit}}

Ethics (also known as moral philosophy) is the branch of [[philosophy]] which addresses questions of morality. The word "ethics" is "commonly used interchangeably with 'morality,' and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual."&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially [[deontological ethics]], sometimes distinguish between ethics and morals: "Although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of [[Immanuel Kant]], based on notions such as duty, obligation, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] of conduct, reserving ethics for the more [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a [[virtue]], and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=Simon Blackburn|last = Blackburn|first = Simon |title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]|edition = 2nd|date = 2008|page = 240|isbn = 978-0199541430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive and normative===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
In its descriptive sense, "morality" refers to [[Value (personal and cultural)|personal or cultural values]], [[code of conduct|codes of conduct]] or social [[mores]] from a society that provides these codes of conduct in which it applies and is accepted by an individual. It does not connote objective claims of right or wrong, but only refers to that which is considered right or wrong. [[Descriptive ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.&lt;ref name="Gert"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/morality-definition/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Gert|first=Bernard|last2=Gert|first2=Joshua|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its [[normative]] sense, "morality" refers to whatever (if anything) is ''actually'' right or wrong, which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures. [[Normative ethics]] is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.&lt;ref name="Gert"/&gt;

===Realism and anti-realism===
Philosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality (that is, theories of [[meta-ethics]]) are broadly divided into two classes:
* [[Moral realism]] is the class of theories which hold that there are true moral statements that report objective moral facts. For example, while they might concede that forces of social [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] significantly shape individuals' "moral" decisions, they deny that those cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[convention (norm)|customs]] define morally right behavior. This may be the philosophical view propounded by [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]], however not all moral realists accept that position (e.g. [[ethical non-naturalism|ethical non-naturalists]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Chapouthier|Chapouthier, Georges]], "To what extent is moral judgment natural?", ''European Review'' (GB), 2004, 12(2): 179–83&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moral [[anti-realism]], on the other hand, holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts. Instead, they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of objective moral facts ([[error theory]]); claims about subjective attitudes rather than objective facts ([[ethical subjectivism]]); or else not attempts to describe the world at all but rather something else, like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command ([[non-cognitivism]]).

Some forms of non-cognitivism and ethical subjectivism, while considered anti-realist in the robust sense used here, are considered realist in the sense synonymous with [[moral universalism]]. For example, [[universal prescriptivism]] is a universalist form of non-cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives, and [[divine command theory]] and [[ideal observer theory]] are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being, respectively.

==Anthropology==

===Tribal and territorial===
[[Celia Green]] made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, Celia (2004). ''Letters from Exile: Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Chapters I–XX.&lt;/ref&gt; She characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person's territory, including his or her property and dependents, which is not to be damaged or interfered with. Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and 'flexible', whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s '[[categorical imperative]]' and [[Norman Geisler|Geisler]]'s [[graded absolutism]]. Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.

===In-group and out-group===
{{main|Ingroups and outgroups}}
Some observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an "[[in-group]]" (the individual and those they believe to be of the same group) or an "out-group" (people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules). Some biologists, anthropologists and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival. This belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;T.R. Shultz, M. Hartshorn, and A. Kaznatcheev. [http://141.14.165.6/CogSci09/papers/500/ Why is ethnocentrism more common than humanitarianism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327152454/http://141.14.165.6/CogSci09/papers/500/ |date=2012-03-27 }} Proceedings of the 31st annual conference of the cognitive science society, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In simulations this discrimination can result in both unexpected cooperation towards the in-group and irrational hostility towards the out-group.&lt;ref&gt;Kaznatcheev, A. (2010, March). [http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~akazna/kaznatcheev20100910.pdf Robustness of ethnocentrism to changes in inter-personal interactions]. In ''Complex Adaptive Systems – AAAI Fall Symposium''.Butiz wintrades&lt;/ref&gt; Gary R. Johnson and V.S. Falger have argued that [[nationalism]] and [[patriotism]] are forms of this in-group/out-group boundary. Jonathan Haidt has noted&lt;ref name = haidt&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z | pmid = | title = When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions that Liberals may not Recognize | year = 2007 | last1 = Haidt | first1 = Jonathan | last2 = Graham | first2 = Jesse | journal = Social Justice Research | volume = 20 | pages = 98–116 |url = http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.graham.2007.when-morality-opposes-justice.pub041.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; that experimental observation indicating an in-group criterion provides one moral foundation substantially used by [[conservative]]s, but far less so by [[Liberalism|liberals]].

===Comparing cultures===
Peterson and Seligman&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Christopher, and Martin E. P. Seligman. ''Character Strengths and Virtues''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; approach the anthropological view looking across cultures, geo-cultural areas and across millennia. They conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined. The major virtues they identified include ''wisdom / knowledge; courage; [[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]]; justice; temperance; and transcendence''. Each of these includes several divisions. For instance ''humanity'' includes ''[[love]]'', ''[[kindness]]'', and ''social intelligence''.

[[Fons Trompenaars]], author of ''Did the Pedestrian Die?'', tested members of different cultures with various [[moral dilemma]]s. One of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend, a passenger riding in the car, lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian. Trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations, from none to definite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAYKAQAAMAAJ|title=Did the Pedestrian Die: Insights from the World's Greatest Culture Guru|last=Trompenaars|first=Fons|date=2003-03-14|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781841124360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated in ''Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century'', "One of the important objectives of this book is to blend harmoniously the fine souls regarding conduct in the Eastern and the Western cultures, to take the result as the source and then to create newer and better conduct principles to suit the human society of the new century, and to introduce a lot of Chinese fine conduct spirits to the Western world. It is hoped that this helps solve lots of problems the human society of the 21st century faces, including (but not limited to the Eastern and the Western cultures) what a single culture cannot."

==Evolution==
{{See also|Altruism#Evolutionary explanations|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}

The development of modern morality is a process closely tied to [[sociocultural evolution]]. Some [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], particularly [[Sociobiology|sociobiologists]], believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through [[group selection]] (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved "pro-social" emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors.

On this understanding, moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically-driven behaviors which encourage human [[cooperation]]. Biologists contend that all social animals, from ants to elephants, have modified their behaviors, by restraining immediate [[selfishness]] in order to improve their evolutionary fitness. Human morality, although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals, is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group's cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals' fitness.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this view, moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction ([[inclusive fitness]]). Examples: the [[maternal bond]] is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring; the [[Westermarck effect]], where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction, underpins [[Incest taboo|taboos against incest]] because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as [[inbreeding]].

&lt;!-- kinship altruism theory --&gt;
&lt;!-- handicap altruism theory --&gt;
&lt;!-- reputation theory --&gt;
&lt;!-- reciprocity theory --&gt;
The phenomenon of [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality. Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, some [[vampire bat]]s fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus. Bats that did eat will then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)

Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce (2009) have argued that morality is a suite of behavioral capacities likely shared by all mammals living in complex social groups (e.g., wolves, coyotes, elephants, dolphins, rats, chimpanzees). They define morality as "a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups." This suite of behaviors includes empathy, reciprocity, altruism, cooperation, and a sense of fairness.&lt;ref&gt;Bekoff, Marc and Jessica Pierce ''Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals'' (Chicago, The University of Chicago Press 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In related work, it has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show [[empathy]] for each other in a wide variety of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connell |first= Sanjida |date=July 1995|title= Empathy in chimpanzees: Evidence for theory of mind? |journal= Primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 397–410|issn= 0032-8332 |url=  |quote=|doi= 10.1007/BF02382862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social politics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals|last = de Waal|first = Frans|date = 1997|publisher = Harvard University Press |isbn = 978-0674356610}}&lt;/ref&gt; prototypical of our own tendencies for [[gossip]] and [[reputation]] management.

Other theories are that increasing complexity was simply a correlate of increasing group size and brain size, and in particular the development of [[theory of mind]] abilities.

==Moral cognition==

Moral cognition refers to cognitive processes that allow a person to act or decide in morally permissible ways. It consists of several domain-general cognitive processes, ranging from perception of a morally-salient stimuli to reasoning when faced with a moral dilemma. While it’s important to mention that there is not a single cognitive faculty dedicated exclusively to moral cognition, characterizing the contributions of domain-general processes to moral behavior is a critical scientific endeavor to understand how morality works and how it can be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Liane |last2=Dungan |first2=James |title=Where in the brain is morality? Everywhere and maybe nowhere |journal=Social Neuroscience |date=January 2012 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1080/17470919.2011.569146|pmid=21590587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists investigate the inputs to these cognitive processes and their interactions, as well as how these contribute to moral behavior by running controlled experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yoder |first1=Keith J. |last2=Decety |first2=Jean |title=The neuroscience of morality and social decision-making |journal=Psychology, Crime &amp; Law |date=12 December 2017 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=279–295 |doi=10.1080/1068316X.2017.1414817}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments putatively moral versus nonmoral stimuli are compared to each other, while controlling for other variables such as content or working memory load. Often, the differential neural response to specifically moral statements or scenes, are examined using functional neuroimaging experiments.

Critically, the specific cognitive processes that are involved depend on the prototypical situation that a person encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monin |first1=Benoît |last2=Pizarro |first2=David A. |last3=Beer |first3=Jennifer S. |title=Deciding versus reacting: Conceptions of moral judgment and the reason-affect debate. |journal=Review of General Psychology |date=2007 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=99–111 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, while situations that require an active decision on a moral dilemma may require active reasoning, an immediate reaction to a shocking moral violation may involve quick, affect-laden processes. Nonetheless certain cognitive skills such as being able to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, emotions to oneself, and to others is a common feature of a broad range of prototypical situations. In line with this, a meta-analysis found overlapping activity between moral emotion and moral reasoning tasks, suggesting a shared neural network for both tasks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Spreng |first2=R. Nathan |title=Contextual and Perceptual Brain Processes Underlying Moral Cognition: A Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Moral Reasoning and Moral Emotions |journal=PLoS ONE |date=4 February 2014 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=e87427 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0087427|pmid=24503959 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...987427S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this meta-analaysis, however, also demonstrated that the processing of moral input is affected by task demands.

==Neuroscience==
{{anchor|Neuroscience of morality}}
{{see also|Science of morality}}
The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated by a quantitative large-scale meta-analysis of the brain activity changes reported in the moral neuroscience literature.,&lt;ref name = Bzdok&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/a8926q746t212727/ |title=Bzdok, D. et al.

This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons' points of view and to grasping others' feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.&lt;ref name = Bzdok /&gt;

===Brain areas===

An essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Gurvit |first2=Hakan |last3=Spreng |first3=R.

The explicit making of moral right and wrong judgments coincides with activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] (VMPC) while intuitive reactions to situations containing implicit moral issues activates the [[temporoparietal junction]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harenski | first1 = CL | last2 = Antonenko | first2 = O | last3 = Shane | first3 = MS | last4 = Kiehl | first4 = KA.  | year = 2010 | title = A functional imaging investigation of moral deliberation and moral intuition | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 2707–16 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.062 | pmid = 19878727 | pmc = 4270295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Stimulation of the VMPC by [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]], has been shown to inhibit the ability of human subjects to take into account intent when forming a moral judgment. According to this investigation, TMS did not disrupt participants' ability to make any moral
judgment. On the contrary, moral judgments of intentional harms and non-harms were unaffected by TMS to either the RTPJ or the control site; presumably, however, people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action's harmful outcome but the agent's intentions and beliefs. So why
were moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by TMS to the RTPJ? One possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time. On the basis of this view, when information concerning the agent's belief is unavailable or degraded, the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other
morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). Alternatively, following TMS to the RTPJ, moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account. On either account, when belief information is degraded or unavailable, moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). For intentional harms and non-harms, however, the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as the intention. Thus, the researchers suggest that TMS to the RTPJ disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms, but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms, in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Liane |last2= Camprodon |first2= Joan Albert |last3= Hauser |first3= Marc |last4= Pascual-Leone |first4= Alvaro |last5= Saxe |first5= Rebecca |year= 2010 |title= Disruption of the right temporoparietal junction with transcranial magnetic stimulation reduces the role of beliefs in moral judgments |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] |volume= 107 |issue= 15 |pages= 6753–58 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0914826107 |pmid=20351278 |pmc=2872442|bibcode= 2010PNAS..107.6753Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly VMPC-impaired persons will judge an action purely on its outcome and are unable to take into account the intent of that action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= Liane |last2= Bechara |first2= Antoine |last3= Tranel |first3= Daniel |last4= Damasio |first4= Hanna |last5= Hauser |first5= Marc |last6= Damasio |first6= Antonio |year= 2010 |title= Damage to ventromedial prefrontal cortex impairs judgment of harmful intent |journal= Neuron |volume= 65 |issue= 6 |pages= 845–51 |doi= 10.1016/j.neuron.2010.03.003 |pmid=20346759 |pmc=3085837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mirror neurons===
{{main|Mirror neurons}}
Mirror neurons are neurons in the brain that fire when another person is observed doing a certain action. The neurons fire in imitation of the action being observed, causing the same muscles to act minutely in the observer as are acting grossly in the person actually performing the action. Research on mirror neurons, since their discovery in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = Giacomo | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1996 | title = Premotor cortex and the recognition of motor actions | url = | journal = Cognitive Brain Research | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 131–41 | doi=10.1016/0926-6410(95)00038-0| pmid = 8713554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that they may have a role to play not only in action understanding, but also in emotion sharing [[empathy]].

[[File:Kohlberg Model of Moral Development.svg|thumb|[[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] Model of Moral Development]]

In modern [[moral psychology]], morality is considered to change through personal development. A number of psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals, usually going through stages of different morals. [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Elliot Turiel]] have cognitive-developmental approaches to [[moral development]]; to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains. In the [[Ethics of care]] approach established by [[Carol Gilligan]], moral development occurs in the context of caring, mutually responsive relationships  which are based on [[interdependence]], particularly in parenting but also in social relationships generally.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan and Kohlberg: "Implications for Moral Theory" Author(s): Lawrence A. Blum
Source: ''Ethics'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (Apr., 1988), pp. 472–91&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology|Social psychologists]] such as [[Martin Hoffman]] and [[Jonathan Haidt]] emphasize social and emotional development based on biology, such as [[empathy]]. Moral identity theorists, such as [[William Damon]] and [[Mordechai Nisan]], see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self-identity that is defined by moral purposes: this moral self-identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes. Of historical interest in psychology are the theories of [[psychoanalyst]]s such as [[Sigmund Freud]], who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the [[super-ego]] as guilt-shame avoidance.

Because we are naturally prone to be empathic and moral, we have a sense of responsibility to pursue moral purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Decety | first = Jean | year = 2008 | title = Study shows Children are naturally prone to be empathic and moral | url = http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2008/07/11/children-are-naturally-prone-be-empathic-and-moral-university-chicago-study-shows | journal = University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J | last2 = Michalska | first2 = KJ | last3 = Akitsuki | first3 = Y | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the Pain?

Such behaviors jeopardize our moral self-image; however, when we engage in immoral behaviors we still feel as though we are moral individuals. ''[[Moral self-licensing]]'' attempts to explain this phenomenon and proposes that self-image security increases our likelihood to engage in immoral behavior. When our moral self-image is threatened, we can gain confidence from our past moral behavior. The more confident we are, the less we will worry about our future behavior which actually increases the likelihood that we will engage in immoral behaviors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Monin | first1 = B | last2 = Miller | first2 = D.

As an alternative to viewing morality as an individual trait, some sociologists as well as social- and discursive psychologists have taken upon themselves to study the ''in-vivo'' aspects of morality by examining how persons conduct themselves in social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bergmann Jörg |  year = 1998 | title = Introduction:Morality in discourse | url = | journal = Research on Language and Social Interaction | volume = 31 | issue = 3/4| pages = 279–74 | doi = 10.1080/08351813.1998.9683594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Bergmann "Veiled morality: Notes on discretion in psychiatry."

==Politics==
If morality is the answer to the question 'how ought we to live' at the individual level, [[politics]] can be seen as addressing the same question at the social level, though the political sphere raises additional problems and challenges.&lt;ref&gt;See Weber, Eric Thomas. 2011. ''[http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/morality-leadership-and-public-policy-9781441144812/ Morality, Leadership, and Public Policy]'' (London: Continuum).&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore unsurprising that evidence has been found of a relationship between attitudes in morality and politics. [[Jonathan Haidt]] and [[Jesse Graham]] have studied the differences between [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[conservatism|conservatives]], in this regard.&lt;ref name=haidt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/video/conference/2007/haidt |title=Morality: 2012: Online Only Video |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousintersection.org/?p=1445 |title=Why conservatives and liberals talk past each other on moral issues. |publisher=Dangerous Intersection |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt found that Americans who identified as liberals tended to value care and fairness higher than loyalty, respect and purity. Self-identified conservative Americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more. Both groups gave care the highest over-all weighting, but conservatives valued fairness the lowest, whereas liberals valued purity the lowest. Haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the United States can be traced to geo-historical factors, with conservatism strongest in closely knit, ethnically homogenous communities, in contrast to [[port]]-cities, where the cultural mix is greater, thus requiring more liberalism.

Group morality develops from shared [[concept]]s and [[belief]]s and is often codified to regulate behavior within a [[culture]] or community. Various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral. Individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess "moral fiber", whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate. The continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of [[Cistercian]] reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Dowager Empress]] in the subjugation of China to European interests). Within [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements, there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality, regardless of its content.
Political Morality is also relevant to the behavior internationally of national governments, and to the support they receive from their host population. [[Noam Chomsky]] states that&lt;ref name="Zmag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/11934 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113102044/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/11934 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-13 |title=Terror and Just Response |publisher=ZNet |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |date=2002-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="counterpunch"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/schivone08032007.html &lt;!-- alternate: http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20070803.htm --&gt; |title=On Responsibility, War Guilt and Intellectuals |last=Schivone |first=Gabriel Matthew |date=2007-08-03 |journal=[[CounterPunch]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004204116/http://www.counterpunch.org/schivone08032007.html |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }} Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... if we adopt the principle of universality : if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us. Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others—more stringent ones, in fact—plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong, good and evil.

In fact, one of the, maybe the most, elementary of moral principles is that of universality, that is, If something's right for me, it's right for you; if it's wrong for you, it's wrong for me. Any moral code that is even worth looking at has that at its core somehow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Ethics in religion|Morality and religion}} {{See also|Divine command theory|Divine law|Morality without religion|Religious law|Secular ethics}}

Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not depend upon religion although for some this is "an almost automatic assumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Rachels| first1 = (ed) James | last2 =  Rachels | first2 = (ed) Stuart | title = The Elements of Moral Philosophy | publisher = McGraw-Hill| edition = 7 | year = 2011| location = New York| page = | isbn = 0-078-03824-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'', religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress| first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie| first2 = (ed) John  | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press| edition = | year = 1986| location = Philadelphia| page = 401| isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positions ===
Within the wide range of moral traditions, religious value systems co-exist with contemporary secular frameworks such as [[consequentialism]], [[freethought]], [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], and others. There are many types of religious value systems. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]], define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. Other religions spanning [[pantheistic]] to [[nontheistic]] tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for to determine if an action is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Morgan, "Buddhism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages= 61, 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further disparity between the values of religious traditions is pointed out by [[Barbara Stoler Miller]], who states that, in Hinduism, "practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and [[egalitarianism]], this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last=  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher= Random House|location= New York|isbn= 0-553-21365-2 |page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in [[Hinduism]], which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski, "Hinduism."

Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, "the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious [[piety]] and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hume]], "The Natural History of Religion."

Religious value systems can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]]. For example, [[Simon Blackburn]] states that "apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to Christianity, he states that the "[[Bible]] can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notes morally suspect themes in the Bible's [[New Testament]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|E|e|none}} Christian [[apologists]] address Blackburn's viewpoints&lt;ref name="colley1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Colley|first=Caleb|title=Is Christianity a Threat to Ethics?|url=http://espanol.apologeticspress.org/articles/240427|publisher=Apologetics Press|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and construe that [[Halachah|Jewish laws]] in the [[Jewish Bible]] showed the evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treating slaves as persons and not property.&lt;ref name="enrichmentjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/201102/201102_108_slavery.htm.cfm |title=Does the Old Testament Endorse Slavery?

These values can be resources for finding common ground between believers and nonbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;See Weber, Eric Thomas.

=== Empirical analyses ===
A number of studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries, and the overall relationship between faith and [[crime]] is unclear.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} A 2001 review of studies on this topic found "The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime."&lt;ref name = baier/&gt; Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book, ''Society without God'', based on studies conducted during a 14-month period in Scandinavia in 2005-2006, notes that [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], "which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world", enjoy "among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Society Without God: What the Least Religious Nations Can Tell Us about Contentment|edition= |last= Zuckerman|first= Phil|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-8147-9714-3|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|C|c|none}}

Dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by [[Gregory S. Paul]] published in the ''Journal of Religion and Society'' stated that, "In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies," and "In all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows" with the exceptions being the United States (with a high religiosity level) and "theistic" Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html |journal=Journal of Religion and Society|title=Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous Democracies: A First Look|first=Gregory S.|last=Paul|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year =2005 |volume =7|pages=4–5, 8, 10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214113448/http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html |archivedate=2011-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|d|none}}  In a response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;Gary F.

On April 26, 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects' [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social]] sentiments were published in the ''[[Social Psychological and Personality Science]]'' journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people also had lower scores when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140035.htm "Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers"].

'''Motion perception''' is the process of inferring the speed and direction of elements in a scene based on [[visual perception|visual]], [[Vestibular_system|vestibular]] and [[proprioceptive]] inputs. Although this process appears straightforward to most observers, it has proven to be a difficult problem from a computational perspective, and extraordinarily difficult to explain in terms of [[neural]] processing.

Motion perception is studied by many disciplines, including [[psychology]] (i.e. [[visual perception]]), [[neurology]], [[neurophysiology]], [[engineering]], and [[computer science]].

==Neuropsychology==
The inability to perceive motion is called [[akinetopsia]] and it may be caused by a lesion to [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] area [[Visual cortex#V5/MT|V5]] in the [[extrastriate cortex]]. [[Neuropsychology|Neuropsychological]] studies of a patient who could not see motion, seeing the world in a series of static "frames" instead, suggested that visual area V5 in humans is homologous to motion processing area MT in primates.&lt;ref name=Hess1989&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "motion-blind" patient: low-level spatial and temporal filters |author=Hess, Baker, Zihl |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |year=1989 |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=1628–1640 |pmid=2723744}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker1991&gt;{{cite journal |title=Residual motion perception in a "motion-blind" patient, assessed with limited-lifetime random dot stimuli |author=Baker, Hess, Zihl |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |year=1991 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=454–461 |pmid=1992012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-order motion perception ==
[[Image:Phi phenomenom no watermark.gif|right|thumb|225px|Example of [[Beta movement]], often confused with [[phi phenomenon]], in which a succession of still images gives the illusion of a moving ball.&lt;ref name="PhiIsNotBeta"&gt;Steinman, Pizlo &amp; Pizlo (2000) [http://www.psych.purdue.edu/Magniphi/PhiIsNotBeta/phi1.html Phi is not Beta] slideshow based on ARVO presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Two or more stimuli that are switched on and off in alternation can produce two different motion percepts. The first, demonstrated in the figure to the right is "[[Beta movement]]", often used in billboard displays, in which an object is perceived as moving when, in fact, a series of stationary images is being presented. This is also termed "[[Illusory motion|apparent motion]]" and is the basis of movies and television. However, at faster alternation rates, and if the distance between the stimuli is just right, an illusory "object" the same colour as the background is seen moving between the two stimuli and alternately occluding them. This is called the [[phi phenomenon]] and is sometimes described as an example of "pure" motion detection uncontaminated, as in Beta movement, by form cues.&lt;ref name="PhiIsNotBeta"/&gt; This description is, however, somewhat paradoxical as it is not possible to create such motion in the absence of figural percepts. 

The phi phenomenon has been referred to as "first-order" motion perception. Werner E. Reichardt and Bernard Hassenstein have modelled it in terms of relatively simple "motion sensors" in the visual system, that have evolved to detect a change in luminance at one point on the retina and correlate it with a change in luminance at a neighbouring point on the retina after a short delay. Sensors that are proposed to work this way have been referred to as either ''Hassenstein-Reichardt detectors'' after the scientists [[Bernhard Hassenstein]] and [[Werner E. Reichardt|Werner Reichardt]], who first modelled them,&lt;ref name="Reichardt1961"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reichardt, W. |year= 1961 |chapter=Autocorrelation, a principle for the evaluation of sensory information by the central nervous system |editor=W.A. Rosenblith |title=Sensory Communication |pages=303–317 |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; motion-energy sensors,&lt;ref name="AdelsonBergen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adelson, E.H. |author2=Bergen, J.R. |year=1985 |title=Spatiotemporal energy models for the perception of motion |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A |pmid=3973762 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=284–299 |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.2.000284|bibcode=1985JOSAA...2..284A |citeseerx=10.1.1.148.4141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Elaborated Reichardt Detectors.&lt;ref name="VanSantenSperling"&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Santen, J.P. |author2=Sperling, G. |year=1985 |title=Elaborated Reichardt detectors |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A  |pmid=3973763 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=300–321 |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.2.000300|bibcode=1985JOSAA...2..300S }}&lt;/ref&gt; These sensors are described as detecting motion by spatio-temporal [[correlation]] and are considered by some to be plausible models for how the visual system may detect motion. (Although, again, the notion of a "pure motion" detector suffers from the problem that there is no "pure motion" stimulus, i.e. a stimulus lacking perceived figure/ground properties). There is still considerable debate regarding the accuracy of the model and exact nature of this proposed process. It is not clear how the model distinguishes between movements of the eyes and movements of objects in the visual field, both of which produce changes in luminance on points on the retina.

==Second-order motion perception==
''[[Second-order stimulus|Second-order]]'' motion has been defined as motion in which the moving contour is defined by [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], flicker or some other quality that does not result in an increase in luminance or motion energy in the [[Fourier transform|Fourier spectrum]] of the stimulus.&lt;ref name="CavanaghMather"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cavanagh, P  |author2=Mather, G  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1989 |title=Motion: the long and short of it |journal=Spatial Vision |volume=4 |pages=103–129 |doi=10.1163/156856889X00077 |pmid=2487159 |issue=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChubbSperling"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chubb, C  |author2=Sperling, G  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1988 |title=Drift-balanced random stimuli: A general basis for studying non-Fourier motion perception |journal=J.

(The notion that neural responses are attuned to frequency components of stimulation suffers from the lack of a functional rationale and has been generally criticized by G. Westheimer (2001) in an article called "The Fourier Theory of Vision.") Second-order motion produces a weaker [[motion aftereffect]] unless tested with dynamically flickering stimuli.&lt;ref name="LedgewaySmith"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ledgeway, T.  |author2=Smith, A.T.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1994 |title=The duration of the motion aftereffect following adaptation to first- and second-order motion |journal=Perception |volume=23 |pages=1211–1219 |doi=10.1068/p231211 |pmid=7899037 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The aperture problem==
&lt;!--[[Aperture problem]] redirects here.--&gt;
[[Image:aperture problem animated.gif|thumb|275px|The aperture problem. The [[grating]] appears to be moving down and to the right, [[perpendicular]] to the orientation of the bars. But it could be moving in many other directions, such as only down, or only to the right. It is impossible to determine unless the ends of the bars become visible in the aperture.]]
The motion direction of a contour is ambiguous, because the motion component parallel to the line cannot be inferred based on the visual input. This means that a variety of contours of different orientations moving at different speeds can cause identical responses in a motion sensitive neuron in the visual system.

==Motion integration==
Some have speculated that, having extracted the hypothesized motion signals (first- or second-order) from the retinal image, the visual system must integrate those individual ''local'' motion signals at various parts of the visual field into a 2-dimensional or ''global'' representation of moving objects and surfaces. (It is not clear how this 2D representation is then converted into the perceived 3D percept) Further processing is required to detect coherent motion or "global motion" present in a scene.&lt;ref name="BurrSantoro2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burr|first1=David C|last2=Santoro|first2=Loredana|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698901000724|title=Temporal integration of optic flow, measured by contrast and coherence thresholds|journal=Vision Research|volume=41|issue=15|year=2001|pages=1891–1899|issn=0042-6989|doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(01)00072-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of a subject to detect coherent motion is commonly tested using motion coherence discrimination tasks. For these tasks, dynamic random-dot patterns (also called ''random dot kinematograms'') are used that consist in 'signal' dots moving in one direction and 'noise' dots moving in random directions. The sensitivity to motion coherence is assessed by measuring the ratio of 'signal' to 'noise' dots required to determine the coherent motion direction. The required ratio is called the ''motion coherence threshold''.

==Motion in depth==
{{Main|Monocular depth cues|Structure from motion|Stereoscopic motion}}
As in other aspects of vision, the observer's visual input is generally insufficient to determine the true nature of stimulus sources, in this case their velocity in the real world. In monocular vision for example, the visual input will be a 2D projection of a 3D scene. The motion cues present in the 2D projection will by default be insufficient to reconstruct the motion present in the 3D scene. Put differently, many 3D scenes will be compatible with a single 2D projection. The problem of motion estimation generalizes to [[binocular vision]] when we consider occlusion or motion perception at relatively large distances, where binocular disparity is a poor cue to depth. This fundamental difficulty is referred to as the [[inverse problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maloney|first1=Laurence T.|last2=Lages|first2=Martin|last3=Heron|first3=Suzanne|title=On the Inverse Problem of Binocular 3D Motion Perception|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=6|issue=11|year=2010|pages=e1000999|issn=1553-7358|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000999|pmid=21124957|pmc=2987932|bibcode=2010PLSCB...6E0999L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, some humans do perceive motion in depth. There are indications that the brain uses various cues, in particular temporal changes in disparity as well as monocular velocity ratios, for producing a sensation of motion in depth.&lt;ref name="BlakeWilson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blake|first1=Randolph|last2=Wilson|first2=Hugh|title=Binocular vision|journal=Vision Research|volume=51|issue=7|year=2011|pages=754–770|issn=0042-6989|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.10.009|pmid=20951722|pmc=3050089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Perceptual learning]] of motion==
Detection and discrimination of motion can be improved by training with long-term results. Participants trained to detect the movements of dots on a screen in only one direction become particularly good at detecting small movements in the directions around that in which they have been trained. This improvement was still present 10 weeks later. However [[perceptual learning]] is highly specific. For example, the participants show no improvement when tested around other motion directions, or for other sorts of stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ball | first1 = K. | last2 = Sekuler | first2 = R. | year = 1982 | title = A specific and enduring improvement in visual motion discrimination | url = | journal = Science | volume = 219 | issue = | pages = 697–698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive map==
A [[cognitive map]] is a type of mental representation which serves an individual to acquire, code, store, recall, and decode information about the relative locations and attributes of phenomena in their spatial environment.

Many species of mammals can keep track of spatial location even in the absence of visual, auditory, olfactory, or tactile cues, by integrating their movements—the ability to do this is referred to in the literature as [[path integration]]. A number of theoretical models have explored mechanisms by which path integration could be performed by [[artificial neural network|neural network]]s. In most models, such as those of Samsonovich and McNaughton (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Neurophysiology==
Motion sensing using vision is crucial for detecting a potential mate, prey, or predator, and thus it is found both in vertebrates and invertebrates vision throughout a wide variety of species, although it is not universally found in all species. In vertebrates, the process takes place in retina and more specifically in [[retinal ganglion cells]], which are neurons that receive input from [[bipolar cells]] and [[amacrine cells]] on visual information and process output to higher regions of the brain including, thalamus, hypothalamus, and mesencephalon.

The study of directionally selective units began with a discovery of such cells in the cerebral cortex of cats by [[David Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]] in 1959. Following the initial report, an attempt to understand the mechanism of directionally selective cells was pursued by [[Horace B. Barlow]] and [[William R. Levick]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=barlev&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barlow, H. B., &amp; Levick, W. R.|year=1965|title=The mechanism of directionally selective units in rabbit's retina|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=178|issue=3|pages=477–504|pmc=1357309|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1965.sp007638|pmid=5827909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their in-depth experiments in rabbit's retina expanded the anatomical and physiological understanding of the vertebrate visual system and ignited the interest in the field. Numerous studies that followed thereafter have unveiled the mechanism of motion sensing in vision for the most part. [[Alexander Borst]] and [[Thomas Euler]]'s 2011 review paper, "Seeing Things in Motion: Models, Circuits and Mechanisms".&lt;ref name=boreul&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Borst, Alexander |author2=Thomas Euler|title=Seeing Things in Motion: Models, Circuits, and Mechanisms|journal=Neuron|volume=71.6|issue=6|year=2011|pages=974–994|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.08.031|pmid=21943597}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses certain important findings from the early discoveries to the recent work on the subject, coming to the conclusion of the current status of the knowledge.

===Direction selective (DS) cells===
Direction selective (DS) cells in the retina are defined as neurons that respond differentially to the direction of a visual stimulus. According to Barlow and Levick (1965), the term is used to describe a group of neurons that "gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction."&lt;ref name=barlev/&gt; This direction in which a set of neurons respond most strongly to is their "preferred direction". In contrast, they do not respond at all to the opposite direction, "null direction". The preferred direction is not dependent on the stimulus—that is, regardless of the stimulus' size, shape, or color, the neurons respond when it is moving in their preferred direction, and do not respond if it is moving in the null direction. There are three known types of DS cells in the vertebrate retina of the mouse, ON/OFF DS ganglion cells, ON DS ganglion cells, and OFF DS ganglion cells. Each has a distinctive physiology and anatomy.

====ON/OFF DS ganglion cells====
ON/OFF DS ganglion cells act as local motion detectors. They fire at the onset and offset of a stimulus (a light source). If a stimulus is moving in the direction of the cell's preference, it will fire at the leading and the trailing edge. Their firing pattern is time-dependent and is supported by the [[Werner E. Reichardt|Reichardt]]-[[Bernhard Hassenstein|Hassenstain]] model, which detects spatiotemporal correlation between the two adjacent points. The detailed explanation of the Reichardt-Hassenstain model will be provided later in the section. 
The anatomy of ON/OFF cells is such that the dendrites extend to two sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer and make synapses with bipolar and amacrine cells. They have four subtypes, each with own preference for direction.

====ON DS ganglion cells====
Unlike ON/OFF DS ganglion cells that respond both to the leading and the trailing edge of a stimulus, ON DS ganglion cells are responsive only to a leading edge. The dendrites of ON DS ganglion cells are monostratified and extend into the inner sublamina of the inner plexiform layer. They have three subtypes with different directional preferences.

====OFF DS ganglion cells====
OFF DS ganglion cells act as a centripetal motion detector, and they respond only to the trailing edge of a stimulus. They are tuned to upward motion of a stimulus. The dendrites are asymmetrical and arbor in to the direction of their preference.&lt;ref name=boreul/&gt;

===DS cells in insects===
The first DS cells in invertebrates were found in [[flies]] in a brain structure called the [[lobula plate]]. The lobula plate is one of the three stacks of the [[neuropils]] in the fly's [[optic lobe (arthropods)|optic lobe]]. The "[[tangential cell]]s" of the [[lobula plate]] composed of roughly about 50 neurons, and they arborize extensively in the neuropile.  The tangential cells are known to be directionally selective with distinctive directional preference. One of which is Horizontally Sensitive (HS) cells, such as the [[H1 neuron]], that depolarize most strongly in response to stimulus moving in a horizontal direction (preferred direction). On the other hand, they hyperpolarize when the direction of motion is opposite (null direction). Vertically Sensitive (VS) cells are another group of cells that are most sensitive to vertical motion. They depolarize when a stimulus is moving downward and hyperpolarize when it is moving upward. Both HS and VS cells respond with a fixed preferred direction and a null direction regardless of the color or contrast of the background or the stimulus.

===The Reichardt-Hassenstein model===
[[File:Reichardt model.jpg|thumb|Reichardt model]]
It is now known that motion detection in vision is based on the Hassenstein-Reichardt detector model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassenstein|first=B.|last2=Reichardt|first2=W.|date=1956-10-01|title=Systemtheoretische Analyse der Zeit-, Reihenfolgen- und Vorzeichenauswertung bei der Bewegungsperzeption des Rüsselkäfers Chlorophanus|journal=Zeitschrift für Naturforschung B|volume=11|issue=9–10|pages=513–524|doi=10.1515/znb-1956-9-1004|issn=1865-7117}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is a model used to detect correlation between the two adjacent points. It consists of two symmetrical subunits. Both subunits have a receptor that can be stimulated by an input (light in the case of visual system). In each subunit, when an input is received, a signal is sent to the other subunit. At the same time, the signal is delayed in time within the subunit, and after the temporal filter, is then multiplied by the signal received from the other subunit. Thus, within each subunit, the two brightness values, one received directly from its receptor with a time delay and the other received from the adjacent receptor, are multiplied. The multiplied values from the two subunits are then subtracted to produce an output.  The direction of selectivity or preferred direction is determined by whether the difference is positive or negative. The direction which produces a positive outcome is the preferred direction.

In order to confirm that the Reichardt-Hassenstain model accurately describes the directional selectivity in the retina, the study was conducted using optical recordings of free cytosolic calcium levels after loading a fluorescent indicator dye into the fly tangential cells. The fly was presented uniformly moving gratings while the calcium concentration in the dendritic tips of the tangential cells was measured. The tangential cells showed modulations that matched the temporal frequency of the gratings, and the velocity of the moving gratings at which the neurons respond most strongly showed a close dependency on the pattern wavelength. This confirmed the accuracy of the model both at the cellular and the behavioral level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haag J | year = 2004 | title = Fly Motion Vision Is Based on Reichardt Detectors Regardless of the Signal-to-noise Ratio | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 101 | issue = 46| pages = 16333–6338 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0407368101| pmid = 15534201 | pmc = 526200| bibcode = 2004PNAS..10116333H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the details of the Hassenstein-Reichardt model have not been confirmed at an anatomical and physiological level, the site of subtraction in the model is now being localized to the tangential cells. When depolarizing current is injected into the tangential cell while presenting a visual stimulus, the response to the preferred direction of motion decreased, and the response to the null direction increased. The opposite was observed with hyperpolarizing current. The T4 and T5 cells, which have been selected as a strong candidate for providing input to the tangential cells, have four subtypes that each project into one of the four strata of the lobula plate that differ in the preferred orientation.&lt;ref name=boreul/&gt;

===DS cells in vertebrates===
One of the early works on DS cells in vertebrates was done on the rabbit retina by H. Barlow and W. Levick in 1965. Their experimental methods include variations to the slit-experiments and recording of the action potentials in the rabbit retina. The basic set-up of the slit experiment was they presented a moving black-white grating through a slit of various widths to a rabbit and recorded the action potentials in the retina. This early study had a large impact on the study of DS cells by laying down the foundation for later studies. The study showed that DS ganglion cells derive their property from the basis of sequence-discriminating activity of subunits, and that this activity may be the result of inhibitory mechanism in response to the motion of image in the null direction. It also showed that the DS property of retinal ganglion cells is distributed over the entire receptive field, and not limited to specific zones. Direction selectivity is contained for two adjacent points in the receptive field separated by as small as 1/4°, but selectivity decreased with larger separations. They used this to support their hypothesis that discrimination of sequences gives rise to direction selectivity because normal movement would activate adjacent points in a succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barlow H., Levick W. R. | year = 1965 | title = The Mechanism of Directionally Selective Units in Rabbit's Retina | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 178 | issue = 3| pages = 477–504 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1965.sp007638 | pmid=5827909 | pmc=1357309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular identity and structure of DS cells in mice===
ON/OFF DS ganglion cells can be divided into 4 subtypes differing in their directional preference, ventral, dorsal, nasal, or temporal. The cells of different subtypes also differ in their dendritic structure and synaptic targets in the brain. The neurons that were identified to prefer ventral motion were also found to have dendritic projections in the ventral direction. Also, the neurons that prefer nasal motion had asymmetric dendritic extensions in the nasal direction. Thus, a strong association between the structural and functional asymmetry in ventral and nasal direction was observed. With a distinct property and preference for each subtype, there was an expectation that they could be selectively labeled by molecular markers. The neurons that were preferentially responsive to vertical motion were indeed shown to be selectively expressed by a specific molecular marker. However, molecular markers for other three subtypes have not been yet found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kay | first=J.

===Neural mechanism: starburst amacrine cells===
The direction selective (DS) ganglion cells receive inputs from bipolar cells and starburst amacrine cells. The DS ganglion cells respond to their preferred direction with a large excitatory postsynaptic potential followed by a small inhibitory response. On the other hand, they respond to their null direction with a simultaneous small excitatory postsynaptic potential and a large inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Starburst amacrine cells have been viewed as a strong candidate for direction selectivity in ganglion cells because they can release both GABA and Ach. Their dendrites branch out radiantly from a soma, and there is a significant dendritic overlap. Optical measurements of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration showed that they respond strongly to the centrifugal motion (the outward motion from the soma to the dendrites), while they don't respond well to the centripetal motion (the inward motion from the dendritic tips to the soma).
When the starburst cells were ablated with toxins, direction selectivity was eliminated. Moreover, their release of neurotransmitters itself, specifically calcium ions, reflect direction selectivity, which may be presumably attributed to the synaptic pattern. The branching pattern is organized such that certain presynaptic input will have more influence on a given dendrite than others, creating a polarity in excitation and inhibition. Further evidence suggests that starburst cells release inhibitory neurotransmitters, GABA onto each other in a delayed and prolonged manner. This accounts for the temporal property of inhibition.&lt;ref name=boreul/&gt;

In addition to spatial offset due to GABAergic synapses, the important role of chloride transporters has started to be discussed. The popular hypothesis is that starburst amacrine cells differentially express chloride transporters along the dendrites. Given this assumption, some areas along the dendrite will have a positive chloride-ion equilibrium potential relative to the resting potential while others have a negative equilibrium potential. This means that GABA at one area will be depolarizing and at another area hyperpolarizing, accounting for the spatial offset present between excitation and inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Demb Jonathan B | year = 2007 | title = Cellular mechanisms for direction selectivity in the retina | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 179–186 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.07.001| pmid = 17640521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research (published March 2011) relying on [[Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy|serial block-face electron microscopy]] (SBEM) has led to identification of the circuitry that influences directional selectivity. This new technique provides detailed images of calcium flow and anatomy of dendrites of both [[starburst amacrine cell|starburst amacrine]] (SAC) and DS ganglion cells. By comparing the preferred directions of ganglion cells with their synapses on SAC's, Briggman et al. provide evidence for a mechanism primarily based on inhibitory signals from SAC's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Briggman Kevin L., Helmstaedter Moritz, Denk Winfried | year = 2011 | title = Wiring specificity in the direction-selectivity circuit of the retina | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7337| pages = 183–188 | doi=10.1038/nature09818| pmid = 21390125 | bibcode = 2011Natur.471..183B}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an oversampled serial block-face scanning electron microscopy study of one sampled retina,  that retinal ganglion cells may receive asymmetrical inhibitory inputs directly from starburst amacrine cells, and therefore computation of directional selectivity also occurs postsynaptically.  Such postsynaptic models are unparsimonious, and so if  any given starburst amacrine cells conveys motion information to retinal ganglion cells then any computing of 'local' direction selectivity postsynaptically by retinal ganglion cells  is  redundant and dysfunctional. An [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) transmission model of directionally selective starburst amacrine cells provides a robust topological underpinning of a motion sensing in the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poznanski R.R. | year = 2010 | title = Cellular Inhibitory Behavior Underlying the Formation of Retinal Direction Selectivity | url = | journal = J.

'''Kriss Donald''' (2 July 1988 – 15 March 2004) was a 15-year-old [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[White people|white]] male who was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] and [[murder]]ed in [[Glasgow]] in 2004 by a gang of men of [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] origin,&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt; some of whom fled to [[Pakistan]] after the crime.&lt;ref name="Times Of India"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-11-17/rest-of-world/27813647_1_sikh-leaders-sikh-political-party-sikh-federation|work=The Times Of India|title=Sikhs blame British policy of 'Asian' tag|date=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PaxtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22kidnapped+because+he+was+White+and+was+tortured+to+death+over+five+hours%22&amp;dq=%22kidnapped+because+he+was+White+and+was+tortured+to+death+over+five+hours%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qeWYTsreM9C98gOCgo3CBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA The Middle East, abstracts and index – Library Information and Research Service], google.com; accessed 21 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/11/10/stories/2006111006241400.htm|location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|title=Life for Pakistani men for killing white teenager|date=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daanish Zahid, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid and Mohammed Faisal Mustaq were later found guilty of [[racially motivated crime|racially motivated murder]] and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="Times Of India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-east-fife/justice_for_kriss_donald_held_hostage_by_the_law_1_539905|location=Edinburgh, UK|work=The Scotsman|first=Dan|last=Mcdougall|title=Justice for Kriss Donald held hostage by the law|date=24 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case, which featured the first-ever conviction for racially motivated murder in Scotland, is cited in two newspaper articles as an example of the lack of attention the media and society give to white sufferers of [[Racism|racist]] attacks compared to that given to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Evening Standard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alibhai Brown|first=Yasmin|title=When the victim is white, does anyone care?|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-153368757/when-the-victim-is-white-does-anyone-care|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=26 October 2006|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Denise|title=Skin colour is irrelevant |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Skin+colour+is+irrelevant.-a0153544141|accessdate=28 July 2011|newspaper=The Journal|date=31 October 2006|location=Newcastle, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested the crime demonstrates how society has been forced to redefine racism so as to no longer exclude white victims.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2"/&gt;

==Kidnapping and murder==
On 15 March 2004, Donald was abducted from Kenmure Street by five men associated with a local [[British Pakistani]] [[gang]] led by Imran Shahid. The kidnapping was ostensibly revenge for an attack on Shahid at a [[nightclub]] in Glasgow city centre the night before by a local white gang, and Donald was chosen as an example of a "white boy from the McCulloch Street area" despite having no involvement in the nightclub attack or in any gang activity.&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6125660.stm "Gangsters, murder and extradition"], BBC News; accessed 21 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=threejailed/&gt;

Donald was taken on a 200-mile journey to [[Dundee]] and back while his kidnappers made phone calls looking for a house to take him to. Having no success at this, they returned to Glasgow and took him to the [[Clyde Walkway]], near [[Celtic Football Club]]'s training ground.&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt;&lt;ref name=threejailed&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/nov/09/race.ukcrime Three jailed for life for race murder of schoolboy]. The Guardian 9 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There, they held his arms (ascertained due to an absence of defensive wounds) and stabbed him multiple times. He sustained internal injuries to three [[arteries]], one of his [[lungs]], his [[liver]] and a [[kidney]]. He was doused in [[petrol]] and  set on fire as he [[Exsanguination|bled to death]].&lt;ref name=tranquil/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061102124926/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/news/5058624.html|archivedate=2 November 2006|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/news/5058624.html |title=Kriss trial told boy was set on fire as he bled to death|newspaper=[[Evening Times]]|date=27 October 2006|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of the killing quickly became politicised because of the racial element. After the murder there were reportedly 'racial tensions' in the area sufficient to lead to police intervention.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 1"/&gt;

==Arrests and first trials==
Initially, two men were arrested in connection with the crime. One man, Daanish Zahid, was found guilty of Kriss Donald's murder on 18 November 2004 and is the first person to be convicted of racially motivated murder in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Calum Macdonald, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23640996.html "Two others convicted THE FIRST TRIAL"], ''The Herald'', 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special extradition and later trial==
Three suspects were arrested in Pakistan in July 2005 and [[extradited]] to the UK in October 2005, following the intervention of [[Mohammad Sarwar (politician)|Mohammed Sarwar]], the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]].&lt;ref name=threejailed/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"/&gt;

The [[Pakistani police]] had to engage in a "long struggle" to capture two of the escapees. There is no [[extradition treaty]] between Pakistan and Britain, but the Pakistani authorities agreed to extradite the suspects.&lt;ref name="BBC News 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=threejailed/&gt; There were numerous diplomatic complications around the case, including apparent divergences between government activities and those of ambassadorial officials; government figures were at times alleged to be reluctant to pursue the case for diplomatic reasons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/ministers-block-extradition-of-kriss-donald-murder-suspects-1-540009 "Ministers block extradition of Kriss Donald murder suspects"], ''The Scotsman'', 23 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three extradited suspects, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid, and Mohammed Faisal Mushtaq, all in their late twenties, arrived in Scotland on 5 October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4310410.stm "Glasgow murder suspects fly to UK"], BBC News, 5 October 2005.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with Donald's murder the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4314050.stm "Murder suspects appear in court"], BBC News, 6 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Their trial opened on 2 October 2006 in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5400138.stm "Schoolboy murder trial under way"], BBC News, 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2006, the three men were found guilty of the racially motivated murder of Kriss Donald. All three had denied the charge, but a jury at the High Court in [[Edinburgh]] convicted them of abduction and murder.&lt;ref name="BBC News 1"/&gt;

== Controversies surrounding the case ==

===Lack of media coverage===
The [[BBC]] has been criticised by some viewers because the case featured on national news only three times and the first trial was later largely confined to [[regional]] Scottish bulletins including the verdict itself. Although admitting that the BBC had "got it wrong", the organisation's Head of Newsgathering, [[Fran Unsworth]], largely rejected the suggestion that Donald's race played a part in the lack of reportage, instead claiming it was mostly a product of "Scottish blindness". In preference to reporting the verdict the organisation found the time to report the opening of a new [[arts centre]] in [[Gateshead]] in its running order.&lt;ref name="Newswatch"&gt;{{cite episode |title=NewsWatch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/shared/player/vid100.stm?clippos=0&amp;clipurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news_web/video/9012da68002d768/bb/09012da68002d97c_16x9_bb!asx&amp;title=NewsWatch%202%20December%202005&amp;wintype=200&amp;rhs=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_4490000/newsid_4499400/bb_wm_4499440.stm&amp;cs=news&amp;fsname=bb_wm_fs&amp;bw=bb |series=[[NewsWatch (TV series)|NewsWatch]] |serieslink= |credits=Presenter: [[Raymond Snoddy]], Interviewee: [[Fran Unsworth]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC 1]], [[BBC News Channel]] |location=London, England |airdate=11 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The BBC again faced criticisms for its failure to cover the second trial in its main bulletins, waiting until day 18 to mention the issue and [[Peter Horrocks]] of the BBC apologised for the organisation's further failings.&lt;ref name="Newswatch2"&gt;{{cite episode |title=NewsWatch (TV series) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news/video/63000/bb/63300_16x9_bb.asx |series=NewsWatch |serieslink= |credits=Presenter: Raymond Snoddy, Interviewee: [[Peter Horrocks]] |network=BBC |station=BBC 1, BBC News Channel |location=London, England |airdate=30 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Fahy]], spokesman of race issues for the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]], noted that the media as a whole tended to under-report the racist murders of white people, stating "it was a fact that it was harder to get the media interested where murder victims were young white men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/22/ukcrime.race |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Racial murders: nearly half the victims are white |first=Antony |last=Barnett |date=22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British National Party]] were accused by [[First Minister of Scotland|Scotland's First Minister]] and [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] [[Jack McConnell]] among others of seeking to exploit the case for political advantage, and an open letter signed by [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]], trades unionists, and community leaders, condemned the BNP's plans to stage a visit to [[Pollokshields]]. The group did hold a rally in the area, leading to accusations that it was fuelling racial tension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/46396 sundayherald.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204154218/http://www.sundayherald.com/46396 |date=4 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police response===
A March 2004 article in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper alleged a lack of response by authorities to concerns of rising racial tensions and that [[Strathclyde Police]] had felt pressured to abandon Operation Gather, an investigation into Asian gangs in the area, for fear of offending ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Dan McDougall, [http://www.scotsman.com/news/murder-hunt-police-drop-politically-incorrect-gang-crackdown-1-518252 "Murder hunt police drop ‘politically incorrect’ gang crackdown"], ''The Scotsman'', 19 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2005 interview with a Scottish newspaper, prominent Pakistani Glaswegian [[Bashir Maan]] claimed that "fear and intimidation" had allowed problems with Asian gangs in some parts of the city to go unchecked. The article also quoted a former senior Strathclyde police officer who criticised "a culture of [[political correctness]]" which had allowed gang crime to "grow unfettered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwitness.co.uk/scottish/0105s02.htm |title="Row over policing Asian gangs" |accessdate=2006-11-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231743/http://www.iwitness.co.uk/scottish/0105s02.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }} by Imaad Azim in ''the iWitness''&lt;/ref&gt;

A BBC report suggests that another reason for inaction was lack of evidence, as locals were more prepared to make complaints than to give evidence in court.&lt;ref name="BBC News 3" /&gt; Some commentators have argued the murder was somewhat mischaracterised in the media, as well as expressing a doubt that significant ethnic tensions exist in Pollokshields, suggesting that "gangland revenge" may have played a part.&lt;ref name="www_spiked_online_com1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/2081/ |title=spiked-online.com |accessdate=24 June 2007 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==
Glasgow band [[Glasvegas]] wrote the song "[[Flowers &amp; Football Tops|Flowers And Football Tops]]" having been inspired by the tragedy and the likely effect it would have on the victim's parents. The band dedicated their 2008 Philip Hall Radar NME award win to Donald's memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-s-hogmanay-first-footers-stomp-1-1302563 "Edinburgh's Hogmanay: First footers' stomp"], ''Scotland on Sunday''.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/t-in-the-park-preview-glasvegas-1-1435788 "T in the Park preview: Glasvegas"], ''The Scotsman'', 4 June 2008.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The extended NME interview |journal=New Musical Express |date=21 June 2008 |location=London |publisher=IPC Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial plaque was installed on a bench beside the [[River Clyde]], near to where he was killed, in memory of Donald.&lt;ref name=tranquil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/now_tranquil_the_place_where_horror_visited_1_724626 |title=Now tranquil, the place where horror visited|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=13 November 2006|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition,a memorial plaque was placed on a public fence in Pollokshields close to the spot where he was kidnapped; in July 2018, friends and family gathered at the spot to remember him on what would have been his 30th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/16330666.kriss-donald-poignant-tributes-left-on-what-would-have-been-his-30th-birthday/

==Legacy==
The murder led some people to examine their views of racism and its victims. [[Mark Easton]] cited the racist murders of Donald and also [[Murder of Ross Parker|Ross Parker]] as demonstrating how society has been forced to redefine [[racism]] and discard the erroneous definition of "[[prejudice plus power]]"—a definition which only allowed ethnic minorities to be victims of hate crime.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6128466.stm |work=BBC News |first=Mark |last=Easton |title=Racism and race crime redefined |date=8 November 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]] also cited the Donald case when highlighting the lack of concern for white victims of racist murders. She drew comparisons with high-profile ethnic minority victims, asking whether Donald's murderers were "less evil than those who killed [[Stephen Lawrence]]". Alibhai-Brown came to the conclusion that treating "some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable—and a betrayal of [[anti-racism]] itself".&lt;ref name="Evening Standard" /&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''negative number''' is a [[real number]] that is [[inequality (mathematics)|less than]] [[0 (number)|zero]]. Negative numbers represent opposites. If positive represents a movement to the right, negative represents a movement to the left. If positive represents above sea level, then negative represents below sea level. If positive represents a deposit, negative represents a withdrawal. They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency. A [[debt]] that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset, a decrease in some quantity may be thought of as a negative increase. If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses, then one may choose to distinguish between those senses—perhaps arbitrarily—as ''positive'' and ''negative''. In the medical context of fighting a tumor, an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero, such as the Celsius and [[Fahrenheit]] scales for temperature. The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic. For example, −(−3) = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original value.

Negative numbers are usually written with a [[Plus and minus signs|minus sign]] in front. For example, −3 represents a negative quantity with a magnitude of three, and is pronounced "minus three" or "negative three". To help tell the difference between a [[subtraction]] operation and a negative number, occasionally the negative sign is placed slightly higher than the [[minus sign]] (as a [[superscript]]). Conversely, a number that is greater than zero is called ''positive''; zero is usually ([[signed zero|but not always]]) thought of as neither positive nor [[negative zero|negative]].&lt;ref&gt;The convention that zero is neither positive nor negative is not universal. For example, in the French convention, zero is considered to be ''both'' positive and negative. The French words [[:fr:Nombre positif|positif]] and [[:fr:Nombre négatif|négatif]] mean the same as English "positive or zero" and "negative or zero" respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; The positivity of a number may be emphasized by placing a plus sign before it, e.g. {{math|+3}}. In general, the negativity or positivity of a number is referred to as its [[sign (mathematics)|sign]].

Every real number other than zero is either positive or negative. The positive whole numbers are referred to as [[natural number]]s, while the positive and negative whole numbers (together with zero) are referred to as [[integer]]s.

In [[bookkeeping]], amounts owed are often represented by red numbers, or a number in parentheses, as an alternative notation to represent negative numbers.

Negative numbers appeared for the first time in history in the ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', which in its present form dates from the period of the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – AD 220), but may well contain much older material.&lt;ref name=struik33&gt;Struik, page 32–33. "''In these matrices we find negative numbers, which appear here for the first time in history.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Hui]]  (c. 3rd century) established rules for adding and subtracting negative numbers.&lt;ref name="Hodgkin"/&gt; By the 7th century, Indian mathematicians such as [[Brahmagupta]] were describing the use of negative numbers. [[Islamic mathematicians]] further developed the rules of subtracting and multiplying negative numbers and solved problems with negative [[coefficients]].&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt; Western mathematicians accepted the idea of negative numbers by the 17th century. Prior to the concept of negative numbers, mathematicians such as [[Diophantus]] considered negative solutions to problems "false" and equations requiring negative solutions were described as absurd.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diophantus]], ''[[Arithmetica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

===As the result of subtraction===
Negative numbers can be thought of as resulting from the [[subtraction]] of a larger number from a smaller. For example, negative three is the result of subtracting three from zero:
: {{math| 0 − 3  {{=}}  −3.}}
In general, the subtraction of a larger number from a smaller yields a negative result, with the magnitude of the result being the difference between the two numbers.  For example,
: {{math| 5 − 8  {{=}}  −3}}
since {{math|8 − 5 {{=}} 3}}.

===The number line===
{{Main|Number line}}
The relationship between negative numbers, positive numbers, and zero is often expressed in the form of a '''number line''':
[[File:Number-line.svg|center|The number line]]
Numbers appearing farther to the right on this line are greater, while numbers appearing farther to the left are less. Thus zero appears in the middle, with the positive numbers to the right and the negative numbers to the left.

Note that a negative number with greater magnitude is considered less. For example, even though (positive) {{math|8}} is greater than (positive) {{math|5}}, written
: {{math|8 &gt; 5}}
negative {{math|8}} is considered to be less than negative {{math|5}}:
: {{math|−8 &lt; −5.}}
(Because, for example, if you have £-8, a debt of £8, you would have less after adding, say £10, to it than if you have £-5.) 
It follows that any negative number is less than any positive number, so
: {{math|−8 &lt; 5}} &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;{{math|−5 &lt; 8.}}

===Signed numbers===
{{main|Sign (mathematics)}}
In the context of negative numbers, a number that is greater than zero is referred to as '''positive'''. Thus every [[real number]] other than zero is either positive or negative, while zero itself is not considered to have a sign. Positive numbers are sometimes written with a [[plus sign]] in front, e.g. {{math|+3}} denotes a positive three.

Because zero is neither positive nor negative, the term '''nonnegative''' is sometimes used to refer to a number that is either positive or zero, while '''nonpositive''' is used to refer to a number that is either negative or zero. Zero is a neutral number.

==Arithmetic involving negative numbers==
The [[Plus and minus signs|minus sign]] "−" signifies the [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] for both the binary (two-[[operand]]) [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] of [[subtraction]] (as in {{math|y − z}}) and the unary (one-operand) operation of [[negation]] (as in {{math|−x}}, or twice in {{math|−(−x)}}). A special case of unary negation occurs when it operates on a positive number, in which case the result is a negative number (as in {{math|−5}}).

The ambiguity of the "−" symbol does not generally lead to ambiguity in arithmetical expressions, because the order of operations makes only one interpretation or the other possible for each "−". However, it can lead to confusion and be difficult for a person to understand an expression when operator symbols appear adjacent to one another. A solution can be to parenthesize the unary "−" along with its operand.

For example, the expression {{math|7 + −5}} may be clearer if written {{math|7 + (−5)}} (even though they mean exactly the same thing formally). The [[subtraction]] expression {{math|7–5}} is a different expression that doesn't represent the same operations, but it evaluates to the same result.

Sometimes in elementary schools a number may be prefixed by a superscript minus sign or plus sign to explicitly distinguish negative and positive numbers as in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding by design|author1=Grant P. Wiggins|author2=Jay McTighe|page=210|year=2005|publisher=ACSD Publications|isbn=1-4166-0035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;2 + &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;5}} &amp;nbsp;gives&amp;nbsp;{{math|&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;7}}.

===Addition===
[[File:AdditionRules.svg|right|thumb|A visual representation of the addition of positive and negative numbers. Larger balls represent numbers with greater magnitude.]]
Addition of two negative numbers is very similar to addition of two positive numbers. For example,
:{{math|(−3) + (−5)  {{=}}  −8}}.
The idea is that two debts can be combined into a single debt of greater magnitude.

When adding together a mixture of positive and negative numbers, one can think of the negative numbers as positive quantities being subtracted. For example:
:{{math|8 + (−3)  {{=}}  8 − 3  {{=}}  5}} &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;{{math|(−2) + 7  {{=}}  7 − 2  {{=}}  5}}.
In the first example, a credit of {{math|8}} is combined with a debt of {{math|3}}, which yields a total credit of {{math|5}}. If the negative number has greater magnitude, then the result is negative:
:{{math|(−8) + 3  {{=}}  3 − 8  {{=}}  −5}} &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;{{math|2 + (−7)  {{=}}  2 − 7  {{=}}  −5}}.
Here the credit is less than the debt, so the net result is a debt.

===Subtraction===
As discussed above, it is possible for the subtraction of two non-negative numbers to yield a negative answer:
: {{math| 5 − 8  {{=}}  −3}}
In general, subtraction of a positive number yields the same result as the addition of a negative number of equal magnitude. Thus
: {{math| 5 − 8  {{=}}  5 + (−8)  {{=}}  −3}}
and
: {{math| (−3) − 5  {{=}}  (−3) + (−5)  {{=}}  −8}}

On the other hand, subtracting a negative number yields the same result as the addition a positive number of equal magnitude. (The idea is that ''losing'' a debt is the same thing as ''gaining'' a credit.) Thus
: {{math| 3 − (−5)  {{=}}  3 + 5  {{=}}  8}}
and
: {{math| (−5) − (−8)  {{=}}  (−5) + 8  {{=}}  3}}.

===Multiplication===
When multiplying numbers, the magnitude of the product is always just the product of the two magnitudes. The [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] of the product is determined by the following rules:
* The product of one positive number and one negative number is negative.
* The product of two negative numbers is positive.
Thus
: {{math| (−2) × 3  {{=}}  −6}}
and
: {{math| (−2) × (−3)  {{=}}  6}}.
The reason behind the first example is simple: adding three {{math|−2}}'s together yields {{math|−6}}:
: {{math| (−2) × 3  {{=}}  (−2) + (−2) + (−2)  {{=}}  −6}}.
The reasoning behind the second example is more complicated. The idea again is that losing a debt is the same thing as gaining a credit. In this case, losing two debts of three each is the same as gaining a credit of six:
: {{math| (−2}} debts {{math|) × (−3}} each{{math|)  {{=}}  +6}} credit.
The convention that a product of two negative numbers is positive is also necessary for multiplication to follow the [[distributive law]].  In this case, we know that
: {{math| (−2) × (−3)  +  2 × (−3)  {{=}}  (−2 + 2) × (−3)  {{=}}  0 × (−3)  {{=}}  0}}.
Since {{math|2 × (−3) {{=}} −6}}, the product {{math|(−2) × (−3)}} must equal {{math|6}}.

These rules lead to another (equivalent) rule—the sign of any product ''a'' × ''b'' depends on the sign of ''a'' as follows:
* if ''a'' is positive, then the sign of ''a'' × ''b'' is the same as the sign of ''b'', and
* if ''a'' is negative, then the sign of ''a'' × ''b'' is the opposite of the sign of ''b''.
The justification for why the product of two negative numbers is a positive number can be observed in the analysis of [[complex numbers]].

===Division===
The sign rules for [[Division (mathematics)|division]] are the same as for multiplication.  For example,
:{{math|8 ÷ (−2)  {{=}}  −4}},
:{{math|(−8) ÷ 2  {{=}}  −4}},
and
:{{math|(−8) ÷ (−2)  {{=}}  4}}.
If dividend and divisor have the same sign, the result is always positive. Another method of dividing negative numbers is that if one of the numbers being divided is a negative, the answer will be negative.

==Negation==
{{main|Additive inverse}}
The negative version of a positive number is referred to as its [[Additive inverse|negation]]. For example, {{math|−3}} is the negation of the positive number {{math|3}}.  The [[addition|sum]] of a number and its negation is equal to zero:
:{{math|3 + (−3)  {{=}}  0}}.
That is, the negation of a positive number is the [[additive inverse]] of the number.

Using [[algebra]], we may write this principle as an [[algebraic identity]]:
:{{math|''x'' + (−''x'' ) {{=}}  0}}.
This identity holds for any positive number {{math|''x''}}. It can be made to hold for all real numbers by extending the definition of negation to include zero and negative numbers.  Specifically:
* The negation of 0 is 0, and
* The negation of a negative number is the corresponding positive number.
For example, the negation of {{math|−3}} is {{math|+3}}.  In general,
:{{math|−(−''x'')  {{=}}  ''x''}}.

The [[absolute value]] of a number is the non-negative number with the same magnitude. For example, the absolute value of {{math|−3}} and the absolute value of {{math|3}} are both equal to {{math|3}}, and the absolute value of {{math|0}} is {{math|0}}.

==Formal construction of negative integers==
{{See also|Integer#Construction}}
In a similar manner to [[rational number]]s, we can extend the [[natural number]]s '''N''' to the integers '''Z''' by defining integers as an [[ordered pair]] of natural numbers (''a'', ''b''). We can extend addition and multiplication to these pairs with the following rules:
:(''a'', ''b'') + (''c'', ''d'') = (''a'' + ''c'', ''b'' + ''d'')
:(''a'', ''b'') × (''c'', ''d'') = (''a'' × ''c'' + ''b'' × ''d'', ''a'' × ''d'' + ''b'' × ''c'')

We define an [[equivalence relation]] ~ upon these pairs with the following rule:
:(''a'', ''b'') ~ (''c'', ''d'') if and only if ''a'' + ''d'' = ''b'' + ''c''.
This equivalence relation is compatible with the addition and multiplication defined above, and we may define '''Z''' to be the [[quotient set]] '''N'''²/~, i.e. we identify two pairs (''a'', ''b'') and (''c'', ''d'') if they are equivalent in the above sense. Note that '''Z''', equipped with these operations of addition and multiplication, is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], and is in fact, the prototypical example of a ring.

We can also define a [[total order]] on '''Z''' by writing
:(''a'', ''b'') ≤ (''c'', ''d'') if and only if ''a'' + ''d'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c''.

This will lead to an ''additive zero'' of the form (''a'', ''a''), an ''[[additive inverse]]'' of (''a'', ''b'') of the form (''b'', ''a''), a multiplicative unit of the form (''a'' + 1, ''a''), and a definition of [[subtraction]]
:(''a'', ''b'') − (''c'', ''d'') = (''a'' + ''d'', ''b'' + ''c'').
This construction is a special case of the [[Grothendieck group#Explicit construction|Grothendieck construction]].

===Uniqueness===
The negative of a number is unique, as is shown by the following proof.

Let ''x'' be a number and let ''y'' be its negative.
Suppose ''y′'' is another negative of ''x''. By an [[axiom]] of the real number system

:&lt;math&gt;x + y \prime = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x + y\,\, = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

And so, ''x'' + ''y′'' = ''x'' + ''y''. Using the law of cancellation for addition, it is seen that
''y′'' = ''y''. Thus ''y'' is equal to any other negative of ''x''. That is, ''y'' is the unique negative of ''x''.

For a long time, negative solutions to problems were considered "false". In [[Hellenistic Egypt]], the [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Diophantus]] in the 3rd century AD referred to an equation that was equivalent to 4''x'' + 20 = 4 (which has a negative solution) in ''[[Arithmetica]]'', saying that the equation was absurd.&lt;ref name="Needham volume 3 p90"&gt;{{cite book|author=Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 3; Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfQ9E0u4pLAC|year=1995|orig-year=1959|edition=reprint|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-05801-5|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative numbers appear for the first time in history in the ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (''Jiu zhang suan-shu''), which in its present form dates from the period of the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – AD 220), but may well contain much older material.&lt;ref name="struik33"/&gt; The mathematician [[Liu Hui]] (c. 3rd century) established rules for the addition and subtraction of negative numbers. The historian Jean-Claude Martzloff theorized that the importance of duality in Chinese natural philosophy made it easier for the Chinese to accept the idea of negative numbers.&lt;ref name="Hodgkin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luke Hodgkin|title=A History of Mathematics: From Mesopotamia to Modernity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6HlhlBuQUgC&amp;pg=PA88|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-152383-0|page=88|quote=Liu is explicit on this; at the point where the ''Nine Chapters'' give a detailed and helpful 'Sign Rule'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese were able to solve simultaneous equations involving negative numbers.

Liu Hui writes:

During the 7th century AD, negative numbers were used in India to represent debts. The [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]], in ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta|Brahma-Sphuta-Siddhanta]]'' (written c. AD 630), discussed the use of negative numbers to produce the general form [[quadratic formula]] that remains in use today.&lt;ref name="Needham volume 3 p90"/&gt; He also found negative solutions of [[quadratic equation]]s and gave rules regarding operations involving negative numbers and [[0 (number)|zero]], such as ''"A debt cut off from nothingness becomes a credit; a credit cut off from nothingness becomes a debt. "'' He called positive numbers "fortunes," zero "a cipher," and negative numbers "debts."&lt;ref&gt;Colva M. Roney-Dougal, Lecturer in Pure Mathematics at the University of St Andrews, stated this on the BBC Radio 4 programme "In Our Time," on 9 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Knowledge Transfer and Perceptions of the Passage of Time'', ICEE-2002 Keynote Address by Colin Adamson-Macedo. "''Referring again to Brahmagupta's great work, all the necessary rules for algebra, including the 'rule of signs', were stipulated, but in a form which used the language and imagery of commerce and the market place. Thus 'dhana' (= fortunes) is used to represent positive numbers, whereas 'rina' (= debts) were negative''".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, [[Islamic mathematicians]] were familiar with negative numbers from the works of Indian mathematicians, but the recognition and use of negative numbers during this period remained timid.&lt;ref name=Rashed&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Springer| isbn = 9780792325659| last = Rashed| first = R.| title = The Development of Arabic Mathematics: Between Arithmetic and Algebra| date =1994-06-30|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Khwarizmi]] in his ''Al-jabr wa'l-muqabala'' (from which we get the word "algebra") did not use negative numbers or negative coefficients.&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt; But within fifty years, [[Abu Kamil]] illustrated the rules of signs for expanding the multiplication &lt;math&gt;(a \pm b)(c \pm d)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Ismail&gt;{{citation | author = Mat Rofa Bin Ismail | title = Algebra in Islamic Mathematics | work = Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | volume = 1 | year = 2008 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 9781402045592 | editor = [[Helaine Selin]] | page=115 | edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[al-Karaji]] wrote in his ''al-Fakhrī'' that "negative quantities must be counted as terms".&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt; In the 10th century, [[Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī]] considered debts as negative numbers in ''A Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen''.&lt;ref name=Ismail /&gt;

By the 12th century, al-Karaji's successors were to state the general rules of signs and use them to solve [[polynomial division]]s.&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt; As [[al-Samaw'al]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the product of a negative number — ''al-nāqiṣ'' — by a positive number — ''al-zāʾid'' — is negative, and by a negative number is positive. If we subtract a negative number from a higher negative number, the remainder is their negative difference. The difference remains positive if we subtract a negative number from a lower negative number. If we subtract a negative number from a positive number, the remainder is their positive sum. If we subtract a positive number from an empty power (''martaba khāliyya''), the remainder is the same negative, and if we subtract a negative number from an empty power, the remainder is the same positive number.&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 12th century in India, [[Bhāskara II]] gave negative roots for quadratic equations but rejected them because they were inappropriate in the context of the problem. He stated that a negative value is "''in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots.''"

European mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th century, although [[Leonardo of Pisa#Important publications|Fibonacci]] allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debits (chapter 13 of ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', AD 1202) and later as losses (in ''[[Leonardo of Pisa|Flos]]'').

In the 15th century, [[Nicolas Chuquet]], a Frenchman, used negative numbers as [[Exponentiation|exponents]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nicolas Chuquet, Renaissance Mathematician: a study with extensive translations of Chuquet's mathematical manuscript completed in 1484|first1=Graham|last1=Flegg|first2=C.|last2=Hay|first3=B.|last3=Moss|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Co.|year=1985|isbn=9789027718723|page=354|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_rO6lVwdbjcC&amp;pg=PA354}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but referred to them as “absurd numbers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Famous Problems and Their Mathematicians|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9781563084461|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STKX4qadFTkC&amp;pg=PA56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1544 ''Arithmetica Integra'' [[Michael Stifel]] also dealt with negative numbers, also calling them ''numeri absurdi''.

In 1545, [[Gerolamo Cardano]], in his [[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|''Ars Magna'']], provided the first satisfactory treatment of negative numbers in Europe.&lt;ref name="Needham volume 3 p90"/&gt; He did not allow negative numbers in his consideration of [[cubic equation]]s, so he had to treat, for example, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' separately from ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' (with ''a'',''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 in both cases). In all, Cardano was driven to the study of thirteen different types of cubic equations, each expressed purely in terms of positive numbers.

In A.D. 1759, [[Francis Maseres]], an English mathematician, wrote that negative numbers "darken the very whole doctrines of the equations and make dark of the things which are in their nature excessively obvious and simple". He came to the conclusion that negative numbers were nonsensical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maseres |first=Francis |authorlink=Francis Maseres |title=A dissertation on the use of the negative sign in algebra: containing a demonstration of the rules usually given concerning it; and shewing how quadratic and cubic equations may be explained, without the consideration of negative roots.

In the 18th century it was common practice to ignore any negative results derived from equations, on the assumption that they were meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alberto A. |last=Martinez |title=Negative Math: How Mathematical Rules Can Be Positively Bent |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2006 }} a history of controversies on negative numbers, mainly from the 1600s until the early 1900s.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] was the first mathematician to systematically employ negative numbers as part of a coherent mathematical system, the [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Calculus made negative numbers necessary and their dismissal as "absurd numbers" quickly faded.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12303">The '''phenomenal concept strategy''' ('''PCS''') is an approach within [[philosophy of mind]] to provide a [[physicalist]] response to anti-physicalist arguments like the [[explanatory gap]] and [[philosophical zombies]]. The name was coined by [[Daniel Stoljar]].&lt;ref name=Stoljar2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Daniel Stoljar|title=Physicalism and Phenomenal Concepts|journal=Mind &amp; Language|date=Nov 2005|volume=20|issue=5|pages=469–494|doi=10.1111/j.0268-1064.2005.00296.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[David Chalmers]] put it, PCS "locates the gap in the relationship between our ''concepts'' of physical processes and our ''concepts'' of consciousness, rather than in the relationship between physical processes and consciousness themselves."&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; The idea is that if we can explain why we ''think'' there's an explanatory gap, this will defuse the motivation to question physicalism.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt;

==Overview==

PCS advocates typically subscribe to&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; what Chalmers has called "type-B materialism",&lt;ref name=Chalmers2003&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalmers|first1=David J.|editor1-link=Stephen P. Stich|editor2-link=Ted A. Warfield|title=The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind|date=2003|isbn=978-0631217756|chapter=Consciousness and its Place in Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds that there is an [[epistemic]] but not [[ontological]] gap between physics and subjective experience. PCS maintains that our concepts are [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]], but reality is [[monistic]], in a similar way as "heat" and "molecular motion" are two different concepts that refer to the same property.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; However, phenomenal concepts are different from other concepts in that they incline us to see an epistemic gap.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; PCS suggests that physicalist explanations "cannot feel satisfactory [...] since the concepts used in the physical explanation don't entail any applications of the phenomenal concepts in terms of which the explanandum is characterized."&lt;ref name=CarruthersVeillet2007 /&gt;

PCS would help physicalists answer the [[knowledge argument]] because upon seeing red, Mary would have new thoughts about phenomenal concepts, even though those thoughts would only re-express physical facts she already knew. Likewise, we can conceive of zombies even if they aren't possible because when we think about their functional/physical characteristics, we don't also conjure thoughts about phenomenal concepts.&lt;ref name=CarruthersVeillet2007 /&gt;

[[David Papineau]] coined the term ''antipathetic fallacy'' to refer to the way in which we fail to see phenomenal experience in brain processing. It's the opposite of the [[pathetic fallacy]] of seeing consciousness in non-minds.&lt;ref name=Papineau2002 /&gt;

==Types of concepts==

Chalmers outlines several ways in which phenomenal concepts might be distinctive:&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt;

===Recognitional concepts===

These are so-called "type-demonstratives" in which we point to "one of ''those''". For instance:&lt;ref name=Loar1997&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brian Loar|editor1-link=Ned Block|editor2-link=Owen Flanagan|editor3-link=Güven Güzeldere|title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|chapter=Phenomenal states II}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Suppose you go into the California desert and spot a succulent never seen before. You become adept at recognizing instances, and gain a recognitional command of their kind, without a name for it; you are disposed to identify positive and negative instances and thereby pick out a kind. These dispositions are typically linked with capacities to form images, whose conceptual role seems to be to focus thoughts about an identifiable kind in the absence of currently perceived instances.

[[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]] suggests&lt;ref name=Carruthers2000&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Carruthers|title=Phenomenal Consciousness: A Naturalistic Theory|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521781732}}&lt;/ref&gt; that phenomenal concepts are ''purely'' recognitional, which means&lt;ref name=CarruthersVeillet2007 /&gt;
# they apply directly to instances
# they are ''conceptually isolated'', i.e., don't have ''a priori'' connections with other concepts (including physical or functional concepts).

===Distinct conceptual roles===

We think about physical and phenomenal concepts in different ways.&lt;ref name=Hill1997&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christopher S. Hill|title=Imaginability, conceivability, possibility, and the mind-body problem|journal=Philosophical Studies|date=Jul 1997|volume=87|issue=1|pages=61–85|doi=10.1023/A:1017911200883|issn=1573-0883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indexical concepts===

Several philosophers have suggested that phenomenal concepts denote brain states indexically, in a similar way as saying "now" picks out a particular time. Even given full knowledge of physics, additional indexical information is required to say where and when one is.&lt;ref name=Perry1979&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John Perry|title=The Problem of the Essential Indexical|journal=Noûs|date=Mar 1979|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3–21|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lderosse/courses/lang/Perry(1979).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotational/constitutional concepts===

Some contend that phenomenal states are part of the concepts that refer to them. For instance, Papineau suggests that phenomenal concepts are ''quotational'', like saying "That state: ___."&lt;ref name=Papineau2002&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Papineau|title=[[Thinking about Consciousness]]|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199243822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katalin Balog defends a ''constitutional account'' of phenomenal concepts, in which "token experiences serve as modes of presentation of the phenomenal properties they instantiate."&lt;ref name=Balog2012&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Katalin Balog|title=In Defense of the Phenomenal Concept Strategy|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=Jan 2012|volume=84|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00541.x|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~kbalog/Web%20publications/PCS-Response.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6–7}} For instance, the concept of pain is partly constituted by a [[Type–token distinction|token]] experience of pain.&lt;ref name=Balog2012 /&gt;{{rp|7}} She claims this position helps resolve the explanatory gap because an ''a priori'' description alone doesn't suffice to express the concept; in addition, a direct experiential constitution is required.&lt;ref name=Balog2012 /&gt;{{rp|8}} While it seems like physical/functional information about {{chem|H|2|O}} tells us all there is about it, we feel something more for phenomenality because we "have a 'substantive' grasp of its nature."&lt;ref name=Balog2012 /&gt;{{rp|9}}

Papineau takes a similar position.&lt;ref name=Papineau2003&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David Papineau|title=Confusions about Consciousness|journal=Richmond Journal of Philosophy|date=Autumn 2003|volume=5|url=http://www.richmond-philosophy.net/rjp/back_issues/rjp5_papineau.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that normal physical identity statements (such as that heat is molecular kinetic energy) involve two descriptions, which we can associate in our minds. In contrast, we think about a phenomenal concept by either "actually undergoing the experience" or at least by imagining it, and this creates a "what-it’s-likeness" sensation. Then:&lt;ref name=Papineau2003 /&gt;
:This subjective commonality can easily confuse us when we contemplate identities like ''pains = nociceptive-specific neuronal activity''.  We focus on the left-hand side, deploy our phenomenal concept of pain (that feeling), and therewith feel something akin to pain.  Then we focus on the right-hand side, deploy our concept of ''nociceptive-specific neurons'', and feel nothing (or at least nothing in the pain dimension—we may visually imagine axons and dendrites and so on).   And so we conclude that the right hand side ''leaves out'' the feeling of pain itself, the unpleasant what-it’s-likeness, and refers only to the distinct physical correlates of pain.
Papineau compares the situation to the [[use–mention distinction]]: Phenomenal concepts directly use the experiences to which they refer, while physical descriptions merely mention them.&lt;ref name=Papineau2003 /&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Chalmers's "master argument"===

David Chalmers presents "A Master Argument" against PCS.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007 /&gt; He defines C as the PCS thesis that
# humans have psychological features
# that explain why we have the apparent epistemic gaps with consciousness,
# and this explanation is purely physical.
All three of these must hold for PCS to succeed. He defines P as all physical facts. Then he poses a dilemma:
* "If P&amp;~C is conceivable, then C is not physically explicable." This is because P&amp;~C logically means physics alone doesn't explain C. If true, this horn would invalidate #3 of C.
* "If P&amp;~C is not conceivable, then C cannot explain our epistemic situation." This is because if P&amp;~C is not conceivable, C must follow straightforwardly from P. Hence, even zombies would satisfy C (since nothing more than P is required). But zombies would not completely share our epistemic situation—for instance, because their statements that "I'm phenomenally conscious" would be false while ours would be true. Since zombies might also share C, C doesn't explain why our epistemic situation is different from theirs. If true, this horn would invalidate #2 of C.
Regardless of which horn is true, C is invalidated.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalmers|first1=David J.|editor1-link=Torin Alter|editor2-link=Sven Walter|title=Phenomenal Concepts and Phenomenal Knowledge: New Essays on Consciousness and Physicalism|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|chapter=Phenomenal Concepts and the Explanatory Gap|url=http://consc.net/papers/pceg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reply====

Carruthers and Veillet argue that Chalmers's argument commits a fallacy of equivocation between first-person and third-person phenomenal concepts, but the authors reformulate it to avoid that problem. They proceed to attack the revised argument by denying the premise that if zombies must have third-person phenomenal concepts, then phenomenal concepts can't account for the explanatory gap. In particular, they suggest that, pace Chalmers, people and zombies would have the same epistemic situation even though the ''contents'' of their situations would be different. For instance, a person's phenomenal concept would have content of a phenomenal state, while the "schmenomenal" concept of a zombie would have content about a "schmenomenal" state. A zombie "is correct when he says that he is conscious, because he isn't saying that he has phenomenal states as we understand them. He is correct because he means that he has schmenomenal states, and he has them." So people and zombies can both have true beliefs justified in similar ways (same epistemic situation), even if those beliefs are ''about'' different things.&lt;ref name=CarruthersVeillet2007&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Peter Carruthers|author2=Bénédicte Veillet|title=The Phenomenal Concept Strategy|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|date=1 Jan 2007|volume=14|issue=9-10|pages=212–236|url=http://faculty.philosophy.umd.edu/pcarruthers/Phenomenal%20Concept%20Strategy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''point at infinity''' or '''ideal point''' is an idealized limiting point at the "end" of each line.

In the case of an [[affine plane]] (including the [[Euclidean plane]]), there is one ideal point for each [[Pencil (mathematics)|pencil]] of parallel lines of the plane. Adjoining these points produces a [[projective plane]], in which no point can be distinguished, if we "forget" which points were added. This holds for a geometry over any [[Field (mathematics)|field]], and more generally over any [[division ring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric W.|title=Point at Infinity|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PointatInfinity.html|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=28 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the real case, a point at infinity completes a line into a topologically closed curve.  In higher dimensions, all the points at infinity form a projective subspace of one dimension less than that of the whole projective space to which they belong.  A point at infinity can also be added to the [[complex line]] (which may be thought of as the complex plane), thereby turning it into a closed surface known as the complex projective line, '''C'''P&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, also called the [[Riemann sphere]] (when complex numbers are mapped to each point).

In the case of a [[hyperbolic space]], each line has two distinct [[ideal point]]s.  Here, the set of ideal points takes the form of a [[Quadric (projective geometry)|quadric]].

== Affine geometry ==
In an [[affine space|affine]] or [[Euclidean space]] of higher dimension, the '''points at infinity''' are the points which are added to the space to get the [[projective space|projective completion]]. The set of the points at infinity is called, depending on the dimension of the space, the [[line at infinity]], the [[plane at infinity]] or the [[hyperplane at infinity]], in all cases a projective space of one less dimension.

As a projective space over a field is a [[smooth algebraic variety]], the same is true for the set of points at infinity. Similarly, if the ground field is the real or the complex field, the set of points at infinity is a [[manifold]].

=== Perspective ===
{{main|Perspective (graphical)}}
In artistic drawing and technical perspective, the projection on the picture plane of the point at infinity of a class of parallel lines is called their [[vanishing point]].

== Hyperbolic geometry ==
{{main|Ideal point}}
In [[hyperbolic geometry]], '''points at infinity''' are typically named [[ideal point]]s.  Unlike [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] and [[Elliptic geometry|elliptic]] geometries, each line has two points at infinity: given a line ''l'' and a point ''P'' not on ''l'', the right- and left-[[limiting parallel]]s [[Convergence (mathematics)|converge]] [[asymptotically]] to different points at infinity.

All points at infinity together form the [[Cayley absolute]] or boundary of a [[hyperbolic plane]].

== Other generalisations ==
{{main|Compactification (mathematics)}}
This construction can be generalized to [[topological space]]s. Different compactifications may exist for a given space, but arbitrary topological space admits [[Alexandroff extension]], also called the ''one-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]]'' when the original space is not itself [[compact space|compact]].  Projective line (over arbitrary field) is the Alexandroff extension&lt;!-- such way is correct.  finite fields do not have "compactifications" but Alexandroff extensions. --&gt; of the corresponding field. Thus the circle is the one-point compactification of the [[real line]], and the sphere is the one-point compactification of the plane. [[Projective space]]s '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; for {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 are not ''one-point'' compactifications of corresponding affine spaces for the reason mentioned above under {{section link||Affine geometry}}, and completions of hyperbolic spaces with ideal points are also not one-point compactifications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25200">In [[neurophysiology]], several mathematical models of the [[action potential]] have been developed, which fall into two basic types. The first type seeks to model the experimental data quantitatively, i.e., to reproduce the measurements of current and voltage exactly. The renowned [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] of the axon from the ''[[Loligo]]'' squid exemplifies such models.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" &gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]], [[Bernard Katz|Katz B]] |title = Currents carried by sodium and potassium ions through the membrane of the giant axon of Loligo | journal = Journal of Physiology | year = 1952 | volume = 116 | pages = 424&amp;ndash;448 | pmid = 14946713 | issue = 4 | pmc = 1392213 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004717}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]] |title = Currents carried by sodium and potassium ions through the membrane of the giant axon of Loligo|journal=Journal of Physiology | year = 1952 | volume = 116 | pages = 449&amp;ndash;472 | pmid = 14946713 | issue = 4 | pmc = 1392213 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004717}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]] | title = The components of membrane conductance in the giant axon of Loligo | journal = J Physiol | year = 1952 | volume = 116 | pages= 473&amp;ndash;496 | pmid = 14946714 | issue = 4 | pmc = 1392209 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004718}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]] | title = The dual effect of membrane potential on sodium conductance in the giant axon of Loligo | journal = J Physiol | year = 1952 | volume = 116 | pages = 497&amp;ndash;506 | pmid = 14946715 | issue=4 | pmc=1392212 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004719}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]] | title = A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve | journal = J Physiol | year = 1952 | volume = 117 | pages = 500&amp;ndash;544 | pmid = 12991237 | issue = 4 | pmc = 1392413 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although qualitatively correct, the H-H model does not describe every type of excitable membrane accurately, since it considers only two ions (sodium and potassium), each with only one type of voltage-sensitive channel.

For such a purpose, detailed physiological models may be unnecessarily complicated and may obscure the "forest for the trees".

==Hodgkin–Huxley model==
{{main|Hodgkin–Huxley model}}

[[File:MembraneCircuit.svg|thumb|right|448px|Equivalent electrical circuit for the Hodgkin–Huxley model of the action potential. ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; represent the current through, and the voltage across, a small patch of membrane, respectively. The ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the capacitance of the membrane patch, whereas the four ''g'''s represent the [[electrical conductance|conductances]] of four types of ions. The two conductances on the left, for potassium (K) and sodium (Na), are shown with arrows to indicate that they can vary with the applied voltage, corresponding to the [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-sensitive ion channels]].]]

In 1952 [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] developed a set of equations to fit their experimental voltage-clamp data on the axonal membrane.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nelson ME, Rinzel J | year= 1994|chapter= The Hodgkin–Huxley Model|title=The Book of GENESIS: Exploring Realistic Neural Models with the GEneral NEural SImulation System|veditors=Bower J, Beeman D | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York|pages= 29–49 | chapterurl=http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/iBoG/iBoGpdf/chapt4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumes that the membrane capacitance ''C'' is constant; thus, the transmembrane voltage ''V'' changes with the total transmembrane current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; according to the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
C \frac{dV}{dt} = I_{\mathrm{tot}} = I_{\mathrm{ext}} + I_{\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\mathrm{K}} + I_{\mathrm{L}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; are currents conveyed through the local sodium channels, potassium channels, and "leakage" channels (a catch-all), respectively. The initial term ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; represents the current arriving from external sources, such as [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s from the dendrites or a scientist's electrode.

The model further assumes that a given ion channel is either fully open or closed; if closed, its [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] is zero, whereas if open, its conductance is some constant value ''g''. Hence, the net current through an ion channel depends on two variables: the probability ''p''&lt;sub&gt;open&lt;/sub&gt; of the channel being open, and the difference in voltage from that ion's equilibrium voltage, ''V'' &amp;minus; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, the current through the potassium channel may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
I_{\mathrm{K}} = g_{\mathrm{K}} \left( V - E_{\mathrm{K}} \right) p_{\mathrm{open, K}}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to [[Ohm's law]]. By definition, no net current flows (''I''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = 0) when the transmembrane voltage equals the equilibrium voltage of that ion (when ''V'' = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;).

To fit their data accurately, Hodgkin and Huxley assumed that each type of ion channel had multiple "gates", so that the channel was open only if all the gates were open and closed otherwise. They also assumed that the probability of a gate being open was independent of the other gates being open; this assumption was later validated for the inactivation gate.&lt;ref name="armstrong_1973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Armstrong CM, Bezanilla F, Rojas E | year = 1973 | title = Destruction of Sodium Conductance Inactivation in Squid Axons Perfused with Pronase |pmid=4755846 | journal = J.

Physiol. | volume = 262 | pages = 501&amp;ndash;531 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1976.sp011608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgkin and Huxley modeled the voltage-sensitive potassium channel as having four gates; letting ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the probability of a single such gate being open, the probability of the whole channel being open is the product of four such probabilities, i.e., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;open, K&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the probability of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel was modeled to have three similar gates of probability ''m'' and a fourth gate, associated with inactivation, of probability ''h''; thus, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;open, Na&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''h''. The probabilities for each gate are assumed to obey [[rate equation|first-order kinetics]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dm}{dt} = - \frac{m - m_{\mathrm{eq}}}{\tau_{m}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where both the equilibrium value ''m''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; and the relaxation time constant τ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; depend on the instantaneous voltage ''V'' across the membrane. If ''V'' changes on a time-scale more slowly than τ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''m'' probability will always roughly equal its equilibrium value ''m''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;; however, if ''V'' changes more quickly, then ''m'' will lag behind ''m''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. By fitting their voltage-clamp data, Hodgkin and Huxley were able to model how these equilibrium values and time constants varied with temperature and transmembrane voltage.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" /&gt; The formulae are complex and depend exponentially on the voltage and temperature. For example, the time constant for sodium-channel activation probability ''h'' varies as 3&lt;sup&gt;(θ&amp;minus;6.3)/10&lt;/sup&gt; with the Celsius temperature θ, and with voltage ''V'' as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\tau_{h}} = 0.07 e^{-V/20} + \frac{1}{1 + e^{3 - V/10}}.

In summary, the Hodgkin–Huxley equations are complex, non-linear [[ordinary differential equation]]s in four [[independent variable]]s: the transmembrane voltage ''V'', and the probabilities ''m'', ''h'' and ''n''.&lt;ref name="sato_2005" &gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sato S, Fukai H, Nomura T, Doi S | year = 2005 | chapter = Bifurcation Analysis of the Hodgkin–Huxley Equations | title = Modeling in the Neurosciences: From Biological Systems to Neuromimetic Robotics | edition = 2nd |veditors=Reeke GN, Poznanski RR, Lindsay KA, Rosenberg JR, Sporns O | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | isbn = 978-0-415-32868-5 | pages = 459&amp;ndash;478}}&lt;/ref&gt; No general solution of these equations has been discovered.

==Fitzhugh-Nagumo model==
{{main|Fitzhugh-Nagumo model}}

[[File:Negative differential resistance.svg|thumb|right|350px|Figure FHN: To mimick the action potential, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and its relatives use a function ''g''(''V'') with [[negative differential resistance]] (a negative slope on the ''I'' vs. ''V'' plot). For comparison, a normal resistor would have a positive slope, by [[Ohm's law]] ''I = GV'', where the [[electrical conductance|conductance]] ''G'' is the inverse of [[electrical resistance|resistance]] ''G''=1/''R''.]]

Because of the complexity of the Hodgkin–Huxley equations, various simplifications have been developed that exhibit qualitatively similar behavior.&lt;ref name="hoppensteadt_1986" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = FitzHugh R | year = 1960 | title = Thresholds and Plateaus in the Hodgkin-Huxley Nerve Equations | journal = J.

&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g(V)'' is a function of the voltage ''V'' that has a region of negative slope in the middle, flanked by one maximum and one minimum (Figure FHN). A much-studied simple case of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model is the Bonhoeffer-van der Pol nerve model, which is described by the equations&lt;ref name="bonhoeffer_vanderPol"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bonhoeffer KF | year = 1948 | title = ACTIVATION OF PASSIVE IRON AS A MODEL FOR THE EXCITATION OF NERVE | journal = J.

:&lt;math&gt;
C \frac{dV}{dt} = I - \epsilon \left(\frac{V^{3}}{3} - V \right),
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L\frac{dI}{dt} = - V
&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficient ε is assumed to be small. These equations can be combined into a second-order differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;
C \frac{d^{2}V}{dt^{2}} + \epsilon \left( V^{2} - 1 \right) \frac{dV}{dt} + \frac{V}{L} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

This [[van der Pol oscillator|van der Pol]] equation has stimulated much research in the mathematics of nonlinear [[dynamical system]]s. [[operational amplifier|Op-amp]] circuits that realize the FHN and van der Pol models of the action potential have been developed by Keener.&lt;ref name="keener_1983"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keener JP | year = 1983 | title = Analogue circuitry for the van der Pol and FitzHugh-Nagumo equations | journal = IEEE Trans. on Systems, Man and Cybernetics | volume = 13 | pages = 1010&amp;ndash;1014 | doi=10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hybrid of the Hodgkin–Huxley and FitzHugh–Nagumo models was developed by Morris and Lecar in 1981, and applied to the [[muscle]] fiber of [[barnacle]]s.&lt;ref name="morris_1981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris C, Lecar H | year = 1981 | title = Voltage oscillations in the barnacle giant muscle fiber | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 193&amp;ndash;213 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(81)84782-0 | pmc = 1327511 | pmid=7260316 | bibcode=1981BpJ....35..193M}}&lt;/ref&gt; True to the barnacle's physiology, the Morris–Lecar model replaces the voltage-gated sodium current of the Hodgkin–Huxley model with a voltage-dependent calcium current. There is no inactivation (no ''h'' variable) and the calcium current equilibrates instantaneously, so that again, there are only two time-dependent variables: the transmembrane voltage ''V'' and the potassium gate probability ''n''. The bursting, entrainment and other mathematical properties of this model have been studied in detail.&lt;ref name="rinzel_1989" &gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rinzel J, Ermentrout GB | year = 1989 | chapter = Analysis of Neural Excitability and Oscillations | title = Methods in Neuronal Modeling: From Synapses to Networks | editor = [[Christof Koch|C. Koch]], I Segev | publisher = Bradford Book, The MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 0-262-11133-0 | pages = 135&amp;ndash;169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest models of the action potential are the "flush and fill" models (also called "integrate-and-fire" models), in which the input signal is summed (the "fill" phase) until it reaches a threshold, firing a pulse and resetting the summation to zero (the "flush" phase).&lt;ref name="hoppensteadt_1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="keener_1981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keener JP, Hoppensteadt FC, Rinzel J | year = 1981 | title = Integrate-and-fire models of nerve membrane response to oscillatory input | journal = SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume = 41 | pages = 503&amp;ndash;517 | doi = 10.1137/0141042 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these models are capable of exhibiting [[entrainment (physics)|entrainment]], which is [[entrainment (biomusicology)|commonly observed]] in nervous systems.&lt;ref name="hoppensteadt_1986" /&gt;

==Extracellular potentials and currents==

Whereas the above models simulate the transmembrane voltage and current at a single patch of membrane, other mathematical models pertain to the voltages and currents in the ionic solution surrounding the neuron.&lt;ref name="stevens_1966" &gt;{{cite book | author = Stevens, Charles F. | year = 1966 | title = Neurophysiology: A Primer | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | location = New York | pages = 161&amp;ndash;173 | lccn = 66015872}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such models are helpful in interpreting data from extracellular electrodes, which were common prior to the invention of the glass pipette electrode that allowed intracellular recording.&lt;ref name="ling_1949" &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ling G, Gerard RW | year = 1949 | title = The normal membrane potential of frog sartorius fibers | journal = J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 383&amp;ndash;396 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.1030340304 | pmid=15410483}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extracellular medium may be modeled as a normal isotropic [[electrolyte|ionic solution]]; in such solutions, the current follows the [[electric field|electric]] [[field line]]s, according to the continuum form of [[Ohm's Law]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{j} = \sigma \mathbf{E}
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''j''' and '''E''' are vectors representing the [[current density]] and [[electric field]], respectively, and where σ is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  Thus, '''j''' can be found from '''E''', which in turn may be found using [[Maxwell's equations]].  Maxwell's equations can be reduced to a relatively simple problem of [[electrostatics]], since the ionic concentrations change too slowly (compared to the [[speed of light]]) for [[magnetic field|magnetic effects]] to be important.  The [[electric potential]] φ('''x''') at any extracellular point '''x''' can be solved using [[Green's identities]]&lt;ref name="stevens_1966" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{\mathrm{outside}}} \oint_{\mathrm{membrane}}
\frac{\partial}{\partial n} \frac{1}{\left| \mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol\xi \right|}
\left[ \sigma_{\mathrm{outside}} \phi_{\mathrm{outside}}(\boldsymbol\xi) - \sigma_{\mathrm{inside}}\phi_{\mathrm{inside}}(\boldsymbol\xi) \right] dS
&lt;/math&gt;

where the integration is over the complete surface of the membrane; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\xi&lt;/math&gt; is a position on the membrane, σ&lt;sub&gt;inside&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;inside&lt;/sub&gt; are the conductivity and potential just within the membrane, and σ&lt;sub&gt;outside&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;outside&lt;/sub&gt; the corresponding values just outside the membrane.  Thus, given these σ and φ values on the membrane, the extracellular potential φ('''x''') can be calculated for any position '''x'''; in turn, the electric field '''E''' and current density '''j''' can be calculated from this potential field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lorente de No R | year = 1947 | title = A Study of Nerve Physiology | journal = Stud.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9783">'''Rangeland management''' (also '''range management''', '''range science''', or '''arid-land management''') is a professional [[natural science]] that centers around the study of [[rangeland]]s and the "conservation and sustainable management [of Arid-Lands] for the benefit of current societies and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangelands.org/ Society for range Management. Society for Range Management, 2016. Web. 22 Apr. 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; Range management is defined by Holechek et al. as the "manipulation of rangeland components to obtain optimum combination of [[Ecosystem services|goods and services]] for society on a sustained basis."&lt;ref&gt;Holechek, Jerry L., Rex D. Pieper, and Carlton H. Herbel. Range Management: Principles and Practices (6th Edition). 6th ed. N.p.: Pearson, 2011. 5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest form of Rangeland Management is not formally deemed part of the natural science studied today, although its roots can be traced to [[Nomad|nomadic grazing]] practices of the [[neolithic agricultural revolution]] when humans [[Domestication|domesticated]] plants and animals under pressures from population growth and environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Ecological History of Agriculture 10,000 B.C.-A.D. 10,000|last=Vasey|first=Daniel A.|publisher=Iowa State University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Ames, Iowa|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans might even have altered the environment in times preceding the  [[Neolithic]] through hunting of [[Big-game hunting|large-game]], whereby large losses of [[Grazing|grazing herbivores]] could have resulted in altered ecological states; meaning humans have been inadvertently managing land throughout prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wroe , Judith Field , Richard Fullagar , Lars S. Jermin. "Megafaunal extinction in the late Quaternary and the global overkill hypothesis." ''Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.'' Vol. 28, Iss. 1, (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazoyer, Marcel, and Laurence Roudart. ''A History of World Agriculture: From the Neolithic Age to the Current Crisis''. New York: Monthly review Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rangeland management was developed in the United States in response to rangeland deterioration and in some cases, [[denudation]], due to [[overgrazing]] and other misuse of arid lands, as was described by [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin]]’s 1968 "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" and evidenced previously by the 20th century "[[Dust Bowl]]".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Melvin S. "History of Range Management Education." Rangelands 3.3 (1981): 119-20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, M W., and F P. Cronemiller. "Some of the Beginnings of Range Management." Journal of Range Management 14.2 (1961): 95-102. Print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathan F. Sayre, William deBuys, Brandon T. Bestelmeyer, and Kris M. Havstad. "’The Range  Problem’ After a Century of Rangeland Science: New Research Themes for Altered  Landscapes." Rangeland Ecol Manage 545-552: 65 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the discipline focused on the manipulation of [[grazing]] and the proper use of rangeland vegetation for [[livestock]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Kenneth W., W R. Chapline, Lloyd W. Swift, George W. Craddock, and Donald R. Cornelius. "Arthur W. Sampson- Pioneer Range Scientist." Journal of Range Management 20.6 (1967): 245-351. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern application==
Today, range management's focus has been expanded to include the host of [[ecosystem services]] that rangelands provide to humans world-wide. Key management components seek to optimize such goods and services through the protection and enhancement of [[soils]], [[riparian zones]], [[Drainage basin|watersheds]], and vegetation complexes, [[sustainably]] improving outputs of consumable range products such as [[red meat]], [[wildlife]], water, wood, [[fiber]], [[leather]], energy resource extraction, and [[outdoor recreation]], as well as maintaining a focus on the [[Grazing management|manipulation of grazing]] activities of large herbivores to maintain or improve animal and plant production.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Herrick, J.R. Brown, B.T. Bestelmeyer, S.S. Andrews, G. Baldi, J. Davies, M. Duniway, K.M.  Havstad, J.W. Karl, D.L. Karlen, D.P.C. Peters, J.N. Quinton, C. Riginos, P.L. Shaver, D. Stainaker, S. Twomlow. “Revolutionary Land Use Change in the 21st Century: Is (Rangeland) Science Relevant? Rangeland Ecol Manage 590-598: 65 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society for Range Management [http://www.rangelands.org/] is "the professional society dedicated to supporting persons who work with rangelands and have a commitment to their sustainable use." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rangelands.org/|title=Society for Range Management|website=www.rangelands.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary Rangeland Management publications include the ''Journal of Range Management'', ''Rangelands'', and ''Rangeland Ecology &amp; Management''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rangelands.org/publications.shtml|title=Publications|website=www.rangelands.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pastoralism]] has become a contemporary anthropological and ecological study as it faces many threats including fragmentation of land, conversion of rangeland into urban development, lack of grazing movement, impending threats on global diversity, damage to species with large terrain, decreases in shared public goods, decreased [[Animal migration|biological movements]], threats of a "tragedy of enclosures", limitation of key resources, reduced biomass and invasive plant species growth.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Robin S.; Fernández-Giménes, María E.; Galvin, Kathleen A. “Dynamics and Resilience of Rangelands and Pastoral Peoples Around the Globe.” ''Annu. Rev. Environ. Resource''. 39:217-249 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in contemporary pastoralist cultures like the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] has continued to increase, especially because the traditional syncreticly-adaptive ability of pastoralists could promise lessons in collaborative and [[adaptive management]] for contemporary pastoralist societies threatened by [[globalization]] as well as for contemporary non-pastoralist societies that are managing livestock on rangelands.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Robin S.; Fernández-Giménes, María E.; Galvin, Kathleen A. “Dynamics and Resilience of Rangelands and Pastoral Peoples Around the Globe.” ''Annu. Rev. Environ. Resource''. 39:217-249 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briske, D.D.; Sayre, Nathan F.; Huntsoinger; Fernandez-Gimenez, M.; Budd, B.; Derner, J.D. “Origin, Persistence, and Resolution of the Rotational Grazing Debate: Integrating Human Dimensions Into Rangeland research.” ''Rangeland Ecol Manage''. 64(4): 325-334 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and employment==
In the United States, the study of range science is commonly offered at [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] including [[New Mexico State University]], [[Colorado State University]], [[Oregon State University]], [[South Dakota State University]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]], [[Texas Tech University]], the [[University of Arizona]], the [[University of Idaho]], the [[University of Wyoming]], [[Utah State University]], and [[Montana State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangelands.org/education_universities.shtml Society for Range Management. Society for Range Management Universities and Colleges, 2016. Web. 22 Apr. 2016. ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Range Science curriculum is strongly tied to [[animal science]], as well as [[plant ecology]], [[soil science]], [[wildlife management]], [[climatology]] and [[anthropology]]. Courses in a typical Range Science curriculum may include [[ethology]], range [[animal nutrition]], [[plant physiology]], [[plant ecology]], [[plant identification]], [[plant communities]], [[microbiology]], [[soil sciences]], [[fire control]], [[agricultural economics]], [[Wildlife management|wildlife ecology]], [[ranch management]], [[Socioeconomics]], [[cartography]], [[hydrology]], [[Ecophysiology]], and [[environmental policy]]. These courses are essential to entering a range science profession.

Students with degrees in range science are eligible for a host of technician-type careers working for the federal government under the [[Bureau of Land Management]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], the [[Agricultural Research Service]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]], or the [[US Forest Service]] as range conservationists, inventory technicians, range monitoring/animal science agents, field botanists, natural-resource technicians, vegetation/habitat monitors, [[Geographic information system|GIS]] programming assistants, general range technicians, and as [[Ecological technology|ecological]] assessors, as well as working in the private sector as range managers, [[Rancher|ranch managers]], producers, commercial consultants, mining and agricultural real estate agents, or as Range/ Ranch Consultants. Individuals who complete degrees at the [[Master's degree|M.S.]] or [[Doctor of Philosophy|P.h.D.]] level, can seek academic careers as [[professor]]s, [[Agricultural extension|extension specialists]], research assistants, and [[Adjunct professor|adjunct]] staff, in addition to a number of professional research positions for government agencies such as the [[US Department of Agriculture]] and other state run departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rangelands.org/jobs/listings.html#free Society for Range Management.

'''ReadyBoost''' (codenamed '''EMD'''&lt;ref name="FeatureNames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ianm/archive/2006/04/06/569715.aspx |title=SuperFetch, ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive: some new feature names for you |last=Moulster |first=Ian |date=April 6, 2006 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=MSDN Blogs |accessdate=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[cache (computing)|disk caching]] software component developed by [[Microsoft]] for [[Windows Vista]] and included in later versions of the [[Windows (operating system)|Windows]] [[operating system]]. ReadyBoost enables [[flash memory|NAND memory]] [[mass storage]] devices, including [[CompactFlash]], [[Secure Digital card|SD card]]s, and [[USB flash drive]]s, to be used as a [[cache (computing)|write cache]] between a [[hard drive]] and [[random access memory]] in an effort to increase computing performance. ReadyBoost relies on the [[Windows Vista I/O technologies#SuperFetch|SuperFetch]] technology and, like SuperFetch, adjusts its cache based on user activity. Other features, including [[Windows Vista I/O technologies#ReadyDrive|ReadyDrive]], are implemented in a manner similar to ReadyBoost.&lt;ref name="KernelChanges"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/f/d/afdfd50d-6eb9-425e-84e1-b4085a80e34e/SYS-T512_WH07.pptx |title=Windows Vista Kernel Changes |last=Russinovich |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Russinovich |date=2007 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912235324/http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/f/d/afdfd50d-6eb9-425e-84e1-b4085a80e34e/SYS-T512_WH07.pptx |archivedate=September 12, 2007 |format=PPTX |accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Using ReadyBoost-capable flash memory ([[NAND flash|NAND memory]] devices) for caching allows [[Windows Vista]] and later to service random disk reads with better performance than without the cache. This caching applies to all disk content, not just the page file or system DLLs. Flash devices typically are slower than a mechanical hard disk for sequential I/O, so, to maximize performance, ReadyBoost includes logic that recognizes large, sequential read requests and has the hard disk service these requests.&lt;ref name="QnA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/tomarcher/archive/2006/06/02/615199.aspx |title=ReadyBoost Q&amp;A |accessdate=2008-01-11 |last=Archer |first=Tom |author2=Ayers, Matt  |date=2006-06-02 |work=Tom Archer's Blog |publisher=[[MSDN Blogs]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a compatible device is plugged in, the Windows [[AutoPlay]] dialog offers an additional option to use the flash drive to speed up the system; an additional '''ReadyBoost''' tab is added to the drive's properties dialog where the amount of space to be used can be configured.&lt;ref name="readyboostJim Allchin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/tomarcher/archive/2006/04/14/576548.aspx |title=ReadyBoost - Using Your USB Key to Speed Up Windows Vista |date=April 14, 2006 |accessdate=2006-05-21 |author=Tom Archer |work=Tom Archer's Blog |publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum cache size is 250&amp;nbsp;MB. In Vista or with FAT32 formatting of the drive, the maximum is 4&amp;nbsp;GB. In Windows 7 with NTFS or exFAT formatting, the maximum cache size is 32&amp;nbsp;GB per device. Windows Vista allows only one device to be used, while Windows 7 allows multiple caches, one per device, up to a total of 256&amp;nbsp;GB.&lt;ref name="readyboostMarius Oiaga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-7-RTM-ReadyBoost-256-GB-of-Memory-Cache-Support-124081.shtml |title=Windows 7 RTM ReadyBoost 256 GB of Memory Cache Support |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=2013-01-09 |author=Marius Oiaga |work=SOFTPEDIA |publisher=SoftNews NET SRL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ReadyBoost compresses and encrypts all data that is placed on the flash device with [[AES-128]]; Microsoft has stated that a 2:1 compression ratio is typical, so a 4&amp;nbsp;GB cache would usually contain 8&amp;nbsp;GB of data.&lt;ref name="russinovich"&gt;{{cite web

== Requirements ==
For a device to be compatible and useful, it must conform to these requirements:
* The removable media's capacity must be at least 256&amp;nbsp;MB&lt;ref name=understand /&gt; (250&amp;nbsp;MB after formatting, [[Windows 7]] reports in its Event Log a required minimum of 235&amp;nbsp;MB).
* [[Windows 7]] allows up to eight devices for a maximum of 256&amp;nbsp;GB of additional memory,&lt;ref name="readyboostwin7"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Windows 7 features - ReadyBoost - Microsoft Windows

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 32&amp;nbsp;GB on a single storage device.&lt;ref name="speed-up-your-computer"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2012-01-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The device must have an access time of 1&amp;nbsp;ms or less.
* The device must be capable of 2.5&amp;nbsp;MB/s read speeds for 4&amp;nbsp;kB random reads spread uniformly across the entire device, and 1.75&amp;nbsp;MB/s write speeds for 512&amp;nbsp;kB random writes spread uniformly across the device.&lt;ref name="is-your-flash-drive-fast-enough"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Is your flash drive fast enough for Vista's ReadyBoost?
|author=Ed Bott, ZDNet
|accessdate=2012-01-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Microsoft Windows Client Performance group recommends a flash-memory-to-system-RAM ratio of between 1:1 and 2.5:1.&lt;ref name="QnA" /&gt;

Other considerations:
* Vista's ReadyBoost supports [[NTFS]], [[File Allocation Table|FAT16, and FAT32]] from SP1 onwards.  [[Windows 7]] also supports the newer [[exFAT]] file system.  As the ReadyBoost cache is stored as a file, the flash drive must be formatted as FAT32, NTFS, or exFAT in order to have a cache size greater than FAT16's 2&amp;nbsp;GB filesize limit; if the desired cache size is 4&amp;nbsp;GB (the FAT32 filesize limit) or larger, the drive must be formatted as NTFS or exFAT.  The performance differences between these file systems are negligible with ReadyBoost.
* The initial release of ReadyBoost for Windows Vista supported one device. Windows 7 supports multiple flash drives for ReadyBoost, so performance improvement similar to [[RAID#Standard levels|RAID&amp;nbsp;0]] can be expected.
* The ReadyBoost algorithm was improved in Windows 7, resulting in better performance. One experiment showed reading of flash memory up to 5–10 times faster than Windows Vista due to higher hit rate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* Because ReadyBoost stores its cache as a file on the root directory of the drive rather than using the flash memory without a file system, the file system must be [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] and [[Drive letter assignment|assigned a drive letter]]. The ReadyBoost cache is created on the [[Root directory#Multiple root directories|root directory]] of the drive.
* If the system drive (the primary drive, with Windows system files on it) is a solid-state drive (SSD), ReadyBoost is disabled, since reading from that drive would be at least as fast as reading from the ReadyBoost drive.&lt;ref name=understand&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=[[TechNet Magazine]]|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff356869.aspx|title=Understand ReadyBoost and whether it will Speed Up your System|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ReadyBoost caches all data as it is being written to the local hard disk: "the Ecache.sys device driver intercepts all reads and writes to local hard disk volumes (C:\, for example), and copies any data being written into the caching file that the service created."&lt;ref name="russinovich"/&gt; [[Windows Vista I/O technologies#SuperFetch|SuperFetch]] pre-populates frequently-read data into ReadyBoost cache, so SuperFetch is necessary for ReadyBoost to perform well.&lt;ref name="robbiebench"&gt;{{cite web|title=ReadyBoost - Robbie's Benchmark|url=http://www.fandecheng.com/archives/397|date=14 April 2012|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jim Allchin]], for future releases of Windows, ReadyBoost will be able to use spare RAM on other networked Windows PCs.&lt;ref name="readyboostarcher"&gt;{{cite web

== Performance ==
A system with 512&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM (the minimum requirement for Windows Vista) can see significant gains from ReadyBoost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandtech.com/systems/showdoc.aspx?i=2917&amp;p=5 AnandTech: Windows Vista Performance Guide&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, Patrick. [http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/windows-vista-superfetch-and-readyboostanalyzed,1532-6.html "Windows Vista's SuperFetch and ReadyBoost Analyzed:] Conclusion." Toms Hardware. 2007-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In one test case, adding 1&amp;nbsp;GB of ReadyBoost memory sped up an operation from 11.7 seconds to 2 seconds. However, increasing the physical memory (RAM) from 512&amp;nbsp;MB to 1&amp;nbsp;GB (without ReadyBoost) reduced it to 0.8 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandtech.com/systems/showdoc.aspx?i=2917&amp;p=6 AnandTech: Windows Vista Performance Guide&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; System performance with ReadyBoost can be monitored by Windows Performance Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Greg. [http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/window-on-windows/keep-tabs-on-readyboost-with-windows-7s-performance-monitor/2257 "Keep tabs on ReadyBoost with Windows 7's Performance Monitor."] ''TechRepublic.'' 2010-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt; As the price of RAM decreased and more RAM was installed in computers, the mitigations provided by ReadyBoost to systems with insufficient memory decreased.

The core idea of ReadyBoost is that a [[flash memory]] (e.g. a [[USB flash drive]] or an [[Solid-state drive|SSD]]) have a much faster seek time than a typical magnetic hard disk (less than 1&amp;nbsp;ms), allowing it to satisfy requests faster than reading files from the hard disk. It also leverages the inherent advantage of two parallel sources from which to read data, whereas Windows 7 enables the use of up to eight flash drives at once, allowing up to nine parallel sources. [[Universal Serial Bus#USB 2.0|USB 2.0]] flash drives are slower for ''sequential'' reads and writes than modern desktop hard drives. Desktop hard drives can sustain anywhere from 2 to 10 times the transfer speed of USB 2.0 flash drives but are equal to or slower than [[USB 3.0]] and [[IEEE 1394 interface|Firewire (IEEE 1394)]] for sequential data. USB 2.0 and faster flash drives have faster ''random access'' times: typically around 1&amp;nbsp;ms, compared to 12&amp;nbsp;ms for mainstream desktop hard drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = June 2010 | url = http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=140 | title = WD Scorpio Blue Mobile: Drive Specifications | publisher = [[Western Digital]] | accessdate = 15 January 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110105162632/http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=140 | archivedate = 5 January 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- High-cost ($500-$20,000) solid state mass storage currently has random sustained external throughput up to 3&amp;nbsp;GB/s (TMS RamSan) and latency as low as 0.003 ms (Violin 1010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storagesearch.com/ssd-fastest.html the Fastest Solid State Disks (SSDs) 1.8&amp;quot;, 2.5&amp;quot; to 3U]&lt;/ref&gt;
 --&gt;
On [[laptop]] computers, the performance shifts more in favor of flash memory when laptop memory is more expensive than desktop memory; many laptops also have relatively slow 4200&amp;nbsp;rpm and 5400&amp;nbsp;rpm hard drives.

In versions of Vista prior to SP1, ReadyBoost failed to recognize its cache data upon resume from sleep, and restarted the caching process, making ReadyBoost ineffective on machines undergoing frequent sleep/wake cycles. This problem was fixed in Vista SP1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istartedsomething.com/20070709/vista-sp1-readyboost-bug/ Vista SP1 will fix critical ReadyBoost performance bug&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations==
Since flash drives wear out after a finite (though very large) number of writes, ReadyBoost will eventually wear out the drive it uses. According to the Microsoft Windows Client Performance group, the drive should be able to operate for at least ten years.&lt;ref name="QnA" /&gt;

'''Reformism''' is a political doctrine advocating the [[reform]] of an existing system or institution instead of its abolition and replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/reformism | title=Reformism | author=Collins English Dictionary | year= | website= | publisher=HarperCollins Publishers | accessdate=8 August 2017 | quote= a doctrine or movement advocating reform, esp political or religious reform, rather than abolition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[socialist]] movement, reformism is the view that gradual changes through existing institutions can eventually lead to fundamental changes in a society’s [[Political system|political]] and [[economic system]]s. Reformism as a political tendency and hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that revolutionary upheaval is a necessary precondition for the structural changes necessary to transform a [[capitalist]] system to a qualitatively different socialist economic system.

As a doctrine, reformism is distinguished from the act of pragmatic reform: pragmatic reform aims to safeguard and permeate the status quo by preventing fundamental structural changes to it, whereas reformism posits that an accumulation of reforms can eventually lead to the emergence of entirely different economic and political systems than those of present-day capitalism and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today and Jesus followers | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | website= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are two types of reformism. One has no intention of bringing about socialism or fundamental economic change to society and is used to oppose such structural changes. The other is based on the assumption that while reforms are not socialist in themselves, they can help rally supporters to the cause of revolution by popularizing the cause of socialism to the working class.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate on the ability for [[social democratic]] reformism to lead to a socialist transformation of society is over a century old.

Reformism is criticized for being paradoxical: it seeks to overcome the existing economic system of capitalism, but it tries to improve the conditions of capitalism thereby making it appear more tolerable to society. According to [[Rosa Luxemburg]], under reformism, "(capitalism) is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1973/01/reform.htm | title=Do We Support Reformist Demands? | author=Duncan Hallas | year=1973 | website=Controversy: Do we support reformist demands? | publisher=International Socialism | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Stan Parker of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] argues that reforms are a diversion of energy for socialists and are limited because they must adhere to the logic of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French social theorist [[Andre Gorz]] criticized reformism by advocating a third alternative to reformism and social revolution that he called "non-reformist reforms", specifically focused on structural changes to capitalism, as opposed to reforms for improve living conditions within capitalism or to prop it up through economic interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/363/do-we-need-reform-or-revolution |title=Do we need reform of revolution?|author=Lois Clifton |date=November 2011 |publisher=Socialist Review |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1875 [[German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) adopted a [[Gotha Program]] that proposed "every lawful means" on a way to a "socialist society" and was criticized by [[Karl Marx]] who considered the [[communist revolution]] a required step. One of the delegates to the SPD congress,  [[Eduard Bernstein]], expanded on the concept, proposing ''evolutionary socialism''. Bernstein was a leading [[social democracy|social democrat]] in Germany. Reformism was quickly targeted by [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]], with [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemning Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Reform or Revolution?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm Rosa Luxemburg. ''Reform or Revolution'' (1900)]&lt;/ref&gt; While Luxemburg died in the [[German Revolution]], the reformists soon found themselves contending with the [[Bolsheviks]] and their satellite [[Communism|communist]] parties for the support of intellectuals and the [[working class]].

In 1959, the [[Godesberg Program]] (signed at a party convention in the West German capital of [[Bad Godesberg]]) marked the shift of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) from a Marxist program espousing an end to capitalism to a reformist one focused on social reform.

After [[Joseph Stalin]] consolidated power in the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Comintern]] launched a campaign against the Reformist movement by denouncing them as "[[Social fascism|social fascists]]".  According to ''[[The God that Failed]]'' by [[Arthur Koestler]], a former member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]], the largest communist party in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Interwar period]], communists, aligned with the [[Soviet Union]], continued to consider the "social fascist" Social Democratic Party of Germany to be the real enemy in [[Germany]], even after the [[Nazi Party]] had gotten into power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler|Koestler, Arthur]]. ''[[The God That Failed]].'' Edited by [[Richard Crossman]]. Bantam Matrix, Tenth Edition. pp 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, reformists are seen as [[centre-left]]. Some social democratic parties, such as the Canadian [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, are still considered to be reformist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/dowson/ndp.html#3|title=The Socialist Vanguard and the New Democratic Party|last=Dowson|first=Ross|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformism in the British Labour Party==
The term was applied to elements within the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the 1950s and subsequently, on the party's right. [[Anthony Crosland]] wrote ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956) as a personal manifesto arguing for a reformulation of the term. For Crosland, the relevance of [[nationalization]] (or [[public ownership]]) for socialists was much reduced as a consequence of contemporary [[full employment]], [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] management of the economy and reduced [[capitalism|capitalist]] exploitation. In 1960, after the third successive defeat of his party in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 General Election]] [[Hugh Gaitskell]] attempted to reformulate the original wording of [[Clause IV]] in the party's constitution, but proved unsuccessful.

Some of the younger followers of Gaitskell, principally [[Roy Jenkins]], [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]] left the Labour Party in 1981 to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], but the central objective of the [[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellites]] was eventually achieved by [[Tony Blair]] in his successful attempt to rewrite Clause IV in 1995.

The use of the term is distinguished from the [[gradualism]] associated with [[Fabianism]] (the ideology of the [[Fabian Society]]), which itself should not be seen as being in parallel with the revisionism associated with Bernstein and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, as originally the Fabians had explicitly rejected [[Marxism]].

A '''reusable bottle''' is a [[bottle]] that can be [[reuse]]d, as in the case as by the original bottler or by end-use consumers. Reusable bottles have grown in popularity by consumers for both environmental and health safety reasons. Reusable bottles are one example of [[reusable packaging]].

==Background, history==
[[File:Goupillon epicier.jpg|thumb|Assortment of cleaning brushes, including bottle brushes]]
Early [[glass bottle]]s were often reused, such as for milk, water, beer, soft drinks, yogurt, and other uses.  [[Mason jar]]s, for example, were developed and reused for home canning purposes.

With returnable bottles, a retailer would often collect empty bottles or would accept empty bottles returned by customers.  Bottles would be stored and returned to the bottler in reusable cases or crates. Some regions have a [[container deposit]] which is refunded after returning the bottle to the retailer. At the bottler, the bottles would be inspected for damage, cleaned, sanitized, and refilled.

More recently, many bottles have been designed for [[disposable|single-use]].  This often allows for thinner glass bottles and less expensive [[plastic bottle]]s and aluminum [[beverage can]]s.  On a cost basis, the decision has often been made for non-returnable bottles.

==Environmental consequences==
[[File:Waste hierarchy rect-en.svg|right|thumb|The [[waste hierarchy]]]]
The reuse of containers is often thought of as being a step toward more [[sustainable packaging]].  Reuse sits high on the [[waste hierarchy]].  When a container is used multiple times, the material required per use or per filling cycle is reduced.

Many potential factors are involved in environmental comparisons of returnable vs. non-returnable systems.  Researchers have often used [[life cycle analysis]] methodologies to balance the many diverse considerations.  Some comparisons show no clear winner but rather show a realistic view of a complex subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Singh|first=J | author2 =Krasowski, Singh  |date=January 2011 |title= Life cycle inventory of HDPE bottle-based liquid milk packaging systems

Arguments in favor of reusing bottles, or recycling them into other products, are compelling. It is estimated that in the U.S. alone, consumers use 1,500 plastic water bottles every single second. But only about 23% of [[PET plastic]], which is the plastic used in disposable plastic water bottles, gets recycled. Thus, about 38 billion water bottles are thrown away annually, equating to roughly $1 billion worth of plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/norm-schriever/post_5218_b_3613577.html|title=Plastic Water Bottles Causing Flood of Harm to Our Environment.|last=Schriever|first=Norm|date=2013-07-29|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average American spends $242 per year per person on disposable, single use plastic water bottles. The environmental and cost consequences associated with disposable plastic water bottles are a strong argument for reusing bottles.

==Bottles intended for reuse by households==

Reusable drinking bottles for water, coffee, salad dressing, soup, baby formula, and other beverages have gained in popularity by consumers in recent years, undoubtedly due to the costs and environmental problems associated with single use plastic water bottles and those used for other beverages. Common materials used to make reusable drinking bottles include glass, aluminum, stainless steel, and plastic. Reusable bottles include both single and double wall insulated bottles. Some baby bottles have an inner bag or bladder that can be replaced after each use.

==Health and safety concerns associated with reusable bottles==
=== Bacterial concerns ===
Reusable bottles can hold bacteria. Drinking from a reusable bottle can transfer bacteria from a person's mouth to the beverage it contains, which can contaminate both bottle and water. Contamination can cause bacterial or fungal growth in the liquid while it's stored. It is recommend that users clean reusable drinking bottles thoroughly before each used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Chemicals, Nutrients, Additives, &amp; Toxins: Plastic water bottles|url=http://www.foodsmart.govt.nz/whats-in-our-food/chemicals-nutrients-additives-toxins/plastic-packaging/water-bottles.htm|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users should take care to wash the [[bottle cap]] as well after each use for proper sanitation.

Some experts state that there's generally no harm in reusing your own drinking bottle, but the risk for ingesting harmful bacteria increases if you share your bottle with others. University of Nebraska Medical Center Microbiologist Pete Iwen, Ph.D., says, “If it’s my bottle, my germs, I probably would not be all that paranoid about reusing the bottle. The main issue occurs when sharing bottles. Microbes present in my mouth may be harmful to others.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNMC expert says wash reused water bottles to avoid bacteria, viruses; don't share them|url=http://app1.unmc.edu/publicaffairs/TodaySite/newsreleases/view_art.cfm?article_id=1290|website=University of Nebraska Medical Center|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical concerns ===
Plastic drinking bottles often contain the chemical [[Bisphenol A]] (BPA), which is made from [[polycarbonate]] and which shares [[resin identification code]] 7 with other plastics. Another chemical found in plastic drinking bottles is [[phthalate]]. Both of these chemicals are controversial because they are known [[endocrine disruptor]]s, which can interfere with the body's hormonal system.

A study by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) found that participants who drank from polycarbonate bottles – which is the plastic commonly used in disposable plastic water bottles, other plastic drinking bottles, and baby bottles – for just one week showed a two-thirds increase in their urine of the chemical BPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/bpa-chemical-plastics-leach-polycarbonate-drinking-bottles-humans/|title=BPA, chemical used to make plastics, found to leach from polycarbonate drinking bottles Into humans|date=2009-05-21|work=News|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to BPA has been shown to interfere with reproductive development in animals and has been linked with cardiovascular disease and diabetes in humans. The study is the first to show that drinking from polycarbonate bottles increased the level of urinary BPA, and thus suggests that drinking containers made with BPA release the chemical into the liquid they contain, which people then  consume. The amount of BPA consumed as a result of drinking from plastic bottles was enough to increase the level of BPA excreted in the urine of the people who drank from those containers.

Other studies have shown that even BPA-free plastic bottles leach harmful chemicals into the liquids they contain, making the argument that the safest reusable drinking bottles are those made with either glass or stainless steel. Glass is non-toxic and inert, so it does not leach into the liquid that it contains, and stainless steel is one of the most inert metals, therefore it has a lower likelihood of leaching chemicals into the beverages it contains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uniguide.com/bpa-free-water-bottles-glass-stainless-steel/|title=23 Best BPA Free Water Bottles: Glass, Stainless Steel &amp; Eco-Friendly {{!}} UniGuide|last=Stanton|first=Kristen M.|date=2018-08-20|work=UniGuide|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bisphenol A#Government and industry response|Several countries]] have banned the use of plastics containing BPA used for water and other food items. Leaching of [[phthalate]]s from [[PVC]] (resin identification code 3) is also a concern, but PVC is no longer used for water bottles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Another common material used to make reusable drinking bottles is aluminum. However, aluminum also has health safety concerns. A study by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health found that aluminum levels were over 20-times higher in the elderly than in middle aged people. The study cited a correlation between aluminum levels and “densities of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.” Furthermore, it found that lowering the amount of brain aluminum by using [[Chelation therapy|chelation]] was shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jansson|first=Erik T.|date=December 2001|title=Aluminum exposure and Alzheimer's disease|journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease|volume=3|issue=6|pages=541–549|issn=1875-8908|pmid=12214020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an argument in favor or lessening the amount of aluminum that the body is exposed to, hence making it a less favorable material for reusable drinking bottles.

===Carcinogen misconception===
A university student's master's thesis incorrectly suggested that repeatedly rewashing plastic water bottles can lead to the leaking [[diethylhydroxylamine]] (DEHA) into the drinking water, and can be detrimental to human health.&lt;ref name=Lilya&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Lilya|first=Deena|pages=180|title=Analysis and risk assessment of organic chemical migration from reused PET plastic bottles|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AyShD4Xb?url=http://www.riskworld.com/abstract/2001/sraam01/ab01aa189.htm|archivedate=2012-09-26|url=http://www.riskworld.com/abstract/2001/sraam01/ab01aa189.htm|oclc=49613368|year=2001|access-date=2012-09-26|dead-url=no|df=|type=Master's thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this research were repeated by various sources and also became a [[chain email]], later declared to be a hoax.&lt;ref name=CR-UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=cancerhoax&gt;{{Cite web|title=Reusing Plastic Bottles Causes Cancer Hoax|url=http://www.hoax-slayer.com/plastic-bottles-cancer.html|publisher=Hoax-Slayer.com|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACC-FAQ&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plasticsinfo.org/Functional-Nav/FAQs/Beverage-Bottles|title=FAQs: The Safety of Plastic Beverage Bottles|work=[[American Chemistry Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Cancer Society]] and  [[Cancer Research UK]] have stated that [[diethylhydroxylamine|DEHA]] is not present in plastic water bottles; even if it were, it is not a known [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref name=CR-UK&gt;{{cite web|title=Plastic bottles|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/healthyliving/cancercontroversies/Plasticbottles/|work=[[Cancer Research UK]]|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/HowWeHelpYou/plasticwaterbottles|title=Plastic Water Bottles|work=[[American Cancer Society]]|archivedate=2012-10-07|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BDyVBbRe?url=http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/HowWeHelpYou/plasticwaterbottles|access-date=2012-09-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10956">In the theory of [[general relativity]], a '''stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor''', such as the '''Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor''', is an extension of the non-gravitational [[stress–energy tensor]] which incorporates the [[energy–momentum]] of gravity. It allows the [[energy–momentum]] of a system of gravitating matter to be defined. In particular it allows the total of matter plus the gravitating energy–momentum to form a [[conserved current]] within the framework of [[general relativity]], so that the ''total'' energy–momentum crossing the [[hypersurface]] (3-dimensional boundary) of ''any'' compact [[space–time]] [[hypervolume]] (4-dimensional submanifold) vanishes.

Some people (such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]]{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}) have objected to this derivation on the grounds that [[pseudotensor]]s are inappropriate objects in general relativity, but the conservation law only requires the use of the 4-[[divergence]] of a pseudotensor which is, in this case, a tensor (which also vanishes). Also, most pseudotensors are sections of [[jet bundle]]s, which are now recognized as perfectly valid objects in GR.

==Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor&lt;!--'Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor' and 'Landau-Lifshitz pseudotensor' redirect here--&gt;==
The use of the '''Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, a stress–energy–momentum [[pseudotensor]] for combined matter (including photons and neutrinos) plus gravity,&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;[[Lev Davidovich Landau]] and [[Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz]], ''The Classical Theory of Fields'', (1951), Pergamon Press, {{ISBN|7-5062-4256-7}} chapter 11, section #96&lt;/ref&gt; allows the energy–momentum conservation laws to be extended into [[general relativity]].  Subtraction of the matter [[stress–energy–momentum tensor]] from the combined pseudotensor results in the gravitational stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor.

===Requirements===
[[Lev Davidovich Landau|Landau]] and [[Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] were led by four requirements in their search for a gravitational energy momentum pseudotensor, &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;
# that it be constructed entirely from the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], so as to be purely geometrical or gravitational in origin.
# that it be index symmetric, i.e. &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} = t_{LL}^{\nu \mu} \,&lt;/math&gt;, (to conserve [[angular momentum]])
# that, when added to the [[stress–energy tensor]] of matter, &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, its total 4-[[divergence]] vanishes (this is required of any [[conserved current]]) so that we have a conserved expression for the total stress–energy–momentum.
# that it vanish locally in an [[inertial frame of reference]] (which requires that it only contains first and not second or higher [[derivative]]s of the metric). This is because the [[equivalence principle]] requires that the gravitational force field, the [[Christoffel symbols]], vanish locally in some frame. If gravitational energy is a function of its force field, as is usual for other forces, then the associated gravitational pseudotensor should also vanish locally.

===Definition===
Landau &amp; Lifshitz showed that there is a unique construction that satisfies these requirements, namely

:&lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} = - \frac{c^4}{8\pi G}G^{\mu \nu} + \frac{c^4}{16\pi G (-g)}((-g)(g^{\mu \nu}g^{\alpha \beta} - g^{\mu \alpha}g^{\nu \beta}))_{,\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* ''G''&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Einstein tensor]] (which is constructed from the metric)
* ''g''&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt; is the inverse of the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]
* ''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;det(''g''&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[determinant]] of the metric tensor and is &lt; 0.  Hence its appearance as &lt;math&gt;-g &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;,_{\alpha \beta} =  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^{\alpha} \partial x^{\beta}}\,&lt;/math&gt; are [[partial derivative]]s, not [[covariant derivative]]s.
* ''G'' is Newton's [[gravitational constant]].

===Verification===
Examining the 4 requirement conditions we can see that the first 3 are relatively easy to demonstrate:
#Since the Einstein tensor, &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, is itself constructed from the metric, so therefore is &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt;
#Since the Einstein tensor, &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, is symmetric so is &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt; since the additional terms are symmetric by inspection.
#The Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor is constructed so that when added to the [[stress–energy tensor]] of matter, &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, its total 4-[[divergence]] vanishes: &lt;math&gt;((-g)(T^{\mu \nu} + t_{LL}^{\mu \nu}))_{,\mu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. This follows from the cancellation of the Einstein tensor, &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[stress–energy tensor]], &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Einstein field equations]]; the remaining term vanishes algebraically due the commutativity of partial derivatives applied across antisymmetric indices.
#The Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor appears to include second derivative terms in the metric, but in fact the explicit second derivative terms in the pseudotensor cancel with the implicit second derivative terms contained within the [[Einstein tensor]], &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;.  This is more evident when the pseudotensor is directly expressed in terms of the metric tensor or the [[Levi-Civita connection]]; only the first derivative terms in the metric survive and these vanish where the frame is locally inertial at any chosen point.  As a result, the entire pseudotensor vanishes locally (again, at any chosen point) &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which demonstrates the delocalisation of gravitational energy–momentum.&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;

===Cosmological constant===
When the Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor was formulated it was commonly assumed that the [[cosmological constant]], &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \,&lt;/math&gt;, was zero.  Nowadays [[accelerating universe|we don't make that assumption]], and the expression needs the addition of a &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \,&lt;/math&gt; term, giving:
:&lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} = - \frac{c^4}{8\pi G}(G^{\mu \nu}+\Lambda g^{\mu \nu}) + \frac{c^4}{16\pi G (-g)}((-g)(g^{\mu \nu}g^{\alpha \beta} - g^{\mu \alpha}g^{\nu \beta}))_{,\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt;
This is necessary for consistency with the [[Einstein field equations]].

===Metric and affine connection versions===
Landau &amp; Lifshitz also provide two equivalent but longer expressions for the Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor:

*[[Metric tensor]] version:
:&lt;math&gt;(-g)(t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} + \frac{c^4\Lambda g^{\mu \nu}}{8\pi G}) = \frac{c^4}{16\pi G}((\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu \nu}),_{\alpha }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\alpha \beta}),_{\beta}- &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;- (\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu \alpha }),_{\alpha }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\nu \beta}),_{\beta} +\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu \nu}g_{\alpha \beta}(\sqrt{-g}g^{\alpha \sigma }),_{\rho }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\rho  \beta }),_{ \sigma }-&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;-(g^{\mu \alpha }g_{\beta \sigma }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\nu \sigma }),_{\rho }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\beta \rho }),_{\alpha }+g^{\nu \alpha }g_{\beta \sigma}(\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu \sigma }),_{\rho }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\beta \rho }),_{\alpha })+&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+g_{\alpha \beta }g^{ \sigma \rho }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu \alpha }),_{ \sigma }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\nu \beta }),_{\rho }+\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+\frac{1}{8}(2g^{\mu \alpha }g^{\nu \beta }-g^{\mu \nu}g^{\alpha \beta })(2g_{ \sigma \rho }g_{\lambda \omega}-g_{\rho \lambda }g_{ \sigma \omega})(\sqrt{-g}g^{ \sigma \omega}),_{\alpha }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\rho \lambda }),_{\beta })&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landau–Lifshitz equation 96.9&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Christoffel symbols|Affine connection]] version:
:&lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} + \frac{c^4\Lambda g^{\mu \nu}}{8\pi G}= \frac{c^4}{16\pi G}((2\Gamma^{ \sigma }_{\alpha \beta }\Gamma^{\rho }_{ \sigma \rho }-\Gamma^{ \sigma }_{\alpha \rho }\Gamma^{\rho }_{\beta  \sigma }-\Gamma^{ \sigma }_{\alpha  \sigma }\Gamma^{\rho }_{\beta \rho})(g^{\mu \alpha }g^{\nu \beta }-g^{\mu \nu}g^{\alpha \beta })+&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+g^{\mu \alpha }g^{\beta  \sigma }(\Gamma^{\nu}_{\alpha \rho }\Gamma^{\rho }_{\beta  \sigma }+\Gamma^{\nu}_{\beta \sigma } \Gamma^{\rho }_{\alpha \rho } - \Gamma^{\nu}_{ \sigma \rho } \Gamma^{\rho }_{\alpha \beta } - \Gamma^{\nu}_{\alpha \beta } \Gamma^{\rho }_{ \sigma \rho })+&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+g^{\nu \alpha }g^{\beta \sigma }(\Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \rho }\Gamma^{\rho }_{\beta \sigma }+\Gamma^{\mu}_{\beta \sigma } \Gamma^{\rho }_{\alpha \rho } - \Gamma^{\mu}_{ \sigma \rho } \Gamma^{\rho }_{\alpha \beta } - \Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \beta } \Gamma^{\rho }_{ \sigma \rho })+&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+g^{\alpha \beta }g^{ \sigma \rho}(\Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \sigma } \Gamma^{\nu}_{\beta \rho } - \Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \beta } \Gamma^{\nu}_{ \sigma \rho }))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landau–Lifshitz equation 96.8&lt;/ref&gt;
This definition of energy–momentum is covariantly applicable not just under Lorentz transformations, but also under general coordinate transformations.

==Einstein pseudotensor==
This pseudotensor was originally developed by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] ''Das hamiltonisches Prinzip und allgemeine Relativitätstheorie (The Hamiltonian principle and general relativity).'' Sitzungsber. preuss. Acad. Wiss. 1916, 2, 1111–1116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] ''Der Energiesatz in der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie. (An energy conservation law in general relativity).'' Sitzungsber. preuss. Acad. Wiss. 1918, 1, 448–459&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Dirac]] showed&lt;ref&gt;P.A.M.Dirac, ''General Theory of Relativity'' (1975), Princeton University Press, quick presentation of the bare essentials of GTR. {{ISBN|0-691-01146-X}} pages 61&amp;mdash;63&lt;/ref&gt; that the mixed Einstein pseudotensor 
:&lt;math&gt;{t_{\mu}}^{\nu} = \frac{c^4}{16 \pi G \sqrt{-g}} ( (g^{\alpha\beta}\sqrt{-g})_{,\mu} (\Gamma^{\nu}_{\alpha\beta} - \delta^{\nu}_{\beta} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\alpha\sigma}) - \delta_{\mu}^{\nu} g^{\alpha\beta} (\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta} \Gamma^{\rho}_{\sigma\rho} - \Gamma^{\rho}_{\alpha\sigma} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\beta\rho})\sqrt{-g} ) &lt;/math&gt;

satisfies a conservation law
:&lt;math&gt;(({T_{\mu}}^{\nu} + {t_{\mu}}^{\nu})\sqrt{-g})_{,\nu} = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly this pseudotensor for gravitational stress–energy is constructed exclusively from the metric tensor and its first derivatives. Consequently, it vanishes at any event when the coordinate system is chosen to make the first derivatives of the metric vanish because each term in the pseudotensor is quadratic in the first derivatives of the metric.  However it is not symmetric, and is therefore not suitable as a basis for defining the angular momentum.

As the demand for products continues to increase around the world and environmental factors like [[climate change]] increasingly affect policies - and thus business - it becomes more and more of a [[competitive advantage]] for businesses to consider [[sustainability]] aspects early on in the [[product development]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mike Gordon |author2=Chris Musso |author3=Eric Rebentisch |author4=Nisheeth Gupta  |last-author-amp=yes |quote=Businesses with the best product-development track records stand apart from their less-successful peers in three crucial ways|title=The path to successful new products|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/operations/the_path_to_successful_new_products|journal=McKinsey Quarterly|date=January 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

SPD is not limited to the actual product development, but also the product design. Green design which is a part of SPD has two main goals: the prevention of waste and to minimize environmental impact. Environmental impact involves: deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource/material management, etc. The early stages of design tend to be the areas that effect the environment the worst, the extraction and refining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weenen|first=J.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4929">{{about|the sociological concept|the mathematical term|Symbolic power of a prime ideal}}
The concept of '''symbolic power''' was first introduced by French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] to account for the tacit, almost unconscious modes of cultural/social domination occurring within the everyday social habits maintained over conscious subjects. Symbolic power accounts for discipline used against another to confirm that individual's placement in a [[Social stratification|social hierarchy]], at times in individual relations but most basically through system institutions, in particular [[education]].

Also referred to as "soft [[Power (social and political)|power]]", symbolic power includes actions that have discriminatory or injurious meaning or implications, such as gender dominance and racism. Symbolic power maintains its effect through the mis-recognition of power relations situated in the social matrix of a given [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]]. While symbolic power requires a dominator, it also requires the dominated to accept their position in the exchange of social value that occurs between them.

==History==
The concept of symbolic power may be seen as grounded in [[Friedrich Engels]]' concept of [[false consciousness]]. To Engels, under capitalism, objects and social relationships themselves are embedded with societal value that is dependent upon the actors who engage in interactions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Mehring|year=1893|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the illusion of natural law governing such transactions of social and physical worth, the proletariat would be unwilling to consciously support social relations that counteract their own interests. Dominant actors in a society must consciously accept that such an ideological order exists for unequal social relationships to take place. [[Louis Althusser]] further developed it in his writing on what he called Ideological State Apparatuses, arguing that the latter's power is partly based on symbolic repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Althusser, Louis|contribution=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatus|editor=Althusser, Louis|title=Lenin and Philosophy, and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=1972|p=145ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of symbolic power was first introduced by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] in ''[[La Distinction]]''. Bourdieu suggested that cultural roles are more dominant than economic forces in determining how hierarchies of power are situated and reproduced across societies. Status and economic capital are both necessary to maintain dominance in a system, rather than just ownership over the means of production alone. The idea that one could possess [[symbolic capital]] in addition and set apart from financial capital played a critical role in Bourdieu's analysis of hierarchies of power.

For example, in the process of reciprocal gift exchange in the Kabyle society of Algeria, where there is asymmetry in wealth between the two parties the better endowed giver "can impose a strict relation of hierarchy and debt upon the receiver."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bourdieu in Algeria: Colonial Politics, Ethnographic Practices, Theoretical Developments|author=Jane Goodman|year=2009|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=unpresssamples}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic power, therefore, is fundamentally the imposition of categories of thought and perception upon dominated social agents who, once they begin observing and evaluating the world in terms of those categories—and without necessarily being aware of the change in their perspective—then perceive the existing [[social order]] as just. This, in turn, perpetuates a [[social structure]] favored by and serving the interests of those agents who are already dominant.&lt;ref name="Cattani2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cattani, Gino|author2=Ferriani, Simone|author3=Allison, Paul|year=2014|title=Insiders, Outsiders and the Struggle for Consecration in Cultural Fields: A Core-Periphery Perspective|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=79|issue=|pages=258–281|doi=10.1177/0003122414520960|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlZm9LLW9adXRXMFE/edit?usp=sharing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic power, if real, is in some senses much more powerful than physical violence in that it is embedded in the very modes of action and structures of cognition of individuals, and imposes the specter of legitimacy of the social order.

'''System F''', also known as the ('''Girard–Reynolds''') '''polymorphic lambda calculus''' or the '''second-order lambda calculus''', is a [[typed lambda calculus]] that differs from the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] by the introduction of a mechanism of universal quantification over types. System F thus formalizes the notion of [[parametric polymorphism]] in [[programming language]]s, and forms a theoretical basis for languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. System F was discovered independently by [[logician]] [[Jean-Yves Girard]] (1972) and [[computer scientist]] [[John C. Reynolds]] (1974).

Whereas [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has variables ranging over functions, and binders for them, System F additionally has variables ranging over ''types'', and binders for them. As an example, the fact that the identity function can have any type of the form A→ A would be formalized in System F as the judgment

:&lt;math&gt;\vdash \Lambda\alpha. \lambda x^\alpha.x: \forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a '''[[type variable]]'''.  The upper-case &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is traditionally used to denote type-level functions, as opposed to the lower-case &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; which is used for value-level functions. (The superscripted &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; means that the bound ''x'' is of type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; the expression after the colon is the type of the lambda expression preceding it.)

As a [[term rewriting system]], System F is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. However, type inference in System F (without explicit type annotations) is undecidable. Under the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]], System F corresponds to the fragment of second-order [[intuitionistic logic]] that uses only universal quantification. System F can be seen as part of the [[lambda cube]], together with even more expressive typed lambda calculi, including those with [[dependent types]].

According to Girard, the "F" in ''System F'' was picked by chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Girard|first=Jean-Yves|date=|title=The system F of variable types, fifteen years later|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0304397586900447|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=45|page=160|pages=|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(86)90044-7|quote=However, in [3] it was shown that the obvious rules of conversion for this system, called F by chance, were converging.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic and predicates ==
The &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; type is defined as:
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a [[type variable]]. This means: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of all functions which take as input a type &amp;alpha; and two expressions of type &amp;alpha;, and produce as output an expression of type &amp;alpha; (note that we consider &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; to be [[right-associative]].)

The following two definitions for the boolean values &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; are used, extending the definition of [[Church encoding#Church Booleans|Church booleans]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = \Lambda\alpha{.}\lambda x^{\alpha} \lambda y^\alpha{.}x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- These didn't render without the {}-wrapped around the . --&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \Lambda\alpha{.}\lambda x^{\alpha} \lambda y^{\alpha}{.}y&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that the above two functions require ''three'' &amp;mdash; not two &amp;mdash; parameters. The latter two should be lambda expressions, but the first one should be a type. This fact is reflected in the fact that the type of these expressions is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;; the universal quantifier binding the &amp;alpha; corresponds to the &amp;Lambda; binding the alpha in the lambda expression itself. Also, note that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; is a convenient shorthand for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not a symbol of System F itself, but rather a "meta-symbol". Likewise, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; are also "meta-symbols", convenient shorthands, of System F "assemblies" (in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=IL-SI67hjI4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nicolas+Bourbaki&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nbfmxi9gJK&amp;sig=4nPo8EFXrQYwAC2y0pD0uGv-EGY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3sYBUOukIMLW2AX4t_inCw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nicolas%20Bourbaki&amp;f=false Bourbaki sense]); otherwise, if such functions could be named (within System F), then there would be no need for the lambda-expressive apparatus capable of defining functions anonymously.)

Then, with these two &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-terms, we can define some logic operators (which are of type &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathsf{Boolean} \rightarrow \mathsf{Boolean} \rightarrow \mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt;):
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{AND} &amp;= \lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}} \lambda y^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x y\, \mathbf{F}\\
\mathrm{OR}  &amp;= \lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}} \lambda y^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \mathbf{T}\, y\\
\mathrm{NOT} &amp;= \lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \mathbf{F}\, \mathbf{T} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As in Church encodings, there is no need for an &lt;tt&gt;IFTHENELSE&lt;/tt&gt; function as one can just use raw &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt;-typed terms as decision functions. However, if one is requested:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IFTHENELSE} = \Lambda \alpha.\lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}}\lambda y^{\alpha}\lambda z^{\alpha}. x \alpha y z &lt;/math&gt;
will do.
A ''predicate'' is a function which returns a &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt;-typed value. The most fundamental predicate is &lt;tt&gt;ISZERO&lt;/tt&gt; which returns &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if its argument is the [[Church encoding#Church numerals|Church numeral]]  &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ISZERO} = \lambda n^{\forall \alpha. (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \alpha}{.}n^{\mathsf{Boolean}} (\lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.}\mathbf{F})\, \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;

==System F structures==

System F allows recursive constructions to be embedded in a natural manner, related to that in [[Martin-Löf's type theory]]. Abstract structures (S) are created using ''constructors''. These are functions typed as:
:&lt;math&gt;K_1\rightarrow K_2\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;.

Recursivity is manifested when &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; itself appears within one of the types &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;. If you have &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of these constructors, you can define the type of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha.(K_1^1[\alpha/S]\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow \alpha)\dots\rightarrow(K_1^m[\alpha/S]\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow \alpha)\rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the natural numbers can be defined as an inductive datatype &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; with constructors
: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{zero} : \mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{succ} : \mathrm{N} \rightarrow \mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;
The System F type corresponding to this structure is
&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha. \alpha \to (\alpha \to \alpha) \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  The terms of this type comprise a typed version of the [[Church numeral]]s, the first few of which are:
: &lt;tt&gt;0 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;1 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . f x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;2 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . f (f x)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;3 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . f (f (f x))&lt;/math&gt;

If we reverse the order of the curried arguments (''i.e.,'' &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha. (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;), then the Church numeral for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a function that takes a function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; as argument and returns the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;. That is to say, a Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]] – it takes a single-argument function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, and returns another single-argument function.

==Use in programming languages==

The version of System F used in this article is as an explicitly typed, or Church-style, calculus.  The typing information contained in λ-terms makes [[type-checking]] straightforward.  [[Joe Wells]] (1994) settled an "embarrassing open problem" by proving that type checking is [[decision problem|undecidable]] for a Curry-style variant of System F, that is, one that lacks explicit typing annotations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/research-summary.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.church-project.org/reports/Wells:APAL-1999-v98-no-note.html|title=The Church Project: Typability and type checking in {S}ystem {F} are equivalent and undecidable|date=29 September 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929211126/http://www.church-project.org/reports/Wells:APAL-1999-v98-no-note.html|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells's result implies that [[type inference]] for System F is impossible.
A restriction of System F known as "[[Hindley–Milner]]", or simply "HM", does have an easy type inference algorithm and is used for many [[statically typed]] [[functional programming languages]] such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell 98]] and [[ML programming language|ML]]. Over time, as the restrictions of HM-style type systems have become apparent, languages have steadily moved to more expressive logics for their type systems. As of 2008, [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]], a Haskell compiler, goes beyond HM, and now uses System F extended with non-syntactic type equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/FC|title=Commentary/Compiler/FC – GHC|website=ghc.haskell.org|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[F Sharp (programming_language)|F#]] is designed from scratch with System F in mind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; ==
While System F corresponds to the first axis of Barendregt's [[lambda cube]], '''System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;''' or the '''higher-order polymorphic lambda calculus''' combines the first axis (polymorphism) with the second axis ([[type operator]]s); it is a different, more complex system.

System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined inductively on a family of systems, where induction is based on the [[Kind (type theory)|kind]]s permitted in each system:

* &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; permits kinds:
** &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; (the kind of types) and
** &lt;math&gt;J\Rightarrow K&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;J\in F_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K\in F_n&lt;/math&gt; (the kind of functions from types to types, where the argument type is of a lower order)

In the limit, we can define system &lt;math&gt;F_\omega&lt;/math&gt; to be

* &lt;math&gt;F_\omega = \underset{1 \leq i}{\bigcup} F_i&lt;/math&gt;

That is, F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is the system which allows functions from types to types where the argument (and result) may be of any order.

Note that although F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; places no restrictions on the ''order'' of the arguments in these mappings, it does restrict the ''universe'' of the arguments for these mappings: they must be types rather than values.  System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; does not permit mappings from values to types ([[Dependent types]]), though it does permit mappings from values to values (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction), mappings from types to values (&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction, sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;) and mappings from types to types (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction at the level of types)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10943">'''Systemic development''' is a process of thinking about development which uses a [[systems thinking]] approach to create a solution to a social, environmental, and economic stress which the world is suffering from.

== Overview ==
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumb|Development can be a combination of multiple disciplines. Sustainable development focuses on a balance of environmental, economic, and social.]]
The core approach of systemic development is a process for thinking holistically while addressing complex issues and progressing towards a mutual goal with high participation rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The process encompasses comprehension of current activities and future needs from a holistic perspective. For success, it is essential that the process moves from an integrated assessment to a sustainable assessment. The perspective must consider the many facets of the current and proposed development including the economic, social, environmental, political and ecological aspects. The idea behind a systemic development approach can be applied to many disciplines, similar to [[sustainable development]]. Systemic development is practice rather than [[sustainability]], which is an end state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Systems theory|General Systems Theory]] (GST) laid the foundation to systemic thinking. [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig Von Bertalanffy]] was known as the founder of the original principles of GST.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cruz, Ivonne, Andri Stahel, and Manfred Max-Neef. "Towards a Systemic Development Approach: Building on the Human-Scale Development Paradigm." ''Ecological Economics'' 68.7 (2009): 2021-030. ''Elsevier''. Web. 20 Apr. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.02.004&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1968, when GST was introduced in Bertalanffy’s book, ''General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications'', the traditional approach to development used linear thinking or cause-and-effect thinking. GST was influenced by many different types of theories such as “Chaos theory, complexity theory, catastrophe theory, cybernetics, fuzzy set theory, and learning matrices” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spruill|first=Nina|last2=Kenney|first2=Con|last3=Kaplan|first3=Laura|date=2001-03-01|title=Community Development and Systems Thinking: Theory and Practice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.90110/abstract|journal=National Civic Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=105–116|doi=10.1002/ncr.90110|issn=1542-7811}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, [[Peter Senge]], author of ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'', wove systemic thinking approach into development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concepts ==
The integration of ontology, methodology, epistemology, and axiology has formed an outline for GST. Together, these concepts and philosophies contribute to the theory of systemic development.&lt;ref&gt;Sedlacko, Michal, Andre Martinuzzi, Inge RÃ¸pke, Nuno Videira, and Paula Antunes. "Participatory Systems Mapping for Sustainable Consumption: Discussion of a Method Promoting Systemic Insights." ''Ecological Economics'' 106 (2014): 33-43. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800914002043/1-s2.0-S0921800914002043-main.pdf?_tid=9d75173e-4500-11e7-b416-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1496125640_f44c0f82766115a9b6be398ef056d52f&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontological ===
[[Ontology]] is the most basic fundamental tool. In a systemic development approach, the first step is to define the boundaries, thresholds, and stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sala, Serenella, Biagio Ciuffo, and Peter Nijkamp. "A Systemic Framework for Sustainability Assessment." ''Ecological Economics'' 119 (2015): 314-25. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800915003821/1-s2.0-S0921800915003821-main.pdf?_tid=24da3502-4500-11e7-951c-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1496125438_401becd0b4afcc87524ef4bc3b8de9af&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding what is, is crucial to understand the layers of complexity of the development needs.

=== Methodological ===
[[Methodology]] in systemic development must consider all variables, values, and sustainability principles, and aim to ensure that no elements have been neglected. It is important to ensure completeness, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the assessment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Mutual feedback and interactions between stakeholders should be modeled and assessed using carefully designed specific methodologies.

=== Epistemological ===
[[Epistemology]] stresses how dialogue and communication by the stakeholders are the key tools to systemic development. This is when the verification and confirmation of the facets of the development process are discovered. Insight from each stakeholder is important to enhance and broaden the perspective of all involved. It is essential to take these viewpoints into consideration because they influence the process, the trends, the drivers of change, and the interactions between the parts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is during this phase that learning is accomplished.

=== Axiological ===
Axiologology emphasizes the ethical and aesthetic responsibility during the development process. It is important because the solution manifested by the systemic development process needs to represent the values of the represented stakeholders.

==Framework ==
=== Holistic Thinking ===
To successfully achieve development through a [[systems approach]], holistic thinking is necessary. A holistic approach to a system thinks about each variable, the space between the variables and what defines the variable. “It’s the sum of the interaction of its parts”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this process each individual must learn from each other to understand the whole system in a [[multidimensional]] way to find a solution. To think about development with a systemic lens, one needs to be able to see the whole instead of parts and understand the relationship between the parts, the way the parts move, what drives the behavior of the parts, what influences the flow or direction, and to understand why there are no more or no fewer parts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flander, Katleen De, and Jeb Brugmann. "Pressure-Point Strategy: Leverages for Urban Systemic Transformation." ''Sustainability'' 9.1 (2017): 99. ''Sustainability''. Web. 15 May 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/1/99&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The many factors that make up the whole can be a complex system.

=== Stakeholders ===
Including many diverse stakeholders helps each individual to grow their own perspective, gain an understanding of others and to increase their creativity. Systemic involvement must strive for a [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] approach instead of a [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] or [[interdisciplinary]] approach to achieve successful development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Transdisciplinary allows for the integration of methodologies and epistemologies through collaboration of the different stakeholders. Including more perspectives in the loop will increase the chance of a successful solution.

=== Communication and Learning ===
The foundation of systemic development, systems thinking, when applied, creates knowledge which leads to expanded knowledge, which leads to success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dialog is an essential tool for sharing knowledge and translating it into action. Communication can provide feedback and insight about “system, culture, practices, and artifacts and about the objectives and values of the project sponsor, client, and other stakeholders.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Learning happens during the dialog process as each stakeholder comes to observe other stakeholder’s values and ideas about what successful development would encompass.

''The Fifth Element'', by Peter Senge, emphasizes the importance of learning to improve lives using systems thinking. Individuals who acquire information, knowledge, and skills from other stakeholders and the environment tend to experience a change in their own lives and livelihood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They themselves then become the agents of change by sharing their knowledge with others.&lt;ref&gt;Work Bank. Knowledge for Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex loop ===
A feedback loop, closed loop, or systems complex model is a tool to help cope with complexity&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and understand the system as a whole. The tool will help to visualize the direction, velocity, delay time, long term and short term effects, and to help see the dynamic process. Feedback is necessary to learn about each other, including objectives and values of stakeholders and officials. A systemic approach to development is change oriented. The approach must encourage humans to communicate through interpersonal interactions, address the values of each stakeholder, and take part in developing and understanding the complex loop.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Goals ==
[[File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|thumb|Parts, society, needs, means, individuals, and bigger picture are pieces of the puzzle that must be accounted for to make systemic development successful.]]
Systemic development is based on the principle that one must understand the complexity of the whole system to develop a solution. This can be accomplished by learning different elements in the system and applying them to their existing knowledge. We must learn about the past suggested solutions, the balance of the system, influx of the system, the challenges within the system, the best timing for each element, learning about uncertainty of cause-and-effect, the best leverage points in the system, the system does not work unless every piece is functioning at its prime, and there is no one individual at fault if everyone is working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314017669|title=Systemic development : local solutions in a global environment|last=1944-|first=Sheffield, Jim,|last2=Emergence.|first2=Institute for the Study of Coherence and|last3=N.Z.)|first3=ANZSYS Conference (13th : 2007 : Auckland,|date=2009|publisher=Isce Publishing|isbn=9780981703275|oclc=314017669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of systemic development is to have community participants shift from being reactors to viewing themselves “as active participants in shaping their reality [to move] from reacting to the present to creating the future”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The non-linear processes must coincide, be fluid and strive to benefit all parties involved.

'''Third Party Non-violent Intervention''' (sometimes called '''TPNI''') refers to the practice of intervening from the outside in violent conflicts with the aim of reducing violence and allowing "space" for [[conflict resolution]]. Two common forms of intervention are as an intermediary in a negotiating capacity or, physically, by interposing one's body between two factions.

TPNI work is sometimes categorized into four main areas:
# Interpositioning
# Observation and Documentation
# Protective Accompaniment
# Modeling [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] behavior in a conflict situation

Examples of groups that espouse this practice are [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]], [[International Solidarity Movement]], [[Muslim Peacemaker Teams]], [[Meta Peace Team]],  [[Peace Brigades International]] and [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]].

'''''True20''''' is a [[role-playing game system]] designed by [[Steve Kenson]] and published by [[Green Ronin Publishing]]. The system was first published as a part of the ''[[Blue Rose (RPG)|Blue Rose]]'' [[Role-playing game|RPG]] before being published as a standalone universal generic [[role-playing game]], True20 Adventure Roleplaying.

==History==
The True20 system was originally used in Green Ronin's award-winning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = 2005 ENnie Awards Archives | work = | publisher = ENWorld | date = | url = http://www.ennieawards.com/2005.html | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080120190138/http://www.ennieawards.com/2005.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blue Rose (RPG)|Blue Rose]]'',&lt;ref name=rpg&gt;{{cite web | last = Gray | first = Tim | authorlink = | title = REVIEW OF TRUE20 ADVENTURE ROLEPLAYING | work = | publisher = RPGNet | date = 2005-07-11| url = http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11392.phtml | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; itself based on their multiple-award winning ''[[Mutants &amp; Masterminds]]'' RPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Grigsby | first = John | authorlink = | title = True20 Adventure Roleplaying Review | work = | publisher =d20 Magazine Rack | date = 2006-09-20| url = http://www.d20zines.com/v7/node/2941 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Green Ronin released a PDF distillation of the ''Blue Rose'' rules, with an appendix of some modern-era rules, as a generic form of the game. This was followed by an expanded hardcover release in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Richeson| first = Christopher| authorlink = | title = REVIEW OF TRUE20 ADVENTURE ROLEPLAYING | work = | publisher = RPGNet | date = 2006-06-23| url = http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12267.phtml | format = Review | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised softcover rulebook, combining the rules section of the ''True20 Adventure Roleplaying'' book with the ''True20 Companion'' was released April 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://true20.com/comments.php?id=119_0_2_0_C Message by Chris Pramas concerning 2008 True20 products] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214221802/http://true20.com/comments.php?id=119_0_2_0_C |date=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com True 20 https://www.amazon.com/dp/193454714X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settings==
The original setting for the system was the Blue Rose in which the system first saw print.&lt;ref name=rpg/&gt; In its generic role-playing game, the original hardcover printing of the ''True20 Adventure Roleplaying'' book included four sample settings. These were chosen among publisher submitted setting with the winners announced in [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Strohm |first= Keith |title= True20 Adventure Roleplaying: Worlds of Adventure |journal= [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |volume= 30 |issue= 9-340 |pages= 19|publisher= Pazio Publishing| location= Bellevut, WA |date= February 2006 |issn= 1062-2101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Caliphate Nights", a fantasy version of the golden age of [[Islam]], circa 800 AD. A full-color standalone hardcover was released for the setting at [[Origins International Game Expo|Origins 2006]].&lt;ref name="caliphate"&gt;{{cite web |title= Paradigm Concepts News : d20 / True20 Archives |work= |publisher= Paradigm Concepts |date= |url= http://www.paradigmconcepts.com/d20_true20/ |format= |doi= |accessdate= 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Lux Aeternum", a swashbuckling [[space opera]].
* "Mecha vs. Kaiju", in which giant robots protect Japan from giant monsters.&lt;ref name="mecha"&gt;{{cite web |last= Wright |first= John |last2= Todd |first2= Michael |title=Mecha vs Kaiju |publisher= Big Finger Games |url= http://www.mechavskaiju.com/ |format= |doi= |accessdate= 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Borrowed Time", a setting of [[Kung Fu]] action and gunplay against a backdrop of time-controlling conspiracies.

The Revised Edition has four different settings:
* Fantasy Adventures
* Space Adventures
* Horror Adventures
* Modern Adventures

A follow up volume, ''True20 Worlds of Adventure'' includes five additional settings:
* "Agents of Oblivion"
* "Blood Throne"
* "Land of the Crane", an Asian fantasy setting.
* "Nevermore"
* "Razor in the Apple", a horror setting in which kids face monsters lurking the neighborhood, inspired by films such as ''[[The Goonies]]''.

==System==
Utilizing the [[Open Gaming License]], ''True20'' is derived from [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s ''[[d20 System]]''. Differences from the parent game include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= True20 Adventure Roleplaying |work = |publisher= [[Green Ronin]] |date= 2005-06-16 |url= http://greenronin.com/2005/06/true20_adventure_roleplaying.php |accessdate= 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schneider |first= Wesley |title= First Watch: Natural 20 |journal= [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |volume= 30 |issue= 7/338 |pages= 20 |publisher= Pazio Publishing| location = Bellevut, WA |date= December 2005| issn = 1062-2101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are only three character classes, referred to as roles: warrior, adept and expert.
* A single [[20-sided die]] is used for each roll.
* [[Ability score]]s are given as simple modifiers (+1, +2, etc.) rather than as a statistic in the range from 3-18 (which in some other systems, such as [[D20 System|''d20'']], would then be converted to simple modifiers).
* There are no class-specific or restricted skills, thus characters of any role can have any skill.
* New [[Feat (d20 System)|feats]] are available at each level.
* Magic spells are treated as feats and do not have "levels".
* Instead of [[hit point]]s, characters simply experience "damage conditions" like that of ''[[Mutants &amp; Masterminds]]''.
* Instead of [[experience point]]s, characters automatically increase in level at the Narrator's discretion, usually after one or two adventures.

'''Wai Hnin Pwint Thon''' ({{lang-my|ဝေနှင်းပွင့်သုန်}}; born January 4, 1989) is a Burmese activist based in London. Wai Hnin was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Burma]] (Myanmar) and is the daughter of [[Mya Aye (activist)|Mya Aye]] (Burmese:မြအေး), one of the leaders of the [[8888 Uprising|88 Generation]] student group in Burma.

Throughout her life, Wai Hnin's father was imprisoned for political involvement, meeting him for the first time through bars. She left Burma in 2006 to study in [[London]].  Shortly after arriving in London, her father was arrested for taking part in events leading up to the "[[Saffron Revolution]]" in Burma and sentenced to 65.5 years in prison.  Since that time Wai Hnin has sought to raise her father's detention and the plight of the more than 2,200 other political prisoners&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11741612 BBC article: "Who are Burma's political prisoners?" (13/11/2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; currently held in detention in Burma. Wai Hnin has worked for [[Burma Campaign UK]] and [[Amnesty International]] and has frequently appeared in British and international media. In 2010, after meeting Wai Hnin, former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]], [[David Miliband]], remarked that he was "struck first by her bravery and strength in leaving her family for a new life to study here in Britain, and secondly by her determination to bring about change in Burma." She has been studying [[Global politics]] and [[International Relations]] in [[Birkbeck, University of London]] since 2013 and in 2016, she got a [[Bachelor Degree]] .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/aug/13/burma-human-rights-pressure Guardian article: "Keep making noise about Burma" (13/08/2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A single white feather closeup.jpg|thumb|White feather|200px|A white feather is sometimes given as a mark of cowardice.]]

The '''white feather''' is a widely recognised symbol, although its meaning varies significantly between different countries and cultures.&lt;ref name="Etym"/&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] and the countries of the British Empire since the eighteenth century it has been used a symbol of cowardice, used by [[Patriotism|patriotic groups]], including prominent members of the [[Suffragette]] movement and early [[feminist|feminists]], in order to shame men into enlisting. However in some cases of [[pacifism]] and in the [[United States]] armed forces, it is used to signify extraordinary bravery and excellence in combat marksmanship.

==Symbol of Cowardice==
As a symbol of cowardice, the white feather supposedly&lt;ref name="Etym"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=white+feather&amp;searchmode=none | title=White Feather | publisher=Etymonline.com | accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from [[cockfighting]] and the belief that a [[rooster|cockerel]] sporting a white feather in its tail is likely to be a poor fighter. Pure-breed [[gamecocks]] do not show white feathers, so its presence indicates that the cockerel is an inferior cross-breed.

=== The Crusades ===
Shame was exerted upon men in England and France who had not [[wiktionary:take_the_cross|taken the cross]] at the time of the [[Third Crusade]], "A great many men sent each other [[wool]] and [[distaff]], hinting that if anyone failed to join this military undertaking they were only fit for [[women's work]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Britain, Ireland and the Crusades, C.1000-1300|last=Hurlock|first=Kathryn|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
In August 1914, at the start of the [[World War I|First World War]], Admiral [[Charles Cooper Penrose Fitzgerald|Charles Fitzgerald]] founded the Order of the White Feather with support from the prominent author [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs Humphrey Ward]]. The organization aimed to shame men into enlisting in the British army by persuading women to present them with a white feather if they were not wearing a uniform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/11/first-world-war-white-feather-cowardice Guardian review] of ''We Will Not Fight...: The Untold Story of World War One's Conscientious Objectors'' by Will Ellsworth-Jones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitefeatherdiaries.org.uk "The White Feather Diaries" project]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was joined by prominent [[feminist]]s and [[suffragette]]s of the time, such as [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and her daughter [[Christabel Pankhurst|Christabel]]. They, in addition to handing out the feathers, also lobbied to institute an involuntary universal draft, which included those who lacked votes due to being too young or not owning property.  Although the draft would conscript both sexes, only males would be on the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;"The Suffragette Movement" by [[Sylvia Pankhurst]]: "Mrs. Pankhurst toured the country, making recruiting speeches. Her supporters handed the white feather to every young man they encountered wearing civilian dress, and bobbed up at Hyde Park meetings with placards: "Intern Them All."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The least that men can do is that every man of fighting age should prepare himself to redeem his word to women..." - Mrs. Pankhurst&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Emmeline Pankhurst’s call for universal compulsory national service for both sexes" and "Female service would be played out on the floor of the factory." see http://itech.fgcu.edu/&amp;/issues/vol1/issue1/feather.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

While the true effectiveness of the campaign is impossible to judge, it did spread throughout several other nations in the Empire. In Britain it started to cause problems for the government when public servants and men in essential occupations came under pressure to enlist. This prompted the [[Home Secretary]], [[Reginald McKenna]], to issue employees in state industries with lapel badges reading "King and Country" to indicate that they too were serving the war effort. Likewise, the [[Silver War Badge (SWB)|Silver War Badge]], given to service personnel who had been honourably discharged due to wounds or sickness, was first issued in September 1916 to prevent veterans from being challenged for not wearing uniform.  Anecdotes from the period indicates that the campaign was not popular amongst soldiers - not least because soldiers who were home on leave could find themselves presented with the feathers.

One such was Private Ernest Atkins who was on leave from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He was riding a tram when he was presented with a white feather by a girl sitting behind him. He smacked her across the face with his pay book saying: "Certainly I'll take your feather back to the boys at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]]. I'm in civvies because people think my uniform might be lousy, but if I had it on I wouldn't be half as lousy as you." &lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Geoffrey. Military Anecdotes (1992) p. 63 Guinness Publishing {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private [[Norman Demuth]], who had been discharged from the British Army after being wounded in 1916, received numerous white feathers after returning from the Western Front, and decided that if the women that handed them out were going to be rude to him, he was going to be rude back.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80018012&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last feathers he received was presented to him whilst he was travelling on a bus, by a lady who was sat opposite him. She handed over the feather and said, "Here's a gift for a brave soldier." Demuth replied, "Thank you very much - I wanted one of those." He then used the feather to clean out his pipe, handed it back to her and remarked, "You know we didn't get these in the trenches." The other passengers subsequently became angry with the woman and started shouting at her, much to Demuth's amusement.&lt;ref&gt;Forgotten Voices of the Great War. p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The supporters of the campaign were not easily put off. A woman who confronted a young man in a London park demanded to know why he was not in the army. "Because I am a German", he replied. He received a white feather anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most misplaced use of a white feather was when one was presented to Seaman [[George Samson]] who was on his way in civilian clothes to a public reception in his honour. Samson had been awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for gallantry in the [[Gallipoli]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Glanfield, John. Bravest of the Brave (2005) pp 110-112 Sutton Publishing {{ISBN|0-7509-3695-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roland Gwynne]], later mayor of [[Eastbourne]] (1929–1931) and lover of suspected serial killer [[John Bodkin Adams]], received a feather from a relative. This prompted him to enlist, and he subsequently received the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for bravery.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Cullen, ''A Stranger in Blood: The case files on Doctor John Bodkin Adams'', 2006. P626&lt;/ref&gt; The writer [[Compton Mackenzie]], then a serving soldier, complained about the activities of the Order of the White Feather. He argued that these "idiotic young women were using white feathers to get rid of boyfriends of whom they were tired". The pacifist [[Fenner Brockway]] claimed that he received so many white feathers he had enough to make a fan.

The white feather campaign was briefly renewed during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldstein |first=Joshua S. |title=The Women of World War I |url=http://www.warandgender.com/wgwomwwi.htm |accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://historyoffeminism.com/wp-content/uploads/DailyMirror-1940.jpg Can It Be True?]" editorial by "W.M." from the 3 April 1940 issue of the [[Daily Mirror]]: "Is it possible that nitwit girls are reviving the infamous "white feather" campaign of the last war? Rumours reach us from Doncaster to the effect that certain female louts are thus insulting male workers in or out of reserved occupations." Referenced [http://historyoffeminism.com/white-feather-campaign-second-world-war/ 29 October 2012], retrieved 29 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbol of pacifism and peace==
In contrast, the white feather has been used by some [[pacifism|pacifist]] organisations as a sign of harmlessness.

In the 1870s, the [[Māori people|Māori]] prophet of [[passive resistance]] [[Te Whiti o Rongomai]] promoted the wearing of white feathers by his followers at [[Parihaka]]. They are still worn by the [[iwi]] associated with that area, and by [[Te Ati Awa]] in [[Wellington]]. They are known as ''te raukura'', which literally means the red feather, but metaphorically, the chiefly feather. They are usually three in number, interpreted as standing for "glory to God, peace on earth, goodwill toward people" (Luke 2:14). Albatross feathers are preferred but any white feathers will do. They are usually worn in the hair or on the lapel (but not from the ear).

Some time after the war, pacifists found an alternative interpretation of the white feather as a symbol of peace. The apocryphal story goes that in 1775, [[Quaker]]s in a [[Friends meeting house]] in [[Easton, New York]] were faced by a tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] on the war path. Rather than flee, the Quakers fell silent and waited. The Indian chief came into the meeting house and finding no weapons he declared the Quakers as friends. On leaving he took a white feather from his quiver and attached it to the door as a sign to leave the building unharmed.

In 1937 the [[Peace Pledge Union]] sold 500 white feather badges as symbols of peace.

===Other symbolism===
In the United States, the white feather has also become a symbol of courage, persistence and superior combat marksmanship. Its most notable wearer was US [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] [[Carlos Hathcock]], who was awarded the [[Silver Star]] medal for bravery during the [[Vietnam War]]. Hathcock picked up a white feather on a mission and wore it in his hat to taunt the enemy.  He was so feared by enemy troops that they put a price on his head.  Its wear on combat headgear flaunts an insultingly easy target for enemy snipers.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Henderson. ''Marine Sniper''. New York: [[Berkley Books]], 1986. {{ISBN|0-425-18165-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayals in popular culture==

===Literature===
The [[adventure novel]] ''[[The Four Feathers]]'' (1902) by [[A. E. W. Mason]] tells the story of Harry Faversham, an officer in the [[British Army]], who decides to resign  his commission the day before his regiment is dispatched to fight in [[Sudan]] (the [[Mahdist War|1882 First War of Sudan]], leading to [[Siege of Khartoum|the fall of Khartoum]]). Harry's three fellow officers and his fiancée conclude that he is resigning in order to avoid fighting in the conflict, and each send him a white feather.  Stung by the criticism, Harry sails to Sudan, disguises himself as an Arab, and looks for the opportunity to redeem his honour. He manages this by fighting a covert war on behalf of the British, saving the life of one of his colleagues in the process. On returning to England he asks each of his accusers to take back one of the feathers.

The 1907 [[P. G. Wodehouse]] novel ''[[The White Feather]]'' is a [[school story]] about apparent cowardice and the efforts a boy goes to in order to redeem himself by physical combat.

In the novel ''Birds of a Feather'' by [[Jacqueline Winspear]], four young girls take it upon themselves to hand out feathers to young men not in uniform in an effort to shame them into enlisting on Britain's side in The Great War.

''[[The Man Who Stayed at Home (1914 play)|The Man Who Stayed at Home]]'', a 1914 play by [[J. E. Harold Terry]] and Lechmere Worrall, was renamed ''The White Feather'' when staged in North America. The title character is a British secret agent who is falsely perceived to be a coward for his refusal to enlist as a soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachman |first=Marvin |title=The Villainous Stage: Crime Plays on Broadway and in the West End |publisher=McFarland |page=114 |date=2014 |isbn=9780786495344 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L16QBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20white%20feather%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Camels are Coming'' (1932), the first-ever collection of [[Biggles]] stories, Biggles is handed a white feather by a young woman while on leave in civilian clothes, who is later taken aback to find that he is one of the Royal Flying Corps' leading pilots.

In [[Pat Barker]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'', the character Burns is given two white feathers during his home leave from [[Craiglockhart War Hospital]].

In the 2015 [[graphic novel]] ''[[Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons]]'', [[Christabel Pankhurst]] is depicted encouraging women to hand white feathers to every young man they see out of uniform.  Persephone Wright, the protagonist of the story and heretofore a staunch supporter of Pankhurst's [[Votes for Women]] campaigns, rejects the idea on ethical grounds, saying "a man who's been shamed into service isn't a volunteer at all".

===Music===
The Order of the White Feather was the inspiration for the [[Weddings Parties Anything]] song "Scorn of the Women", which concerns a man who is deemed medically unfit for service when he attempts to enlist, and is unjustly accused of cowardice.

In 1983, [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Kajagoogoo]] released their debut album called ''[[White Feathers]]'', whose opener was the title track, a light-hearted allegory for weak people, whereas the final track, ''Frayo'', had a political flavour, referencing cowardice as the cause for an unchanging war-torn world.

In 1985, progressive rock band [[Marillion]] released an anti-war song called White Feather as the ending track to their album [[Misplaced Childhood]].

===Film and television===
The novel ''[[The Four Feathers]]'' has been the basis of at least seven feature films, the most recent being ''[[The Four Feathers (2002 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (2002), starring [[Heath Ledger]].  It was also parodied in the ''Dad's Army'' episode "[[The Two and a Half Feathers]]".

In the 1980 BBC TV series ''[[To Serve Them All My Days (TV series)|To Serve Them All My Days]]'', David Powlett-Jones, a [[shell-shocked]] [[Tommy Atkins|Tommy]], takes a position in a boys' school.  Suspecting that fellow teacher Carter may be avoiding war duty, he muses, "I'd give a good deal to know whether he's really got a gammy knee", to which an acerbic colleague responds, "I suppose we couldn't get some chubby cherub to give him the white feather" as a means of accusing the suspected malingerer.

In the short-lived 2007 British period drama ''[[Lilies (TV series)|Lilies]]'', the brother of the protagonists is discharged from the military during World War I after his boat sinks and he is one of a handful of shell shocked survivors. Billy gets sent and given numerous white feathers for his perceived cowardice, and begins to hallucinate them choking him. This is a recurring theme throughout the series.

In the 2010 Australian film ''[[Beneath Hill 60]]'' about real-life soldier [[Oliver Woodward]], Woodward, before enlisting, receives several feathers to which he jokingly states, "Just a few more feathers, and I'll have a whole chicken."

In the first episode of the second season of ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' a pair of young women interrupt a benefit concert to hand out white feathers to the men who have not enlisted, before being ordered out by an angry Earl of Grantham.
