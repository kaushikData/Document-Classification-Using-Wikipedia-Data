== Overview  ==
India’s [[rhetoric]] could be said to be a link between the [[West]] and [[East]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Rhetoric: An Historical and Cross-Cultural Introduction|last=Kennedy|first=George A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=0195109333|location=New York|pages=171–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Greek [[sophist]]s, some Indian rhetors in the seventh century BCE held public debates on religion to the public’s amusement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Vedic verses]], composed over three thousand years ago, use similes, similar to [[ancient Greek poetry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Indian rhetoric utilizes systems of categorization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These categorizations appear in early Buddhist writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, India’s Hindu [[caste system]] led to differences in how member of different castes addressed each other, with people from lower castes referring to themselves in a derogatory manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, the [[Upanishads]], a collection of ancient Brahmin dialogues, place value in categorizing technical terms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[History of Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhist]] rhetoric places value in calm and humorous discourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nyanya Rhetoric ===
Lloyd (2007) has proposed [[Nyaya]]’s inclusion in the field of rhetorical studies, exploring its methods within their historical context, comparing its approach to the “traditional logical syllogism, and relating it to the contemporary perspectives [[Stephen Toulmin]], [[Kenneth Burke]], and [[Chaïm Perelman|Chaim Perelman]].”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Keith|date=2007|title=Rethinking Rhetoric from an Indian Perspective: Implications in the ‘Nyaya Sutra.’|url=|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=26|issue=4|page=365|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyaya is a [[Sanskrit]] word which means just or right and refers to “the science of right and wrong reasoning” (Radhakrishnan &amp; Moore, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;356).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=A Source Book in Indian Philosophy|last=Radhakrishnan|first=Sarvepalli|last2=Moore|first2=Charles Alexander|date=|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1957|isbn=|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sutra]] is also a Sanskrit word which means string or thread. Here Sutra refers to a collection of [[aphorism]] in the form of a manual. Each Sutra is a short rule usually consisted of one or two sentences. Example of a Sutra: “Reality is truth, and what is true is so, irrespective of whether we know it is, or are aware of that truth.” The [[Nyāya Sūtras|Nyaya Sutra]] is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by Aksapada Gautama.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nyaya Sutras of Gotama|last=Vidyabhusana|first=M.M. Satisa Chandra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1930|isbn=8120807480|location=Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the foundational text of the Nyaya School of Hindu Philosophy. The date when the text was composed, and the biography of its author is unknown. It is estimated that the text was composed between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zimmer (2013) has said that the text may have been composed by more one author, over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophies of India|last=Zimmer|first=Heinrich|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415462327|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radhakrishan and Moore (1957) placed its origin in the “third century BC…..though some of the contents of the Nyaya Sutra are certainly a post-Christian era” (p.&amp;nbsp;36).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Vidyabhushana|Vidyabhusana]] (1930) stated that the ancient school of Nyaya extended over a period of one thousand years, beginning with Gotama about 550 BC and ending with Vatsyayana about 400 AD.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''Nyaya'' provides significant insight into the Indian rhetoric.  Naya presents an argumentative approach that works a [[rhetor]] how to decide about any argument. In addition, it proposes a new approach of thinking of a cultural tradition which is different from the Western rhetoric. It also broadens the view of rhetoric and the relationship among human beings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  ''Nyaya'' proposes an enlightenment of reality which is associated with situations, time, and places. Toulmin emphasizes on the situational dimension of argumentative genre as the fundamental component of any rhetorical logic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the contrary, ''Nyaya'' views this situational rhetoric in a new way which offers context of practical arguments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Authenticity in art''' is the different ways in which a [[work of art]] or an artistic performance may be considered authentic.{{sfn|Davies|Higgins|Hopkins|2009|pp=156}}
[[Denis Dutton]] distinguishes between ''nominal authenticity'' and ''expressive authenticity''.
The first refers to the correct identification of the author of a work of art, to how closely a performance of a play or piece of music conforms to the author's intention, or to how closely a work of art conforms to an artistic tradition.
The second sense refers to how much the work possesses original or inherent authority, how much sincerity, genuineness of expression, and moral passion the artist or performer puts into the work.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

A quite different concern is the authenticity of the experience, which may be impossible to achieve. A modern visitor to a museum may not only see an object in a very different context from that which the artist intended, but may be unable to understand important aspects of the work. The authentic experience may be impossible to recapture.{{sfn|Phillips|1997|pp=1-4}}

Authenticity is a requirement for inscription upon the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].{{sfn|UNESCO|2011|pp=21f}} According to the ''Nara Document on Authenticity'', it can be expressed through 'form and design; materials and substance; use and function; traditions and techniques; location and setting; spirit and feeling; and other internal and external factors.'{{sfn|Larsen 1995}}{{sfn|Larsen 1994}}

==Authenticity of provenance==
Authenticity of provenance means that the origin or authorship of a work of art has been correctly identified.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=78}}
As [[Lionel Trilling]] points out in his 1972 book ''Sincerity and Authenticity'', the question of authenticity of provenance has acquired a profoundly moral dimension. Regardless of the appearance of the object or the quality of workmanship, there is great importance in knowing whether a vase is a genuine [[Ming vase]] or just a clever [[Art forgery|forgery]].{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=9}}
This intense interest in authenticity is relatively recent and is largely confined to the western world. In the medieval period, and in countries such as modern Thailand, there was or is little interest in the identity of the artist.{{sfn|Abbing|2002|pp=110}}

The case of [[Han van Meegeren]] is well known. After failing to succeed as an artist in his own right, he turned to creating fake [[Vermeer]] paintings. These were accepted as genuine by experts and acclaimed as masterpieces. After being arrested for selling national treasures to the Germans, he caused a sensation when he publicly demonstrated that he was the artist.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=85}}
To guard against forgeries like this, a [[certificate of authenticity]] may be used to prove that a work of art is authentic, but there is a sizable market in fake certificates.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=87}}
Furthermore a combination of art historical, conservational and technical evidence can be used to authenticate a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://authenticationinart.org/|title=Authentication in Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The financial importance of authenticity may bias collectors to acquiring recent works of art where provenance can more easily be proven, perhaps even by a statement from the artist.{{sfn|McAndrew|2010|pp=56}}
For older works, an increasingly sophisticated array of forensic techniques may be deployed to establish authenticity of provenance.{{sfn|Fleming|1975|pp=567}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2017/11/leonardo-da-vinci-salvator-mundi-goes-to-auction-at-christies/|title=Christie’s da Vinci Auction Reveals Why Forgers Love to Fake Masters|date=2017-11-15|work=Observer|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] discusses at length the question raised by [[Aline B. Saarinen]]: "If a fake is so expert that even after the most thorough and trustworthy examination its authenticity is still open to doubt, is it or is it not as satisfactory a work of art as if it were unequivocally genuine?" Goodman concludes that the question is academic, since there must be some way to distinguish a forgery from the original, and once the forgery is known for what it is, that knowledge alters the perception of value.{{sfn|Goodman|1976|pp=99}}
However, [[Arthur Koestler]] in ''[[The Act of Creation]]'' answers that if a forgery fits into an artist's body of work and produces the same kind of aesthetic pleasure as other works by that artist, there is no reason to exclude it from a museum.{{sfn|Koestler|1964|pp=400ff}}

The question of the value of a forgery may be irrelevant to a curator, since they are concerned only with the provenance of the work and not with its artistic merit.{{sfn|Goodman|1976|pp=119}}
Even for the curator, in many cases provenance is a matter of probabilities rather than a certainty - absolute proof is not possible.{{sfn|McGowan|2000|pp=230}}
But once a forgery has been exposed, no matter how highly the work was praised when it was thought to be "authentic" there is rarely any interest in evaluating the work on its own merit.{{sfn|Schefold|2002}}
[[File:Josquin des Prez.jpg|thumb|right|Facsimile of a 1611 [[woodcut]] of the composer [[Josquin des Prez]], copied from a now-lost oil painting done during his lifetime{{sfn|Macey|2010}}]]

Reproduction is inherent to some forms of art. In Medieval Europe, an artist might create a drawing which was used by another craftsman to create a [[woodcut]] block. The drawing was usually destroyed in the block-cutting process, and the block was thrown away when it became worn out. The copies printed from the block are all that remain of the work.{{sfn|Hind|1935|pp=88ff}}
In a 1936 essay, [[Walter Benjamin]] discussed the new media of photography and film, in which the work of art can be reproduced many times with no one version being the authentic "original". He linked this shift from authentic objects to broadly accessible mass media with a transformation in the function of art from ritual to politics.{{sfn|Benjamin|1936}}
Modern art may raise new issues of authenticity of provenance. For example, the artist [[Duane Hanson]] instructed the conservators of his 1971 sculpture ''Sunbather'' to feel free to replace elements such as the bathing cap or swimsuit if they became faded.{{sfn|Spencer|2004|pp=129}}
As [[Julian H. Scaff]] points out, the computer and the internet further confuse the issue of authenticity of provenance, since a digital work of art may exist in thousands or millions of identical versions, and in variants where there is no way to determine the original version or even the author.{{sfn|Scaff}}

==Cultural authenticity==

Authenticity of provenance is concerned with identifying the person who made the work, or at least pinning down the place and time in which the work was made as closely as possible. Cultural authenticity, or authenticity of style or tradition, is concerned with whether a work is a genuine expression of an artistic tradition, even when the author may be anonymous. Interest in this form of authenticity may be associated with a romantic sense of the value of the pure, unadulterated tradition, often linked to nationalistic and possibly racist beliefs.{{sfn|Bendix|1997|pp=6ff}}

A work of art may be considered an authentic example of a traditional culture or genre when it conforms to the style, materials, process of creation and other essential attributes of that genre.
Many traditions are thought to be "owned" by an ethnic group, and work in that genre is only considered authentic if it is created by a member of that group. Thus [[Inuit art]] can only be considered authentic if created by an [[Inuit people|Inuit]]. This may help to protect the originators of an art tradition from [[cultural appropriation]], but there is a racist aspect to the view as described by Joel Rudinow in his essay ''Race, Ethnicity, Expressive Authenticity: Can White People Sing the Blues?''{{sfn|Coleman|2005|pp=31ff}}

The market for "[[primitive art]]" developed in the western world towards the end of the 19th century as explorers or colonialists came into contact with formerly unknown cultural groups in Africa, Asia and the Pacific. These people quickly learned how to incorporate new materials supplied by traders into their art, such as cloth and glass beads, but found that they could not sell these "inauthentic" objects. However, they learned how to manufacture works from local materials that would be considered authentic for sale to the westerners.{{sfn|Scharfstein|2009|pp=99-100}}
This process of creating art that will be considered authentic by western buyers continues to this day. The objects may be designed or modified to give the impression of having popular attributes and provenance, including religious or ritual uses, antiquity and association with royalty.{{sfn|Carrier|2005|pp=281}}
Similarly, in the 1940s [[Haiti]]an professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of [[Haitian Vodou art]]. The Haitian works were later claimed to be authentic.{{sfn|Richman|2008|p=203}}

To distinguish from crude objects made for the tourist trade, many collectors consider that a work is only an authentic example of a traditional genre if it meets certain standards of quality and was made for the original purpose. Dutton gives the example of the [[Igorot]] of northern [[Luzon]] who have long created figurines (''[[bulul]]'') for use in traditional ceremonies, but today produce them primarily for the tourist trade. An Igorot family may purchase a roughly carved ''bulul'' from a tourist booth and use it for traditional ceremonies, thus giving authenticity to the work that would not, perhaps, be present otherwise.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}
Although collectors place greater value on "tribal" masks or sculptures that have been used in an active ritual, it may be impossible to prove whether this is the case. Even if a video shows the mask being worn in a ritual dance, the dance may have been staged for tourists. Yet if the provenance of the mask is proven, if the mask was made by a member of the society using traditional designs and techniques, it is presumably an authentic example of the style or tradition.{{sfn|van der Grijp|2009|pp=317}}

It is not always clear what constitutes a style. For example, production of [[Zimbabwe]]an stone sculptures is relatively recent, dating to the 1950s. It does not draw on any earlier tradition. However, the sculpture plays an important role in establishing the existence of a uniquely Zimbabwean culture, and the authenticity of this style is strongly emphasized by the government of Zimbabwe despite the difficulty of defining its characteristics.{{sfn|Baaz|Palmberg|2001|pp=183ff}}
[[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[Sandpainting|sand paintings]] raise a different issue. The traditional paintings must be destroyed on completion of the ritual in which they are used. However, Navajo artists create sand paintings for sale with slightly modified designs. Can these paintings be considered authentic examples of Navajo art?{{sfn|Davies|Higgins|Hopkins|2009|pp=159}}

Traditions change. In an exploration of the evolution of the art of the [[Maroon people]] of [[French Guiana]], [[Sally Price]] shows that contemporary styles have developed through a complex interaction between artists and buyers. The Maroons have a long tradition of artwork, primarily in the form of decoration of everyday objects such as paddles or shutters. This art was purely aesthetic in purpose, with no symbolic meaning. However, European collectors needed to assign symbolism to "native art". Over time, the Maroon artists have come to accept the European [[semiotic]] vocabulary and to assign symbolism to their work, which younger artists may believe to be based on ancestral traditions. The artists have also moved into new media and new designs. Their art may still be considered authentic examples of Maroon art, but the art form and the meaning associated with it is new.{{sfn|Price|2007}}

==Authenticity of performance==

[[File:Diakonie-kantorei.jpg|thumb|An ensemble performing [[Baroque music]] with authentic instruments and techniques, but in modern dress and setting.]]
With performance arts such as music and theater, both the composer or playwright and the performers are involved in creating an instance of the work. There are some who consider that a performance is only truly authentic if it approximates as closely as possible what the original author would have expected to see and hear. In a [[historically informed performance]], the actors or musicians will make every effort to achieve this effect by using replicas of historical instruments, studying historical guides to acting and so on. They would consider, for example, that a performance of one of [[Mozart]]'s piano concertos would be "inauthentic" if played on a modern concert [[grand piano]], an instrument that would have been unknown to the composer.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

Others would not take such a rigorous view. For example, they would accept a performance of a play by [[Shakespeare]] as authentic even if the female parts were played by women rather than boys, and if the words were spoken with modern pronunciation rather than with the pronunciation of the [[Elizabethan era]], which would be difficult for a modern audience to understand.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

==Authenticity of expression==

Dutton's concept of expressive authenticity is based on the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' alternative definition of "possessing original or inherent authority". In this sense, authenticity is a measure of the degree to which the artist's work is a committed, personal expression rather than derived from other work. It includes concepts of originality, honesty and integrity.
In the case of a musical performance, authenticity of expression may conflict with authenticity of performance. The player is true to their personal musical sense and does not imitate someone else's method of playing. Their performance may thus differ significantly from that of a player attempting to follow the style common at the time the musical work was composed.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

[[File:TinaTurner&amp;Clapton.jpg|thumb|[[Tina Turner]] and [[Eric Clapton]] (1987), both known for authenticity of expression rather than authenticity of tradition.]]
Expressive authenticity is related to the technical term ''[[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]'' as used in [[existential philosophy]]. It has always been thought right to know oneself and to act accordingly, and in existential psychology this form of authenticity is seen as central to mental health.{{sfn|Wood et al.}}
Prominent artists such as the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]] [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Arshile Gorky]], and [[Willem de Kooning]] have been understood in existentialist terms, as have [[filmmaker]]s such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Ingmar Bergman]].{{sfn|Crowell|2010}}
The greater popularity of performer-based music as opposed to composition-based music is relatively recent. It seems to reflect a growing interest in expressive authenticity, and thus in musicians who have a unique and charismatic style.{{sfn|Abbing|2002|pp=173}}

The question of whether an artistic work is an authentic expression depends on the artist's background, beliefs and ideals. [[Andrew Potter]] cites the example of [[Avril Lavigne]], a teenage singer from [[Napanee]], [[Ontario]] who burst onto the pop music scene in 2002. She claimed to be a small-town skateboarder, with her background providing the subjects of her songs, and said these songs were her own compositions. These claims of authenticity of expression and of provenance were both challenged. However, her work could have been authentic in expression even if Lavigne had not written it, or authentic in provenance if she had written it but not authentic in expression if the carefully cultivated skater-girl image were false.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=79ff}}
 
Authenticity of expression may thus be linked with authenticity of style or tradition.
Many feel it is not permissible for someone to speak in the voice of another culture or racial background, and that such an expression cannot be authentic.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=79ff}}
For example, [[hip hop]] was originally an art form through which underprivileged minorities in the [[United States]] protested against their condition. As it has become less of an underground culture, there is debate over whether the spirit of hip hop can survive in a marketable integrated version.{{sfn|Rose|1994|pp=39-40}}
In "Authenticity Within Hip Hop and Other Cultures Threatened with Assimilation," [[Kembrew McLeod]] argues that hip hop culture is threatened with assimilation by a larger, mainstream culture, and that authenticity of expression in this genre is being lost.{{sfn|McLeod|1999}}

==Authenticity of experience==

[[File:British Museum Asia 45.jpg|thumb|An 8th-century AD statue of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] goddess [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] from [[Sri Lanka]] in a very different setting from the original]]
A quite different concern is the authenticity of the experience, which may be impossible to achieve. A modern visitor to a museum may not only see an object in a very different context from that which the artist intended, but also may be unable to understand important aspects of the work. The authentic experience may be impossible to recapture. A curator may accept this, perhaps attempting to present the works of art in their authentic condition, but accepting that the artificial setting and lighting are legitimate in providing a contemporary experience of the artwork, even if this experience cannot be "authentic".{{sfn|Phillips|1997|pp=1-4}}

Dutton discusses the importance of the audience, giving a hypothetical example based on ''[[La Scala]]'', the famous [[Milan]] opera house. He imagines that the natural audience, informed aficionados of the opera, lose interest and cease to attend, but the performances continue to be given to tourists who have no understanding of the work they are experiencing. In another example, he quotes a Pacific Island dancer saying "Culture? That's what we do for the tourists." In both cases, although the performances may be authentic in the sense of being true to the original, the authenticity of the experience is open to debate.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

'''''Bambi Meets Godzilla''''' (1969) is a cartoon created entirely by [[Marv Newland]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Bambi-Meets-Godzilla-Other-Cartoons/dp/6300229386 Amazon.com: Bambi Meets Godzilla &amp; Other Weird Cartoons VHS]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=oscar/&gt; Less than two minutes long, the film is a classic of [[animation]]; it was listed #38 in the book ''[[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]]'' (1994).

==Plot==
The opening credits scroll over an animated image of  the character [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]] serenely grazing while the ''[[Ranz Des Vaches|Call to the Dairy Cows]]'' from [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s [[opera]] ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]]'' (1829) plays in the background.  After the credits, Bambi looks up to see [[Godzilla]]'s giant foot coming down, squashing him flat (set to the final chord of [[The Beatles]]' "[[A Day in the Life]]" slowed down to half speed). After a moment, the closing credits appear alongside held image of Godzilla's foot atop Bambi.

Only 12 of the film's 90 seconds of running time are devoted to the story's single gag. The bulk of the running time is consumed in the opening credits, all of which name Marv Newland, including crediting Newland's parents for "producing" Marv.&lt;ref name="Jardin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/16/fan-restoration-of-bambi-me.html|title=Fan Restoration of "Bambi Meets Godzilla"|last1=Jardin|first1=Xena|website=BoingBoing|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The closing credits give grateful acknowledgement to the city of [[Tokyo]] "for their help in obtaining Godzilla for this film".

==Screenings and distribution==

[[File:Bento box from a grocery store.jpg|thumb|right|A typical bento]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Bento'''''|[[wikt:弁当|弁当]]|bentō}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bento|publisher=Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bento}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a single-portion [[take-out]] or home-packed meal common in [[Japanese cuisine]]. A traditional ''bento'' holds rice or noodles, fish or meat, with [[pickling|pickled]] and cooked vegetables, in a box.&lt;ref name=Chop&gt;"Bento: Changing New York's Lunch Culture," ''Chopsticks NY,'' vol. 27, July 2009, p. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Containers range from [[disposable]] [[Mass production|mass-produced]] to hand-crafted [[lacquerware]]. ''Bento'' are readily available in many places throughout Japan, including [[convenience store]]s, {{nihongo|''bento'' shops|弁当屋|bentō-ya}}, railway stations, and [[department store]]s. However, Japanese [[homemaker]]s often spend time and energy on a carefully prepared [[lunch box]] for their spouse, child, or themselves.

''Bentos'' can be elaborately arranged in a style called "''[[kyaraben]]''" ("character ''bento''"). ''Kyaraben'' are typically decorated to look like popular characters from Japanese animation ([[anime]]), comic books ([[manga]]), or [[video games]]. Another popular ''bento'' style is "''oekakiben''" or "picture ''bento''". This is decorated to look like people, animals, buildings and monuments, or items such as flowers and plants. Contests are often held where ''bento'' arrangers compete for the most aesthetically pleasing arrangements.

There are similar forms of boxed lunches in Asian countries including the Philippines (''baon''), Korea (''[[dosirak]]''), Taiwan (''biàn dāng'' in Mandarin and “piān-tong” in Taiwanese) and India ([[tiffin]]). Also, Hawaiian culture has adopted localized versions of ''bento'' featuring local tastes after over a century of Japanese influence in the islands.

==Etymology==
In Japan, "''bento''" is written as {{lang|ja|弁当}}. The word originates from the [[Song Dynasty|Southern Song]] [[slang]] term {{lang|ja|便当}} ({{lang|zh|便當}} ({{zh|p=biàndāng}})), meaning "convenient" or "convenience." When imported to Japan, it was written with the [[ateji]] {{lang|ja|便道}} and {{lang|ja|弁道}}.&lt;ref name=bento-dic&gt;Bento [http://gogen-allguide.com/he/bentou.html 弁当（べんとう）] 語源由来辞典 (Etymology Dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.japanhoppers.com/en/all_about_japan/food/234/ Bento (Lunch Box)], Japan Hoppers, Retrieved on 29 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the word "''bento''" has been used since the 13th century, and the container itself, also called "''bento''," has been since the 16th century.&lt;ref name=bento-dic/&gt;

In modern times, bento is commonly used in Western countries and East Asia. In [[mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]], "''bento''" is written as {{lang|zh|便當}} ({{zh|p=biàndāng}}).

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2006}}

===Kamakura period===
The origin of ''bento'' can be traced back to the late [[Kamakura period]] (1185 to 1333), when cooked and dried rice called ''hoshi-ii'' ({{lang|ja|糒}} or {{lang|ja|干し飯}}, literally "dried meal") was developed, to be carried to work.&lt;ref name=Chop/&gt; ''Hoshi-ii'' can be eaten as is or boiled with water to make cooked rice, and is stored in a small bag.  In the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]] (1568–1600), wooden lacquered boxes like today's were produced, and ''bento'' would be eaten during a ''[[hanami]]'' or a tea party.

===Edo period===
[[File:Gotenyama hiroshige.jpg|thumb|''[[Hanami]]'' ''bento'' in the [[Edo period]]]]
In the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867), ''bento'' culture spread and became more refined.  Travelers and sightseers would carry a simple ''koshibentō'' ({{lang|ja|腰弁当}}, "waist ''bento''"), consisting of several ''[[onigiri]]'' wrapped with bamboo leaves or in a woven bamboo box.  One of the most popular styles of ''bento'', called ''[[makunouchi|makuno-uchi]] bentō'' ("between-act ''bento''"), was first made during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese Lunch Boxes - History|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/virtual/bento/bento02.html|work=web-japan.org|publisher=Kids Web Japan|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   People who came to see ''[[Noh]]'' and [[Kabuki]] ate specially prepared ''bentos'' between ''maku'' (acts).  Numerous cookbooks were published detailing how to cook, how to pack, and what to prepare for occasions like ''[[Hanami]]'' and ''[[Hinamatsuri]]''.

===Meiji Period===
In the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912), the first ''ekibentō'' or ''[[ekiben]]'' ({{lang|ja|駅弁当}} or {{lang|ja|駅弁}}, "train station ''bento''") was sold. There are several records that claim where ''ekiben'' was first sold, but it is believed that it was sold on 16 July 1885, at the [[Utsunomiya]] train station, in the northern [[Kantō region]] of Japan, and contained two ''onigiri'' and a serving of ''[[takuan]]'' wrapped in bamboo leaves. As early schools did not provide lunch, students and teachers carried ''bentos'', as did many employees. "European" style ''bentos'' with sandwiches also went on sale during this period.

=== Taishō period ===
In the [[Taishō period]] (1912–1926), the aluminum ''bento'' box became a luxury item because of its ease of cleaning and its silver-like appearance. Also, a move to abolish the practice of ''bento'' in school became a social issue.  Disparities in wealth spread during this period, following an export boom during World War I and subsequent crop failures in the Tohoku region. A ''bento'' too often reflected a student's wealth, and many wondered if this had an unfavorable influence on children both physically, from lack of adequate diet, and psychologically, from a clumsily made ''bento'' or the richness of food. After World War II, the practice of bringing ''bentos'' to school gradually declined and was replaced by uniform food provided for all students and teachers.

[[File:Bento box.png|thumb|Aluminum bento box, 1961. Lid fits closely. Small compartment for condiments.]]
===Shōwa and Heisei periods===
''Bentos'' regained popularity in the 1980s, with the help of the microwave oven and the proliferation of [[Convenience store#Japan|convenience stores]]. In addition, the expensive wood and metal boxes have been replaced at most ''bento'' shops with inexpensive, disposable [[polystyrene]] boxes. However, even handmade ''bentos'' have made a comeback, and they are once again a common, although not universal, sight at [[Education in Japan|Japanese schools]]. ''Bentos'' are still used by workers as a [[packed lunch]], by families on day trips, for school picnics and sports days etc. The ''bento'', made at home, is wrapped in a ''[[furoshiki]]'' cloth, which acts as both bag and table mat.

Airports also offer an analogous version of the ''ekiben'': a bento filled with local cuisine, to be eaten while waiting for an airplane or during the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashkenazi|first=Michael|title=The essence of Japanese cuisine: an essay on food and culture|year=2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812235661|page=226|author2=Jacob, Jeanne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other countries===
The ''bento'' made its way to [[Taiwan]] in the first half of the 20th century from Japan and remains very popular to the present day. The Japanese name was borrowed as ''bendong'' ([[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]: ''piān-tong'') or [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] ''biàndāng'' (便當).

==Culture==
In Japan, it is common for mothers to make ''bento'' for their children to take to school. Because making ''bento'' can take a while, some mothers will prepare the ingredients the night before and pack everything the following morning before their children go to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegel|first1=Bettina|title=The Adorable Lunch, Part 2: My Interview With Bento Moms|url=http://www.thelunchtray.com/the-adorable-lunch-part-2-my-interview-with-bento-moms/|website=The Lunch Tray|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often a social expectation of mothers to provide bento for their children, to create both a nutritionally balanced and aesthetically pleasing meal.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allison|first1=Anne|title=Permitted and Prohibited Desires|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity is expected of the mother and emphasised by society at large,&lt;ref name=Allison/&gt; and is common in nursery school institutions.

Pure ''Hinomaru bento'' only consists of rice and ''umeboshi'' to flavor rice without any other side dishes. The metal ''bento'' boxes, once popular in Japan, were often corroded by the acid of ''umeboshi'', eventually making a hole in the middle of the lid.

'''''Broken News''''' is a comedy programme shown on [[BBC Two]] in late 2005. The show poked fun at the world of 24-hour rolling news channels. The title of the show is a play on the phrase "breaking news". It had six thirty-minute episodes. Having previously worked on programmes such as ''[[People Like Us (mockumentary)|People Like Us]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Format]]'', the show's production team worked closely with writer and director [[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]].

The show [[jump cut]] between its various spoof TV channels, which covered both the central story and other stories that would be of interest to their audience. A large part of the comedy came from observations about the nature of news presentation rather than the stories themselves.

The programme centred on Britain's addiction to 24-hour [[news channels]]. Each week, ''Broken News'' looked at a fictitious news story such as "Tomato Flu" or "The End of the Rain". Its massive cast of 145 actors played [[anchors|newsreaders]] and reporters on different networks.

It was released on [[DVD]] Region 2 on 12 June 2006.

== The featured networks ==
The programme featured mainly the following fictitious networks:

* '''Aronovitz Business News'''. This business and financial news station featured onscreen graphics similar in style to [[Bloomberg Television]]. Most of the screen is taken up by graphs and stock-tickers (showing prices of nonexistent stocks such as "Unicorn hooves") with only a small window where '''Gary Mills''' and '''Mitchell Oatis''' tend to argue with rather 'colourful' similes ("Well, [[Marks and Spencer]] are leading investors up the garden path yet again. Why do we have to say 'Yes, we love the underwear and the food'? Why not merge them to make edible underwear?") . Some of the smaller graphics transition by spinning around on a regular basis, and sometimes the studio window spins, as an extra joke.
*'''ESN News''' is an example of style over content where news is forever coming up but never arrives ("Still to come, a round-up of the reminders of the news still to come."). Largely based on the [[ITV News Channel]] and partly on [[Sky News]], with a rolling news ticker, two newscasters ('''Katie Tate''' and '''Richard Pritchard''') at a desk at the front of the studio. '''Melanie Bellamy''' delivers the "standing news" to a large screen at the back of the studio, displaying slightly nauseating floating graphics. The station has a reporter embedded with the crew of the [[International Space Station]], '''Nick Burnham''', who is inevitably miles away from the news. He therefore exaggerates all stories to make the situation seem as dire as possible ("We have been informed that up a third of our supplies contain [[Tomato]]ids, and we've already eaten half!"). The first and last names of the channels' reporters sound almost alike, such as Nicholas Nicklaus, Amanda Panda and Alison Ellison, a running gag on the channel. The station also reads out ill-informed text messages sent in by viewers ("Everyone keeps passing the buck for this problem - I blame society", "I'm not a [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathiser, but why don't we ever sympathise with them?") and performs phone polls ("Are children all criminals? Yes: 104%, No: 103%).
*'''Film and Movie News''' features interviews with all the star names in the movie industry, similar in style to [[Jonathan Ross]] hosted ''[[Film 2015|Film]]'' programme. '''Joe Reed''' is the resident presenter and film critic (and part-time lecturer in Film Studies at the University of Bournemouth), who flatters film stars during interviews &amp;mdash; and then berates their performances in reviews ("I thought I was going to vomit so hard, my liquified kidneys would be forced out of my nose" and "If you see this train-wreck of a movie, you will feel the overwhelming desire to rip out your eyes and force them up into your ears, just so you can't see or hear this film.").
* '''GO Sports 1''' is a sports news channel in the style of [[Sky Sports News]], featuring bizarre stats on the right hand side of the screen such as which Premiership club owns the most Dido CDs and who are the top football lovers this season. The main anchors are '''Kevin Peters''' and '''Natalie Gosling''', with '''Guy Baston''' as reporter ("[[Manchester United]] have denied that starting other Manchester Uniteds in China, Japan, Australia, the US, Scotland, Wales and London would make the club any less unique or be in the least bit confusing"). The channel also runs several other channels (GO Sports 1 2 to GO Sports 1 5) which show non-stop match buildup, post match analysis, repeats and multiangle interactive repeats of all the big matches.
* '''IBS News''' is an American news channel that appears to be a parody of [[Fox News Channel|FOX News]]. The station's [[news presenter|newsreaders]], '''Anthony Markowitz''' and '''Julia Regan''' ([[Claudia Christian]]), give long pieces of opinion after every topic, often using the phrases 'I'm no expert' or 'I don't pretend to know much about this, but...'. Anthony tends to give colloquial, ill-informed opinion ("When you flush the toilet on an aeroplane, do you ever think about where it goes? I sure don't!"), while Julia gives incredibly political commentary on the outcome ("Imagine the effect this will have on the already strict aviation guidelines in force"). They then inevitably link the story, however tenuously, to the weather report ("No more frozen urine falling from the sky, but expect rain over [[North Carolina]]"). It also covers the "Vincenti Trial", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] and [[O.J. Simpson]] trials, where the main defendant is accused of murdering his wife who was having affairs with three different women in three hotels in three states simultaneously while technically dead ("Of course whether or not this is even possible has to be considered a legal nicety").
* '''Look Out East''' is a mish-mash of regional UK news programmes (the name is a parody of [[BBC Look East]]). They lead with banal stories ("Man has teeth stolen!") and feature banter between the urbane hosts, '''Phil Curdridge''' and '''Sarah Holt''', and the mild-mannered weather presenter, '''Russ'''.  Invariably the conversation veers off and ends up discussing some smutty topic ("The closest was the time we visited a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] nudist beach! That's the time my daughter was conceived, I think..."), with a [[subtext]] that is usually at the expense of Russ.  All these end with "Let's not go there" or "Honestly, boys...".
* '''PVS News''', the earnest, no-frills network. The set, presentation, and on screen graphics mirror that of [[BBC News 24]]. The main anchors are '''Adam Lockwood''' and '''Frances Walsh''' ([[Clare Wille]]) (reportedly born within minutes of each other and have been indistinguishable ever since) whose running gag is to complete each other's words and sentences. The station features live links to various locations, with international correspondent '''Will Parker''' ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]). The station uses poor quality live satellite links to locations where events have not occurred yet ("[[Donald Rumsfeld]] is very much his own man, and people here are talking about what he will not say as much as what he will say when he does turn up. He will probably not say what we expect him to say, because that's not his style") and covers unimportant stories too, just to fill up the time ("Due to a debate between [[TV producer]]s and [[librarian]]s, news channels cannot shoot new footage of libraries. These [[stock footage|library pictures]] were shot months ago.") The field reporters often ask the main anchors "''What more can you tell us''" -  a complete [[role reversal]].
* '''SO News''' claims to supply everything you ever wanted to know about the world of celebrity, similar in style to [[BBC Three]]'s now defunct ''[[Liquid News]]''. Presented by '''Claudia van Sant''' ([[Lucy Porter]]) and '''Colin Kay''', the channel leads with vapid gossip on various celebrities, with an incredibly [[Camp (style)|camp]] American reporter live in [[Los Angeles]], '''Josh Cashman''' ([[Phil Nichol]]), who begins all reports with 'Pur-leasee!' ("I mean, can you imagine if [[Robin Williams]] turned up naked to his next premiere?").   Cashman is presumably based on [[Cash Peters]], who does a similar style broadcast on [[BBC Radio Five Live]].

Other smaller networks include:

* '''15 Second News''', based on BBC Three's ''[[60 Seconds]]'' news bulletins. In order to make the news "manageable", important stories are broken into three word headlines ("In national news a car is found in a tree in Basingstoke. Israel threatens. In sport, two world records are broken. More later").
* '''Traffic Round-up-date''', a round-up of the latest traffic conditions (similar to [[BBC London News|BBC London]]'s reports in the morning). Roads are routinely mis-labeled (or in some cases, made up entirely) ("On the A313131, Fiddler's Elbow, a lorry has overturned, spilling its load of cars. Traffic is slow owing to the extra volume of cars on the road", "Motorists have been warned of some weather in severe parts of the country").
* '''World Money Today''': A spoof of [[BBC News 24]]'s ''World Business Report'', with similar graphics and simulcast between several presenters worldwide. The main presenter is '''Dan Evans''', based in a London studio. The other reporters are based in New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Berlin, Geneva, Buenos Aires, Johannesburg and Sydney

Occasional separate weather reports are thrown in, with graphic and presentation styles similar to those found on many television channels in the UK. They are often cut together in such a way that the resulting sentences are complete nonsense. The weather reports vary from almost useless ("There's going to be a lot of air tomorrow") to over-useful ("The northern [[Tajikistan]] province of [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region|Gorno-Badakhshan]] has experienced no weather for over four months now.") and gives pointless figures similar to the pollen, pollution and sun indices used by BBC and ITV weather stations ("There is a warning of high [[altitude]] for people living on mountains in the [[Pennines]] and [[Yorkshire Dales]]").

== Episodes ==
# '''Tomato Flu''' An outbreak of tomato flu is in the headlines. This alarming new super-virus (a parody of [[avian influenza]]) can be traced back to a [[domestic turkey|turkey]] farm in [[Turkey]]. The news networks advise on the best way to avoid tomatoids in food such as [[tomato ketchup]]. ''In other news:'' a man is injured by a frozen block of urine. 	
# '''Missing Island''' A report that an island has gone missing in the [[Barents Sea]] triggers paranoia about rising sea levels in [[Lincolnshire]] and the end of the world as we know it. ''In other news:'' teenagers' attention spans are now as low as eleven seconds. 	
# '''Half Way There Day''' Reports on commemorations around the country to mark the day Britain reached the half-way point in the last [[World War]]. ''In other news:'' The MADI music awards are here again, without last year's controversy. 	
# '''Crime''' The publication of a [[Home Office]] report which reveals that the majority of teenagers are now criminals leads to a series of news stories from the country's worst-hit areas. A picture of Britain in which the teenage population "now effectively feral, roam Britain's urban landscapes in packs of up to fifteen at a single time." ''In other news:'' [[East Anglia]] could be gone within a decade. 	
# '''Bolivian Crisis''' Reaction comes from around the world to rumours that [[Bolivia]] might have acquired [[nuclear weapons]]. Including a report from [[the White House]]: This is a bad day for the good guys, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]. ''In other news:'' A cross-eyed man kills a horse while trying to shoot himself. 	
# '''Hijack''' Media frenzy is quick to follow after reports emerge of an apparent hijack of an American passenger flight bound for [[Amsterdam]]. This live breaking story dominates the running orders of the world's news networks. ''In other news:'' An [[injunction]] has been served on Josh Cashman.

==Reception==
Some have accused the show of being too close in style, presentation, writing and humour to the groundbreaking news satire ''[[The Day Today]]'',  first broadcast in 1994. ''Broken News'' has been attacked as "''The Day Today'' for idiots. A show with nothing to say, full of...sub-[[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] newspeak and malapropism-humour shorn of all originality. ''The Day Today'' had a reason to exist - this didn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first =| last =| title =Comedy Tumbleweed Awards 2005| work =| date =| accessdate =| url =http://chilled.cream.org/tumbleweed2005/tumbleweeds_forcedframe.html?/tumbleweed2005/tumbleweeds_page03.html| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070305013926/http://chilled.cream.org/tumbleweed2005/tumbleweeds_forcedframe.html?%2Ftumbleweed2005%2Ftumbleweeds_page03.html| archivedate =5 March 2007| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, co-creator John Morton said in ''[[The Guardian]]'' "I hope after the first 10 minutes of our show you realise that it's a different animal from ''The Day Today''. The target has changed because we've got this [[Tower of Babel]] of news. Plus we're sillier and more harmless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1670">'''Candidatus scientiarum''' (male), or '''candidata scientiarum''' (female), abbreviated as '''cand.scient.''', is an [[academic degree]] currently awarded in Denmark and formerly awarded in Norway.

In Denmark, cand.scient. is a higher-level degree awarded as a ''[[Kandidat]]'' (Candidate) degree by Danish universities to graduate students in the mathematics and natural sciences. The study requires 120 [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS]], and normally requires two years study in addition to a completed bachelor's degree. The title is officially translated to English as ''Master of Science''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=160853#Kap5&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, cand.scient. was a higher-level degree awarded in the fields of mathematics and natural sciences. It was introduced in 1985, replacing the more rigorous [[cand.real.]] degree. Completion required 1.5–2 years study in addition to a completed cand.mag. degree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sv.uio.no/english/academics/degrees/candpolit.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020213043545/http://www.uio.no/english/academics/admission/academicsystem.html |date=February 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the cand.scient. degree was replaced in Norway by the ''Master of Science'' degree as part of the adoption of the [[Bologna Process]].&lt;ref&gt;Candidatus: akademisk grad.

'''''Cannibal Campout''''' is a 1988 [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Jon McBride (filmmaker)|Jon McBride]], and co-directed by Tom Fisher.

== Plot ==

While out for a jog in the community of Redston, a woman named Nancy is hacked to death with an felling axe by a man wearing a [[fighter pilot]] helmet. Later, two couples consisting of Jon and Carrie, and Amy and Chris, head to Redston to camp out for the weekend, but on the way there they encounter a pair of [[Hillbilly|hillbillies]] named Rich and Gene, who attack them.

After the encounter with the backwoods duo (revealed to be the brothers of the fighter helmet-wearing man, Joe) the quartet set up near some abandoned cabins, while the hillbillies murder would-be pranksters John and Ray. After wandering off alone to get her cigarettes, Carrie is killed by Gene and Joe, and her friends are captured while looking for her. Jon is knocked out in a fight with Joe, and [[Disembowelment|disemboweled]] and eaten by the brothers, who [[Force-feeding|force feed]] the other captives some of his innards. When Gene and Joe leave with Jon's body, Rich butchers Chris, and tries to [[rape]] Amy, but is stabbed with his own knife, and left for dead.

Traversing the wilderness, Amy encounters Joe, and during the ensuing scuffle pulls off his helmet, revealing his disfigured face. After Joe runs off, Gene and the recovered Rich recapture Amy, and cut out and eat her unborn child. An unknown amount of time later, the brothers are shown partaking in an unsuccessful hunt, and when Rich suggests they merely get [[fast food]], Gene scolds him, reminding him that they promised their mother they would never eat those chemical-soaked foods. When Rich continues to complain, Gene and Joe become annoyed, and seemingly decide to eat him.

== Reception ==

A three out of five was awarded by [[Bloody Disgusting]], which stated "The joy of this film is in the sheer audacity of the filmmakers who managed to get this project on the shelves of [[Small business|mom and pop shops]] all over the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://bloody-disgusting.com/film/110551/cannibal-campout-v/?tab=bd-review|title = ''Cannibal Campout'' (V)|author = Bloody Disgusting Staff|publisher = Bloody Disgusting|date = February 6, 2007|work = Cannibal Campout|accessdate = May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVD Verdict]] said that while ''Cannibal Campout'' was bad, it was enjoyable due to the gore, and "the lovable cheapness of the whole thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/cannibalcampout.php|title = ''Cannibal Campout''|author = David Johnson|publisher = DVD Verdict|date = January 16, 2007|work = Cannibal Campout|accessdate = May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DVD Talk gave the film a one and half out of five, writing "Cheap and chintzy is one thing. Low-end and insipid is another, but what's on display here is simply too stupid to believe" and "McBride makes his villains so garishly weird, stupid and gross that it seems he's going for sort of a ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' tone, but the actors are so rotten, and the gore is so blatantly stupid-looking, that any sense of dread or discomfort is replaced by feelings of exasperated incredulity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/26084/cannibal-campout/|title = ''Cannibal Campout''|author = Scott Weinberg|publisher = DVD Talk|date = January 15, 2007|work = Cannibal Campout|accessdate = May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cardinal and Theological Virtues''''' is a [[lunette]] fresco by [[Raphael]] found on the south wall of the [[Stanza della Segnatura]] in the [[Apostolic Palace]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Three of the [[cardinal virtues]] are personified as statuesque women seated in a bucolic landscape and the [[theological virtues]] are depicted by [[putto|putti]]. The fresco was a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the private apartments of [[Pope Julius II]]. These rooms are now known as the [[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]]. After completing his three monumental frescoes ''[[Disputation of the Holy Sacrament]]'', ''[[The Parnassus]]'', and ''[[The School of Athens]]'' in the Stanza della Segnatura, Raphael painted the ''Cardinal and Theological Virtues'' in 1511.{{sfn|Knight|1847|p=358}}

==Description==
[[File:Raffael 053.jpg|thumb|left|Justice displayed in a medallion on the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura]]
The walls containing frescoes in the ''Stanza della Segnatura'' depict four branches of human knowledge: Philosophy (''School of Athens''), Religion (''Disputation''), Poetry (''Parnassus''), and Law (''Virtues'').{{sfn|Paoletti|Radke|2005|p=409}} The fourth wall containing the ''Virtues'' addresses both the civil law of the secular state and the canon law of the Church.{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=109}} Accordingly, three classical cardinal virtues ([[courage|Fortitude]], [[Prudence]] and [[temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]) are  attended by five putti, three of whom depict the theological virtues of [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]], [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]], and [[Faith in Christianity#Roman Catholicism|Faith]].{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}}

On the left, Raphael painted Fortitude. Armor-clad, she caresses a lion with her left hand while grasping a sapling of black oak with her right.{{sfn|Massi|1885|p=72}} The oak tree symbolizes strength and alludes to the [[Della Rovere]] family to which Pope Julius II belonged.{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=110}} A putto representing Charity harvests acorns from the oak branch.{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}} Fortitude's seated posture and the folds of her clothing are copied directly from a [[modello]] Raphael had seen of [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Moses (Michelangelo)|''Moses'']].{{sfn|Joannides|1983|p=20}}

Prominently seated in the center is Prudence. On her breast is an effigy of a winged [[Gorgon]] to ward off deceit and fraud. [[Janus]]-like, her head has two faces shown in profile. Her youthful feminine face looks forward into a mirror. This is an allegory of wisdom and knowledge of the present. The backward-facing visage of the old man peers into a past for sound judgment predicated on experience.{{sfn|Massi|1885|p=72}} His view is enhanced by the flaming torch held by a putto depicting Hope.{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}}

Temperance sits on the right. She holds the bridle of restraint{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=110}} and is accompanied by a putto portraying Faith who points upward to heaven with his right hand.{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}}

The fourth cardinal virtue, [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], isn't included in the scene. Instead, she is depicted holding scales and a sword in a [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] on the ceiling directly above the fresco.{{sfn|Massi|1885|p=71}} The more prominent position of Justice is explained by the emphasis [[Plato]] placed on this fourth virtue. He introduced it to ensure the other three cardinal virtues existed in harmony.{{sfn|Jacorzynski|2009|p=193}}

The other two frescoes found lower on the wall also portray scenes concerning the law. To the left of the window is a fresco designed by Raphael but executed by his studio. It depicts the [[Emperor Justinian]] receiving the civil code known as the [[Digest (Roman law)|Pandects]] of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' from [[Tribonian]]. To the right of the window, [[Pope Gregory IX]] (as portrayed by Julius II) receives the code of canon law known as the ''[[Decretales Gregorii IX|Decretals]]'' from [[Raymond of Penyafort]].{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=109}}

[[File:Adolph Menzel - Flötenkonzert Friedrichs des Großen in Sanssouci - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Frederick the Great]] plays flute in his summer palace [[Sanssouci]], with [[Franz Benda]] playing violin, [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] accompanying on keyboard, and unidentified string players; painting by [[Adolph Menzel]] (1850–52)]]
'''Chamber music''' is a form of [[classical music]] that is composed for a small group of instruments—traditionally a group that could fit in a [[Great chamber|palace chamber]] or a large room. Most broadly, it includes any [[art music]] that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part (in contrast to [[orchestra]]l music, in which each string part is played by a number of performers). However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances.

Because of its intimate nature, chamber music has been described as "the music of friends".&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bashford, "The String Quartet and Society", in Stowell (2003), p 4. The expression "music of friends" was first used by Richard Walthew in a lecture published in South Place Institute, London, in 1909.{{Full citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more than 100 years, chamber music was played primarily by amateur musicians in their homes, and even today, when chamber music performance has migrated from the home to the concert hall, many musicians, amateur and professional, still play chamber music for their own pleasure. Playing chamber music requires special skills, both musical and social, that differ from the skills required for playing solo or symphonic works.&lt;ref&gt;Estelle Ruth Jorgensen, ''The Art of Teaching Music'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2008): 153–54. {{ISBN|978-0-253-35078-7}} (cloth); {{ISBN|978-0-253-21963-3}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] described chamber music (specifically, string quartet music) as "four rational people conversing".&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bashford, "The string quartet and society" in Stowell (2003), p 4. The quote was from a letter to C.F. Zelter, November 9, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; This conversational paradigm–which refers to the way one instrument introduces a melody or motif and then other instruments subsequently "respond" with a similar motif–has been a thread woven through the history of chamber music composition from the end of the 18th century to the present. The analogy to conversation recurs in descriptions and analyses of chamber music compositions.

From its earliest beginnings in the Medieval period to the present, chamber music has been a reflection of the changes in the technology and the society that produced it.

===Early beginnings===

[[File:AntiqueQuartet.jpg|thumb|[[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] play a quartet on viols in this fanciful woodcut from 1516.]]
During the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance, instruments were used primarily as accompaniment for singers.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of the origins of chamber music see Ulrich (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; String players would play along with the melody line sung by the singer. There were also purely instrumental ensembles, often of stringed precursors of the violin family, called [[Consort of instruments|consorts]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyden (1965), p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts consider the origin of classical instrumental ensembles to be the [[sonata da camera]] (chamber sonata) and the [[sonata da chiesa]] (church sonata).&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich (1966), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; These were compositions for one to five or more instruments. The sonata da camera was a suite of slow and fast movements, interspersed with dance tunes; the sonata da chiesa was the same, but the dances were omitted. These forms gradually developed into the [[trio sonata]] of the [[Baroque]] – two treble instruments and a bass instrument, often with a keyboard or other chording instrument ([[harpsichord]], [[Pipe organ|organ]], harp or [[lute]], for example) filling in the harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Donington(1982), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Several things need verification here: (1) what kind of instrument is a "bass line" -- changed to "instrument", though I believe bass line is more correct, as several instruments might play the bass part, (2) how can a clavichord be used to accompany anything that makes any sound at all, (3) why are the harp, organ, theorbo, chotarrone, and archlute excluded from playing continuo, -- comment taken, text revised -- and (4) why must there be only *one* chording instrument? I have cited Donington on this that there is normally only one chording instrument, though other references may differ. I would be interested in hearing if so--&gt; Both the bass instrument and the chordal instrument would play the [[basso continuo]] part.

During the Baroque period, chamber music as a genre was not clearly defined. Often, works could be played on any variety of instruments, in orchestral or chamber ensembles. ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], for example, can be played on a keyboard instrument (harpsichord or organ) or by a string quartet or a [[string orchestra]]. The instrumentation of trio sonatas was also often flexibly specified; some of Handel's sonatas are scored for "[[German flute]], Hoboy [oboe] or Violin"&lt;ref&gt;''Solos for a German Flute, a Hoboy or a Violin'' published by John Walsh, c. 1730.&lt;!--The text originally read "opera 1-5" and "violins or flutes or oboes"; if Ulrich actually says these things, then they may be restored with an additional note pointing out that (1) only the op. 2 and 5 sets consist of trio sonatas (op. 1 contains solo sonatas, op. 3 consists of concerti grossi, and op. 4 contains organ concertos—all of these have entirely specific scoring), and (2) None of the op. 2 or op. 5 trio sonatas include oboes amongst the possible instruments, (3) all of the op. 5 and four of the six op. 2 trios specify violins only.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bass lines could be played by [[violone]], [[cello]], [[theorbo]], or [[bassoon]], and sometimes three or four instruments would join in the bass line in unison. Sometimes composers mixed movements for chamber ensembles with orchestral movements. Telemann's 'Tafelmusik' (1733), for example, has five sets of movements for various combinations of instruments, ending with a full orchestral section.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich (1966), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque chamber music was often [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]]; that is, each instrument played the same melodic materials at different times, creating a complex, interwoven fabric of sound.&lt;!--This is a description of ''canonic writing'', and trio sonatas are rarely canonic.--&gt; Because each instrument was playing essentially the same melodies, all the instruments were equal. In the trio sonata, there is often no ascendent or solo instrument, but all three instruments share equal importance.&lt;!--Source needed. In fact, this is sometimes true, sometimes not. -- I have qualified this so it is less categorical. Personally, I know of no trio sonata of the Baroque where there is a solo line – if there were, would it be called a trio sonata? However, if you still feel this needs a citation, put the fact tag back in, and I will look for a source. ravpapa--&gt;

[[File:TrioSonata.jpg|thumb|[[Baroque music]]ians playing a trio sonata, 18th century anonymous painting]]
The harmonic role played by the keyboard or other chording instrument was subsidiary,&lt;!--Since the keyboard (or harp, or theorbo, etc.) plays the bass (together with an improvised harmonisation guided by it), this statement contradicts the last sentence of the preceding paragraph: "all three instruments have equal importance". -- revised the sentence to clarify. ravpapa --&gt; and usually the keyboard part was not even written out; rather, the chordal structure of the piece was specified by numeric codes over the bass line, called [[figured bass]].

In the second half of the 18th century, tastes began to change: many composers preferred a new, lighter [[Galant]] style, with "thinner texture,&amp;nbsp;... and clearly defined melody and bass" to the complexities of counterpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Gjerdingen (2007), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Now a new custom arose that gave birth to a new form of chamber music: the [[serenade]]. Patrons invited street musicians to play evening concerts below the balconies of their homes, their friends and their lovers. Patrons and musicians commissioned composers to write suitable suites of dances and tunes, for groups of two to five or six players. These works were called serenades (sera=night), nocturnes, divertimenti, or cassations (from gasse=street). The young [[Joseph Haydn]] was commissioned to write several of these.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich(1966), pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haydn, Mozart, and the classical style===

[[Joseph Haydn]] is generally credited with creating the modern form of chamber music as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;See Donald Tovey, "Haydn", in Cobbett (1929), or Geiringer (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn|83 string quartets]], [[List of piano trios by Joseph Haydn|45 piano trios]], and numerous string trios, duos and wind ensembles, Haydn established the conversational style of composition and the overall form that was to dominate the world of chamber music for the next two centuries.

An example of the conversational mode of composition is Haydn's [[String Quartets, Op. 20 (Haydn)|string quartet Op. 20]], No. 4 in D major. In the first movement, after a statement of the main theme by all the instruments, the first violin breaks into a triplet figure, supported by the second violin, viola and cello. The cello answers with its own triplet figure, then the viola, while the other instruments play a secondary theme against this movement. Unlike counterpoint, where each part plays essentially the same melodic role as the others, here each instrument contributes its own character, its own comment on the music as it develops.

[[File:Haydn20-4.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Score of Joseph Haydn's Op. 20, No. 4, showing conversational mode.]]
Haydn also settled on an overall form for his chamber music compositions, which would become the standard, with slight variations, to the present day. The characteristic Haydn string quartet has four movements:

*''An opening movement in [[sonata form]]'', usually with two contrasting themes, followed by a development section where the thematic material is transformed and transposed, and ending with a recapitulation of the initial two themes.
*''A lyrical movement'' in a slow or moderate tempo, sometimes built out of three sections that repeat themselves in the order A–B–C–A–B–C, and sometimes a set of variations.
*''A [[minuet]] or [[scherzo]]'', a light movement in three quarter time, with a main section, a contrasting trio section, and a repeat of the main section.
*''A fast finale section'' in [[rondo]] form, a series of contrasting sections with a main refrain section opening and closing the movement, and repeating between each section.

His innovations earned Haydn the title "father of the string quartet",&lt;ref&gt;Adolfo Betti, "Quartet: its origins and development", in Cobbett (1929). The first use of this expression is earlier than this, but its origin is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was recognized by his contemporaries as the leading composer of his time. But he was by no means the only composer developing new modes of chamber music. Even before Haydn, many composers were already experimenting with new forms. [[Giovanni Battista Sammartini]], [[Ignaz Holzbauer]], and [[Franz Xaver Richter]] wrote precursors of the string quartet.

[[File:HaydnPlaying.jpg|thumb|Joseph Haydn playing string quartets]]
If Haydn created the conversational style of composition, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] greatly expanded its vocabulary. His [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart#Chamber music|chamber music]] added numerous masterpieces to the chamber music repertoire. Mozart's seven piano trios and two piano quartets were the first to apply the conversational principle to chamber music with piano. Haydn's piano trios are essentially piano sonatas with the violin and cello playing mostly supporting roles, doubling the treble and bass lines of the piano score. But Mozart gives the strings an independent role, using them as a counter to the piano, and adding their individual voices to the chamber music conversation.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Fuller Maitland, "Pianoforte and Strings", in Cobbett (1929), p. 220(v.II).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozart introduced the newly invented clarinet into the chamber music arsenal, with the [[Kegelstatt Trio]] for viola, clarinet and piano, K. 498, and the [[Clarinet Quintet (Mozart)|Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet]], K. 581. He also tried other innovative ensembles, including the quintet for violin, two violas, cello, and horn, K. 407, quartets for flute and strings, and various wind instrument combinations. He wrote six string quintets for two violins, two violas and cello, which explore the rich tenor tones of the violas, adding a new dimension to the string quartet conversation.

Mozart's string quartets are considered the pinnacle of the classical art. The [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|six string quartets that he dedicated to Haydn]], his friend and mentor, inspired the elder composer to say to Mozart's father, "I tell you before God as an honest man that your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by reputation. He has taste, and, what is more, the most profound knowledge of composition."&lt;ref&gt;Geiringer (1982), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other composers wrote chamber compositions during this period that were popular at the time and are still played today. [[Luigi Boccherini]], Italian composer and cellist, wrote nearly a hundred string quartets, and more than one hundred quintets for two violins, viola and two cellos. In this innovative ensemble, later used by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], Boccherini gives flashy, virtuosic solos to the principal cello, as a showcase for his own playing. Violinist [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf]] and cellist [[Johann Baptist Wanhal]], who both played pickup quartets with Haydn on second violin and Mozart on viola, were popular chamber music composers of the period.

===From home to hall===

[[File:FortepianoByMcNultyAfterWalter1805.jpg|thumb|upright|Copy of a pianoforte from 1805]]
The turn of the 19th century saw dramatic changes in society and in music technology which had far-reaching effects on the way chamber music was composed and played.

====Collapse of the aristocratic system====

Throughout the 18th century, the composer was normally an employee of an aristocrat, and the chamber music he or she composed was for the pleasure of aristocratic players and listeners.&lt;ref&gt;for a discussion of the effects of social change on music of the 18th and 19th centuries, see Raynor (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn, for example, was an employee of [[Nikolaus I, Prince Esterházy]], a music lover and amateur [[baryton]] player, for whom Haydn wrote many of his string trios. Mozart wrote three string quartets for the King of Prussia, [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]], a cellist. Many of Beethoven's quartets were first performed with patron Count [[Andrey Razumovsky]] on second violin. Boccherini composed for the king of Spain.

With the bankruptcy of the aristocracy and new social orders throughout Europe, composers increasingly had to make money by selling their compositions and performing concerts. They often gave subscription concerts, which involved renting a hall and collecting the receipts from the performance. Increasingly, they wrote chamber music not only for rich patrons, but for professional musicians playing for a paying audience.

====Changes in the structure of stringed instruments====
At the beginning of the 19th century, luthiers developed new methods of constructing the [[violin]], [[viola]] and [[cello]] that gave these instruments a richer tone, more volume, and more carrying power.&lt;ref&gt;David Boyden, "The Violin", pp.&amp;nbsp;31–35, in Sadie (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Also at this time, bowmakers made the violin bow longer, with a thicker ribbon of hair under higher tension. This improved projection, and also made possible new bowing techniques. In 1820, [[Louis Spohr]] invented the chinrest, which gave violinists more freedom of movement in their left hands, for a more nimble technique. These changes contributed to the effectiveness of public performances in large halls, and expanded the repertoire of techniques available to chamber music composers.

====Invention of the pianoforte====
Throughout the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], the [[harpsichord]] was one of the main instruments used in chamber music. The harpsichord used quills to pluck strings, and it had a delicate sound. Due to the design of the harpsichord, the attack or weight with which the performer played the keyboard did not change the volume or tone. In between about 1750 and the late 1700s, the harpsichord gradually fell out of use. By the late 1700s, the [[pianoforte]] became more popular as an instrument for performance. Even though the pianoforte was invented by [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] at the beginning of the 1700s, it did not become widely used until the end of that century, when technical improvements in its construction made it a more effective instrument. Unlike the harpsichord, the pianoforte could play soft or loud dynamics and sharp [[sforzando (musical direction)|sforzando]] attacks depending on how hard or soft the performer played the keys.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Glutton, "The Pianoforte", in Baines (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; The improved pianoforte was adopted by Mozart and other composers, who began composing chamber ensembles with the piano playing a leading role. The piano was to become more and more dominant through the 19th century, so much so that many composers, such as [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]], wrote almost exclusively for solo piano (or solo piano with [[orchestra]]).

===Beethoven===

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] straddled this period of change as a giant of Western music. Beethoven transformed chamber music, raising it to a new plane, both in terms of content and in terms of the technical demands on performers and audiences. His works, in the words of [[Maynard Solomon]], were "...the models against which nineteenth-century romanticism measured its achievements and failures."&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Solomon, "Beethoven: Beyond Classicism", p. 59, in Winter and Martin (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late quartets]], in particular, were considered so daunting an accomplishment that many composers after him were afraid to try composing quartets; [[Johannes Brahms]] composed and tore up 20 string quartets before he dared publish a work that he felt was worthy of the "giant marching behind".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hefling, "The Austro-Germanic quartet tradition in the nineteenth century", p. 244, in Stowell (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeethovenGhostManuscript.jpg|thumb|250px|Manuscript of the [[Piano Trio No. 5 (Beethoven)|"Ghost" Trio, Op. 70, No. 1]], by Beethoven]]
Beethoven made his formal debut as a composer with [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|three Piano Trios, Op. 1]]. Even these early works, written when Beethoven was only 22, while adhering to a strictly classical mold, showed signs of the new paths that Beethoven was to forge in the coming years. When he showed the manuscript of the trios to Haydn, his teacher, prior to publication, Haydn approved of the first two, but warned against publishing the third trio, in C minor, as too radical, warning it would not "...be understood and favorably received by the public."&lt;ref&gt;Solomon (1977), p. 117. The quote is from [[Ferdinand Ries]]'s recollections of conversations with Beethoven.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haydn was wrong—the third trio was the most popular of the set, and Haydn's criticisms caused a falling-out between him and the sensitive Beethoven. The trio is, indeed, a departure from the mold that Haydn and Mozart had formed. Beethoven makes dramatic deviations of tempo within phrases and within movements. He greatly increases the independence of the strings, especially the cello, allowing it to range above the piano and occasionally even the violin.

If his Op. 1 trios introduced Beethoven's works to the public, his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet, Op. 20]], established him as one of Europe's most popular composers. The septet, scored for violin, viola, cello, contrabass, clarinet, horn, and bassoon, was a huge hit. It was played in concerts again and again. It appeared in transcriptions for many combinations – one of which, for clarinet, cello and piano, was written by Beethoven himself – and was so popular that Beethoven feared it would eclipse his other works. So much so that by 1815, [[Carl Czerny]] wrote that Beethoven "could not endure his septet and grew angry because of the universal applause which it has received."&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2006), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The septet is written as a classical divertimento in six movements, including two minuets, and a set of variations. It is full of catchy tunes, with solos for everyone, including the [[contrabass]].

In his 17 string quartets, composed over the course of 37 of his 56 years, Beethoven goes from classical composer par excellence to creator of musical Romanticism, and finally, with his late string quartets, he transcends classicism and romanticism to create a genre that defies categorization. Stravinsky referred to the [[Große Fuge]], of the late quartets, as, "...this absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kerman, "Beethoven Quartet Audiences: Actual Potential, Ideal", p. 21, in Winter and Martin (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[String Quartets Nos. 1–6, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|string quartets 1–6, Op. 18]], were written in the classical style, in the same year that Haydn wrote his [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)|Op. 76 string quartets]]. Even here, Beethoven stretched the formal structures pioneered by Haydn and Mozart. In the quartet Op. 18, No. 1, in F major, for example, there is a long, lyrical solo for cello in the second movement, giving the cello a new type of voice in the quartet conversation. And the last movement of Op. 18, No. 6, "La Malincolia", creates a new type of formal structure, interleaving a slow, melancholic section with a manic dance. Beethoven was to use this form in later quartets, and Brahms and others adopted it as well.

In the years 1805 to 1806, Beethoven composed the three [[String Quartets Nos. 7–9, Op. 59 – Rasumovsky (Beethoven)|Op. 59]] quartets on a commission from Count Razumovsky, who played second violin in their first performance. These quartets, from Beethoven's middle period, were pioneers in the romantic style. Besides introducing many structural and stylistic innovations, these quartets were much more difficult technically to perform – so much so that they were, and remain, beyond the reach of many amateur string players. When first violinist [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]] complained of their difficulty, Beethoven retorted, "Do you think I care about your wretched violin when the spirit moves me?"&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2006), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the difficulties are complex [[syncopation]]s and cross-rhythms; synchronized runs of sixteenth, thirty-second, and sixty-fourth notes; and sudden [[modulation]]s requiring special attention to [[intonation (music)|intonation]]. In addition to the Op. 59 quartets, Beethoven wrote two more quartets during his middle period – [[String Quartet No. 10 (Beethoven)|Op. 74]], the "Harp" quartet, named for the unusual harp-like effect Beethoven creates with pizzicato passages in the first movement, and [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|Op. 95]], the "Serioso".

|}
The Serioso is a transitional work that ushers in Beethoven's late period – a period of compositions of great introspection. "The particular kind of inwardness of Beethoven's last style period", writes Joseph Kerman, gives one the feeling that "the music is sounding only for the composer and for one other auditor, an awestruck eavesdropper: you."&lt;ref&gt;Kerman, in Winters and Martin (1994), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late quartets, the quartet conversation is often disjointed, proceeding like a stream of consciousness. Melodies are broken off, or passed in the middle of the melodic line from instrument to instrument. Beethoven uses new effects, never before essayed in the string quartet literature: the ethereal, dreamlike effect of open intervals between the high E string and the open A string in the second movement of quartet Op. 132; the use of ''sul ponticello'' (playing on the bridge of the violin) for a brittle, scratchy sound in the Presto movement of Op. 131; the use of the [[Lydian mode]], rarely heard in Western music for 200 years, in Op. 132; a cello melody played high above all the other strings in the finale of Op. 132.&lt;ref&gt;For a complete analysis of the late quartets, see Kerman (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet for all this disjointedness, each quartet is tightly designed, with an overarching structure that ties the work together.

Beethoven wrote eight piano trios, five string trios, two string quintets, and numerous pieces for wind ensemble. He also wrote ten sonatas for violin and piano and five sonatas for cello and piano.

===Franz Schubert===

As Beethoven, in his last quartets, went off in his own direction, [[Franz Schubert]] carried on and established the emerging romantic style. In his 31 years, Schubert devoted much of his life to [[List of compositions by Franz Schubert#Music for chamber ensemble|chamber music]], composing 15 string quartets, two piano trios, string trios, a piano quintet commonly known as the ''[[Trout Quintet]]'', an [[Octet (Schubert)|octet for strings and winds]], and his famous quintet for two violins, viola, and two cellos.

Schubert's music, as his life, exemplified the contrasts and contradictions of his time. On the one hand, he was the darling of Viennese society: he starred in soirées that became known as ''Schubertiaden'', where he played his light, mannered compositions that expressed the [[gemütlichkeit]] of Vienna of the 1820s. On the other hand, his own short life was shrouded in tragedy, wracked by poverty and ill health. Chamber music was the ideal medium to express this conflict, "to reconcile his essentially lyric themes with his feeling for dramatic utterance within a form that provided the possibility of extreme color contrasts."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich (1966), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[String Quintet (Schubert)|String Quintet in C, D.956]], is an example of how this conflict is expressed in music. After a slow introduction, the first theme of the first movement, fiery and dramatic, leads to a bridge of rising tension, peaking suddenly and breaking into the second theme, a lilting duet in the lower voices.&lt;ref&gt;Recording is by Caeli Smith and Ryan Shannon, violins, Nora Murphy, viola, and Nick Thompson and Rachel Grandstrand, celli&lt;/ref&gt; The alternating [[Sturm und Drang]] and relaxation continue throughout the movement.

These contending forces are expressed in some of Schubert's other works: in the quartet [[Death and the Maiden Quartet|Death and the Maiden]], the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Schubert)|Rosamunde quartet]] and in the stormy, one-movement [[Quartettsatz, D. 703 (Schubert)|Quartettsatz, D. 703]].&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of these works, as well as the quintet, see Willi Kahl, "Schubert", in Cobbett (1929), pp.&amp;nbsp;352–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Schubert, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] had a life of peace and prosperity. Born into a wealthy Jewish family in Hamburg, Mendelssohn proved himself a child prodigy. By the age of 16, he had written his first major chamber work, the [[Octet (Mendelssohn)|String Octet, Op. 20]]. Already in this work, Mendelssohn showed some of the unique style that was to characterize his later works; notably, the gossamer light texture of his scherzo movements, exemplified also by the ''Canzonetta'' movement of the [[String Quartet No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet, Op. 12]], and the scherzo of the [[Piano Trio No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor, Op. 49]].

Another characteristic that Mendelssohn pioneered is the [[Cycle (music)|cyclic]] form in overall structure. This means the reuse of thematic material from one movement to the next, to give the total piece coherence. In his [[String Quartet No. 2 (Mendelssohn)|second string quartet]], he opens the piece with a peaceful adagio section in A major, that contrasts with the stormy first movement in A minor. After the final, vigorous Presto movement, he returns to the opening adagio to conclude the piece. This string quartet is also Mendelssohn's homage to Beethoven; the work is studded with quotes from Beethoven's middle and late quartets.

[[File:JoachimAndClaraSchumann.jpg|thumb|Violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and pianist Clara Schumann. Joachim and Schumann debuted many of the chamber works of Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and others.]]
During his adult life, Mendelssohn wrote two piano trios, seven works for string quartet, two string quintets, the octet, a sextet for piano and strings, and numerous sonatas for piano with violin, cello, and clarinet.

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Schumann Op 44 Explained.OGG|title=Cyclic structure in the Schumann piano quintet}}
[[Robert Schumann]] continued the development of cyclic structure. In his [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E&amp;nbsp;flat, Op. 44]],&lt;ref&gt;Piano quintet Op. 44 by Robert Schumann, last movement, is played by Steans Artists of Musicians from Ravinia in concert at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. [http://traffic.libsyn.com/gardnermuseum/schumann_op44.mp3 Traffic.libsyn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann wrote a double fugue in the finale, using the theme of the first movement and the theme of the last movement. Both Schumann and Mendelssohn, following the example set by Beethoven, revived the fugue, which had fallen out of favor since the Baroque period. However, rather than writing strict, full-length [[fugue]]s, they used counterpoint as another mode of conversation between the chamber music instruments. Many of Schumann's chamber works, including all three of his string quartets and his piano quartet have contrapuntal sections interwoven seamlessly into the overall compositional texture.&lt;ref&gt;Fannie Davies, "Schumann" in Cobbett (1929), pp.&amp;nbsp;368–394.&lt;/ref&gt;

The composers of the first half of the 19th century were acutely aware of the conversational paradigm established by Haydn and Mozart. Schumann wrote that in a true quartet "everyone has something to say&amp;nbsp;... a conversation, often truly beautiful, often oddly and turbidly woven, among four people."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hefling, "The Austro-Germanic quartet tradition of the nineteenth century", p. 239, in Stowell (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Their awareness is exemplified by composer and virtuoso violinist [[Louis Spohr]]. Spohr divided his 36 string quartets into two types: the ''quatuor brillant'', essentially a violin concerto with string trio accompaniment; and ''quatuor dialogue'', in the conversational tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hefling, in Stowell (2003), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chamber music and society in the 19th century===
[[File:Grün - Chamber Music Concert.jpg|thumb|Home music-making in the 19th century; painting by Jules-Alexandre Grün.]]
The middle of the 19th century saw more changes in society and in musical tastes, which had their impact on chamber music composition and performance. While improvements in instruments led to more public performances of chamber music, it remained very much a type of music to be played as much as performed. Amateur quartet societies sprang up throughout Europe, and no middling-sized city in Germany or France would be without one. These societies sponsored [[house concert]]s, compiled music libraries, and encouraged the playing of quartets and other ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;Bashford, in Stowell (2003), p. 10. For a detailed discussion of quartet societies in France, see Fauquet (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of quartets were published by hundreds of composers; between 1770 and 1800, more than 2000 quartets were published,&lt;ref&gt;Bashford, in Stowell (2003), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and the pace did not decline in the next century. Throughout the 19th century, composers published string quartets now long neglected: [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]] wrote 36 quartets and 35 quintets; [[Gaetano Donizetti]] wrote dozens of quartets, [[Antonio Bazzini]], [[Anton Reicha]], [[Carl Gottlieb Reissiger|Carl Reissiger]], [[Josef Suk (composer)|Joseph Suk]] and others wrote to fill an insatiable demand for quartets. In addition, there was a lively market for string quartet arrangements of popular and [[folk tune]]s, piano works, symphonies, and [[opera aria]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bashford, in Stowell (2003), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

But opposing forces were at work. The middle of the 19th century saw the rise of superstar virtuosi, who drew attention away from chamber music toward solo performance. Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt presented "[[recital]]s" – a term coined by Liszt – that drew crowds of ecstatic fans who swooned at the sound of their playing. The piano, which could be mass-produced, became an instrument of preference, and many composers, like Chopin and Liszt, composed primarily if not exclusively for piano.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the impact of the piano on string quartet composition, see Griffiths (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NerudaQuartet.jpg|thumb|[[Wilma Neruda|Vilemina Norman Neruda]] leading a string quartet, about 1880]]
The ascendance of the piano, and of symphonic composition, was not merely a matter of preference; it was also a matter of [[ideology]]. In the 1860s, a schism grew among romantic musicians over the direction of music. Liszt and [[Richard Wagner]] led a movement that contended that "pure music" had run its course with Beethoven, and that new, [[Program music|programmatic forms of music]]–in which music created "images" with its melodies–were the future of the art. The composers of this school had no use for chamber music. Opposing this view was Johannes Brahms and his associates, especially the powerful [[music critic]] [[Eduard Hanslick]]. This [[War of the Romantics]] shook the artistic world of the period, with vituperative exchanges between the two camps, concert boycotts, and petitions.

Although amateur playing thrived throughout the 19th century, this was also a period of increasing professionalization of chamber music performance. Professional quartets began to dominate the chamber music concert stage. The [[Hellmesberger Quartet]], led by [[Joseph Hellmesberger, Sr.|Joseph Hellmesberger]], and the [[Joachim Quartet]], led by [[Joseph Joachim]], debuted many of the new string quartets by Brahms and other composers. Another famous quartet player was [[Wilma Neruda|Vilemina Norman Neruda]], also known as Lady Hallé. Indeed, during the last third of the century, [[Women in music|women performers]] began taking their place on the concert stage: an all-women string quartet led by Emily Shinner, and the Lucas quartet, also all women, were two notable examples.&lt;ref&gt;Tully Potter, "From chamber to concert hall", in Stowell (2003), p 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toward the 20th century===

[[File:JoachimQuartet.jpg|thumb|300px|The Joachim Quartet, led by violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. The quartet debuted many of the works of Johannes Brahms.]]
It was [[Johannes Brahms]] who carried the torch of Romantic music toward the 20th century. Heralded by [[Robert Schumann]] as the forger of "new paths" in music,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schumann, "Neue Bahnen" in the journal ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'', October 1853, [http://w3.rz-berlin.mpg.de/cmp/brahms_bahnen.html W3.rz-berlin.mpg.de] {{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (accessed 2007-10-30).&lt;/ref&gt; Brahms's music is a bridge from the classical to the modern. On the one hand, Brahms was a traditionalist, conserving the musical traditions of Bach and Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;Swafford (1997), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his chamber music, he uses traditional techniques of [[counterpoint]], incorporating fugues and canons into rich conversational and harmonic textures. On the other hand, Brahms expanded the structure and the harmonic vocabulary of chamber music, challenging traditional notions of [[tonality]]. An example of this is in the [[String Sextet No. 2 (Brahms)|Brahms second string sextet, Op. 36]].&lt;ref&gt;Swafford(1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;290–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, composers wrote the first theme of a piece in the key of the piece, firmly establishing that key as the tonic, or home, key of the piece. The opening theme of Op. 36 starts in the tonic (G major), but already by the third measure has modulated to the unrelated key of E-flat major. As the theme develops, it ranges through various keys before coming back to the tonic G major. This "harmonic audacity", as Swafford describes it,&lt;ref&gt;Swafford(1997), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; opened the way for bolder experiments to come.

Not only in harmony, but also in overall musical structure, Brahms was an innovator. He developed a technique that [[Arnold Schoenberg]] described as "developing variation".&lt;ref&gt;Schoenberg(1984), cited in Swafford(1997), p. 632.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than discretely defined phrases, Brahms often runs phrase into phrase, and mixes melodic motives to create a fabric of continuous melody. Schoenberg, the creator of the [[12-tone system]] of composition, traced the roots of his modernism to Brahms, in his essay "Brahms the Progressive".&lt;ref&gt;Schoenberg(1984), cited in Swafford(1997), p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt;

All told, Brahms published 24 works of chamber music, including three string quartets, five piano trios, the [[Piano Quintet (Brahms)|quintet for piano and strings, Op. 34]], and other works. Among his last works were the [[Clarinet Quintet (Brahms)|clarinet quintet, Op. 115]], and a trio for clarinet, cello and piano. He wrote a trio for the unusual combination of [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|piano, violin and horn]], Op. 40. He also wrote [[Two Songs for Voice, Viola and Piano|two songs for alto singer, viola and piano]], Op. 91, reviving the form of voice with string [[obbligato]] that had been virtually abandoned since the Baroque.

[[File:Monet Lavacourt.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Seine at Lavacourt'' by [[Claude Monet]].[[Impressionisme|Impressionist]] music and art sought similar effects of the ethereal, atmospheric.]]
The exploration of tonality and of structure begun by Brahms was continued by composers of the French school. [[César Franck]]'s piano quintet in F minor, composed in 1879, further established the cyclic form first explored by Schumann and Mendelssohn, reusing the same thematic material in each of the three movements. [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[String Quartet (Debussy)|string quartet, Op. 10]], is considered a watershed in the history of chamber music. The quartet uses the cyclic structure, and constitutes a final divorce from the rules of classical harmony. "Any sounds in any combination and in any succession are henceforth free to be used in a musical continuity", Debussy wrote.&lt;ref name="M104"&gt;Miller (2006), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Boulez]] said that Debussy freed chamber music from "rigid structure, frozen rhetoric and rigid aesthetics".&lt;ref name="M104"/&gt;

Debussy's quartet, like the string quartets of [[Maurice Ravel]] and of [[Gabriel Fauré]], created a new tone color for chamber music, a color and texture associated with the [[Impressionist music|Impressionist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Debussy himself denied that he was an impressionist. See Thomson (1940), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Violist James Dunham, of the Cleveland and Sequoia Quartets, writes of the [[String Quartet (Ravel)|Ravel quartet]], "I was simply overwhelmed by the sweep of sonority, the sensation of colors constantly changing&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2006), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; For these composers, chamber ensembles were the ideal vehicle for transmitting this atmospheric sense, and chamber works constituted much of their oeuvre.

===Nationalism in chamber music===

[[File:KneiselQuartet.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Kneisel Quartet|Kneisel String Quartet]], led by Franz Kneisel. This American ensemble debuted Dvořák's American Quartet, Op. 96.]]
Parallel with the trend to seek new modes of tonality and texture was another new development in chamber music: the rise of [[nationalism]]. Composers turned more and more to the rhythms and tonalities of their native lands for inspiration and material. "Europe was impelled by the Romantic tendency to establish in musical matters the national boundaries more and more sharply", wrote [[Alfred Einstein]]. "The collecting and sifting of old traditional melodic treasures&amp;nbsp;... formed the basis for a creative art-music."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein (1947), p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; For many of these composers, chamber music was the natural vehicle for expressing their national characters.

Czech composer [[Antonín Dvořák]] created in his chamber music a new voice for the music of his native Bohemia. In 14 string quartets, three string quintets, two piano quartets, a string sextet, four piano trios, and numerous other chamber compositions, Dvořák incorporates folk music and modes as an integral part of his compositions. For example, in the [[Piano Quintet No. 2 (Dvořák)|piano quintet in A major, Op. 81]], the slow movement is a [[Dumka (musical form)|Dumka]], a Slavic folk ballad that alternates between a slow expressive song and a fast dance. Dvořák's fame in establishing a national art music was so great that the New York philanthropist and music connoisseur [[Jeannette Thurber]] invited him to America, to head a conservatory that would establish an American style of music.&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth (1980), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; There, Dvořák wrote his [[String Quartet No. 12 (Dvořák)|string quartet in F major, Op. 96]], nicknamed "The American". While composing the work, Dvořák was entertained by a group of Kickapoo Indians who performed native dances and songs, and these songs may have been incorporated in the quartet.&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth (1980), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bedřich Smetana]], another Czech, wrote a piano trio and string quartet, both of which incorporate native Czech rhythms and melodies. In Russia, Russian folk music permeated the works of the late 19th-century composers. [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] uses a typical Russian folk dance in the final movement of his string sextet, ''[[Souvenir de Florence]]'', Op. 70. [[Alexander Borodin]]'s [[String Quartet No. 2 (Borodin)|second string quartet]] contains references to folk music, and the slow Nocturne movement of that quartet recalls Middle Eastern modes that were current in the Muslim sections of southern Russia. [[Edvard Grieg]] used the musical style of his native Norway in his [[String Quartet No. 1 (Grieg)|string quartet in G minor, Op. 27]] and his [[Violin Sonatas (Grieg)|violin sonatas]].

In Hungary, composers [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Béla Bartók]] pioneered the science of [[ethnomusicology]] by performing one of the first comprehensive studies of folk music. Ranging across the [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] provinces, they transcribed, recorded, and classified tens of thousands of folk melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Eosze, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–40.&lt;/ref&gt; They used these tunes in their compositions, which are characterized by the asymmetrical rhythms and modal harmonies of that music. Their chamber music compositions, and those of the Czech composer [[Leoš Janáček]], combined the nationalist trend with the 20th century search for new tonalities. Janáček's string quartets not only incorporate the tonalities of Czech folk music, they also reflect the rhythms of speech in the Czech language.

===New sounds for a new world===

The end of western tonality, begun subtly by Brahms and made explicit by Debussy, posed a crisis for composers of the 20th century. It was not merely an issue of finding new types of harmonies and melodic systems to replace the [[diatonic scale]] that was the basis of western harmony; the whole structure of western music – the relationships between movements and between structural elements within movements – was based on the relationships between different keys.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1978), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; So composers were challenged with building a whole new structure for music.

This was coupled with the feeling that the era that saw the invention of automobiles, the telephone, electric lighting, and world war needed new modes of expression. "The century of the aeroplane deserves its music", wrote Debussy.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1978), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inspiration from folk music====

[[File:Bartok recording folk music.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Béla Bartók]] recording folksongs of Czech peasants, 1908]]
The search for a new music took several directions. The first, led by Bartók, was toward the tonal and rhythmic constructs of folk music. Bartók's research into Hungarian and other eastern European and Middle Eastern folk music revealed to him a musical world built of musical scales that were neither major nor minor, and complex rhythms that were alien to the concert hall. In his fifth quartet, for example, Bartók uses a time signature of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3+2+2+3}{8}&lt;/math&gt;, "startling to the classically-trained musician, but second-nature to the folk musician."&lt;ref&gt;Baron (1998), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Structurally, also, Bartók often invents or borrows from folk modes. In the sixth string quartet, for example, Bartók begins each movement with a slow, elegiac melody, followed by the main melodic material of the movement, and concludes the quartet with a slow movement that is built entirely on this [[elegy]]. This is a form common in many folk music cultures.

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Bartok Op. 17, Second Movement.OGG|title=Bartók string quartet number 2, second movement|description=Played by the [http://www.carmelquartet.com Carmel Quartet].}}
Bartók's six string quartets are often compared with Beethoven's late quartets.&lt;ref&gt;Baron (1998), p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; In them, Bartók builds new musical structures, explores sonorities never previously produced in classical music (for example, the snap pizzicato, where the player lifts the string and lets it snap back on the fingerboard with an audible buzz), and creates modes of expression that set these works apart from all others. "Bartók's last two quartets proclaim the sanctity of life, progress and the victory of humanity despite the anti-humanistic dangers of the time", writes analyst John Herschel Baron.&lt;ref name="Baron 1998, p. 383"&gt;Baron (1998), p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The last quartet, written when Bartók was preparing to flee the [[Nazi]] invasion of Hungary for a new and uncertain life in the U.S., is often seen as an autobiographical statement of the tragedy of his times.

Bartók was not alone in his explorations of folk music. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Three Pieces for String Quartet (Stravinsky)|Three Pieces for String Quartet]]'' is structured as three Russian folksongs, rather than as a classical string quartet. Stravinsky, like Bartók, used asymmetrical rhythms throughout his chamber music; the [[Histoire du soldat]], in Stravinsky's own arrangement for clarinet, violin and piano, constantly shifts time signatures between two, three, four and five beats to the bar. In Britain, composers [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[William Walton]] and [[Benjamin Britten]] drew on English folk music for much of their chamber music: Vaughan Williams incorporates folksongs and country fiddling in his first string quartet. American composer [[Charles Ives]] wrote music that was distinctly American. Ives gave programmatic titles to much of his chamber music; his first string quartet, for example, is called "From the Salvation Army", and quotes American Protestant hymns in several places.

====Serialism, polytonality and polyrhythms====

[[File:Jean-Antoine Watteau - Pierrot, dit autrefois Gilles.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Pierrot, the object of Schoenberg's atonal suite ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'', painted by [[Antoine Watteau]]]]
A second direction in the search for a new tonality was twelve-tone [[serialism]]. [[Arnold Schoenberg]] developed the [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone method of composition]] as an alternative to the structure provided by the diatonic system. His method entails building a piece using a series of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, permuting it and superimposing it on itself to create the composition.

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Schoenberg Quartet No. 2 4th movement.OGG|title=Arnold Schoenberg: Second string quartet, fourth movement|description=Played by the [http://www.carmelquartet.com Carmel Quartet] with soprano Rona Israel-Kolatt. This is the first explicitly atonal piece.}}
Schoenberg did not arrive immediately at the serial method. His first chamber work, the string sextet [[Verklärte Nacht]], was mostly a late German romantic work, though it was bold in its use of modulations. The first work that was frankly [[atonality|atonal]] was the [[String quartets (Schoenberg)#String Quartet No. 2|second string quartet]]; the last movement of this quartet, which includes a soprano, has no key signature. Schoenberg further explored atonality with ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'', for singer, flute or piccolo, clarinet, violin, cello and piano. The singer uses a technique called [[Sprechgesang|Sprechstimme]], halfway between speech and song.

After developing the twelve-tone technique, Schoenberg wrote a number of chamber works, including two more string quartets, a string trio, and a wind quintet. He was followed by a number of other twelve-tone composers, the most prominent of whom were his students [[Alban Berg]], who wrote the ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'' for string quartet, and [[Anton Webern]], who wrote ''Five Movements for String Quartet'', op. 5.

Twelve-tone technique was not the only new experiment in tonality. [[Darius Milhaud]] developed the use of [[polytonality]], that is, music where different instruments play in different keys at the same time. Milhaud wrote 18 string quartets; quartets number 14 and 15 are written so that each can be played by itself, or the two can be played at the same time as an octet. Milhaud also used [[jazz]] idioms, as in his ''Suite'' for clarinet, violin and piano.

The American composer [[Charles Ives]] used not only [[polytonality]] in his chamber works, but also [[polymeter]]. In his [[String Quartet No. 1 (Ives)|first string quartet]] he writes a section where the first violin and viola play in &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt; time while the second violin and cello play in &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{4}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Neoclassicism====

The plethora of directions that music took in the first quarter of the 20th century led to a reaction by many composers. Led by [[Stravinsky]], these composers looked to the music of preclassical Europe for inspiration and stability. While Stravinsky's neoclassical works – such as the ''Double Canon for String Quartet'' – sound contemporary, they are modeled on Baroque and early classical forms – the canon, the fugue, and the Baroque sonata form.

[[Paul Hindemith]] was another neoclassicist. His many chamber works are essentially tonal, though they use many dissonant harmonies. Hindemith wrote seven string quartets and two string trios, among other chamber works. At a time when composers were writing works of increasing complexity, beyond the reach of amateur musicians, Hindemith explicitly recognized the importance of amateur music-making, and intentionally wrote pieces that were within the abilities of nonprofessional players.&lt;ref&gt;Baron (1998), p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dmitri Shostakovich]] was one of the most prolific of chamber music composers of the 20th century, writing 15 string quartets, two piano trios, the piano quintet, and numerous other chamber works. Shostakovich's music was for a long time banned in the Soviet Union and Shostakovich himself was in personal danger of deportation to Siberia. His [[String Quartet No. 8 (Shostakovich)|eighth quartet]] is an autobiographical work, that expresses his deep depression from his ostracization, bordering on suicide:&lt;ref&gt;Baron (1998), p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; it quotes from previous compositions, and uses the four-note motif [[DSCH motif|DSCH]], the composer's initials.

===Stretching the limits===

As the century progressed, many composers created works for small ensembles that, while they formally might be considered chamber music, challenged many of the fundamental characteristics that had defined the genre over the last 150 years.

====Music of friends====
The idea of composing music that could be played at home has been largely abandoned. Bartók was among the first to part with this idea. "Bartók never conceived these quartets for private performance but rather for large, public concerts."&lt;ref name="Baron 1998, p. 383"/&gt; Aside from the many almost insurmountable technical difficulties of many modern pieces, some of them are hardly suitable for performance in a small room. For example, ''[[Different Trains]]'' by [[Steve Reich]] is scored for live string quartet and recorded tape, which layers together a carefully orchestrated sound collage of speech, recorded train sounds, and three string quartets.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Reich, ''Composer's Notes'', at [http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/catalogue/cat_detail.asp?musicid=2699].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conversational paradigm====
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Since the invention of [[Telecommunication|electrical telecommunication devices]] in the 19th century, players of a string quartet can even conduct a conversation when they are flying over the audience in four separate helicopters, as in the ''[[Helikopter-Streichquartett|Helicopter String Quartet]]'' by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. When the piece was performed in 1995, the players had earphones with a [[click track]] to enable them to play at the right time.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine Arditti, "Flight of Fantasy", ''The Strad'' (March 2008):52–53, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Theremin trio (retouched).jpg|thumb|[[Léon Theremin]] performing a trio for voice, piano and theremin, 1924]]

====Relation of composer and performer====
Traditionally, the composer wrote the notes, and the performer interpreted them. But this is no longer the case in much modern music. In ''[[Für kommende Zeiten]]'' (For Times to Come), [[Stockhausen]] writes verbal instructions describing what the performers are to play. "Star constellations/with common points/and falling stars&amp;nbsp;... Abrupt end" is a sample.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], ''Awake'', no. 16 (July 7, 1970) from ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]/[[Für kommende Zeiten]]/For Times to Come/Pour les temps a venir: 17 Texte für Intuitive Musik'', Werk Nr. 33 (Kürten: Stockhausen-Verlag, 1976), 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composer [[Terry Riley]] describes how he works with the [[Kronos Quartet]], an ensemble devoted to contemporary music: "When I write a score for them, it's an unedited score. I put in just a minimal amount of dynamics and phrasing marks&amp;nbsp;...we spend a lot of time trying out different ideas in order to shape the music, to form it. At the end of the process, it makes the performers actually ''own'' the music. That to me is the best way for composers and musicians to interact."&lt;ref&gt;K. Robert Schwarz, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/06/arts/music-a-new-look-at-a-major-minimalist.html?pagewanted=all A New Look at a Major Minimalist]", in ''The New York Times'' (Sunday, May 6, 1990), Section H, p.24. Retrieved 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New sounds====
Composers seek new timbres, remote from the traditional blend of strings, piano and woodwinds that characterized chamber music in the 19th century. This search led to the incorporation of new instruments in the 20th century, such as the [[theremin]] and the [[synthesizer]] in chamber music compositions.

Many composers sought new timbres within the framework of traditional instruments. "Composers begin to hear new timbres and new timbral combinations, which are as important to the new music of the twentieth century as the so-called breakdown of functional tonality," writes music historian James McCalla.&lt;ref&gt;McCalla (2003), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are numerous: Bartók's [[Sonata for two pianos and percussion]] (1937), Schoenberg's ''Pierrot lunaire'', Charles Ives's ''Quartertone Pieces'' for two pianos tuned a quartertone apart. Other composers used electronics and extended techniques to create new sonorities. An example is [[George Crumb]]'s ''[[Black Angels (Crumb)|Black Angels]]'', for electric string quartet (1970). The players not only bow their amplified instruments, they also beat on them with thimbles, pluck them with paper clips and play on the wrong side of the bridge or between the fingers and the nut.&lt;ref&gt;Crumb (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Bartók - Sonata for two pianos and percussion - Assai lento - Allegro molto (clip).ogg|title=Excerpt from Bartók's Sonata for two pianos and percussion}}

What do these changes mean for the future of chamber music? "With the technological advances have come questions of aesthetics and sociological changes in music", writes analyst Baron.&lt;ref&gt;Baron (1998), p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; "These changes have often resulted in accusations that technology has destroyed chamber music and that technological advance is in inverse proportion to musical worth. The ferocity of these attacks only underscores how fundamental these changes are, and only time will tell if humankind will benefit from them."

===In contemporary society===

Analysts agree that the role of chamber music in society has changed profoundly in the last 50 years; yet there is little agreement as to what that change is. On the one hand, Baron contends that "chamber music in the home&amp;nbsp;... remained very important in Europe and America until the Second World War, after which the increasing invasion of radio and recording reduced its scope considerably."&lt;ref&gt;Baron (1998), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by subjective impressions. "Today there are so many more millions of people listening to music, but far fewer playing chamber music just for the pleasure of it", says conductor and pianist [[Daniel Barenboim]].&lt;ref&gt;Booth (1999), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amateur music making.jpg|thumb|Amateurs play a string sextet]]
However, recent surveys suggest there is, on the contrary, a resurgence of home music making. In the radio program "Amateurs Help Keep Chamber Music Alive" from 2005, reporter Theresa Schiavone cites a Gallup poll showing an increase in the sale of stringed instruments in America. Joe Lamond, president of the National Association of Music Manufacturers (NAMM) attributes the increase to a growth of home music-making by adults approaching retirement. "I would really look to the demographics of the [baby] boomers", he said in an interview. These people "are starting to look for something that matters to them&amp;nbsp;... nothing makes them feel good more than playing music."&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Schiavone, "Amateurs Help Keep Chamber Music Alive", broadcast August 27, 2005, ''NPR All Things considered'', [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4819111 NPR]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the European Music Office in 1996 suggests that not only older people are playing music. "The number of adolescents today to have done music has almost doubled by comparison with those born before 1960", the study shows.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Hennion, "Music industry and music lovers, beyond Benjamin: The return of the amateur", in ''Soundscapes'' (volume 2, July 1999) available online at [http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/MIE/Part2_chapter06.shtml Soundscapes.info].&lt;/ref&gt; While most of this growth is in popular music, some is in chamber music and art music, according to the study.

While there is no agreement about the number of chamber music players, the opportunities for amateurs to play have certainly grown. The number of chamber music camps and retreats, where amateurs can meet for a weekend or a month to play together, has burgeoned. ''Music for the Love of It'', an organization to promote amateur playing, publishes a directory of music workshops that lists more than 500 workshops in 24 countries for amateurs in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfortheloveofit.com|title=Music For The Love of It|website=musicfortheloveofit.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Chamber Music Players (ACMP) offers a directory of over 5,000 amateur players worldwide who welcome partners for chamber music sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://acmp.net/|title=ACMP {{!}} The Chamber Music Network|website=acmp.net|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of whether the number of amateur players has grown or shrunk, the number of chamber music concerts in the west has increased greatly in the last 20 years. Concert halls have largely replaced the home as the venue for concerts. Baron suggests that one of the reasons for this surge is "the spiraling costs of orchestral concerts and the astronomical fees demanded by famous soloists, which have priced both out of the range of most audiences."&lt;ref&gt;Baron (1999), p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; The repertoire at these concerts is almost universally the classics of the 19th century. However, modern works are increasingly included in programs, and some groups, like the [[Kronos Quartet]], devote themselves almost exclusively to contemporary music and new compositions; and ensembles like the [[Turtle Island String Quartet]], that combine classical, jazz, rock and other styles to create [[Crossover (music)|crossover music]]. [[Cello Fury]] and [[Project Trio]] offer a new spin to the standard chamber ensemble. Cello Fury consists of three cellists and a drummer and Project Trio includes a flutist, bassist, and cellist.

==Performance==

Chamber music performance is a specialized field, and requires a number of skills not normally required for the performance of symphonic or solo music. Many performers and authors have written about the specialized techniques required for a successful chamber musician. Chamber music playing, writes M.D. Herter Norton, requires that "individuals&amp;nbsp;... make a unified whole yet remain individuals. The soloist is a whole unto himself, and in the orchestra individuality is lost in numbers&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Norton (1925), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Music of friends"===

[[File:From the Short-tempered Clavichord.jpg|thumb|Chamber musicians at each other, from "The Short-tempered Clavichord" by illustrator [http://bonotto.robert.googlepages.com/ Robert Bonotto] ]]
Many performers contend that the intimate nature of chamber music playing requires certain personality traits.

David Waterman, cellist of the Endellion Quartet, writes that the chamber musician "needs to balance assertiveness and flexibility."&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, in Stowell (2003), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Good rapport is essential. Arnold Steinhardt, first violinist of the Guarneri Quartet, notes that many professional quartets suffer from frequent turnover of players. "Many musicians cannot take the strain of going ''mano a mano'' with the same three people year after year."&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt (1998), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Norton, a violinist who studied quartet playing with the Kneisel Quartet at the beginning of the last century, goes so far that players of different parts in a quartet have different personality traits. "By tradition the first violin is the leader" but "this does not mean a relentless predominance." The second violinist "is a little everybody's servant." "The artistic contribution of each member will be measured by his skill in asserting or subduing that individuality which he must possess to be at all interesting."&lt;ref&gt;Norton (1925), pp.&amp;nbsp;25–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

"For an individual, the problems of interpretation are challenging enough", writes Waterman, "but for a quartet grappling with some of the most profound, intimate and heartfelt compositions in the music literature, the communal nature of decision-making is often more testing than the decisions themselves."&lt;ref&gt;David Waterman, "Playing quartets: the view from inside", in Stowell (2003), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of finding agreement on musical issues is complicated by the fact that each player is playing a different part, that may appear to demand dynamics or gestures contrary to those of other parts in the same passage. Sometimes these differences are even specified in the score – for example, where cross-dynamics are indicated, with one instrument crescendoing while another is getting softer.

One of the issues that must be settled in rehearsal is who leads the ensemble at each point of the piece. Normally, the first violin leads the ensemble. By leading, this means that the violinist indicates the start of each movement and their tempos by a [[Conducting|gesture with her head or bowing hand]]. However, there are passages that require other instruments to lead. For example, John Dalley, second violinist of the Guarneri Quartet, says, "We'll often ask [the cellist] to lead in [[pizzicato]] passages. A cellist's preparatory motion for pizzicato is larger and slower than that of a violinist."&lt;ref&gt;Blum (1986), p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Players discuss issues of interpretation in rehearsal; but often, in mid-performance, players do things spontaneously, requiring the other players to respond in real time. "After twenty years in the [Guarneri] Quartet, I'm happily surprised on occasion to find myself totally wrong about what I think a player will do, or how he'll react in a particular passage", says violist Michael Tree.&lt;ref&gt;Blum (1986), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ensemble, blend, and balance===

[[File:Bartok 6th String Quartet.jpg|thumb|300px|Graphic interpretation of Burletta movement of Bartók's 6th String Quartet, by artist Joel Epstein]]
Playing together constitutes a major challenge to chamber music players. Many compositions pose difficulties in coordination, with figures such as [[hemiola]]s, [[syncopation]], fast unison passages and simultaneously sounded notes that form chords that are challenging to play in tune. But beyond the challenge of merely playing together from a rhythmic or intonation perspective is the greater challenge of sounding good together.

To create a unified chamber music sound – to blend – the players must coordinate the details of their technique. They must decide when to use vibrato and how much. They often need to coordinate their bowing and "breathing" between phrases, to ensure a unified sound. They need to agree on special techniques, such as [[spiccato]], [[sul tasto]], [[sul ponticello]], and so on.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of problems of blending in a string quartet, see Norton (1925), chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Balance refers to the relative volume of each of the instruments. Because chamber music is a conversation, sometimes one instrument must stand out, sometimes another. It is not always a simple matter for members of an ensemble to determine the proper balance while playing; frequently, they require an outside listener, or a recording of their rehearsal, to tell them that the relations between the instruments are correct.

===Intonation===

Chamber music playing presents special problems of [[intonation (music)|intonation]]. The piano is tuned using [[equal temperament]], that is, the 12 notes of the scale are spaced exactly equally. This method makes it possible for the piano to play in any key; however, all the intervals except the octave sound very slightly out of tune. String players can play with [[just intonation]], that is, they can play specific intervals (such as fifths) exactly in tune. Moreover, string and wind players can use ''expressive intonation'', changing the pitch of a note to create a musical or dramatic effect. "String intonation is more expressive and sensitive than equal-tempered piano intonation."&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, in Stowell (2003), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, using true and expressive intonation requires careful coordination with the other players, especially when a piece is going through harmonic modulations. "The difficulty in string quartet intonation is to determine the degree of freedom you have at any given moment", says Steinhardt.&lt;ref&gt;Blum (1986), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The chamber music experience==

Players of chamber music, both amateur and professional, attest to a unique enchantment with playing in ensemble. "It is not an exaggeration to say that there opened out before me an enchanted world", writes [[Walter Willson Cobbett]], devoted amateur musician and editor of ''Cobbett's Cyclopedic Survey of Chamber Music''.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbett, "Chamber Music Life", in Cobbett (1929), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensembles develop a close intimacy of shared musical experience. "It is on the concert stage where the moments of true intimacy occur", writes Steinhardt. "When a performance is in progress, all four of us together enter a zone of magic somewhere between our music stands and become a conduit, messenger, and missionary&amp;nbsp;... It is an experience too personal to talk about and yet it colors every aspect of our relationship, every good-natured musical confrontation, all the professional gossip, the latest viola joke."&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt (1998), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The playing of chamber music has been the inspiration for numerous books, both fiction and nonfiction. ''An Equal Music'' by Vikram Seth, explores the life and love of the second violinist of a fictional quartet, the Maggiore. Central to the story is the tensions and the intimacy developed between the four members of the quartet. "A strange composite being we are [in performance], not ourselves any more, but the Maggiore, composed of so many disjunct parts: chairs, stands, music, bows, instruments, musicians&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Seth (1999), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rosendorf Quartet'', by [[Nathan Shaham]],&lt;ref&gt;Shaham (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; describes the trials of a string quartet in Palestine, before the establishment of the state of Israel. ''For the Love of It'' by Wayne Booth&lt;ref&gt;Booth (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; is a nonfictional account of the author's romance with cello playing and chamber music.

{{Historical Christian theology}}
'''Revivalism''' is increased [[spirtuality|spiritual]] interest or [[Renewal (religion)|renewal]] in the life of a [[local church|church]] congregation or society, with a local, national or global effect. This should be distinguished from the use of the term "revival" to refer to an [[evangelistic]] meeting or series of meetings (see [[Revival meeting]]).

Revivals are seen as the restoration of the church itself to a vital and fervent relationship with God after a period of moral decline. Mass [[Religious conversion|conversion]]s of non-believers are viewed by church leaders as having positive moral effects.

Within Christian studies the concept of revival is derived from biblical narratives of national decline and restoration during the history of the Israelites. In particular, narrative accounts of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emphasise periods of national decline and revival associated with the rule of various righteous and wicked kings. [[Josiah]] is notable within this biblical narrative as a figure who reinstituted temple worship of [[Yahweh]] while destroying pagan worship. Within modern Church history, church historians have identified and debated the effects of various national revivals within the history of the USA and other countries. During the 18th and 19th centuries American society experienced a number of "[[Great Awakenings|Awakenings]]" around the years 1727, 1792, 1830, 1857 and 1882. More recent revivals in the 20th century include those of the [[1904–1905 Welsh Revival]], 1906 ([[Azusa Street Revival]]), 1930s ([[Balokole]]), 1970s ([[Jesus people]]), 1971 Bario Revival and 1909 Chile Revival which spread in the Americas, Africa, and Asia among Protestants and Catholics.

==National revival within Jewish history==

The Bible narrative records a number of revivals within the history of the Israelites. In particular, following the development of temple worship based in Jerusalem the Bible records periods of national decline and revival associated with the rule of righteous and wicked kings. Within this historical narrative the reign of [[Josiah]] epitomises the effect of revival on Israelite society in reinstituting temple worship of [[Yahweh]] and the rejection of pagan worship and idolatry. Other Jewish narratives such as the accounts of the [[Maccabean revolt]] in like manner record national revival characterised by the rejection of pagan worship practices and the military defeat and expulsion of idolatrous foreign powers.

==Revivals within modern Church history==
{{Empty section|date=September 2014}}

==17th century==
Many Christian revivals drew inspiration from the [[missionary]] work of early monks, from the [[Protestant Reformation]] (and [[Catholic Reformation]]) and from the uncompromising stance of the [[Covenanter]]s in 17th-century Scotland and Ulster, that came to Virginia and Pennsylvania with Presbyterians and other non-conformists. Its character formed part of the mental framework that led to the American War of Independence and the Civil War.{{Citation needed | date = September 2014}}

==18th century==
The 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] had two camps: those who identified humans as only intellectual beings, [[Rationalists]], and those who believed humans to be only passionate beings, followers of [[Romanticism]]. The philosophy of [[Earl of Shaftesbury III]] led to a Proto-Romanticism that mixed with Christian worship to produce a tertium quid. The [[Methodist]] revival of [[John Wesley]], [[Charles Wesley]] and [[George Whitefield]] in England and [[Daniel Rowland (preacher)|Daniel Rowland]], [[Howel Harris]] and [[William Williams Pantycelyn|William Williams]], Pantycelyn in Wales and the [[Great Awakening]] in America prior to the Revolution. A similar (but smaller scale) revival in Scotland took place at [[Cambuslang]], then a village and is known as the [[Cambuslang Work]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Fawcett, ''The Cambuslang Revival: the Scottish Evangelical Revival of the eighteenth century'' (Banner of Truth Trust, London, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;


===American colonies===

In the American colonies the [[First Great Awakening]] was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants that swept the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American religion. It resulted from powerful preaching that deeply affected listeners (already church members) with a deep sense of personal guilt and salvation by Christ.  Pulling away from ancient ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made religion intensely emotive to the average person by creating a deep sense of spiritual guilt and redemption. Historian [[Sydney E. Ahlstrom]] sees it as part of a "great international Protestant upheaval" that also created [[Pietism]] in Germany, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]] and [[Methodism]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Armstrong, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (1972), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; It brought [[Slavery in the United States#Christianity and slavery|Christianity to the slaves]] and was an apocalyptic event in [[New England]] that challenged established authority. It incited rancor and division between the traditionalists who argued for ritual and doctrine and the revivalists who ignored or sometimes avidly contradicted doctrine, e.g. George Whitfield's being denied a pulpit in Anglican Churches after denying Anglican Doctrine. Its democratic features had a major impact in shaping the [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]], and German Reformed denominations, and strengthened the small [[Baptist]] and [[Methodism|Methodist]] denominations. It had little impact on [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]]. Unlike the [[Second Great Awakening]] that began about 1800 and which reached out to the [[unchurched]], the [[First Great Awakening]] focused on people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness.

==19th century==

===Transylvania===
The Hungarian Baptist church sprung out of revival with the perceived liberalism of the Hungarian reformed church during the late 1800s. Many thousands of people were baptized in a revival that was led primarily by uneducated laymen, the so-called "peasant prophets".&lt;ref&gt;Gergely, István, "Revival among Hungarian Baptists in Transylvania in the period of the 'peasant prophets'", ''Baptistic Theologies'' 1 no. 1, Spring 2009, pp. 54–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
{{See|Evangelical revival in Scotland}}
During the 18th century, England saw a series of Methodist revivalist campaigns that stressed the tenets of faith set forth by John Wesley and that were conducted in accordance with a careful strategy. In addition to stressing the evangelist combination of "Bible, cross, conversion, and activism," the revivalist movement of the 19th century made efforts toward a universal appeal – rich and poor, urban and rural, and men and women. Special efforts were made to attract children and to generate literature to spread the revivalist message.

Gobbett (1997) discusses the usefulness of historian [[Elie Halévy]]'s thesis explaining why England did not undergo a social revolution in the period 1790–1832, a time that appeared ripe for violent social upheaval. Halévy suggested that a politically conservative Methodism forestalled revolution among the largely uneducated working class by redirecting its energies toward spiritual rather than temporal affairs. The thesis has engendered strong debate among historians, and several have adopted and modified Halévy's thesis. Some historians, such as Robert Wearmouth, suggest that evangelical revivalism directed working-class attention toward moral regeneration, not social radicalism. Others, including [[E. P. Thompson]], claim that Methodism, though a small movement, had a politically regressive effect on efforts for reform. Some historians question the Halévy thesis. [[Eric Hobsbawm]] claims that Methodism was not a large enough movement to have been able to prevent revolution. Alan Gilbert suggests that Methodism's supposed antiradicalism has been misunderstood by historians, suggesting that it was seen as a socially deviant movement and the majority of Methodists were moderate radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Gobbett, "Inevitable Revolution and Methodism in Early Industrial England: Revisiting the Historiography of the Halevy Thesis," ''[[Fides et Historia]]'', Winter 1997, Vol. 29, Issue 1, pp. 28–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 19th century the Scottish minister [[Thomas Chalmers]] had an important influence on the evangelical revival movement. Chalmers began life as a moderate in the [[Church of Scotland]] and an opponent of evangelicalism. During the winter of 1803–04, he presented a series of lectures that outlined a reconciliation of the apparent incompatibility between the Genesis account of creation and the findings of the developing science of geology. However, by 1810 he had become an evangelical and would eventually lead the [[Disruption of 1843]] that resulted in the formation of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

The [[Plymouth Brethren]] started with [[John Nelson Darby]] at this time, a result of disillusionment with denominationalism and clerical hierarchy.

The established churches too, were influenced by the evangelical revival. In 1833 a group of Anglican clergymen led by [[John Henry Newman]] and [[John Keble]] began the [[Oxford Movement]]. However its objective was to renew the Church of England by reviving certain Roman Catholic doctrines and rituals, thus distancing themselves as far as possible from evangelical enthusiasm.

===Australia===
Many say that Australia has never been visited by a genuine religious revival as in other countries, but that is not entirely true. The effect of the Great Awakening of 1858-59 was also felt in Australia fostered mainly by the Methodist Church, one of the greatest forces for evangelism and missions the world has ever seen. Records show that the Methodist Church grew by a staggering 72% between 1857 and 1864, while the Baptists, Anglicans, Presbyterians and other evangelicals also benefited.
Evangelical fervor was its height during the 1920s with visiting evangelists, R. A. Torrey, Wilbur J. Chapman, Charles M. Alexander and others winning many converts in their Crusades. The Crusades of American evangelist Billy Graham in the 1950s had significant impact on Australian Churches.&lt;ref&gt;J Edwin Orr, ''Evangelical Awakenings in the South Seas'', 1976; Babbage/Siggins, ''Light Beneath the Cross'', 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Piggin (1988) explores the development and tenacity of the evangelical movement in Australia, and its impact on Australian society. Evangelicalism arrived from Britain as an already mature movement characterized by commonly shared attitudes toward doctrine, spiritual life, and sacred history. Any attempt to periodize the history of the movement in Australia should examine the role of revivalism and the oscillations between emphases on personal holiness and social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Piggin, "Toward A Bicentennial History of Australian Evangelicalism," ''Journal of Religious History,'' February 1988, Vol. 15, Issue 1, pp. 20–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavia===
Historians have examined the revival movements in Scandinavia, with special attention to the growth of organizations, church history, missionary history, social class and religion, women in religious movements, religious geography, the lay movements as counter culture, ethnology, and social force. Some historians approach it as a cult process since the revivalist movements tend to rise and fall. Others study it as minority discontent with the status quo or, after the revivalists gain wide acceptance, as a majority that tends to impose its own standards.&lt;ref&gt;Bjorn Slettan, "Religious Movements in Norway. Attitudes and Trends in Recent Research," ''Scandinavian Journal of History,'' December 1986, Vol. 11, Issue 4, pp. 345–361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anders Gustavsson, "New Trends in Recent Swedish Research into Revivalism," ''Scandinavian Journal of History,'' December 1986, Vol. 11, Issue 4, pp. 301–307.&lt;/ref&gt; The Grundtvigian and Home Mission revival movements arose in Denmark after 1860 and reshaped religion in that country, and among immigrants to America.&lt;ref&gt;Vagn Wåhlin, "Popular Revivalism in Denmark: Recent Research Trends and Results," ''Scandinavian Journal of History'', December 1986, Vol. 11, Issue 4, pp. 363–387.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States 1800–1850===
In the U.S. the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1800–30s) was the second great religious revival in United States history and consisted of renewed personal salvation experienced in revival meetings. Major leaders included [[Asahel Nettleton]], [[James Brainerd Taylor]], [[Charles Grandison Finney]], [[Lyman Beecher]], [[Barton Stone]], [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Peter Cartwright]] and [[James B. Finley]].

Rev. [[Charles Finney]] (1792–1875) was a key leader of the evangelical revival movement in America. From 1821 onwards he conducted revival meetings across many north-eastern states and won many converts. For him, a revival was not a miracle but a change of mindset that was ultimately a matter for the individual's free will. His revival meetings created anxiety in a penitent's mind that one could only save his or her soul by submission to the will of God, as illustrated by Finney's quotations from the Bible. Finney also conducted revival meetings in England, first in 1849 and later to England and Scotland in 1858–59.

In [[New England]], the renewed interest in religion inspired a wave of social activism, including [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. It had been here, in [[upstate New York]]'s '[[Burned-over district]],' in the 1810s and 20s, that the religious fervor acquired a fevered pitch, and this intense [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|revivalism]] spawned an authentically new American sect — which ultimately would become a [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|major worldwide religion]] — [[Mormonism]], founded by a young seeker of [[Christian primitivism]], [[Joseph Smith, Jr]] (1805-1844).

In the West (now Upper South) especially—at [[Cane Ridge, Kentucky]] and in [[Tennessee]]—the revival strengthened the [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Baptists]].  The [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] arose from the [[Restoration Movement|Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement]]. It also introduced into America a new form of religious expression—the Scottish [[camp meeting]].

=== Europe: Le Réveil ===
{{main article |Réveil}}
A movement in Swiss, eastern French, German, and Dutch Protestant history known as ''le [[Réveil]]'' (German: ''die Erweckung'', Dutch: ''Het Reveil'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jean Henri Merle | last = d'Aubigne | title = For God and His People: Ulrich Zwingli and the Swiss Reformation | place = [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville, SC]] | publisher = BJU Press | year = 2000 | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Sidwell}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Réveil'' was a revival of Protestant Christianity along conservative evangelical lines at a time when rationalism had taken a strong hold in the churches on the continent of Europe.

In German-speaking Europe Lutheran [[Johann Georg Hamann]] (1730–[[1788|88]]) was a leading light in the new wave of evangelicalism, the ''[[Lutheranism#Revivals|Erweckung]]'', which spread across the land, cross-fertilizing with British movements

The movement began in the Francophone world in connection with a circle of pastors and seminarians at French-speaking Protestant theological seminaries in [[Geneva]], Switzerland and [[Montauban]], France, influenced ''inter alia'' by the visit of Scottish Christian [[Robert Haldane]] in 1816–[[1817|17]]. The circle included such figures as [[Merle D'Aubigne]], [[César Malan]], [[Felix Neff]], and the [[Monod]] brothers.

As these men travelled out, the movement spread to Lyon and Paris in France, to Berlin and Eberfeld in Germany and to the Netherlands.  Several missionary societies were founded to support this work, such as the British-based [[Continental society]] and the indigenous [[Geneva Evangelical Society]].

As well as supporting existing Protestant denominations, in France and Germany the movement led to the creation of Free Evangelical Church groupings: the [[Union des Églises évangéliques libres]] and [[Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland]].

In the Netherlands the movement was taken forward by [[Willem Bilderdijk]], with [[Isaäc da Costa]], [[Abraham Capadose]], [[Samuel Iperusz Wiselius]], [[Willem de Clercq]] and [[Groen van Prinsterer]] as his pupils. The movement was politically influential and actively involved in improving society, and — at the end of the 19th century — brought about anti-revolutionary and Christian historical parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodenakkers.nl/beroemd/politiek/119-groen.html |title=Groen van Prinsterer, Guillaume (Willem) |publisher=Dodenakkers.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time in Britain figures such as [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Thomas Chalmers]] were active, although they are not considered to be part of the ''Le Reveil'' movement.

===1850–1900===
In North America the [[Third Great Awakening]] began from 1857 onwards in Canada and spread throughout the world including America and Australia. Significant names include [[Dwight L. Moody]], [[Ira D. Sankey]], [[William Booth]] and [[Catherine Booth]] (founders of the [[Salvation Army]]), [[Charles Spurgeon]] and [[James Caughey]].  [[Hudson Taylor]] began the [[China Inland Mission]] and [[Thomas John Barnardo]] founded his famous orphanages.

Representative was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent by the Wesleyan Methodist Church to Canada from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851-53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a clear call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. It was a time when the Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest of men and women in Christian perfection. Caughey successfully bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bush, "The Reverend James Caughey and Wesleyan Methodist Revivalism in Canada West, 1851–1856," ''Ontario History,'' September 1987, Vol. 79, Issue 3, pp. 231–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England the [[Keswick Convention]] movement began out of the [[Higher Life movement|British Holiness movement]], encouraging a lifestyle of [[Sacred|holiness]], unity and prayer.

====1857–1860 revival in America====
On 21 September 1857 Jeremiah Lanphier, a businessman, began a series of prayer meetings in New York. By the beginning of 1858 the congregation was crowded, often with a majority of businessmen. Newspapers reported that over 6,000 were attending various prayer meetings in New York, and 6,000 in Pittsburgh. Daily prayer meetings were held in Washington, D.C. at 5 different times to accommodate the crowds. Other cities followed the pattern. Soon, a common mid-day sign on business premises read, "We will re-open at the close of the prayer meeting". By May, 50,000 of New York's 800,000 people were new converts.

Finney wrote of this revival, "This winter of 1857–58 will be remembered as the time when a great revival prevailed. It swept across the land with such power that at the time it was estimated that not less than 50,000 conversions occurred weekly."&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of Rev. Charles G. Finney'' by Charles Finney, The Trustees of Oberlin College, 1876 (p. 446).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- online in Google Books --&gt;

===Britain and Ireland===
{{main|1859 Ulster revival}}
In 1857, four young Irishmen began a weekly prayer meeting in the village of [[Connor, County Antrim|Connor]] near [[Ballymena]]. See also [[Ahoghill]]. This meeting is generally regarded as the origin of the 1859 Ulster Revival that swept through most of the towns and villages throughout  [[Ulster]] and in due course brought 100,000 converts into the churches. It was also ignited by a young preacher, [[Henry Grattan Guinness]], who drew thousands at a time to hear his preaching. So great was the interest in the American movement that in 1858 the Presbyterian General Assembly meeting in [[Derry]] appointed two of their ministers, Dr. [[William Gibson (minister)|William Gibson]] and Rev. William McClure to visit North America. Upon their return the two deputies had many public opportunities to bear testimony to what they had witnessed of the remarkable outpouring of the Spirit across the Atlantic, and to fan the flames in their homeland yet further. Such was the strength of emotion generated by the preachers' oratory that many made spontaneous confessions seeking to be relieved of their burdens of sin. Others suffered complete nervous breakdown.

==20th century==
The most recent [[Great Awakening]] (1904 onwards) had its roots in the [[holiness movement]] which had developed in the late 19th century. The [[Pentecostal]] revival movement began, out of a passion for more power and a greater outpouring of the [[Holy Spirit]]. In 1902 the American evangelists [[Reuben Archer Torrey]] and [[Charles McCallon Alexander]] conducted meetings in Melbourne, Australia, resulting in more than 8,000 converts. News of this revival travelled fast, igniting a passion for prayer and an expectation that God would work in similar ways elsewhere.

Torrey and Alexander were involved in the beginnings of the great [[1904-1905 Welsh Revival|Welsh revival]] (1904).

In 1906 the modern Pentecostal movement was born in [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street]], in Los Angeles.

=== Melanesia ===
The ''rebaibal'', as it is known in [[Tok Pisin]], had begun in the [[Solomon Islands]] and reached the [[Urapmin people]] by 1977. The Urapmin were particularly zealous in rejecting their traditional beliefs, and adopted a form of [[Charismatic Christianity]] based on [[Baptist Christianity]]. The Urapmin innovated the practices of [[spirit possession]] (known as the "spirit disko") and ritualized confessions, the latter being especially atypical for [[Protestantism]].

===Wales===
{{main article|1904-1905 Welsh Revival}}
The Welsh revival was not an isolated religious movement but very much a part of Britain's modernization. The revival began in the fall of 1904 under the leadership of [[Evan Roberts (minister)|Evan Roberts]] (1878–1951), a 26-year-old former collier and minister-in-training. The revival lasted less than a year, but in that period 100,000 converts were made.  Begun as an effort to kindle nondenominational, nonsectarian spirituality, the Welsh revival of 1904–05 coincided with the rise of the labor movement, socialism, and a general disaffection with religion among the working class and youths. Placed in context, the short-lived revival appears as both a climax for Nonconformism and a flashpoint of change in Welsh religious life.  The movement spread to Scotland and England, with estimates that a million people were converted in Britain. Missionaries subsequently carried the movement abroad; it was especially influential on the [[Azusa Street Revival|Pentecostal movement emerging in California]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Gwynfor Jones, "Reflections on the Religious Revival in Wales 1904–05," ''Journal of the United Reformed Church History Society,'' October 2005, Vol. 7, Issue 7, pp. 427–445.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Vyrnwy Morgan, ''"The Welsh Religious Revival 1904–05: A Restrospect and Critique'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike earlier religious revivals that pivoted on powerful preaching, the revival of 1904–05 relied primarily on music and on paranormal phenomena as exemplified by the visions of Evan Roberts. The intellectual emphasis of the earlier revivals had left a dearth of religious imagery that the visions supplied. They also challenged the denial of the spiritual and miraculous element of scripture by opponents of the revival, who held liberal and critical theological positions. The structure and content of the visions not only repeated those of Scripture and earlier Christian mystical tradition but also illuminated the personal and social tensions that the revival addressed by juxtaposing biblical images with scenes familiar to contemporary Welsh believers.&lt;ref&gt;John Harvey, "Spiritual Emblems: The Visions of the 1904-5 Welsh Revival," ''Llafur: Journal of Welsh Labour History/Cylchgrawn Hanes Llafur Cymru,'' 1993, Vol. 6 Issue 2, pp. 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literary theory]] and [[philosophy of language]], the '''chronotope''' is how configurations of time and space are represented in [[language]] and [[discourse]]. The term was taken up by Russian literary scholar [[Bakhtin|M.M. Bakhtin]] who used it as a central element in his theory of meaning in language and literature. The term itself comes from the Russian ''{{lang|ru|xронотоп}}'', which in turn is derived from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|χρόνος}}'' ('[[time]]') and ''{{lang|grc|τόπος}}'' ('[[space]]'); it thus can be literally translated as "time-space." Bakhtin developed the term in his 1937 essay "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" ({{lang|ru|Формы времени и хронотопа в романе}}). Here Bakhtin showed how different literary genres operated with different configurations of time and space, which gave each genre its particular narrative character. For example, the chronotopic frame of the epic differed from that of the hero adventure or the comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=M.|year=1981|chapter=Forms of time and of the chronotope in the novel|title=In The Dialogic Imagination|pages=84–258|location=Austin|publisher=Univ. Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
In the [[philosophy of language]] and [[philology]], Bakhtin scholars [[Caryl Emerson]] and [[Michael Holquist]] state that the chronotope is "a unit of analysis for studying language according to the ratio and characteristics of the temporal and spatial categories represented in that language". Specific chronotopes are said to correspond to particular [[genre]]s, or relatively stable ways of speaking, which themselves represent particular [[worldview]]s or [[ideology|ideologies]]. To this extent, a chronotope is both a cognitive concept and a narrative feature of language.

In "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel," Bakhtin defines the chronotope thus:

{{quote|text=We will give the name chronotope (literally, "time space") to the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature. This term [space-time] is employed in mathematics, and was introduced as part of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. The special meaning it has in relativity theory is not important for our purposes; we are borrowing it for literary criticism almost as a metaphor (almost, but not entirely). What counts for us is the fact that it expresses the inseparability of space and time (time as the fourth dimension of space). We understand the chronotope as a formally constitutive category of literature; we will not deal with the chronotope in other areas of culture.' In the literary artistic chronotope, spatial and temporal indicators are fused into one carefully thought-out, concrete whole. Time, as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history. This intersection of axes and fusion of indicators characterizes the artistic chronotope.
The chronotope in literature has an intrinsic generic significance. It can even be said that it is precisely the chronotope that defines genre and generic distinctions, for in literature the primary category in the chronotope is time. The chronotope as a formally constitutive category determines to a significant degree the image of man in literature as well. The image of man is always intrinsically chronotopic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=M.|year=1981|chapter=Forms of time and of the chronotope in the novel|title=In The Dialogic Imagination|pages=84-85|location=Austin|publisher=Univ. Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Examples ==
The concept of the chronotope has been most widely used in literary studies. The scholar Timo Müller for example argued that analysis of chronotopes highlights the environmental dimension of literary texts because it draws attention to the concrete physical spaces in which stories take place. Müller discusses the chronotope of the road, which for Bakhtin was a meeting place but in recent literature no longer brings people together in this way because automobiles have changed the way we perceive the time and space of the road. Car drivers want to minimize the time they spend on the road. They are rarely interested in the road as a physical space, the natural environment around the road, or the environmental implications of their driving. This contrasts with earlier literary examples such as [[Robert Frost]]'s poem "The Road Not Taken" or [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''The Grapes of Wrath'', where the road is described as part of the natural environment and the travelers are interested in that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Timo|title=Notes Toward an Ecological Conception of Bakhtin’s ‘Chronotope.’|url=http://ecozona.eu/article/viewFile/327/301|date=2010}}; {{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Timo|chapter=The Ecology of Literary Chronotopes|title=Handbook of Ecocriticism and Cultural Ecology|date=2016|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/206422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic anthropologist [[Keith Basso]] invoked "chronotopes" in discussing Western [Apache] stories linked with places. In the 1980s when Basso was writing, geographic features reminded the [[Western Apache]] of "the moral teachings of their history" by recalling to mind events that occurred there in important moral narratives. By merely mentioning "it happened at [the place called] 'men stand above here and there,'" storyteller Nick Thompson could remind locals of the dangers of joining "with outsiders against members of their own community." Geographic features in the Western Apache landscape are chronotopes, Basso says, in precisely the way Bakhtin defines the term when he says they are "points in the geography of a community where time and space intersect and fuse. Time takes on flesh and becomes visible for human contemplation; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time and history and the enduring character of a people. ...Chronotopes thus stand as monuments to the community itself, as symbols of it, as forces operating to shape its members' images of themselves" (qtd. in Basso 1984: 44–45).

Anthropologist of syncretism [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/safet-hadzimuhamedovic/index.html Safet HadžiMuhamedović] built upon [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin’s]] term in his ethnography of the [[Gatačko Polje|Field of Gacko]] in the southeastern Bosnian highlands. In [http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HadziMuhamedovicWaiting ''Waiting for'' ''Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape''], he argued that people and landscapes may sometimes be trapped between timespaces and thus '''''"schizochronotopic"''''' (from the Greek σχίζειν (''skhizein''): "to split").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape|last=HadžiMuhamedović|first=Safet|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78533-856-4|location=New York and Oxford|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described two overarching chronotopes as "collective timespace themes", both of which relied on certain kinds of past and laid claims to the Field’s future. One was told through proximities, the other through distances between religious communities. For HadžiMuhamedović, '''''schizochronotopia''''' is a rift occurring within the same body/landscape, through which the past and the present of place have rendered each other unbidden. 

The chronotope has also been adopted for the analysis of classroom events and conversations, for example by Raymond Brown and [[Peter Renshaw]] in order to view "student participation in the classroom as a dynamic process constituted through the interaction of past experience, ongoing involvement, and yet-to-be-accomplished goals" (2006: 247–259). Kumpulainen, Mikkola, and Jaatinen (2013) examined the space–time configurations of students’ technology-mediated creative learning practices over a year-long school musical project in a Finnish elementary school. The findings of their study suggest that "blended practices appeared to break away from traditional learning practices, allowing students to navigate in different time zones, spaces, and places with diverse tools situated in their formal and informal lives" (2013: 53).

'''''Command &amp; Conquer''''' ('''''C&amp;C''''') is a [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) [[video game]] [[media franchise|franchise]], first developed by [[Westwood Studios]]. The first game was one of the earliest of the RTS genre, itself based on Westwood Studios' influential strategy game ''[[Dune II]]'' and introducing trademarks followed in the rest of the series. This includes full-motion video cutscenes with a notable ensemble cast to progress the story, as opposed to digitally in-game rendered cutscenes. Westwood Studios was taken over by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1998 and closed down in 2003. The studio and some of its members were absorbed into [[EA Los Angeles]], which continued development on the series.

==History==
After [[Westwood Studios]] developed the critically acclaimed ''[[Dune II]]'', ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' reported in 1993 that the company would not use the ''Dune'' license for Westwood's next strategy game "mostly because the programmers are tired of sand". The magazine stated that it would have "new terrain and enemies", and that "the design team is serious about doing a multi-player version".&lt;ref name="cgw199311"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=112 | title=Vampires, Video Games, Virtual Reality | work=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1993 | accessdate=28 March 2016 | pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Command &amp; Conquer (1995 video game)|Command &amp; Conquer]]'' was released worldwide by Westwood in 1995. The plot is set sometime in the near future where the Earth becomes contaminated by a mysterious resource known as Tiberium. A global war ensues between the [[United Nations|UN]]-formed [[Global Defense Initiative]] to contain it and the cult quasi-state revolutionary [[Brotherhood of Nod]], led by the enigmatic [[Kane (Command &amp; Conquer)|Kane]], which seeks to harness it. Highly successful, it was followed by ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert]]'' in 1996 which is set in an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] where the Soviet Union wages war with the Allies. Developed as the [[prequel]] to the original, the ''Red Alert'' series was spun off into a separate, lighthearted and comic series, while the original game and its sequels became known as the "Tiberium" series, retaining its [[science fiction]] and serious tone. The first game is sometimes referred to as ''Tiberian Dawn'' as a result.

The original game was followed by ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' in 1999 and its expansion pack ''[[Tiberian Sun: Firestorm]]''. In 2002, a first person-shooter set in the ''Tiberium'' universe, ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade]]'', was released and praised for its online features. ''[[Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars]]'' was released in 2007 and followed by the expansion pack ''[[Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath]]''. ''[[Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight]]'', released in 2010 as the conclusion to the ''Tiberium'' saga, received noticeably more mixed reviews because of its deviation from traditional gameplay and story. The ''Red Alert'' series was continued by the 2000 title ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2]]'', its expansion, ''[[Yuri's Revenge]]'' and ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3]]'' in 2008, which introduced a third "Empire of the Rising Sun" faction. A spin-off game in 2003, ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Generals]]'', set in a more realistic near-future and featuring the [[United States]], [[China]] and the [[Global Liberation Army]] was followed by an expansion pack, ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour|Zero Hour]]''.

The series was originally marketed to an [[English language|Anglophone]] audience, though many of the games have been translated into other languages including [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. The series is primarily developed for [[personal computer]]s running [[Microsoft Windows]], although some titles have been [[porting|ported]] to various [[video game console]]s and the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]]. Other games for platforms such as iOS and web-based have also been developed. As of July 2010, the ''Command &amp; Conquer'' franchise consists of eleven games and eight expansion packs. The first three games of the series have been released as [[freeware]] to promote the successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commandandconquer.com/classic |title=Command &amp; Conquer Classics |accessdate=2010-04-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214144634/http://www.commandandconquer.com/classic |archivedate=February 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A free-to-play game, entitled ''[[Command &amp; Conquer (2013 video game)|Command &amp; Conquer]]'', was in development with the studio [[Victory Games (EA)|Victory Games]].  It was set to be the next game in the series and was expected to be released in 2013. However, after a short alpha period the game was cancelled, and Victory Games disbanded by EA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commandandconquer.com/en/news/1380/a-new-future-for-command-conquer|title=Command and Conquer|publisher=commandandconquer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/10/29/5043244/ea-cancels-free-to-play-command-and-conquer|title=EA cancels Command &amp; Conquer, closes development studio|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|date=29 October 2013|publisher=polygon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Command &amp; Conquer'' series has been a commercial success with over 30 million ''Command &amp; Conquer'' games sold as of 2009.

==Gameplay==
The ''Command &amp; Conquer'' are [[real-time strategy]] games, with the exception of the [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade]]''. A staple of the series is the parallel campaigns of various different factions to one central storyline. Games in the series also offered [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] game options, via [[LAN]] and [[modem]] connection. All games in the series have also offered online play, as well as "skirmish" matches in which players can face AI enemies.

All ''Command &amp; Conquer'' real-time strategy games except ''Command &amp; Conquer: Generals'' and its expansions have featured the "side bar" for navigation and control as opposed to many other similar games where the control bar is located on the bottom of the screen.

''Command &amp; Conquer'' gameplay typically requires the player to construct a base and acquire resources, in order to fund the ongoing production of various types of forces with which to assault and conquer the opponent's base. All available structures of the faction chosen by the player are constructed on-site at so-called "construction yard" - which typically begin as large-sized vehicles capable of deploying themselves into the aforementioned construction yards, called MCVs or Mobile Construction Vehicle. When a construction yard has finished building a new structure, the player can select a spot near to a preexisting structure in order to place it, where the [[prefabricated]] building will then rapidly unfold in a distinctive manner.

In all games in the series except ''Command &amp; Conquer: Generals'' and its expansion, ''Zero Hour'', funds are acquired by specialized "harvester" units which bring their cargo (Tiberium for the ''Tiberian'' series of games or [[ore]] or the more valuable [[Gemstone|gems]] for the ''Red Alert'' series) to a "refinery" structure. This in turn will convert the raw material into usable resources, expressed as credits. The raw materials themselves, in games released before ''Red Alert 2'' as well as ''Command &amp; Conquer 3'' require storage space in the form of refineries and, in the case of excess, "[[storage silo]]" structures.  In ''Generals'' and ''Zero Hour'', funds are collected by two methods: collection of supplies by specialized units and converted to money in "supply centers" or directly produced by specialized units, buildings, or tech buildings at a set interval of time.

All factions have structures and units with similar functions at their disposal. However, they are adjusted to fit each faction's theme and have somewhat varying properties. Units can be classified into infantry, vehicles, and aircraft, each with their own subdivisions (note: in the ''Red Alert'' series there is also naval craft available). Unit effectiveness against opponents follows the [[rock-paper-scissors]] ([[intransitivity]]) principle found in most [[real-time strategy]] games.

Virtually every type of structure in the series acts as a [[tech tree]] node, and additional units, structures and faction-specific abilities will become available as new structures are built and placed. Access to advanced units and abilities may be temporarily blocked if the required structures are destroyed or if they are not being provided with adequate power by the supporting "[[power plant]]" structures.

===Multiplayer===
Each ''Command &amp; Conquer'' game has included the ability to play multiplayer games against other players. Each box of ''Command &amp; Conquer'' contains two CD copies of the game, immediately making [[multiplayer game|multiplayer gaming]] possible with a single purchase of the game. Westwood Studios advertised this on the packaging with the slogan "A second copy, so you and your friend can destroy each other." This resulted in ''Command &amp; Conquer'' becoming the first RTS game title to feature competitive online play,&lt;ref name="C&amp;CRTSInfluence" /&gt; and this is considered the most pertinent outside factor in the success of ''Command &amp; Conquer''.&lt;ref name="ccorigins" /&gt; All games in the series up to ''Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2'' also featured two CDs that could be used for this reason. However, later games did not.

''Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3'' was noted for being the first RTS game to enable the campaigns to be played cooperatively online; others had only supported single player campaigns. However, it was only possible to connect to other computers through EA's servers and not with [[LAN]] play.

Games produced by Westwood use the proprietary Westwood Online system to facilitate multiplayer games over the Internet; ''Renegade'' also supported [[GameSpy]]. Games under EA's development continued to use GameSpy, but dropped support for Westwood Online in favor of using EA's own servers. The GameSpy master servers have shut down in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Stapleton [http://au.pc.gamespy.com/articles/122/1227460p1.html Goodbye, And Thank You From The GameSpy Team] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222133146/http://au.pc.gamespy.com/articles/122/1227460p1.html |date=February 22, 2013 }} Feb 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The community filled the gap with their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnc-online.net/|title=C&amp;C:Online - Command &amp; Conquer server|publisher=au.pc.gamespy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the shutdown of EA's servers and removed support for the games, the fan base for the series has created their own way to play online. The well maintained CNC online website allows for players to still face off many years after the official server shutdowns. CNC online only supports Command And conquer games made by [[EA Los Angeles]] (2003 and later)

''Command &amp; Conquer'' was well received and was widely praised by critics: "''Command &amp; Conquer'' is one of the finest, most brilliantly-designed computer games I have ever seen" said [[GameSpot]] reviewer Chris Hudak.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReviewC&amp;Cone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/command-and-conquer/reviews/command-and-conquer-review-2538453/|title=Command &amp; Conquer Review|last=Hudak|first=Chris|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1996-05-01|accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Command &amp; Conquer'' has attained 94% as an aggregate score from [[Metacritic]]&lt;ref name=CNC1MC/&gt; with the less well received ''Covert Operations'' expansion pack obtaining an aggregate score of 72% after its 1996 release.&lt;ref name=CNC1GR/&gt;

''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'', released on August 27, 1999, takes place approximately 30 years after the events in its predecessor. While the original ''Command &amp; Conquer''{{'}}s plot was centered around an allegorical world politics setting, ''Tiberian Sun'' shifted this to a more [[science fiction]]-like setting against the apocalyptic background of Tiberium beginning to assimilate vast portions of the Earth's ecosystems. In 1998, [[Westwood Studios]], the developers of ''Tiberian Sun'', was acquired by [[Electronic Arts]]. However, EA had no direct part in the development of the title. Compared to its predecessor, ''Tiberian Sun'' relies heavily on science fiction technologies and introduces a new isometric game engine featuring varying level terrain to give the impression of a true [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment.

The [[full motion video]] is also scripted differently; while the cutscenes of ''Command &amp; Conquer'' and ''Red Alert'' were filmed from a first-person perspective, ''Tiberian Sun'' used traditional cinematic shots for its FMVs featuring actors such as [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Michael Biehn]].

''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade]]'', released February 26, 2002, takes place in the final days of the events of ''Command &amp; Conquer'' and was the last ''Command &amp; Conquer'' game to be created by ''Westwood Studios'' before their liquidation in 2003. Unlike any other games in the series, ''Renegade'' is a [[first-person shooter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/013/013180.html|title=Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade|publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although receiving average reviews, with an aggregate score of 75% on both [[GameRankings]] and Metacritic, ''Renegade'' was praised for its online features. [[GameSpy]] awarded ''Renegade'' its 2002 "Wish it had been better" award, condemning the single player but saying that "C&amp;C: Renegade's multiplayer was innovative and fun".&lt;ref name=gamespy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/goty2002/pc/index16.shtml|title=GameSpy's Game of the year awards 2002|year=2002|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2009-08-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412122151/http://archive.gamespy.com/goty2002/pc/index16.shtml|archivedate=2009-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online play was praised for encouraging teamwork and coordinated assaults, unlike other contemporary first-person shooters.&lt;ref name=GameOverOnline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.game-over.net/reviews.php?id=712&amp;page=reviews|title=Game Over Online Magazine - Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade|date=2002-04-09|publisher=Game Over Online Magazine|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars]]'', released March 29, 2007, was a return to the real-time strategy roots of the ''Command &amp; Conquer'' series. As a direct sequel to ''Tiberian Sun'', ''Tiberium Wars'' is set approximately 17 years after the events of ''Tiberian Sun'' and features the introduction of a third faction, the [[List of Command &amp; Conquer factions#Scrin|Scrin]]. The sequel attained an aggregate score of 85% from both GameRankings and Metacritic. ''[[PC Gamer]]'' U.S. gave the game its "Editor's Choice" rating at 90%, stating that "one of the greatest RTS franchises of all time returns to glory", while PC Gamer UK gave it a more reserved rating of 82%, stating that it was "a welcome, but limited, return".

Shortly after the release of ''Tiberium Wars'', the expansion pack ''[[Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath]]'' was announced. Released on March 24, 2008, ''Kane's Wrath'' limited the player to only the [[List of Command &amp; Conquer factions#Brotherhood of Nod|Brotherhood of Nod]] in the campaign mode, though the original factions and six new sub-factions are available for the new strategic mode and skirmish mode. Reception was mainly positive with the expansion attaining an aggregate score of 77%.

''[[Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight]]'', released on March 16, 2010, saw a big change in gameplay from the previous ''Command &amp; Conquer'' by removing the resource gathering and base building elements in previous games as well as the removal of the third faction, the Scrin. It is a direct sequel to ''Kane's Wrath'' (however not directly following on from its storyline), and is set 10 years after the game's final events, a time when Tiberium has advanced to its next evolutionary stage, and is rapidly spreading across Earth making it soon to be uninhabitable.

''[[Renegade X]]'', is a [[Freeware|free]], [[fan-made]] [[video game remake|remake]] of ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade]]''. The developers received approval from EA to release their game,&lt;ref name="RPS_Renegade-X"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/02/28/renegade-x-thoughts/|title=Repair Facility: Three Hours With Renegade-X|last=Smith|first=Graham|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=February 28, 2014|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it entered [[open beta]] on February 26, 2014. ''Renegade X'' includes a short single-player campaign called Black Dawn.

[[Louis Castle]] has said that connecting ''Red Alert'' with the ''Tiberium'' series was a "failed experiment".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''Red Alert'' introduces the [[Allies]] and the [[Soviets]] as rival factions roughly analogous to [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] of the Cold War. The game was received well by critics and has the highest average score of any ''Command &amp; Conquer'' game with an average of over 90% from [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]], unlike the title's two expansion packs, ''Red Alert: Counterstrike'' and ''Red Alert: The Aftermath'' of which both received below average reviews for the series with 63% and 70% average scores respectively. Both expansions gave the game more missions and more units. For PlayStation only, there was also a separate release to the original called ''Red Alert: Retaliation'' which included all the maps, missions and units of ''Red Alert: Counterstrike'' and ''Red Alert: The Aftermath'' as well as some newly filmed cut-scenes only available with ''Red Alert: Retaliation''. Before being re-released as [[freeware]] on 31 August 2008 by [[Electronic Arts]] ''Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert'' had sold over three million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetcnc.gamespy.com/redalert2/|title=GameSpy Red Alert 2|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2]]'' was released on October 23, 2000. It featured a Soviet invasion of North America with tanks, conscripts, large [[airship]]s, and psychically dominated anti-ship [[giant squid]]. Since that game lacked reference to the ''Tiberian'' series, the connection established in the first ''Red Alert'' game became unclear. However, it has been implied by the original creators of the series, now working at [[Petroglyph Games]], that ''Red Alert 2'' takes place in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that came about as a result of [[time travel]] experiments taking place some time into the ''Tiberian'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petroglyphgames.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1455&amp;st=0&amp;p=20748&amp;#entry20748|title=C&amp;C Timeline (ii)|date=2006-12-18|accessdate=2007-08-23|last=Isgreen|first=Adam|publisher=[[Petroglyph Games]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red Alert 2'' was received fairly positively with an aggregate score of 86% from GameRankings.

An expansion pack to ''Red Alert 2'', ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Yuri's Revenge]]'' was released on October 10, 2001. In ''Yuri's Revenge'', an ex-Soviet figure named Yuri, tries to conquer the world using psychic technology and his own private army. The expansion pack received mostly positive reviews. [[GameRankings]] reports an average score of 85% based on 31 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/476890.asp|title=Command &amp; Conquer: Yuri's Revenge for PC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=[[GameRankings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; making ''Yuri's Revenge'' the best received expansion pack in the ''Command &amp; Conquer'' series.

''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3]]'', released on October 28, 2008, followed up on the story of ''Red Alert 2'' and continued the series' more "light-hearted" take on ''Command &amp; Conquer''. It introduced many new comical units and the Empire of the Rising Sun faction, an [[anime]] inspired version of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Executive producer Chris Corry stated in a pre-release interview that ''Red Alert 3'' will further differentiate the playable factions from each other and "[play] up the silliness in their faction design whenever possible".&lt;ref&gt;Fordham, A: "[[PC PowerPlay]] #150", page 31. Next Publishing, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was seen as popular with ''Red Alert 3'' obtaining an aggregate score of 82% from Metacritic. A stand-alone expansion to ''Red Alert 3'', ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 – Uprising]]'' was released on March 12, 2009 to fairly poor reviews for the series with an average score of 64% from Metacritic. Another downloadable standalone game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was released known as ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 – Uprising#Commander's Challenge|Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Commander's Challenge]]'' which contained the Commander's Challenge mode of Uprising for consoles.

''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert (iOS)|Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert]]'' was released on October 16, 2009 for [[iOS]] which was a continuation of the story of ''Red Alert 2'' and takes place before ''Red Alert 3''. It contained two factions, the Allies and Soviet Union with a third faction, the Empire of the Rising Sun, to be added in its expansion pack. However this is version of the game is not available in some regions (e.g. Uk).

On April 23, 2018, the Chinese developer [[Tencent]] announced a new [[iOS]] version of Red Alert would be made available, with a highly mixed reception from fans online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/red-alert-online-announced-for-mobile/|title=‘Red Alert Online’ is coming to mobile devices, and people are not happy|date=2018-04-23|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Generals'' series===
''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Generals]]'', released on February 10, 2003, has a plotline which is unrelated to the other games of the ''Command &amp; Conquer'' series. ''Generals'' is set in the near future and features the [[United States]], [[China]] and the fictional [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization, the [[List of Command &amp; Conquer factions#Global Liberation Army|Global Liberation Army]]. ''Generals'' uses an engine dubbed [[SAGE (game engine)|SAGE]] (or '''S'''trategy '''A'''ction '''G'''ame '''E'''ngine) and is the first fully three-dimensional ''Command &amp; Conquer'' real-time strategy game. After its release, ''Generals'' received mostly positive reviews. Based on 34 reviews, [[Metacritic]] gives it a score of 84/100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/commandandconquergenerals|title=Command &amp; Conquer: Generals for PC Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a score of 9.3/10 from IGN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/385/385453p1.html|title=Command &amp; Conquer Generals - PC Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Generals'' has also received the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2002 [[Game Critics Awards]] Best Strategy Game award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamecriticsawards.com/2002winners.html|title=2002 Game Critics Awards|publisher=GameCriticsAwards.com|accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One review noted that Generals was the first ''Command &amp; Conquer'' real-time strategy game that did not include full-motion video cutscenes to tell the story and that it departed from the unique interface and base-building mechanics that had characterized all of the previous ''C&amp;C'' RTS titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armchairempire.com/Reviews/PC%20Games/command-conquer-generals.htm|title=The Armchair Empire - PC Reviews: Command &amp; Conquer - Generals Score: 7.9 / 10|publisher=Omni|date=2003-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expansion for ''Generals'', ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour]]'', was released on September 22, 2003 to further the ''Generals'' storyline.  ''Zero Hour'' added 9 new armies to the game, over a dozen new campaign missions, and a gameplay mode known as Generals Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/uk/command-and-conquer-generals-zero-hour|title=Command and Conquer Generals: Zero Hour  - EA Games|publisher=ea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ''Generals'', ''Zero Hour'' featured the return of full motion videos to the series. ''Zero Hour'' obtained much the same reception as ''Generals'' with an aggregate score of 85% and 84% from GameRankings and Metacritic respectively.

After EA Los Angeles started up their new internal group Danger Close and switched its focus to the ''[[Medal of Honor (video game series)|Medal of Honor]]'' series, EA launched a new studio named [[Victory Games (EA)|Victory Games]] to continue the ''Command &amp; Conquer'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commandandconquer.com/en/blogs/blog/71 |title=EA Starts New Strategy Studio: Victory Games |format=Interview |date=2011-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312234857/http://www.commandandconquer.com/en/blogs/blog/71 |archivedate=2013-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, 2011, Electronic Arts posted that the next game in the series would be ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Generals 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generals2.com/|title=Generals 2 Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210025445/http://www.generals2.com/|archivedate=2011-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, it was also announced that a new browser-based, free-to-play MMO ''Command &amp; Conquer'' game is under development, under the name ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberium Alliances]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alliances.commandandconquer.com/|title=Tiberium Alliances Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 15, ''Tiberium Alliances'' began a closed beta.&lt;ref name="CCTABETA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alliances.commandandconquer.com/news/list |title=Command &amp; Conquer Alliances - NEWS |accessdate=2011-12-19 |publisher=Electronic Arts |date=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===
On August 15, 2012, it was announced that ''Generals 2'' would be repurposed to a [[free-to-play]] game known as simply ''[[Command &amp; Conquer (2013 video game)|Command &amp; Conquer]]''.&lt;ref name="C&amp;CF2P"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/events/gamescom-2012/story.html?sid=6391569|title=Next Command &amp; Conquer goes free-to-play|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2012-08-15|accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new game would have been based around the ''Generals'' franchise. However, following feedback from players who were able to play the alpha trial, the game was cancelled in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EA Cancels C&amp;C game and shutsdown studio|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-free-to-play-command-conquer-game-closes-studio/1100-6415840/|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, EA has said that the franchise will continue, but has given no other information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incgamers.com/2013/11/command-conquer-development-to-resume-under-new-studio|title=Command &amp; Conquer development to resume under new studio - PC Invasion|date=17 November 2013|publisher=incgamers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, EA was looking for a new developer for the reboot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancelled ''Command &amp; Conquer'' to continue development at new studio: Free-to-play ''Command &amp; Conquer'' brought back from the dead|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/command_conquer_generals_2/news/cancelled_command_and_conquer_to_continue_development_at_new_studio.html|work=VideoGamer|publisher=Pro-G Media Ltd.|first=David|last=Scammell|date=November 19, 2013|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2018, EA revealed ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Rivals]]'', which is under development by the newly-formed EA Redwood Studios for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ea.com/news/command-and-conquer-rivals|title=Command &amp; Conquer: Rivals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EA announced in November 2018 its plans to remaster ''Command &amp; Conquer'', including expansions and ''Red Alert'', for modern computer systems through [[Petroglyph Games]]. There is no current estimated release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/14/18095301/command-conquer-remastered-red-alert-ea-petroglyph | title = Command &amp; Conquer 4K remaster coming | first=  Michael | last =McWhertor | date = November 14, 2018 | accessdate = November 14, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Music of the Command &amp; Conquer series}}

Much of the music for the series was composed and produced by [[Westwood Studios]]' former sound director and [[video game music]] [[composer]] [[Frank Klepacki]] for the early games, with composition duties being taken on by several others following the liquidation of Westwood Studios in 2003. Klepacki returned to the series in 2008 however to assist with the soundtrack for ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3|Red Alert 3]]''.

The music has been received positively by critics, although praise was higher with earlier entries.

The original score for ''Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert'' was composed by [[Frank Klepacki]] and was voted the best video game soundtrack of 1996 by [[PC Gamer]] and Gameslice magazines.&lt;ref name="behindra"&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMENTARY: Behind the Red Alert Soundtrack|last=Klepacki|first=Frank|url=http://www.frankklepacki.com|work=frankklepacki.com|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his most famous songs from the series is the theme of ''Red Alert'', titled "Hell March", which accents the style of the game with adrenalized riffs of electric guitar, the sounds of marching feet, and synthesizers to a dramatic chant. Originally intended to be the theme for the [[List of Command &amp; Conquer factions#Brotherhood of Nod|Brotherhood of Nod]] faction in the ''Covert Operations'' expansion to the original 1995 ''Command &amp; Conquer'' game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMENTARY: Behind the C&amp;C Soundtrack|last=Klepacki|first=Frank|url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/|work=frankklepacki.com|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the track eventually ended up enlisting itself as a staple in the ''Red Alert'' series instead, and a second version of "Hell March" was specifically created for ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2]]''.

{{quote|After C&amp;C came out we wasted no time kicking out Covert Ops. I wrote some more ambient style themes they asked me for, and then I began tinkering with this heavy metal song that I was trying to gear towards Nod for the next big C&amp;C game. Brett Sperry came in my office and said "You got anything I can hear for the new C&amp;C?" I played it for him. He said "What's the name of this one?" I said "Hell March." He said "That's the signature song for our next game."&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=119522869602|title=Frank Klepacki: Behind the music of the first Command &amp; Conquer|last=Klepacki|first=Frank|date=2009-07-27|publisher=FaceBook.com|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Frank Klepacki]]|''[[Composer|Senior Composer]]''}}

'''Coteau Books''' is a small, non-profit literary press based in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada. It was established in 1975 by Bob Currie, Gary Hyland, Barbara Sapergia and [[Geoffrey Ursell]] when they realized that there was little opportunity for Saskatchewan writers to get published, especially first-time authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coteaubooks.com Coteau Books official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coteau Books has grown considerably since its 1975 founding, publishing 16 books a year, from authors across Canada, and adding a substantial and high-profile "young readers" element to its list. Now employing five people, Coteau distributes its books to Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand, and around the world on the internet. It also has rights representation for its titles in most parts of the world. It has published authors from all over Canada, and it has been short listed for or won many literary awards in the country, including the prestigious [[Governor General's Literary Awards]] (which Coteau's [[Gloria Sawai]] won in 2001 for her short story collection ''A Song for Nettie Johnson'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coteaubooks.com/awardpgs/GovGen.html Coteau Books – Governor General's Literary Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207190038/http://www.coteaubooks.com/awardpgs/GovGen.html |date=2007-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coteau has had books named GG finalists seven times, in four different genres, which is a rare accomplishment for a press of its size.

Writers who have been published by the firm have included [[Mark Abley]], [[Linda Aksomitis]], [[Sharon Butala]], [[Warren Cariou]], [[Archie Crail]], [[Deborah Ellis]], [[Connie Gault]], [[Wendy Phillips (author)|Wendy Phillips]], [[Armand Garnet Ruffo]], [[Linda Smith (novelist)|Linda Smith]] and [[Anne Szumigalski]].

The technical term '''direction of fit''' is used to describe the distinctions that are offered by two related sets of opposing terms:{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* The more general set of '''mind-to-world''' (i.e., '''mind-to-fit-world''', not '''from-mind-to-world''') ''vs.'' '''world-to-mind'''{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} (i.e., '''world-to-fit-mind''') used by [[philosophy of mind|philosophers of mind]],{{Who|date=December 2012}} and
* The narrower, more specific set, '''word-to-world'''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Searle]], ''Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind'', Cambridge University Press, 1983, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., '''word-to-fit-world''') ''vs.'' '''world-to-word''' {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} (i.e., '''world-to-fit-word''') used by advocates of [[Speech act|speech act theory]].{{Who|date=December 2012}}

==In general==

In philosophy of mind, a [[belief]]  has a '''mind-to-world''' direction of fit.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (2001), p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; A belief (that '''p''', say) depicts the world as being in a state of affairs such that '''p''' is true. Beliefs, some philosophers have argued,&lt;ref&gt;Searle (2001), p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; aim at the truth and so aim to fit the world. A belief is satisfied when it fits the world.

A desire, on the other hand, normally expresses a yet to be realized state of affairs and so has a '''world-to-mind''' direction of fit.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (2001), p.37-8.&lt;/ref&gt; A desire that '''p''', unlike a belief, doesn't depict the world as being in the state that '''p'''; rather it expresses a desire that the world be such that '''p''' is true. Desire is a state that is satisfied when the world fits it.

A way to account for the difference is that a (rational) person that holds the belief that '''p''' when confronted with evidence that '''not-p''', will revise his belief, whereas a person that desires that '''p''' can retain his desire that '''p''' in the face of evidence that '''not-p'''.{{Who|date=December 2012}}

To a philosopher of language{{Who|date=December 2012}} a '''word-to-world''' fit occurs when, say, a sports journalist correctly names Jones as a goal scorer; while if the journalist mistakenly names Smith as the goal scorer, the printed account does ''not'' display a '''word-to-world''' fit, and must be altered such that it matches the real world. Conversely, a '''world-to-word''' fit occurs when a fan of Smith's team opines that they deserved to win the match, even though they lost. In this case, the world would have to change to make the sports fan's wish become true.

However, in the case of, say, a judge delivering a [[Capital punishment|death]] [[sentence (law)|sentence]] to a criminal declared [[guilt (law)|guilty]] by a [[jury]], the utterances of the judge ''alter'' the world, through the fact of that utterance;{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and, in this case, the judge is generating a '''world-to-word-to-world''' fit (see below). So, if the judge's opinion is upheld, the world ''must'' be altered to match the content of the judge's utterance (i.e., the criminal must be executed).

==In medieval philosophy==
According to [[Thomas Aquinas]] (''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 21, Article 2), there are two kinds of "[[truth]]" (''veritas''), both understood as [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] between mind (''intellectus'') or words (''oratio'') and world ("things", ''res''):
{{quotation|Truth consists in the equation of [thing and mind] (''[[adaequatio rei et intellectus]]''), as said above. Now the mind, that is the cause of the thing, is related to it as its rule and measure; whereas the converse is the case with the mind that receives its knowledge from things.&lt;br&gt;
When therefore things are the measure and rule of the mind, truth consists in ''the equation of the mind to the thing'', as happens in ourselves. For according as a thing is, or is not, our thoughts or our words about it are true or false.&lt;br&gt;
But when the mind is the rule or measure of things, truth consists in ''the equation of the thing to the mind''; just as the work of an artist is said to be true, when it is in accordance with his art. Now as works of art are related to art, so are works of justice related to the law with which they accord. Therefore God's justice, which establishes things in the order conformable to the rule of His wisdom, which is the law of His justice, is suitably called truth. Thus we also in human affairs speak of the truth of justice. (''emphasis added to original'')}}

==In speech act theory==
Perhaps the first to speak of a "direction of fit" was the philosopher [[J. L. Austin]]. Austin did not use the distinction between different directions of fit to contrast commands or expressions of intention to assertions, or desires to beliefs. He rather distinguishes different ways of asserting that an item is of a certain type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hennig|first=Boris|title=Two Epistemic Directions of Fit|url=http://www.borishennig.de/texte/2011/dof.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an extensive discussion&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1953), p.234.&lt;/ref&gt; of the issues involved with the differences between, say, (a) wrongly calling a triangle a square (something which, he said, was committing an act of violence to the language) and (b) wrongly describing a triangular object as being a square (something which, he said, was committing an act of violence to the facts), Austin distinguished between what he termed:
* "'''the onus of match'''": in the case of one wanting to ''match'' X and Y, the distinction between the matching of '''X to Y''' and the matching of '''Y to X'''; and
* "'''the direction of fit'''": in the case of naming something, the difference between the fitting of a '''name to an item''', and the fitting of '''an item to a name'''.

The concept of direction of fit can also apply to [[speech acts]]: e.g., statements, guesses and conjectures have '''word-to-world''' direction of fit, while [[imperative mood|commands]] and promises have a '''world-to-word''' direction of fit.

[[John Searle]] and Daniel Vanderveken&lt;ref&gt;Searle &amp; Vanderveken, (1985), pp.52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; assert that there are only four possible "''directions of fit''" in language:
:'''1. The word-to-world direction of fit'''.
:In achieving success of fit the propositional content of the [[utterance]] fits an independently existing state of affairs in the world. E.g.: "We are married".

:'''2. The world-to-word direction of fit'''.
:To achieve success of fit the world must change to match the propositional content of the utterance. E.g.: "Will you marry me?", "I want to marry him", "You'd just better marry her, buddy!", etc.

:'''3. The double direction of fit'''.
:To achieve success of fit the world is ''thereby'' altered to fit the propositional content by representing the world as being so altered, unlike sense 2. E.g.: "I declare you man and wife". The 'doubled' direction is therefore always world-to-word-to-world. For obvious reasons, Searle calls sentences of this type 'declarations'.

:'''4. The null or empty direction of fit'''.
:There is no direct question of achieving success of fit between the propositional content and the world, because success of fit is presupposed by the utterance. E.g.: "I'm glad I married you" presupposes that the speaker is married to the listener.

Searle used this notion of "''direction of fit''" to create a taxonomy of [[illocutionary act]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Searle (1975/1976/1979).&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Although [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]] never employed the term "the direction of fit", Searle has strongly argued&lt;ref&gt;Searle, 1985, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; that the following passage from her work '''''Intention''''' was, by far, "the best illustration" of the distinction between the tasks of "[getting] the words (more strictly their propositional content) to match the world… [and that of getting] the world to match the words":
{{quotation|§32. Let us consider a man going round a town with a shopping list in his hand. Now it is clear that the relation of this list to the things he actually buys is one and the same whether his wife gave him the list or it is his own list; and that there is a different relation where a list is made by a detective following him about. If he made the list itself, it was an expression of intention; if his wife gave it him, it has the role of an order. What then is the identical relation to what happens, in the order and the intention, which is not shared by the record? It is precisely this: if the list and the things that the man actually buys do not agree, and if this and this alone constitutes a mistake, then the mistake is not in the list but in the man's performance (if his wife were to say: “Look, it says butter and you have bought margarine”, he would hardly reply: “What a mistake! we must put that right” and alter the word on the list to “margarine”); whereas if the detective's record and what the man actually buys do not agree, then the mistake is in the record.&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe, 1963, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In philosophy of mind==

According to Velleman, when used in the domain of the [[philosophy of mind]], the concept '''direction of fit''' represents the distinguishing feature between two types of [[intentionality|intentional]] [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]]s:

:'''''Facta''''' (singular '''''factum''''', states that currently exist) are states with a mind-to-world direction of fit.
: Examples include [[belief]]s, [[perception]]s, [[hypotheses]], and [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]].  In the event of a mismatch between the mental state and the world, the mental state is in some sense false or wrong and should perhaps be changed.

:'''''Facienda''''' (singular '''''faciendum''''', states that are yet to exist) are states with a world-to-mind direction of fit.
:Examples include [[Intentionality|intentions]] and desires.  If there is a mismatch between the mental state and the world, the world is in some sense wrong and should perhaps be changed.

In some forms of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]], a matching ''factum'' and ''faciendum'' must be present in a person's [[mind]] in order for him to [[action (philosophy)|act]] intentionally.  If a person has the belief that action (A) will lead to state (S), and has the desire that state (S) obtain, then he will perform action (A). The action is directly [[Causality|caused]] by simultaneous presence of the two mental states; no further explanation is needed.

According to Velleman:
::''The term "direction of fit" refers to the two ways in which attitudes can relate [[proposition]]s to the world.''
::''In [[cognitive]] attitudes [such as '''belief'''], a proposition is grasped as patterned after the world; whereas in [[Conation|conative]] attitudes [such as '''desire'''], the proposition is grasped as a pattern for the world to follow.''
::''The propositional object of desire is regarded not as fact -- not, that is, as '''factum''', having been brought about -- but rather as '''faciendum''', to be brought about: it's regarded not as true but as to be made true.''&lt;ref&gt;Velleman, (1992), p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13101">An '''ethnic interest group''' or '''ethnic lobby''', according to [[Thomas Ambrosio]],&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Thomas Ambrosio |last=Ambrosio |first=Thomas |year=2002 |title=Ethnic identity groups and U.S. foreign policy |location= |publisher=Praeger Publishers |isbn=0-275-97533-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[advocacy group]] (often a [[foreign policy interest group]]) established along cultural, ethnic, religious or racial lines by an [[ethnic group]] for the purposes of directly or indirectly influencing the [[foreign policy]] of their resident country in support of the [[homeland]] and/or ethnic [[Kinship|kin]] abroad with which they identify.

==Overview==
According to Ambrosio,&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt; "like other societal interest groups, ethnic identity groups establish formal organizations devoted to promoting group cohesiveness and addressing group concerns."  While many formal organizations established by ethnic identity groups are apolitical, others are created explicitly for political purposes.  In general, groups who seek to influence government policy on domestic or foreign issues are referred to as [[advocacy group]]s.  Those interest groups established by ethnic identity groups are referred as to ''ethnic interest groups''.&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Foreign concerns===
{{Main|Foreign policy interest group}}
According to Thomas Ambrosio, most ethnic identity groups have connections inside their host country.&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt;  These connections can be derived from membership in a [[diaspora]], with ethnic [[Kinship|kin]] in their historical homeland (e.g. Anglo-Saxon Americans and Britain, Italian-Americans and Italy, Armenian-Americans and Armenia, Arab-Americans and the Middle East) or scattered among many countries (e.g. Jewish-Americans, Palestinian-Americans), or based on perceived similarities with others even though they may share little or no common ancestry (e.g. White Southerners and Afrikaners in South Africa, African-Americans and black South Africans, Muslims worldwide.)  Because of the concern of the ethnic groups for "kin" in foreign states, many ethnic interest groups focus on influencing the foreign policy of their host countries to benefit there foreign "kin" and thus act as [[foreign policy interest group]]s.

===Variable influence===
The influence of ethnic groups on the foreign policy of many states, including that of the United States, is "a reality",&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt; although these ethnic groups must "compete for influence with a plethora of other special interest groups and institutional interests."&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt;  According to a literature review of the topic conducted by Patrick J. Haney and Walt Vanderbush,&lt;ref name=Haney1999&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haney |first=Patrick J. |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Walt |last2=Vanderbush |title=The Role of Ethnic Interest Groups in U.S. Foreign Policy: The Case of the Cuban American National Foundation |journal=International Studies Quarterly |volume=43 |year=1999 |issue=2 |pages=344–345 |doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the primary factors that determine the relative strength of influence of an ethnic interest group are:
# "Organizational strength – organizational unity, a professional lobbying apparatus that provides useful information, and financial resources;
# Membership unity, placement, and voter participation – based on the group's electoral implications;
# Salience and resonance of the message – the ability to influence public opinion;
# Push on an open door – ethnic interest groups will be more successful if they promote policies that the government already favors;
# Strength of opposition
# Permeability of and access to the government – ethnic interest groups [in the context of the United States] are more likely to be successful when the policy in question requires a congressional role since it is usually more porous than the executive;
# Mutually supportive relationships – while groups need policy makers to do something for them, policymakers also need the ethnic interest groups.  Ethnic interest groups may provide a host of valuable resources to policymakers, including information, votes, and campaign contributions."

==Discussing ethnic influence==
{{rquote|right|'''''The diversity that enriches our domestic life remains a recurrent cause of difficulties in our foreign relations.''''' &amp;mdash; U.S. Senator [[Charles Mathias]] (R-Md.) &lt;ref name=Mathias1981&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mathis |first=Charles McCurdy, Jr. |title=Ethnic Groups and Foreign Policy |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |volume=59 |date=Summer 1981 |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/35181/charles-mcc-mathias-jr/ethnic-groups-and-foreign-policy |pages=28–66, 89–117 |doi=10.2307/20040899}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Discussing the influence and proper role of ethnic groups in the formulation of foreign policy has often been difficult and contentious.  This section first describes the typical characteristics of the debates which restrict their focus to the legitimacy of or the harm caused by ethnic lobbies.  The second section presents a response to simplistic debates of ethnic lobbies devoid of context, by refocusing on the identification of the interests of the broader community and then permitting or limiting the influence of ethnic lobbies based on their alignment within the interests of the broader context.

===Debating legitimacy verse harm===
Discussions of foreign policy formulation and the involvement of ethnic interest groups often become debates on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of ethnic interest groups devoid of wider context.  The two opposing positions often expressed in these debates: One interpretations welcomes a ''multicultural foreign policy'' and thus views the influence of ethnic groups as legitimate.  The opposing interpretation comes to a conclusion that the influence of ethnic interest groups can result in a ''parochial capture'' of a nation's foreign policy that harms the "true" national interest and [[common good]].

====Legitimate multiculturalism====
Those arguing for a ''multicultural foreign policy'' "see little wrong with ethnic groups having a voice in the foreign policy process."  They tend to "believe that a more diverse foreign policy" results in the enrichment of the nation "both at home and abroad."&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt;

There are six common arguments in favor of the ''enriching multiculturalism'' interpretation:&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt;
# "A multicultural foreign policy is a reflection of [a state's] liberal democratic ethos.
# It respects the diversity of the [nation].
# It serves as a correction for historically '[dominant ethnic group-centric]' foreign policies.
# It helps to resist the trend towards [[isolationism]].
# It spreads democratic principles throughout the world.
# Ethnic identity groups can reinforce [national] interests."

====Harmful parochial capture====
Those who argue against the idea of a multicultural foreign policy influenced by domestic ethnic interest groups often begin from a "[[Political realism|realist]]" perspective and "start with the premise that there exists 'objective' [[national interests|[national] interests]] that may (or may not) differ from the interests of substate political actors (ethnic, business or otherwise).  Thus, a tension potentially exists between 'national' and 'special' interests.  According to this argument, ethnic identity groups may harm the [nation] if these groups distract the [nation] from the pursuit of its national interests or induce it to pursue a foreign policy contrary to its national interests.  In the worst-case scenario, ethnic groups can effectively hijack the foreign policy process and use the strength of [the nation] for their ''parochial interests''."&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt;

There are seven common arguments in favor of the ''parochial capture'' interpretation:&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt;
# "Ethnic interest groups often put their own interests ahead of '[national]' interests.
# They undercut the foundations of [nation's] democracy.
# They may be agents of foreign (and possibly hostile) governments.
# They promote an incoherent foreign policy.
# They resist/prevent necessary changes in [the nation's] foreign policy.
# Certain ethnic interest groups are simply too powerful.
# They may get the [nation] involved in conflicts where no [national] interest is threatened."

====Criticisms of legitimacy verse harm debates====
Both stances, according to Ambrosio,&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt; are unrealistic.

The uncritical embrace of ethnic interests in the formulation of foreign policy, as favored by the ''enriching multiculturalism'' interpretation, is problematic because:
# "It is fundamentally undemocratic because it allows a small minority to determine policy for the vast majority (just as it is fundamentally undemocratic to allow any small interest group to determine [national] foreign policy."
# The traditional foreign policy debating "process itself tends to moderate policies; that is; extremism will be more likely if the process is circumvented" by ethnic lobbies.
# "It is a recipe for conflict: if a policy needs to be determined towards a specific region where ethnic groups are in conflict, how do we determine which diaspora should effective make [national] foreign policy?"

Equally unworkable is the complete exclusion of ethnic participation in foreign policy formulation advocated by the ''parochial capture'' interpretation:
# It "is fundamentally undemocratic to arbitrarily exclude certain groups from legitimate expressions of political preference."
# Trying to enforce a ban on ethnic involvement "would be nearly impossible: ethnic identity groups have ingeniously found ways around bans on ethnic mobilization."
# Many "interest groups that support a specific ethnic agenda may argue that they are not ethnic-specific."

===Debating broader interests and goals first===
A productive alternative, according to Ambrosio,&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt; to debating the abstract legitimacy or harm of ethnic influence in the general case, is reorienting the debate towards identifying, clarifying and methods of pursuing the nation's broad interests.  Only after the broader community' interests and thus goals are identified, can one properly evaluate the value, in the rich context of the nation's broadly established [[common good]], offered by the involvement or influence of individual special or ethnic interest groups.  The result is that ethnic interest groups with goals that align with the broader community will be bestowed with more legitimacy than those goals exhibit less or no alignment.

Ambrosio writes:
:"It should not be surprising that neither extreme amounts to what can reasonably called sound foreign policy. [...] Instead, a more sympathetic perspective of both arguments would result in differences over the ''range'' of legitimate influence by special interest groups, not over the influence itself (although, for some, the range could be quite limited or quite broad.)
:Indeed, the debate over the legitimate range of influence by special interest groups can be a healthy part of the political process.  However, such a debate must always be focused on the end goal of defining, protecting, and advancing the interests of the broader community. [...] Thus, it should not be the groups influencing the debate themselves that are the target for criticism or praise, but whether they are advancing the [nation's] interests.  Ignoring the broader community's interests is just as dangerous as ostracizing certain groups from the foreign policy process merely because they are based on ethnic identities."&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002/&gt;

The concept of '''ethnic origin''' is an attempt to classify people, not according to their current [[nationality]], but according to commonalities in their social background.  For example, somebody living in a monocultural environment, speaking English and clearly a member of an English-speaking cultural milieu, may be descended from immigrants speaking some other language and still participate in some other aspects of their culture.

Ethnic origin implies one or more of the following:&lt;ref&gt;PA Senior, R Bhopal - Ethnicity as a Variable in Epidemiological Research - BMJ 1994;309:327&lt;/ref&gt; 
* shared origins or social background;
* shared culture and traditions that are distinctive, maintained between generations, and lead to a sense of identity and group;
* a common language
* a common religious tradition.

Ethnic origin has become a popular classification in [[statistics]], where the concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] has been largely discarded since [[World War II]], for various reasons.  A reaction against the abuses of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[apartheid]] made it hard to collect, store or publish racial data{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. Social scientists in general have lost  interest in race as useful concept of study{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, with many other differences between population groups more significant. However the relative prosperity of distinguishable groups remain of interest in public policy discussions.

In the US, however, the use of the term race is still current. The [[Race (U.S. census)|census]] asks questions about race, though the classification used is no different from what would be termed ethnic origin elsewhere{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

The concept of ethnic origin in practice may seem arbitrary and without a rigorous definition of how to assign a person to the particular categories. If a person was asked for their ethnic origin and answered "how do I tell what ethnic origin I am?" it may not be clear whether they are being asked for: their country of birth, the country of birth of their parents, or more distant ancestors (how distant?), or for a description of their appearance, such as skin colour or hair type, or for their cultural behaviour such as food, clothing, language and the people they associate with. The answers to these questions may be contradictory and suggest different ethnic origins.

The answer of interest to the questioner is probably whether the person considers themselves to be a member of a particular ethnic subdivision of society, or are considered a member of such a group by others{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. This would affect whether they were possibly subject to discrimination etc. However the question is still open to interpretation, since a person may be identified differently depending on the mode of contact, e.g., considering outward appearance such as skin colour or clothing, name, or use of written or oral language, etc. This raises the question of whether ethnic origin is just another term for [[ethnic group]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12873">'''Getting it right for every child''' (GIRFEC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/gettingitright/ |title=Getting it right for every child (GIRFEC)| publisher=Scottish Government |date=18 August 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[Scottish Government]]'s approach to supporting children and young people. It is intended as a framework that will allow organisations who work on behalf of the country's children and their families to provide a consistent, supportive approach for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/337339/0110683.pdf |title=The vital importance of getting it right for every child and young person |publisher=Scottish Government |date=11 January 2014|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for the controversial "Named Person" requirement.

It requires that services aimed at children and young people – [[Social work in Scotland|social work]], [[Health in Scotland|health]], [[Education in Scotland|education]], [[Police in Scotland|police]], [[Housing in Scotland|housing]] and voluntary organisations – adapt and streamline their systems and practices and work together. The approach encourages earlier intervention by professionals to avoid crisis situations at a later date.

==Development of GIRFEC==
The GIRFEC approach arose out of the review of the [[Children's Hearings System]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2004/10/20021/44106 |title=Getting it Right for Every Child: A Report on the Responses to the Consultation on the Review of the Children's Hearings System |publisher=Scottish Government |date=4 October 2004 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review recognised that in order to improve outcomes for vulnerable children, agencies need to intervene earlier, in a better and more integrated way in response to identified needs and risks, and not when a threshold is reached to trigger action. The origins of the approach can be traced back to the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Report (1964)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2003/10/18259/26879 "Kilbrandon Report 1964"]&lt;/ref&gt; reinforced by publications such as 'For Scotland's Children'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2001/10/fscr |title=For Scotland's Children Report |publisher=Scottish Executive |date=30 October 2001|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development and early implementation of this approach took place across Scotland. In Highland there were pathfinder projects that launched in September 2006 followed by an implementation phase that began in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/292706/0090352.pdf |title=Changing Professional Practice and Culture to Get it Right for Every Child. An Evaluation of the Development and Early Implementation Phases of Getting it right for every child in Highland: 2006-2009 |publisher=Scottish Government |date=November 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lanarkshire pathfinder reported that GIRFEC had led to a sharper focus on the needs of the child and had also helped a culture of shared responsibility among education, health and social work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6296445 |title='We've been getting it right for years' |last=Blane |first=Douglas |publisher=TES Scotland |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of GIRFEC has included some [[change management]] elements, with a programme designed to achieve some consistency around meeting the needs of – and improving outcomes for – all children and young people in Scotland.

The [[Scottish Government]] has published a number of guides and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/Young-People/gettingitright/publications |title=Guides and resources |publisher=Scottish Government |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support implementation.

In October 2012 a programme of visits was carried out by [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education|HM Inspectors]] to review the readiness of the education system in using GIRFEC approaches to help ensure that children and families get the right help at the right time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/Images/GIRFEC%20FINAL%2024-10-12_tcm4-735258.pdf |title=Getting it right for every child: Where are we now? |publisher=[[Education Scotland]] |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
In July 2012 details of a bill were announced that included embedding the GIRFEC approach in a single system of planning and delivery across children's services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18706446 |title=Bill to increase free pre-school childcare in Scotland |work=BBC News |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 12-week period of consultation followed and many organisations and individuals submitted responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/CurrentCommittees/66626.aspx |title=Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill - Submissions received |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014]] became law on the 27 March 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sccyp.org.uk/policy/children-young-people-scotland-act |title=The Children &amp; Young People (Scotland) Act |publisher=[[Scotland’s Commissioner for Children and Young People]] |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; enshrining in law key elements of the Getting it Right approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/Young-People/legislation |title=Children, Young People and families: Children's legislation |publisher=Scottish Government |date=6 June 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to named person requirement of GIRFEC==
Under GIRFEC each child in Scotland will be assigned a "'''Named Person'''".  The Named Person is intended to be a clear point of contact if a child, young person or their parents want information or advice, or if they want to talk about any worries and seek support.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/Young-People/gettingitright/named-person|title=The role of the Named Person|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=2012-11-16|website=www.gov.scot|language=English|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Named Personwill usually be the health visitor for a pre-school child and a promoted teacher - such as a headteacher, or guidance teacher or other promoted member of staff - for a school age child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Criticism of the Named Person requirement (referred to as a "'''state guardian'''" in some media) has been aired in some press,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/400779/SNP-bill-to-spy-on-parents-is-criticised-by-families SNP Bill to Spy On Parents opposed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highlandperthshirenews.co.uk/general-news-main/no-kidding How the Scottish Government is Stealing Our Children&lt;/ref&gt; newspaper columns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/23/scottish-children-government-appointed-guardians |title=Comment is free: Scottish children don't need these government spies |last=McKenna |first=Kevin |work=The Observer |date=23 February 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[home educators]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schoolhouse.org.uk/home-ed-in-the-news/schoolhouse-petition-to-reject-girfec-surveillance-and-a-named-person-for-every-child-in-scotland Schoolhouse opposes GIRFEC&lt;/ref&gt; churches, various opposition MSPs and lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcn.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/578231/April-2014_NPPC_CYP_Act_Scotland_final.pdf |title=Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 - Update for NPPC, April 2014 |publisher=[[Royal College of Nursing|Royal College of Nursing Scotland]] |date=April 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns expressed by home educators included: the "Named Person" requirement not being an opt-in service; "welfare" may be subject to the bias of the Named Person; and personal data is gathered and shared.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hslda.org/hs/international/Scotland/201307230.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 a campaign group lodged legal papers at the [[Court of Session]], challenging the Named Person plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28219353 |title=Bid to block named person plan goes to Court of Session |work=BBC News |date=9 July 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015 this legal challenge was dismissed, with the judge explaining that the case "fails on all points".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30935806 |title=Legal challenge against 'named person' plans dismissed |first=Reevel |last=Alderson |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=1dadc2a6-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7 |title=Judgement: Outer House, Court of Session [2015]. CSOH 7. P679/14 |publisher=[[Scottish Court Service]] |date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal against this dismissal was heard by [[Lord Carloway]] in the Court of Session in June 2015. Lord Carloway also dismissed the concerns raised by the campaign group saying "It [the creation of a Named Person] has no effect whatsoever on the legal, moral or social relationships within the family.  The assertion to the contrary, without any supporting basis, has the appearance of hyperbole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13647529.Named_person_concerns_are__hyperbole___say_appeal_judges/ |title=Named person concerns are 'hyperbole', say appeal judges |first=Stephen |last=Naysmith |work=Herald Scotland |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=8a55eaa6-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7 |title=Judgement: Second Division, Inner House, Court of Session [2015]. CSIH 64. P679/14 |publisher=[[Scottish Court Service]] |date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK Supreme Court ruling===
On 28 July, 2016, the [[UK Supreme Court]] ruled against some aspects of the scheme. Judges said that some proposals breach rights to [[Privacy rights|privacy]] and a [[Family rights|family life]] under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. While they said that the aim of the Act is "unquestionably legitimate and benign" they also said that specific proposals about information-sharing "are not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament" and that the legislation made it "perfectly possible" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a "wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware".

The Scottish government says it will not commence the legislation until the criticisms are addressed, delaying the implementation until after the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36903513 |title=Supreme Court rules against Named Person scheme|work=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To '''hallow''' is "to make [[holy]] or sacred, to sanctify or consecrate, to venerate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hallow|date=15 January 2007|accessdate=23 January 2007|title=Dictionary.com|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group, LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective form ''hallowed'', as used in ''[[Lord's Prayer|The Lord's Prayer]]'', means holy, consecrated, sacred, or revered.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'' entry for ''hallowed''&lt;/ref&gt; The noun form ''hallow'', as used in ''[[Hallowtide]]'', is a synonym of the word [[saint]].&lt;ref name="WilsonFischer2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiehlDonnelly2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leslie1895"/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{further|Weoh}}
The noun is from the [[Old English]] adjective ''hālig'', nominalised as ''se hālga'' "the holy man". The [[Gothic language|Gothic]] word for "holy" is either ''hailags'' or ''weihaba'', ''weihs''. "To hold as holy" or "to become holy" is ''weihnan'', "to make holy, to sanctify" is ''weihan''. Holiness or sanctification is ''weihiþa''. Old English, like Gothic, had a second term of similar meaning, ''wēoh'' "holy", with a substantive ''wīh'' or ''wīg'', [[Old High German]] ''wīh'' or ''wīhi'' ([[Middle High German]]  ''wîhe'', [[German language|Modern German]] ''Weihe''). The [[Nordendorf fibula]] has ''wigiþonar'', interpreted as ''wīgi-þonar'' "holy [[Donar]]" or "sacred to Donar". [[Old Norse]] ''[[Vé (shrine)|vé]]'' is a type of [[shrine]]. The ''weihs'' group is cognate to [[Latin]] ''victima'', an animal dedicated to the gods and destined to be [[animal sacrifice|sacrificed]].

==In current usage==
Hallow, as a noun, is a synonym of the word [[saint]].&lt;ref name="WilsonFischer2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Douglas|last2=Fischer|first2=Ty|title=Omnibus II: Church Fathers Through the Reformation|date=30 June 2005|publisher=Veritas Press|isbn=9781932168440|page=101|quote=The word "hallow" means "saint," in that "hallow" is just an alternative form of the word "holy" ("hallowed be Thy name").}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiehlDonnelly2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diehl|first1=Daniel|last2=Donnelly|first2=Mark|title=Medieval Celebrations: How to Plan Holidays, Weddings, and Feasts with Recipes, Customs, Costumes, Decorations, Songs, Dances, and Games|date=1 May 2001|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=9780811728669|page=13|quote=The word hallow was simply another word for saint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern English usage, the noun "hallow" appears mostly in the compound [[Hallowtide]], a liturgical season which includes the days of [[Halloween]] and [[Hallowmas]].&lt;ref name="Leslie1895"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Frank|title=Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly|accessdate=3 September 2014|year=1895|publisher=Frank Leslie Publishing House|page=539|work=Allhallowtide|quote=Just as the term "Eastertide" expresses for us the whole of the church services and ancient customs attached to the festival of Easter, from Palm Sunday until Easter Monday, so does All-hallowtide include for us all the various customs, obsolete and still observed, of Halloween, All Saints' and All Souls' Days. From the 31st of October until the morning of the 3d of November, this period of three days, known as All-hallowtide, is full of traditional and legendary lore.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halloween (or ''Hallowe'en'') is a shortened form of "All Hallow Even," meaning "All Hallows' Eve" or "All Saints' Eve."&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'' entry for ''Halloween''&lt;/ref&gt; Hallowmas, the day after Halloween, is shortened from "Hallows' [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]," and is also known as "[[All Saints' Day|All Hallows]]' Day" or "[[All Saints' Day]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'' entry for ''Hallowmas''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In legend==
Some important and powerful objects in legends could be referred to as "hallows" because of their function and symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mystical-www.co.uk/arthuriana2z/h.htm#HOB|accessdate=16 February 2007|title= Arthurian A-ZZ|publisher=Mystical WWW}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tuatha de Danaan]] in Ireland possessed the [[Four Treasures of the Tuatha Dé Danann|Four Treasures]] of Ireland which could be interpreted as "hallows": the [[Lugh#Lug.27s Spear|Spear of Lugh]], [[Lia Fáil|Stone of Fal]], the [[Claíomh Solais|Sword of Light]] of [[Nuada]], and [[The Dagda]]'s [[Dagda's Cauldron|Cauldron]].

In the modern period, some neo-pagans believe that the four suits in the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider-Waite]] [[Tarot|Tarot cards]] deck (swords, wands, pentacles and cups), which are also a representation of the four [[classical elements]] of air, fire, earth and water, are also hallows.

[[Coronation]] ceremonies for monarchs still invokes four ritual objects, now represented as the [[sceptre]], [[sword]], [[ampulla]] of oil, and [[Crown (headgear)|crown]].  Similar objects also appear in [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legends, where the [[Fisher King]] is the guardian of four "hallows" representing the four elements: a dish (earth), Arthur's sword [[Excalibur]] (air), the [[Holy Lance]] or spear, baton, or a magic wand (fire), and the [[Holy Grail]] (water).&lt;ref name=Fisher_king&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uidaho.edu/student_orgs/arthurian_legend/grail/fisher/|date=April 1999|accessdate=23 January 2007|title=The Fisher King|publisher=University of Idaho|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210012424/http://www.uidaho.edu/student_orgs/arthurian_legend/grail/fisher/|archivedate=10 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hidden curriculum''' is a side effect of schooling, "[lessons] which are learned but not openly intended"&lt;ref name="Martin, Jane 1983"&gt;Martin, Jane. "What Should We Do with a Hidden Curriculum When We Find One?" The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 122&amp;ndash;139.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the transmission of norms, values, and beliefs conveyed in the classroom and the social environment.&lt;ref name="Giroux 1983"&gt;Giroux, Henry and Anthony Penna. "Social Education in the Classroom: The Dynamics of the Hidden Curriculum." The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 100&amp;ndash;121.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be mentioned that the breaktime is an important part of the hidden curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kaggelaris, N. - Koutsioumari, M. I. (2015), "The breaktime as part of the hidden curriculum in Public High School", ''Pedagogy theory &amp; praxis'' 8 (2015): 76-87 [https://www.academia.edu/22694046/_%CE%A4%CE%BF_%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B1_%CF%89%CF%82_%CE%BC%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%BA%CF%81%CF%85%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%8D_%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BB%CF%85%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%8D_%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82_%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF_%CE%94%CE%B7%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BF_%CE%93%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C_%CE%9B%CF%8D%CE%BA%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BF_%CE%95%CF%80%CE%B9%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%B1_%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%B1_%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF_1%CE%BF_%CE%93%CE%95%CE%9B_%CE%94%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%84%CF%83%CF%8E%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%82_%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9_%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF_3%CE%BF_%CE%93%CE%95%CE%9B_%CE%99%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85_The_breaktime_as_part_of_the_hidden_curriculum_in_Public_High_School_Pedagogy_theory_and_praxis_8_2015_76-87].&lt;/ref&gt;   


Any learning experience may teach unintended lessons.&lt;ref name="Martin, Jane 1983"/&gt; Hidden curriculum often refers to knowledge gained in primary and secondary school settings, usually with a negative connotation where the school strives for equal intellectual development (as a positive aim).&lt;ref&gt;Cornbleth, Catherine. "Beyond Hidden Curriculum?" Journal of Curriculum Studies. 16.1(1984): 29&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, a hidden curriculum reinforces existing social inequalities by educating students according to their class and [[social status]]. The unequal distribution of [[cultural capital]] in a society mirrors a corresponding distribution of knowledge among its students.&lt;ref name="Apple 1983"&gt;Apple, Michael and Nancy King. "What Do Schools Teach?" The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 82&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational history ==

Early workers in the field of education were influenced by the notion that the preservation of the social privileges, interests, and knowledge of one group within the population was worth the exploitation of less powerful groups.&lt;ref name="Apple 1983"/&gt; Over time this theory has become less blatant, yet its underlying tones remain a contributing factor to the issue of the hidden curriculum.

Several educational theories have been developed to help give meaning and structure to the hidden curriculum and to illustrate the role that schools play in [[socialization]]. Three of these theories, as cited by [[Henry Giroux]] and Anthony Penna, are a [[Structural functionalism|structural-functional]] view of schooling, a phenomenological view related to the "new" sociology of education, and a radical critical view corresponding to the [[neo-Marxist]] analysis of the theory and practice of education. The structural-functional view focuses on how norms and values are conveyed within schools and how their necessities for the functioning of society become indisputably accepted. The phenomenological view suggests that meaning is created through situational encounters and interactions, and it implies that knowledge is somewhat objective. The radical critical view recognizes the relationship between economic and cultural reproduction and stresses the relationships among the theory, ideology, and social practice of learning. Although the first two theories have contributed to the analysis of the hidden curriculum, the radical critical view of schooling provides the most insight.&lt;ref name="Giroux 1983"/&gt; Most importantly it acknowledges the perpetuated economic and social aspects of education that are clearly illustrated by the hidden curriculum.

==Aspects==

Various aspects of learning contribute to the success of the hidden curriculum, including practices, procedures, rules, relationships, and structures.&lt;ref name="Martin, Jane 1983"/&gt; Many school-specific sources, some of which may be included in these aspects of learning, give rise to important elements of the hidden curriculum. These sources may include, but are not limited to, the social structures of the classroom, the teacher's exercise of authority, rules governing the relationship between teachers and students, standard learning activities, the teacher's use of language, textbooks, audio-visual aids, furnishings, architecture, disciplinary measures, timetables, tracking systems, and curricular priorities.&lt;ref name="Martin, Jane 1983"/&gt; Variations among these sources promote the disparities found when comparing the hidden curricula corresponding to various class and social statuses. "Every school is both an expression of a political situation and a teacher of politics."&lt;ref name="GreatAtlantic1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Atlantic and Pacific School Conspiracy (Group)|title=Doing your own school: a practical guide to starting and operating a community school|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ws2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2013|year=1972|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-3172-8|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the actual material that students absorb through the hidden curriculum is of utmost importance, the personnel who convey it elicit special investigation. This particularly applies to the social and moral lessons conveyed by the hidden curriculum, for the moral characteristics and ideologies of teachers and other authority figures are translated into their lessons, albeit not necessarily with intention.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Lawrence. "The Moral Atmosphere of the School." The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 61&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet these unintended learning experiences can result from interactions with not only instructors, but also with peers. Like interactions with authority figures, interactions amongst peers can promote moral and social ideals but also foster the exchange of information and are thus important sources of knowledge contributing to the success of the hidden curriculum.

=== Heteronormativity ===
According to Merfat Ayesh Alsubaie, the hidden curriculum of [[heteronormativity]] is the erasure of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identities in the curriculum through the privileging of heterosexual identities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alsubaie|first=Merfat Ayesh|date=2015|title=Hidden Curriculum as One of Current Issue of Curriculum|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1083566.pdf|journal=Journal of Education and Practice|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a quote from Gust Yep, heteronormativity is the "presumption and assumption that all human experience is unquestionably and automatically heterosexual".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yep|first=Gust|date=2002|title=From homophobia and heterosexism to heteronormativity|pmid=24804596|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws such as "[[No promo homo laws|No Promo Homo]]" that prohibit the mention of or teaching about LGBTQ identities are considered to work to reinforce the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chesir-Teran|first=Daniel|date=2009|title=Heterosexism in high school and victimization among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning students|url=|journal=Journal of Youth &amp; Adolescence|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glsen.org/learn/policy/issues/nopromohomo|title="No Promo Homo" Laws|website=GLSEN|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to No Promo Homo laws, currently over half of the states in the U.S. are not legally mandated to have any [[Sex education|sexual education]]. According to Mary Preston, the lack of sexual education in schools removes LGBTQ identities from the explicit curriculum, and contributes to the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preston|first=Mary|date=2016|title=They're just not mature right now’: teachers' complicated perceptions of gender and anti-queer bullying|url=|journal=Sex Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When students fall outside the heterosexual norm in schools, some students and teachers have been shown to police students back in line with heteronormative expectations.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puchner|first=Laurel|date=2011|title=The right time and place? Middle school language arts teachers talk about not talking about sexual orientation|url=|journal=Equity and Excellence in Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. J. Pascoe said policing takes place through the use of bullying behaviors such as the use of words such as "fag, queer, or dyke" which are used to shame students with identities outside the norm. Pascoe said the use of LGBTQ slurs forms a "Fag Discourse." The "Fag Discourse" in schools upholds heteronormativity as sacred, works to silence LGBTQ voices and places LGBTQ identities to the hidden curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pascoe|first=C.J.|date=2005|title='Dude, you're a fag': Adolescent masculinity and the fag discourse|url=|journal=Sexualities|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

Although the hidden curriculum conveys a great deal of knowledge to its students, the inequality promoted through its disparities among classes and social statuses often invokes a negative connotation. For example, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] asserts that education-related capital must be accessible to promote academic achievement. The effectiveness of schools becomes limited when these forms of capital are unequally distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Edmumd W., Beatrice L. Bridglall, and Aundra Saa Meroe. Preface. Supplemental Education: The Hidden Curriculum of High Academic Achievement. By Gordon, Edmumd W., Beatrice L. Bridglall, and Aundra Saa Meroe. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2005. ix&amp;ndash;x.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the hidden curriculum is considered to be a form of education-related capital, it promotes this ineffectiveness of schools as a result of its unequal distribution. As a means of social control, the hidden curriculum promotes the acceptance of a social destiny without promoting rational and reflective consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Maxine. Introduction. The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. By Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 1&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Elizabeth Vallance, the functions of hidden curriculum include "the inculcation of values, political socialization, training in obedience and docility, the perpetuation of traditional class structure-functions that may be characterized generally as social control."&lt;ref&gt;Vallance, Elizabeth. "Hiding the Hidden Curriculum: An Interpretation of the Language of Justification in Nineteenth-Century Educational Reform." The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 9&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt; Hidden curriculum can also be associated with the reinforcement of social inequality, as evidenced by the development of different relationships to capital based on the types of work and work-related activities assigned to students varying by social class.&lt;ref&gt;Anyon, Jean. "Social Class and the Hidden Curriculum of Work." The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 143&amp;ndash;167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the hidden curriculum has negative connotations, it is not inherently negative, and the tacit factors that are involved can potentially exert a positive developmental force on students. Some educational approaches, such as [[democratic education]], actively seek to minimize, make explicit, and/ or reorient the hidden curriculum in such a way that it has a positive developmental impact on students. Similarly, in the fields of [[environmental education]] and [[education for sustainable development]], there has been some advocacy for making school environments more natural and sustainable, such that the tacit developmental forces that these physical factors exert on students can become positive factors in their development as environmental citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Earth in mind: On education, environment, and the human prospect|last=Orr|first=D.|publisher=Island Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Covelo, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainable education: Re-visioning learning and change|last=Sterling|first=S.|publisher=Green Books|year=2001|isbn=|location=Devon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher education and tracking ==

While studies on the hidden curriculum mostly focus on fundamental primary and secondary education, higher education also feels the effects of this latent knowledge. For example, gender biases become present in specific fields of study; the quality of and experiences associated with prior education become more significant; and class, gender, and race become more evident at higher levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Margolis, Eric]], Michael Soldatenko, Sandra Acker, and Marina Gair. "Peekaboo: Hiding and Outing the Curriculum." The Hidden Curriculum in Higher Education. Ed. Margolis, Eric. New York: Routledge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

One additional aspect of hidden curriculum that plays a major part in the development of students and their fates is [[Tracking (education)|tracking]]. This method of imposing educational and career paths upon students at young ages relies on various factors such as class and status to reinforce socioeconomic differences. Children tend to be placed on tracks guiding them towards socioeconomic occupations similar to that of their parents, without real considerations for their strengths and weaknesses. As students advance through the educational system, they follow along their tracks by completing the predetermined courses.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, James E. The Hidden Curriculum of High School Tracking. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, this is one of the main factors limiting [[social mobility]] in America today.

== Literary references ==

[[John Dewey]] explored the hidden curriculum of education in his early 20th century works, particularly his classic, ''[[Wikisource:Democracy and Education|Democracy and Education]]''. Dewey saw patterns evolving and trends developing in public schools which lent themselves to his pro-democratic perspectives. His work was quickly rebutted by educational theorist [[George Counts]], whose 1929 book, ''[[Dare the School Build a New Social Order?]]'' challenged the presumptive nature of Dewey's works. Where Dewey (and other [[child development]] theorists including [[Jean Piaget]], [[Erik Erikson]] and [[Maria Montessori]]) hypothesized a singular path through which all young people travelled in order to become adults, Counts recognized the reactive, adaptive, and multifaceted nature of learning. This nature caused many educators to slant their perspectives, practices, and assessments of student performance in particular directions which affected their students drastically.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Counts' examinations were expanded on by [[Charles A. Beard]], and later, [[Myles Horton]] as he created what became the [[Highlander Folk School]] in Tennessee.

The phrase "hidden curriculum" was reportedly coined by Philip W. Jackson (''Life In Classrooms'', 1968). He argued that we need to understand "[[education]]" as a [[socialization]] process.  Shortly after Jackson's coinage, [[MIT]]'s Benson Snyder published ''[[The Hidden Curriculum]],'' which addresses the question of why students&amp;mdash;even or especially the most gifted&amp;mdash;turn away from education.  Snyder advocates the thesis that much of campus conflict and students' personal anxiety is caused by a mass of unstated academic and social norms, which thwart the students' ability to develop independently or think creatively.

The hidden curriculum has been further explored by a number of educators. Starting with ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', published in 1972, through the late 1990s, Brazilian educator [[Paulo Freire]] explored various effects of presumptive teaching on students, schools, and society as a whole. Freire's explorations were in sync with those of [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]] and [[Ivan Illich]], each of whom were quickly identified as radical educators. Other theorists who have identified the insidious nature of hidden curricula and hidden agendas include [[Neil Postman]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Joel Spring]], [[John Taylor Gatto]], and others.

More recent definitions were given by Roland Meighan ("A Sociology of Education", 1981):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hidden curriculum is taught by the school, not by any teacher...something is coming across to the pupils which may never be spoken in the English lesson or prayed about in assembly. They are picking-up an approach to living and an attitude to learning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and Michael Haralambos ("Sociology: Themes and Perspectives", 1991):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hidden curriculum consists of those things pupils learn through the experience of attending school rather than the stated educational objectives of such institutions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Educational critics [[Henry Giroux]],&lt;ref name="Giroux 1983"/&gt; [[bell hooks]], and [[Jonathan Kozol]] also have examined the effects of hidden curriculum.

[[Developmental psychologist]] [[Robert Kegan]] addressed the hidden curriculum of everyday life in his 1994 book ''[[Robert Kegan#In Over Our Heads|In Over Our Heads]]'', which focused on the relation between [[cognitive development]] and the "cognitive demands" of cultural expectations.

Professor of communication [[Joseph Turow]], in his 2017 book ''The Aisles Have Eyes'', used the concept to describe acculturation to massive personal [[data collection]]; he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turow |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Turow |date=2017 |title=The aisles have eyes: how retailers track your shopping, strip your privacy, and define your power |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=9780300212198 |oclc=959871776}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The very activities that dismay privacy and anti-discrimination advocates are already beginning to become everyday habits in American lives, and part of Americans' cultural routines. Retailing is at the leading edge of a new ''hidden curriculum'' for American society—teaching people what they have to give up in order to get along in the twenty-first century.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Jacob (Francisco de Zurbarán).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Jacob'' by Zurbarán]]
'''''Jacob and his twelve sons''''' is a series of thirteen paintings by Spanish artist Francisco de [[Zurbarán]]. 

The series of life-size portraits was painted between 1641 and 1658.&lt;ref&gt;Gállego, Julián; Gudiol, José (1987). ''Zurbarán''. London: Alpine Fine Arts Collection, Ltd. pp. 353–354. {{ISBN|0-88168-115-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve of the thirteen paintings are in [[Auckland Castle]], [[Bishop Auckland]], England, and one is in [[Grimsthorpe Castle]], [[Lincolnshire]].

The series traveled to the Americas for the first time in 2016, to be displayed at the [[Meadows Museum]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], from 17 September 2017 until 7 January 2018, and then in New York City at the [[Frick Collection]] from 31 January until 22 April 2018.&lt;ref name=BrownFirst&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Mark|title=Zurbarán masterpieces to leave UK for US for the first time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/31/zurbaran-masterpieces-leave-uk-united-states-first-time-auckland-castle|accessdate=31 July 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Paintings==
The depiction of Jacob and his sons in epic portraits in unusual for the era. More commonly, artists, including [[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]] and [[Velázquez]], included these men in narrative painting of Biblical episodes.&lt;ref name=BaticleZurbaran/&gt; According to art historian Jeannine Baticle, a series of Jacob and his sons  survives in the possession of the Orden Tercera de San Francisco in [[Lima, Peru]], which she describes as a "fairly close replica" of the Auckland Zurbarán series.  An additional series, "a more distant and awkward imitation" by an imitator, is in the possession of the Academia de Bellas Artes in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico.&lt;ref name=BaticleZurbaran/&gt;

==History==
It is not known how the paintings reached England, although some speculate that they may have been captured by English pirates while traveling from the painter's studio in [[Seville]] to a buyer in a Spanish colony in the Americas.&lt;ref name=BaticleZurbaran&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baticle|first1=Jeannine|title=Zurbarán|date=1987|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=0870995022|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The series is first recorded in 1722 as part of the estate of one William Chapman.&lt;ref name=BaticleZurbaran/&gt;  It was later owned by London Banker [[James Mendez]], whose heirs sold twelve of the thirteen to [[Richard Trevor (bishop)|Richard Trevor, Bishop of Durham]] in 1756 for [[Pound sign|£]]125. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebowesmuseum.org.uk/Collections/ResearchScholarship/SpanishSymposium.aspx www.thebowesmuseum.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Trevor, a political liberal and a backer of the [[Jewish Naturalization Act 1753]], acquired the paintings, and redesigned and reconstructed the Long Dining Room at Auckland Palace, as a public statement of his support for Jewish naturalization rights.&lt;ref name=MuirBishopsPalace&gt;{{cite news|last1=Appelbaum|first1=[[Diana Muir]]|title=Jacob's Sons in the Bishop's Palace|url=http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/5364/features/jacobs-sons/|accessdate=1 August 2016|publisher=[[Jewish Ideas Daily]]|date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the Bill was quickly repealed, the paintings still hang in the Long Dining at Auckland.&lt;ref name=MuirBishopsPalace/&gt;

The portrait of one of Jacob's sons, [[Benjamin]], was sold separately to the [[Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven]];&lt;ref name=BaticleZurbaran/&gt; it hangs in [[Grimsthorpe Castle]], [[Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref name="MorrisZurbaran"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Roderick|title=Master of Light Leaps From the Shadows|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/arts/international/master-of-light-leaps-from-the-shadows.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 August 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bishop Trevor commissioned [[Arthur Pond]] to produce a copy painting of "Benjamin".  It hangs, with Jacob and the other eleven sons, in the Castle's Long Dining Room, which Bishop Trevor rebuilt for the purpose of displaying the pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2001 the [[Church Commissioners]] voted to sell the paintings, a decision that was revoked in 2011 following a donation of £15 million by investment manager and philanthropist [[Jonathan Ruffer]]; new arrangements placed the paintings, along with the castle, under the Auckland Castle Trust, making them available to the public after centuries during which they hung in a private home where they could be seen only by invited guests or by special arrangement with the Bishop's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

In the [[English language]], the expression "'''Japanese puzzle'''" usually refers to [[logic puzzle]]s, which (at least in the past) have been more popular in [[Japan]] than in the West, where [[word game]]s dominate.

The largest publisher of [[puzzle]]s in Japan is currently [[Nikoli (publisher)|Nikoli]]; see the associated article for more information.

The Joshua Project maintains [[Ethnic group|ethnologic]] data to support [[Christian missions]] and is based in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], United States. The project began in 1995 within the former [[AD2000]] and Beyond Movement. From 2001 through 2005 the Joshua Project was at different times informally connected with Caleb Project, ICTA and World Help. In 2006, the Joshua Project officially became part of the [[U.S. Center for World Mission]], now called the [[Venture Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.frontierventures.org/ministries/joshua-project frontierventures.org, Joshua Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], the project maintains a database of "[[Unreached people group|unreached peoples]]" listed by country and language. As of 2010, they list 9,803 ethnic groups. These are further divided into 16,350 peoples-by-countries, counting national minorities individually for each of 236 countries, of which 6,642 are classified as "unreached peoples". Ethnic groups are organized hierarchically in 251 "People Clusters" which in turn are divided in 16 "Affinity Blocs" ([[Arab World]], [[East Asians]], [[Eurasia]]ns, [[Cushitic|Horn of Africa-Cushitic]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian-Median]], [[Jews]], [[Latin America#Ethnic groups|Latin-Caribbean Americans]], [[Malay peoples]], [[Demographics of North America|North American peoples]], [[Pacific Islanders]], [[South Asians]], [[Southeast Asians]], [[Sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Ethnic groups in Asia#Central Asia|Tibetan / Himalayan peoples]], [[Turkic peoples]] and Unclassified). Each ethnicity is listed as speaking at least one of 6,510 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joshua Project |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/great-commission-statistics.php |title=Great Commission Statistics |publisher=Joshua Project |date= |accessdate=2010-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplegroups.org/Documents/26-6-joshua-project.pdf peoplegroups.org, Joshua Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/joshua-project Mission Frontiers Joshua Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Enlightened despot''' (also called '''benevolent despot''') is an [[authoritarian]] or non-[[Democracy|democratic]] leader who exercises his political power for the benefit of the people, rather than exclusively for themselves or for an elite or small portion of the people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/topic/enlightened-despotism&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically they were [[monarch]]s using enlightened ideas and principles in order to enhance the central government's power (thereby their own power).{{sfn|Perry|Chase|Jacob|2015|p=442}} Most were directly linked to [[the Enlightenment]] period in the [[18th century|18th]] and early [[19th century|19th centuries]].

==Characteristics==
{{main article|Enlightened absolutism}}
Enlightened despots were monarchs who distinguished themselves from [[despotism|despots]] (in the ordinary sense) by the way they governed; they claimed to rule for the well-being of their subjects. For example, an enlightened despot may focus government priorities on matters of public importance such as [[healthcare]], [[education]], nonviolent population control, or physical infrastructure. He or she may be committed to [[peace]]ful relations and may even allow for some democratic decision-making to exist, such as public [[referendum|referendums,]] but did not propose reforms that would undermine their sovereignty or disrupt social order. As [[John Stuart Mill]] articulated: "Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement."{{sfn|Mill|1989|p=13}}

Although their reigns were based upon Enlightenment principles, their beliefs about royal power were similar to those of regular despots. Enlightened despots believed that they were destined to be ruler the moment they were born.

Enlightened rulers may have played a part in the abolition of serfdom in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Disappearance of Serfdom. France. England. Italy. Germany. Spain.|url = http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/S/SLA/slavery-12.html|website = www.1902encyclopedia.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] once said: "Everything for the people, nothing by the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.habsburger.net/en/chapter/joseph-ii-long-awaited-son |title=Joseph II: The long-awaited son |author=World of the Habsburgs |work=Textmode |publisher=World of the Habsburgs |accessdate=2015-10-21 |quote=‘Everything for the people, nothing by the people’ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most dictatorial regimes portray themselves as enlightened and often tend to regard democratic regimes as messy, inefficient, and corrupt. Additionally, many dictators may attempt to openly spread misinformation about their enlightenment, real or assumed, in an attempt to create a [[personality cult]].

In the Spanish language the word ''[[dictablanda]]'' is sometimes used for a dictatorship that preserves some of the liberties and mechanisms of democracy.

==Famous enlightened despots==
The most famous enlightened despots in history were:

===Enlightened despots in recent history===
Like many [[political]] classifications, the title of enlightened despot suffers from its inherent subjectivity. In recent history dictators such as [[Lee Kuan Yew]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], [[António Salazar]], [[Isaias Afwerki]], [[Park Chung-hee]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Pervez Musharraf]], [[Thomas Sankara]], and [[Muammar Gaddafi]] can be characterized as enlightened despots. In all of these cases the point of view as to just how "enlightened" or "dictatorial" they are is largely subjective.

Generally, dictators who serve in office for a very long period are more likely to be regarded as enlightened because they will often be forced to pay some attention to the public interest in order to remain in power and, more importantly, to be regarded as [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]]. Dictators who hold office for a brief period of time or are simply members of a rotating dictatorial elite (such as those heading some [[Totalitarianism|juntas]]) may have less [[charismatic authority]] and prove to be forgettable and are therefore often easier to demonize. In the cases of dictators such as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi their enlightened qualities became apparent only in the wake of the breakdown of state institutions and persecution of religious and ethnic minorities that followed their removal from power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/3o5p19/some_people_contend_the_middle_east_is_better_off/ Neutral Politics]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|West London Free School}}

The '''London Free School''' ('''LFS''') was founded on 8 March 1966, principally by [[John Hopkins (political activist)|John "Hoppy" Hopkins]] and [[Rhaune Laslett]].

== Description ==

The London Free School was a community action adult education project inspired by American free universities (and the Victorian Jewish Free School in Spitalfields). The organisers have been described as an "anarchic temporary coalition" of the old guard [[New Left]] and [[CND]] housing activists from the [[Rachman]] days and the new [[beatnik]]/[[hippy]] generation. The former included [[George Clark (activist)|George Clark]] of the Notting Hill Community Workshop, Richard Hauser (who ran a community scheme after the [[1958 Notting Hill race riots|1958 riots]]), Rhaune and Jim Laslett-O’Brien, Bill Richardson of the Powis and Colville Residents Association, Andre and Barbara Shervington.

To varying degrees of involvement, the hippy contingent numbered John Hopkins, [[Michael X]], Courtney Tulloch (''[[International Times|IT]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Phillips (writer)|Mike Phillips]], [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/dec/13/guardianobituaries.obituaries1 ''Guardian'' obituary - Courtney Tulloch, 13 December 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd Hunter, [[Peter Jenner]] (who was just starting to manage Pink Floyd), [[Joe Boyd]] of [[Elektra Records]] and UFO, [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[John Michell]], [[Julie Felix]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], Mike McInnerney ([[Tommy (album)|''Tommy'' artist]]), Graham Keen (''IT''), [[Neil Oram]] (The Warp), Dave Tomlin (''[[International Times|IT]]''), [[Felix de Mendelssohn]] (''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain|Children of Albion]]''), [[Nigel Waymouth]] of [[Granny Takes a Trip]], [[John Esam]], [[Alexander Trocchi]], the jazz writer Ron Atkins, the [[Warhol]] star [[Kate Heliczer]], [[Harvey Matusow]] (the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy witchtrials]] saboteur), [[R. D. Laing]] and "the Belsize Park shrinks", [[Emily Young]], [[Anjelica Huston]] and [[Pink Floyd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytalk.org/Notting%20Hill%20History%20Timeline/timelinechap10.pdf An historical and psychogeographical report on Notting Hill] compiled by Tom Vague for HISTORYtalk.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeff Nuttall, "Ultimately the Free School did nothing but put out a local underground newsletter and organise the 2 Notting Hill Gate Festivals, which were, admittedly, models of exactly how the arts should operate – festive, friendly, audacious, a little mad and all taking place on demolition sites, in the streets, and in a magnificently institutional church hall."&lt;ref name="Vague2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Vague|title=Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate: A West London Psychogeography Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2xvCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT230|date=1 October 2012|publisher=Bread and Circuses|isbn=978-1-62517-202-0|pages=230–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this opinion, the formation of "The Notting Hill Neighbourhood Service" (one of the first centres to offer drug and legal advice in London),the [[Notting Hill Carnival]], the ''[[International Times]]'' and the [[UFO Club]] all emerged from the brief life of the LFS.

Also significant was the early development of [[Pink Floyd]], who played at [[All Saints Notting Hill|All Saints Church Hall]], initially as part of The Notting Hill Fayre (Carnival), and then a series of fund-raising concerts for the LFS. These were among the earliest gigs by the band, coming between their Spontaneous Underground period at [[The Marquee]] and the start of the UFO club.&lt;ref&gt;"Echoes: the complete history of Pink Floyd" By Glenn Povey.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MAC Cosmetics''', stylized as '''M·A·C''', is a cosmetics manufacturer founded in [[Toronto]], Canada in 1984 by Frank Toskan and Frank Angelo. The company is headquartered in [[New York City]] and became part of the [[Estée Lauder Companies]] in 1998. MAC is an acronym for ''Make-up Art Cosmetics''.

==Background==
During his time as a photographer and makeup artist, co-founder Frank Toskan realized the lack of suitable colours and textures needed to maximize performance and result of makeup for these industries. Further, he realized how limited conventional products in the cosmetic industry were to responding to the needs of the modern woman. For the first time ethnicity in makeup was addressed. Toskan began to craft a niche market in the world of makeup. Family joined forces including brother-in-law and chemist Victor Casale. The Franks created the brand that was “by makeup artists for makeup artist.” They were also were known for creating many vivid and rich colours, for every skin tone, focusing on darker skin tones.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benoit |first1=Andrea |title=An Advertising World Gone Completely Haywire: MAC VIVA GLAM. |journal=Advertising &amp; Society Review |date=2014 |volume=15 |issue=1 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/541385}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAC very quickly cultivated a following in both the fashion and the retail markets, and was responsible for creating many trends.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"/&gt; Initially sold exclusively at the BAY in Canada it quickly expanded to Henry Bendel in New York. [[Nordstrom]] department stores welcomed the brand soon after marking MAC's first foray into the mass North American retail market [[Saks Fifth Avenue|Saks]], [[Macy's]], [[Dillard's]], and [[Bloomingdale's]] rapidly followed suit as well as dozens of MAC owned stand alone stores. Unsolicited celebrity endorsement was key to MAC's success as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Mariah Carey]],  [[Princess Diana]], [[Linda Evangelista]], [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Cher]], and [[Janet Jackson]] embraced this new world of makeup art. MAC continues to be the leader in creative cosmetic innovation worldwide.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The company's products were originally intended for makeup professionals, but are sold directly to consumers worldwide. Frank Toskan stated that he "first manufactured makeup for models, but then the models wanted this makeup for their sisters, friends, and so on... ".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = MAC, cosmétiquement correctLa marque canadienne aux grandes causes va s'implanter en France.|url = http://www.liberation.fr/economie/0101149156-mac-cosmetiquement-correctla-marque-canadienne-aux-grandes-causes-va-s-implanter-en-france|website = Libération.fr|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the brand continues to work with  in fashion show professionals: "From a niche brand [mainly for photo or film], MAC has become a global brand."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Résultats recherche lesechos.fr|url = http://archives.lesechos.fr/archives/2012/LesEchos/21115-102-ECH.htm|website = Les Echos.fr|access-date = 2016-02-20|language = fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the brand had over a hundred stores worldwide, earning 200 million [[French franc|francs]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The development of the brand internationally, the opening of new points of sale, and the adaptation of product lines tailored to each continent, left little time for the founders to create new products. In 1994, the company Estée Lauder took control of 51% of shares of MAC Cosmetics and began managing the business end&lt;ref name="Schiro"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Frank Angelo, 49, Cosmetics Innovator, Dies|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/17/us/frank-angelo-49-cosmetics-innovator-dies.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1997-01-17|access-date = 2016-02-20|issn = 0362-4331|first = Anne-marie|last = Schiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the two founders retained creative control. In 1997, co-founder Frank Angelo died of [[cardiac arrest]] during surgery at the age of 49.&lt;ref name="Schiro"/&gt; At that time, MAC had a [[revenue]] of US $250 million, which doubled ten years later.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Estée Lauder Inc. completed the acquisition in 1998, and Frank Toskan decided to sell his remaining shares shortly thereafter before leaving the company at the end of the same year.

MAC Cosmetics is named one of the top three global makeup brands, with an annual turnover of over $1 billion, and 500 independent stores, with over thirty stores in France. All stores are run by professional makeup artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = MAC Cosmetics s'offre une vitrine sur les Champs-Elysées|url = http://archives.lesechos.fr/archives/2012/LesEchos/21115-102-ECH.htm|website = lesechos.fr|access-date = 2016-02-20|language = fr-FR|first = Dominique|last = Chapuis}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAC is an official makeup brand, used to create makeup for movie actors. The most popular products by the brand are Studio Fix Powder Foundation and Gigablack lash mascara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAC absolute bestsellers |url=https://www.maccosmetics.com/bestsellers |date=February 2018 |publisher=MAC Cosmetics Official}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular lip product by this brand is Viva Glam Lipstick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glam Lipstick by MAC: About |url=https://glamlipstick.com/glam-lipstick-by-mac-review-swatches.html |date=March 2018 |publisher=GlamLipstick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became popular due to smooth formula and rich pigmentation. The lipstick was released in 2014.

In September 2016,  MAC Cosmetics launched the "MAC Selena" collection in collaboration with the estate of [[Selena|Selena Quintanilla Perez]]. A petition on Change.org proposed the idea of this collaboration to MAC Cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2016/09/123386/selena-mac-collection-latina-women-importance|title=Why MAC's Selena Collection Is SO Important For Latinas|website=refinery29.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selena's sister, Suzette Quintanilla, worked with MAC to create the perfect collection that really represented Selena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressnews.com/lifestyle/article/MAC-releases-Selena-makeup-collection-this-week-9289687.php|title=MAC releases Selena makeup collection this week|website=expressnews.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection sold out within hours not only at MAC stores but also at other retailers that carried the collection such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, and Macy's. Fans stood in line for hours to get their hands on the collection but some did walk away empty handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2016/11/04/latinas-behind-growth-in-cosmetic-sales-sold-out-selena-makeup-line/|title=Latinas behind growth in cosmetic sales, sold out Selena makeup line - Cronkite News|date=4 November 2016|website=azpbs.org|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high demand for this collection, MAC restocked the collection in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciarretto|first1=Amy|title=Is The MAC x Selena Restock Sold Out?

In September 2018, fans started a petition on [[Change.org]] to ask MAC Cosmetics to collaborate with the estate of the late British singer [[Amy Winehouse]] for her own make-up collection; "MAC Amy Winehouse". After seeing other late female artists [[Selena]] and [[Aaliyah]] getting their own posthumous lines, fans stated; "Amy Winehouse's image alone inspires so many looks and trends today and has had a massive impact in women, as well as the society we live in." It has been said that the proceeds would go towards the [[Amy Winehouse Foundation]]; which raises awareness and helps young vulnerable people struggling with drug/alcohol addiction, as well as mental health issues.

==MAC AIDS Fund== 
{{main|Mac AIDS Fund}}

The MAC AIDS Fund was established in 1994 to support men, women, and children affected by [[HIV/AIDS]] globally by addressing the link between [[poverty]] and HIV/AIDS. According to MAC Cosmetics, the fund has raised over $400 million through the sale of MAC's Viva Glam Lipsticks and Lipglosses, donating 100% of the sale price to fight HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.maccosmetics.com.au/viva-glam-mac-aids-fund&lt;/ref&gt; The Viva Glam product line has been a best-seller for the MAC Cosmetics brand.&lt;ref&gt;[[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (November 14, 2014).

The '''Majorelle Garden''' ({{lang-fr|Jardin Majorelle}}, {{lang-ar|حديقة ماجوريل}} hadiqat mmajuril, {{lang-ber|ⵓⵔⵜⵉ ⵎⴰⵊⵓⵔⵉⵍ}} urti majuril) is a two and half acre [[botanical garden]] and artist's [[landscape garden]] in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]]. It was created by the French Orientalist artist, [[Jacques Majorelle]] over almost forty years, starting in 1923, and features a Cubist villa designed by the French architect, Paul Sinoir in the 1930s. The property was the residence of the artist and his wife from 1923 until their divorce in the 1950s. In the 1980s, the property was purchased by the fashion designers, [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] and [[Pierre Bergé]] who worked to restore it. Today, the garden and villa complex is open to the public. The villa houses the '''Islamic Art Museum''' of Marrakech, the '''Berber Museum''' and has recently opened the '''Musee Yves Saint Laurent.'''

==History==
[[File:Majorelle Garden.jpg|thumb|Majorelle Garden's [[cactus]] collection, with Villa in the background]]
The Majorelle Garden was designed by the French artist, Jacques Majorelle (1886-1962), son of the [[Art Nouveau]] ''[[ébéniste]]'' (cabinet-maker) of Nancy, [[Louis Majorelle]]. As a young aspiring painter, Jacques Majorelle was sent to Morocco in around 1917 to convalesce from a serious medical condition. After spending a short time in Casablanca, he travelled to Marrakech and like many of his contemporaries, fell in love with the vibrant colours and street life he found there. After travelling around North Africa and the Mediterranean, he eventually decided to settle permanently in Marrakech. &lt;ref&gt;Marcilhac, F., ''La Vie et l'Oeuvre de Jacques Majorelle: 1886-1962,'' [The Orientalists Volume 7], ARC Internationale edition, 1988, pp 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, just four years after his marriage to Andrée Longueville, Majorelle purchased a four-acre plot, situated on the border of a palm grove in Marrakech and built a house in the Mooroccan style. In 1931, he commissioned the architect, Paul Sinoir, to design a Cubist villa for the property. Gradually, he purchased additional land, extending his holding by some 10 acres. In the grounds around the residence, Majorelle began planting a luxuriant garden which would become known as the ''Jardins Majorelle'' (Majorelle Garden). The garden became his life's work and he devoted himself to developing it for almost forty years.&lt;ref&gt;Jardin Majorelle, ''Biography- Jacques Majorelle,'' Online: http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/jacques-majorelle-in-morocco/&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden proved costly to run and in 1947, Majorelle opened the garden to the public with an admission fee designed to defray the cost of maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;"Jacques Majorelle," ''Atlas Elite Magazine International,'' 10 July 2017, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; At times, he sold off parcels of land to fund the growing garden. Following his divorce in the 1950s, Majorelle was forced to sell the house and land. After this, the garden was neglected and fell into disrepair. The garden and villa were rediscovered in the 1980s, by fashion designers, [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] and [[Pierre Bergé]] who set about restoring it and saving it.&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on Jacques Majorelle,'' 2003, https://web.archive.org/web/20081122043640/http://www.painterskeys.com/clickbacks/majorelle.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marrakech Majorelle Garden 2011.jpg|thumb|An example of Majorelle Blue from the house in the garden]]
During his lifetime, Majorelle earned a reputation as a celebrated Orientalist painter. Though Majorelle's watercolors are largely forgotten today, the gardens remain as his creative masterpiece. The special shade of bold cobalt blue, inspired by the coloured tiles he had seen around Marrakech and in Berber burn-houses, was used extensively in the garden and its buildings and is named after him, ''[[Majorelle Blue|bleu Majorelle]]''—Majorelle Blue.&lt;ref name=aat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.articlesandtexticles.co.uk/2006/10/25/painters-i-should-have-known-about-007-jacques-majorelle/ |title=Painters I Should Have Known About (007) Jacques Majorelle |work=Articles &amp; Texticles |year=2007 |accessdate=28 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902084956/http://www.articlesandtexticles.co.uk/2006/10/25/painters-i-should-have-known-about-007-jacques-majorelle/ |archivedate=2 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.painterskeys.com/clickbacks/majorelle.asp |work=The Painter's Keys |title=Jacques Majorelle |date=18 November 2003 |accessdate=13 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122043640/http://www.painterskeys.com/clickbacks/majorelle.asp |archivedate=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his death, Majorelle patented the colour which carries his name.

==Gardens and complex==
The gardens and buildings form a complex, where specific buildings are dedicated to various museums and exhibits of interest to visitors. The gardens, which cover two and half acres, are open to the public daily and house an important collection of cacti and sculpture. The villa is home to the '''[[Berbers|Berber]] Museum''' and also features a collection of Majorelle's paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Foundation Jardin Majorelle, ''Le Cahiers de Musee Berbere,'' [English version], 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Majorelle's former studio workshop has become the location of the '''Islamic Art Museum of Marrakech''' which features a collection of North African textiles from Saint-Laurent's personal collection as well as ceramics and jewelry. &lt;ref name=JM&gt;{{cite web|title=Bienvenue au Jardin Majorelle|url=http://www.jardinmajorelle.com/|publisher=Jardin Majorelle|accessdate=28 March 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Development of the garden complex is ongoing. Profits from the gardens are used to fund new projects. In October 2017, the '''Musee Yves Saint Laurent''' was opened to the public as a tribute to the designer's legacy and his links with Marrakech. &lt;ref&gt;Panguang, J.C., "In Marrakesh, a New Museum Celebrates Yves Saint Laurent," ''New York Times,'' 21 August, 2017, &lt;Online: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/t-magazine/fashion/yves-saint-laurent-museum-marrakesh.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The gardens are a major tourist drawcard in Marrakech, attracting more than 700,000 visitors annually. &lt;ref&gt;Foundation Jardin Majorelle, Online: http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/fondation-jardin-majorelle/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation and management==
Since 2010, the property has been owned by the Foundation Pierre Bergé – Yves Saint Laurent, a French not-for-profit organisation and since 2011 has been managed by the Foundation Jardin Majorelle, a recognized non-profit organization in Marrakech.&lt;ref&gt;Foundation Jardin Majorelle, Online: http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/fondation-jardin-majorelle/&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Bergé was the director of the Garden's Foundation until his death in September, 2017. &lt;ref&gt;Diderich, J., "Pierre Bergé Ties the Knot With Madison Cox," ''WWD,'' 4 May, 2017; Howell, V., "Pierre Bergé Obituary," ''The Guardian'' (UK),Online: https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/10/pierre-berge-obituary&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden hosts more than 15 bird species that are endemic to North Africa. It has many fountains, and a notable collection of cacti.&lt;ref name=aat/&gt;

==Yves Saint-Laurent==
The garden was owned by [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] and [[Pierre Bergé]] between 1980 and 2008. After Yves Saint Laurent died in 2008 his ashes were scattered in the Majorelle Garden.&lt;ref name="YSLashes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-pb-ysl.net/en/History-399.html|title=Love 1936-2008|work=Fondation Pierre Bergé - Yves Saint Laurent|year=2008|accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Metzendorf-Woxdorf head of burial''' is the [[Neolithic]] [[burial]] of a single [[human]] [[skull]] that was found in 1958 in the [[Seevetal]] district of Woxdorf, in [[Harburg (district)|Harburg]], in [[Lower Saxony]]. The find is currently the only one of its kind of the Single Grave Culture ([[German Language|German]]: {{lang|de|Einzelgrabkultur}}) in [[Germany]] and is in the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic Death, Show case no. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Articus"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Articus | first1 =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication - Helms-Museum  | volume =103 | edition = | year =2013 | location = Hamburg | pages =78 | isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

Even before the discovery of the head burial numerous [[Feature (archaeology)|archaeological finds]] were made in the vicinity due to intensive agricultural land use. The find spot, was located at {{coord|53.408732|9.958667|type:landmark_region:DE-NI|display=inline,title}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi | title = Eine Schädelbestattung der Einzelgrabkultur | journal = Nachrichten aus Niedersachsens Urgeschichte | volume = 29 | year = 1960 | issn = 0342-1406 | pages = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a flat hilltop between two [[Field (agriculture)|fields]] which has not been used for agriculture. The Metzendorf-Woxdorf head burial has been discovered during levelling work, while taking off [[soil]] of the hill with a [[bulldozer]] for a pipeline for the local the Metzendorf water supply association. The workers noticed broken [[ceramic]] sherds in the plained soil. They stopped their work on this site and reported their discovery to the Helms-Museum. During the following [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]], a large, upside stored giant beaker ([[German Language|German]]: {{lang|de|Riesenbecher}}) was uncovered in a depth of {{convert|30|cm|in}}, the vessel floor and wall was broken by the levelling work. The giant beaker was put over a foot shell ([[German Language|German]]: {{lang|de|Fußschale}}) which contains the remnains of a single human skull.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1960"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi | title = Eine Schädelbestattung der Einzelgrabkultur | journal = Nachrichten aus Niedersachsens Urgeschichte | volume = 29 | year = 1960 | issn = 0342-1406 | pages = 6–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==
[[File:Schädelbestattung Metzendorf-Woxdorf Zeichnung.jpg|thumb|Graphic reconstruction of the burial [[in situ]]]]
The foot shell was placed on three smaller stones. It was made from a greyish brown clay having a height of {{convert|105|mm|in}} and diameters of {{convert|83|mm|in}} at the stand and {{convert|207|mm|in}} at its mouth. The outside wall of the vessel is irregularly decorated with {{convert|23|mm|in}} long parallel impressions of a comb-like tool. Inside, the foot shell was filled up to a height of two-thirds with [[humus]] soil on which the skull lay. The giant beaker was placed upside down over the cup. The retracted walls below the mouth of the vessel were carefully framed with larger stones. The giant beaker consists of a brownish-gray to reddish-brown clay. It has a height of {{convert|425|mm|in}} with diameters of about {{convert|97|mm|in}} at the base and {{convert|240|mm|in}} at the mouth. Its largest diameter is {{convert|195|mm|in}} to {{convert|210|mm|in}} at a height of {{convert|265|mm|in}} from the base. The shards of the damaged vessels base could not be recovered. Below the vessels rim, the vessel is decorated with an irregular series of small triangular recesses, whose tips are directed downward. Prior to its discovery the vessel and its interior was intact but it has been damaged with the bulldozer.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1960"/&gt; The shape of the giant beaker corresponds to the Bentheim group, defined by Karl Hermann Jacob Friesen,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Karl Hermann | last = Jacob-Friesen | title = Einführung in Niedersachsens Urgeschichte | publisher = Lax | location = Hildesheim | year = 1959 | pages = Fig. 156, 157 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this vessel stands out because of its size. Wegewitz interprets the giant beaker as storage vessel. The skull has been preserved from its [[cranium]] to the [[ear bone]]s and [[nasal bone]], while the [[facial skeleton]] and [[jaw]]s were probably decomposed after the funeral. The closed air space inside the large vessel favoured the preservation of the skull as opposed to being stored in well-aerated sandy soil at the site. In the earthy filling of the foot shell a few remains of [[tooth enamel]] were found. Due to its small amount Wegewitz suspected that at the times of the funeral only the head and upper jaw were present while the [[lower jaw]] and [[cervical vertebrae]] were already lost. The skull was [[anthropology|anthropologically]] determined as most likely that of an [[adult]] [[male]]. Whether the burial was dug in a pit into the ground or settled above the ground could not be determined due to lack of soil discolouration at site. Likewise, it remains unclear whether the head burial was created in close proximity to a possibly nearby or lost full body burial.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1960"/&gt;

Due to [[Typology (archaeology)|typological]] determination of the ceramic vessels the Metzendorf-Woxdorf head burial was [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dated]] to the [[Chalcolithic Europe|chalcolithic period]], around 2200 BCE.&lt;ref name="Articus"/&gt;

== Interpretation ==
The [[funeral]] of a single [[Human head]], separated from his [[Human body|body]] is, unique for the [[northern Germany|northern German]] Neolithic so far, it suggests cultural influences from [[Bronze Age|early Bronze Age]] [[Bohemia]], where such separate head burials in ceramic vessels with their bodies buried underneath were common at the same time.&lt;ref name="Laux_1995"&gt;{{citation | last = Laux | first = Friedrich | authorlink = |title= Schädelbestattung aus Metzendorf-Woxdorf, Gem. Seevetal, Ldkr. Harburg | editor = Ralf Busch |type= Fund und Deutung -  Alte und neue Funde aus den archäologischen Sammlungen | publisher = Hamburger Museum für Archäologie und die Geschichte Harburgs Helms-Museum | location = Hamburg-Harburg | year = 1995 | pages = 28–29 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, giant beakers similar to the Metzendorf-Woxdorf type were widely used there.&lt;ref name="Articus"/&gt; Similar archaeological finds of giant beakers are known from the [[Lüchow-Dannenberg|Hannoversches Wendland]] along the river [[Elbe]] supporting the theory of cultural ties to Bohemia, but the vessels found in Wendland were always found without content, so that the use as a funeral vessel here appears unlikely.&lt;ref name="Laux_1995"/&gt;

'''''Mis amigos de siempre''''' ({{lang-en|My lifelong friends}}) is an Argentine telenovela produced by [[Pol-Ka]] and aired by [[El Trece]]. The main actors are [[Nicolás Cabré]], [[Gonzalo Heredia]], [[Nicolás Vázquez]], [[Calu Rivero]], [[Agustina Cherri]], and [[Emilia Attías]]. It began as a comedy, and switched to the [[police procedural]] genre. The program did not get enough support, and was cancelled. The last program was aired on August 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://personajes.lanacion.com.ar/1716224-mis-amigos-de-siempre-asi-llega-a-su-fin-una-historia-sin-ton-ni-son|title= Mis amigos de siempre: así llega a su fin una historia sin ton ni son|trans-title=Mis amigos de siempre: so it ends a confusing story|author=  Silvina Ajmat|language= Spanish |date= August 8, 2014|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Julián ([[Gonzalo Heredia]]), Manuel ([[Nicolás Vázquez]]), and Simón ([[Nicolás Cabré]]) are a group of friends since childhood who spent many years at a local [[sports club]]. They meet again after a decade without seeing each other, and try to save the sports club from bankruptcy. They find out that if the club wins a certain tournament, the award will provide the economic support needed to pay the club's debts.

==Production==
Pol-ka had a difficult year in 2012, as most of its productions had poor ratings against ''[[Graduados]]'', the telenovela from the rival channel [[Telefe]]. Their 2013 productions had a better reception, and ''[[Solamente Vos]]'' and ''[[Farsantes]]'' got the highest ratings. ''Mis amigos de siempre'', the production for the 2014 season, includes several actors who had not worked in Argentine television  for some time, such as the senior actors [[Soledad Silveyra]] and [[Osvaldo Laport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://personajes.lanacion.com.ar/1634581-difunden-las-primeras-imagenes-de-mis-amigos-de-siempre|title= Se viene Mis amigos de siempre: ¡mirá las primeras imágenes!|trans-title=Mis amigos de siempre is coming, see the first images!|language= Spanish|author= |date= November 1, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production includes similarities with ''[[Campeones de la vida]]'', an older telenovela by Pol-Ka. The plot is focused on a sports club and many characters are sportspeople. Silveyra and Laport play a couple once more.&lt;ref name="debut" /&gt; The plots try to avoid the usual cliches in the romantic couples of telenovelas. The plots are also focused on nostalgia, but not as pronounced as in ''Graduados''.&lt;ref name="debut" /&gt; The opening theme was performed by the band [[Tan Biónica]], who had also made the opening theme of ''Graduados''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://secciones.cienradios.com.ar/radiomitre/2013/10/29/tan-bionica-hara-la-cancion-de-mis-amigos-de-siempre/|title= Tan Biónica hará la canción de "Mis amigos de siempre"|trans-title= Tan Biónica will make the song for "Mis amigos de siempre"|language= Spanish|author= |date= October 29, 2013|work= |publisher= Radio Mitre|accessdate= December 5, 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131204002735/http://secciones.cienradios.com.ar/radiomitre/2013/10/29/tan-bionica-hara-la-cancion-de-mis-amigos-de-siempre/|archivedate= December 4, 2013|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The first episode was aired on December 3, 2013. It got 18.1 rating points.&lt;ref name="debut"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://personajes.lanacion.com.ar/1644268-mis-amigos-de-siempre-en-busca-del-tiempo-perdido|title= Con 18,1 puntos de rating debutó Mis amigos de siempre|trans-title=With 18,1 rating points, Mis amigos de siempre started|language= Spanish|author= Martín Fernández Cruz|date= December 4, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2355">According to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n, [[Asturia]]n and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[mythology]], the '''Mouros''' are a race of supernatural beings which inhabited the lands of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]] and [[Portugal]] since the beginning of time. For unknown reasons they were forced to take refuge under the earth, and now they are usually seen by people in the surroundings of ''[[castro culture|castros]]'' and [[long barrow]]s. The Mouros work with gold, silver and gem stones with which they make up enormous treasures that are protected by [[cuélebre]]s.

The Mouros do not usually go out of their dwellings, except for taking food, and also in special dates like [[Midsummer]].

Galician anthropologists had formed the theory that the '''Mouros''' are the opposite character of traditional galician peasant.

The Mouros encantados some times appear as giants or warriors, and they include the legend of the [[Enchanted Moura|moura encantada]] and the legend of the ''mourinhos'' or ''maruxinhos'', a very small [[elf]] like people  who live under the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticiasdevilareal.com/noticias/index.php?action=getDetalhe&amp;id=3629 “O Tesouro dos Maruxinhos” lançado na Biblioteca Municipal de Chaves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001043509/http://www.noticiasdevilareal.com/noticias/index.php?action=getDetalhe&amp;id=3629 |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.continuitas.org/texts/morais_portugal1.pdf Portugal, mundo dos mortos e das mouras encantadas, vol.

{{Globalize|section|date=December 2017}}
&lt;!-- The following examples taken from the "What links here" lists for Non[-]sectarian --&gt;
Examples of US universities that identify themselves as being nonsectarian include [[Adelphi University]], [[Berea College]], [[Boston University]], [[Bradley University]], [[Brandeis University]], [[Columbia College (Missouri)|Columbia College]] in Missouri, [[Cornell University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[Denison University]], [[Duke University]], [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]], [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]], [[George Washington University]], [[Hawaii Pacific University]], [[Hillsdale College]], [[Hofstra University]], [[Howard University]], [[Ithaca College]], [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], [[Long Island University]], [[National University (California)|National University]], [[New York University]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], [[Pratt Institute]], [[Quinnipiac University]] in Connecticut, [[Reed College]] in Oregon, [[Whitman College]] in Washington, [[Rice University]], the [[University of Richmond]], [[Syracuse University]], [[Tulane University]], the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of Denver]], the [[University of Southern California]], the [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and [[Woodbury University]] in California.

Private primary and secondary schools in the US that self-identify as being nonsectarian include [[Allendale Columbia School]] in [[Rochester, New York]], [[Baylor School]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], [[Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School]] in New York and [[Germantown Academy]] in [[Fort Washington, Pennsylvania]] (the oldest nonsectarian school in the U.S.){{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, [[Friends School Mullica Hill]] in New Jersey, [[Pine Crest School]] in [[Ft. Lauderdale, Florida]], and [[The Pembroke Hill School]].

[[Pi Lambda Phi]] ({{lang|el|ΠΛΦ}} or Pi Lam) is a [[college]] social [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] founded by Frederick Manfred Werner, Louis Samter Levy, and Henry Mark Fisher at [[Yale University]] in 1895. It was founded as the first [[Sectarianism|non-sectarian]] fraternity, "a fraternity in which all men were brothers, no matter what their religion; a fraternity in which ability, open-mindedness, farsightedness, and a progressive, forward-looking attitude would be recognized as the basic attributes."&lt;ref name="pi-founders"&gt;[http://www.pilambdaphi.org/history/plhistory_02_founders.php The Founders' Period] History of the Fraternity&lt;/ref&gt; It currently boasts 35 chapters and four colonies in the [[United States]] and one chapter in [[Canada]]. The fraternity founded the ''Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity Educational Foundation''&lt;ref name="pi-edu"&gt;[http://foundation.pilambdaphi.org/Educational Foundation] Pi Lambda Phi Educational Foundation, Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The first nonsectarian sorority was [[Phi Sigma Sigma]]. Phi Sigma Sigma (ΦΣΣ), colloquially known as "Phi Sig," was the first collegiate nonsectarian sorority, welcoming women of all faiths and backgrounds. Founded by 10 women on November 26, 1913 at [[Hunter College]] in New York, Phi Sigma Sigma is now an international sorority with 60,000 initiated members, 115 collegiate chapters and more than 100 alumnae chapters, clubs and associations across the United States and Canada.

[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]] Sorority, founded in 1917, was the first [[non-sectarian]] social sorority founded at a professional school.&lt;ref name="Founding DPhiE"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Founding of DPhiE|url=http://www.dphie.org/aboutdphie|publisher=Delta Phi Epsilon|accessdate=10 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226082707/http://www.dphie.org/aboutdphie|archivedate=26 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal usage===
A 1956 amendment to the constitution of the State of Virginia allowed for tuition grants to be paid by the state to ''nonsectarian private schools''.&lt;ref name="vsc140324"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dinan|first1=John|title=The Virginia State Constitution|date=March 24, 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199355730|page=210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnbqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=virginia+non-denominational+tuition+grants+1956&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y-7-4BUOML&amp;sig=rKoaC_vcL1cfipWkTAOKELIgWwQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOgsH-t4zYAhWH1CYKHXqPCS0Q6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blaine amendment]]s to thirty-eight state constitutions forbid direct government aid to educational institutions that have a religious affiliation. The typical wording, "religious sects or denominations," is most often used to challenge support to Catholic parochial schools (38% of private school attendance); Protestant schools with an undifferentiated "Christian," often get a pass.&lt;ref name="ph170620"&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Philip Hamburger]]|title=Prejudice and the Blaine Amendments|url=https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2017/06/prejudice-and-the-blaine-amendments|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=[[First Things]]|date=20 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools often claim both "nonsectarian" and "Christian" in their promotional materials. The United States Department of Education differentiates ''Christian'' from ''Conservative Christian'' in its analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private School Enrollment|url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cgc.asp|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=8 January 2018|date=March 2017|quote=Affiliated religious schools belong to associations of schools with a specific religious orientation other than Catholic or conservative Christian. Unaffiliated religious schools have a religious orientation or purpose but are not classified as Catholic, conservative Christian, or affiliated religious. Nonsectarian schools do not have a religious orientation or purpose.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-academic institutions==
&lt;!-- More examples from the "What links here" lists --&gt;
Organizations that are explicitly nonsectarian include the [[Apex Clubs of Australia]], those participating in the [[Ethical Culture|Ethical Culture Movement]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], the [[National Jewish Medical and Research Center]], and the Tibetan Buddhist Center of Philadelphia. In [[Northern Ireland]], nonsectarian refers to groups identifying themselves as neither [[Irish republicanism|Nationalist/Republican]] or [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist/Loyalist]], such as the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]].

==Other==
Some [[cemeteries]] are known for being nonsectarian. In the United States, these are typically Christian cemeteries that do not adhere to one branch of the faith. Interment services can therefore be conducted in accordance with any one of various faith traditions, or none at all.

{{wiktionary|on-the-job}}
'''On-the-job training'''(OTJ) can be described as the process of passing along the skills, knowledge, and competencies needed for employees to perform a specific job in the environment of their workplace. On-the-job training is highly effective because it uses the existing workplace tools, machines, documents and equipment which simplifies the process of adapting to the new work environment. This type of training is normally used for practical tasks. 
On-the job training is not the most effective or efficient method however, it is easy to arrange and manage. No transfer of learning is required, and because the training is performed on the job it is highly realistic.  On-the-job training is inexpensive and it doesn’t require special equipment but what is normally used for the specific job and does not require a training guide. OTJ is a subject for many researches, highlighting its importance and benefits. A large majority of employee learning is accomplished through on-the-job training. When well designed, OTJ training program provides the needed resources and knowledge from competent staff managers, while setting a performance standards. 

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snell|first1=Scott|title=Managing Human Resources|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=305–306|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

On the job training is one of the earliest forms of training in the United States. The method is used when trained professional is passing his knowledge to the new hire. The OTJ method dates from back in the days when not everyone knew how to read or write, and it was the most convenient way to understand the requirements needed for the new job, on a one-to-one basis. In antiquity, the work performed by most people did not rely on abstract thinking, or academic education. Parents or community members, who knew the skills necessary for survival, passed their knowledge on to the children through direct instruction. This method is still widely used today. It is a frequently used because it requires only a person who knows how to do the task and the tools the person uses to do the task.
Over the years, as society has grown, on the job training has become less popular. Many companies have switched to doing simulation training, and using training guides. Businesses now prefer to hire employees who are already experienced and have the required skills set. However, there are still many companies who feel that on the job training is the best for their employees. 

==Psychology==

The concept of observational learning was introduced by Albert Bandura. Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory. Bandura believes that people learn best by observing others. According to this theory, people must pay attention to those around them first, retain what they have observed, and try to reproduce it. Bandura’s theory is implemented in the aspect of on the job training, where the new employees first observe their trainer completing the necessary tasks, before trying perform them themselves. After observing for some time, typically, they will imitate the action they had observed. This is exactly how on-the-job training is expected to occur, as long as necessary, until the new employee is capable of performing the task on their own.
==Pros and Cons==

There are both advantages and disadvantages to on-the-job training. Companies must weigh out their options before they decide which type of training is most beneficial for their field. If there are more disadvantages than advantages companies must opt out from the OJT and look for better options. In order to clarify these advantages and disadvantages, a list of pros and cons can be found below. 

==Pros===

•        On the job training is a quick method of training. 
•        When a company is short on employees, and needs to hire someone new, they are able to have the employee immediately on the job! 
•        It is oftentimes hard to create a simulation of the work environment in a training field. By doing the on the job training, everyone is taught exactly what they will be using on a daily basis.
•        On-the-job training is Cost effective 


===Cons===

•       One drawback is that OJT takes the trainer and materials out of production for the duration of the training time. 
•        On the job training can sometimes cause an issue when the training employees doesn’t have the required skills.
•        On the job training can also cause distractions to the job and affect the productivity 
•        In many jobs, there are safety precautions that need to be taught prior to entering the job field. Without employees being properly trained, there could be injuries that occur on the jobsite.
•        On the job training, is oftentimes rushed, which results in low productivity of the employee

An '''opaque inventory''' is the market of selling unsold [[travel inventory]] at a discounted price. The inventory is called "opaque" because the specific suppliers (i.e. hotel, airline, etc.) remain hidden until after the purchase has been completed. This is done to prevent sales of unsold inventory from cannibalizing full-price retail sales. According to TravelClick, the opaque channel accounted for 6% of all hotel reservations for major brands in 2012, up 2% from 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.secrethotels.eu/secret-hotels-win-win-for-hotels-and-travellers/=all|title = Secret Hotels – Win Win for Hotels and Travellers|date= June 29, 2013|website=Secret Hotels Europe|dead-url=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary consumers of opaque inventories are price-conscious people whose primary aim is the cheapest travel possible and are less concerned with the specifics of their travel plans. Hotel discounts of 30-60% are typical, and bargains are stronger at a higher star hotel. While one has control over the dates and times of a travel itinerary, the downside is these purchases are absolutely non-refundable and non-changeable and, as noted above, the specific hotel or airline is not revealed until after purchase.

The main sources of opaque inventories are [[Hotwire.com]] and [[Priceline.com]], but [[Travelocity.com]] and [[Expedia.com]] also offer opaque booking options. Hotwire has a fixed pricing model, where it sells a room at a fixed price with a limited description of a given venue, whereas Priceline offers both a similar fixed pricing model and a bidding model where travelers bid for a hotel room from among a group of hotels of a given star rating and location. Typically hotel deals are greater than airline discounts on opaque travel sites, namely because airlines have limited seating and also take monetary cuts when publishing discounted fares, whereas a hotel sells to opaque sites to fill empty rooms.

In response to these opaque travel sites, there are also 'decoder' sites that use feedback from recent purchasers to help construct a profile of the opaque travel property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3599">A '''public offering''' is the offering of [[securities]] of a [[company]] or a similar [[corporation]] to the public. Generally, the securities are to be listed on a [[stock exchange]]. In most jurisdictions, a public offering requires the issuing company to publish a [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] detailing the terms and rights attached to the offered security, as well as information on the company itself and its finances. Many other [[financial regulation|regulatory]] requirements surround any public offering and they vary according to jurisdiction.

[[Initial public offering]] (IPO) is one type of public offering. Not all public offerings are IPOs. An IPO occurs only when a company offers its [[shares]] (not other securities) for the first time for public ownership and trading, an act making it a [[public company]]. However, public offerings are also made by already-listed companies. The company issues additional securities to the public, adding to those currently being traded. For example, a listed company with 8 million [[shares outstanding]] can offer to the public another 2 million shares. This is a public offering but not an IPO. Once the transaction is complete, the company will have 10 million shares outstanding. Non-initial public offering of equity is also called [[seasoned equity offering]].

A [[shelf prospectus]] is often used by companies in exactly that situation. Instead of drafting one before each public offering, the company can file a single prospectus detailing the terms of many different securities it might offer in the next several years. Shortly before the offering (if any) actually takes place, the company informs the public of material changes in its finances and outlook since the publication of the shelf prospectus.

Other types of securities, besides shares, can be offered publicly. [[Bond (finance)|Bonds]], [[warrant (finance)|warrant]]s, [[capital note]]s and many other kinds of [[debt]] and [[equity (finance)|equity]] vehicles are offered, issued and traded in public capital markets. A [[private company]], with no shares listed publicly, can still issue other securities to the public and have them traded on an exchange. A public company may also offer and list other securities alongside its shares.

Most public offerings are in the [[primary market]], that is, the issuing company itself is the offerer of securities to the public. The offered securities are then issued (allocated, allotted) to the new owners. If it is an offering of shares, this means that the company's [[outstanding share capital|outstanding]] capital grows. If it is an offering of other securities, this entails the creation or expansion of a series (of bonds, warrants, etc.). However, more rarely, public offerings take place in the [[secondary market]]. This is called a [[secondary market offering]]: existing security holders offer to sell their stake to other, new owners, through the stock exchange. The offerer is different from the issuer (the company). A secondary market offering is still a public offering with much the same requirements, including a prospectus.

The services of an [[securities underwriting|underwriter]] are often used to conduct a public offering.

In the fictional ''[[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer Fantasy]]'' setting by [[Games Workshop]], there are a number of different [[Race (fantasy)|races]] and [[nation]]s.  The most important of these feature are individual armies in the [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]] table top game.

==Realms of Men==
All of the featured human nations are based in the [[Old World (Warhammer)|Old World]].

===Kingdom of Bretonnia===
Bretonnia is based on real-world medieval [[France]]; its name is clearly derived from the French province of [[Britanny]] and it draws heavily from Arthurian legends which are associated with Medieval Brittany; for instance with The Lady and The Green Knight who both have parallels in Arthurian lore. Though originally received by the Warhammer community as too idealistic for the Warhammer atmosphere, further source books have revealed the underlying arrogance of Bretonnian knights and their casually cruel treatment of their lowborn citizens.

Bretonnia was founded when the Knight Lord Giles drove the hordes of Orcs and Chaos out of Bretonnia in the name of the Lady, the goddess in whom the Bretonnians place their faith. Since then Bretonnia has been divided and collectively ruled by the King of Bretonnia and his twelve Dukes and their families. Each Duke, in turn, rules over several barons and earls, each having great swathes of land and are able to call upon dozens of knights from the lesser nobility that they rule.

Bretonnia's official religion is the worship of ''The Lady''. However, this religion is only exclusive to the aristocracy, as peasants are considered unworthy to worship Her and any caught doing so are brutally punished.

Bretonnian knights train extensively from boyhood in riding and heavy armor combat, specializing in two kinds of weapons, the longsword and the lance; completely abstaining from using ranged weapons, which they consider dishonorable. Their blacksmiths are the best human armorers in the world, second only to the Elves and Dwarfs in craftsmanship. Though indoctrinated in the art of knightly chivalry (similar to that which is practiced in Arthurian legend), Bretonnians generally believe that chivalrous acts and responsibilities only apply to their fellow aristocrats and do not extend the same courtesies and respect to their peasant citizens. Bretonnian knights are born exclusively from the nobility of Bretonnia as peasants cannot afford the cost of the armor and weapons required to be a knight, to say nothing of the upkeep necessary to keep horses and maintain equipment.

Some more well-off peasants may still serve as ''Men-at-arms'' in their lord's forces, each aristocrat being able to raise a few hundred men-at-arms from their peasant tenant families. These part-time soldiers are paid a marginal wage and are provisionally given basic armor and carry pikes or spears as their armaments. Each is also required to wear the livery of his lord's house. Though organized and markedly courageous, they are mostly poorly trained and under-supplied as their lords will rarely spare the time and resources to properly equip them. As such, men-at-arms often rely on salvaged or captured arms and other war gear from the battlefield.

Additionally, Bretonnian armies are supplemented by the ''Fey Enchantresses'' (women who are mysteriously abducted by fey spirits when they are young, raised by the Lady and endowed with magical powers) and the famed ''Pegasi Riders'' (knights trained to ride highly-temperamental winged horses exclusively raised by Bretonnian breeders and serve as the kingdoms aerial forces). For heavy firepower, Bretonnia has only one major siege weapon, the trebuchet. While boasting impressive range, the siege weapon is as inaccurate to fire as it is cumbersome to load. These are usually kept far to the rear of Bretonnian armies along with their peasant longbowmen who rank even less than Men-at-Arms.

Thus, Bretonnian armies rely on powerful charges from their many heavily armed and armored knights in order to achieve victory. Bretonnian knights are arguably the best heavy cavalry in Warhammer Fantasy, along with being the most varied. For support units, they have the Pegasi and the Enchantresses and for basic units, Bretonnian armies can also contain cheap and expendable peasant longbowmen and men-at-arms to serve as fodder.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Armies: Bretonnia'' (Games Workshop, 1998) {{ISBN|1-869893-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Empire===
*[[The Empire (Warhammer)|The Empire]] is one of the largest nations of the Old World. The Empire is based upon the real-world [[Holy Roman Empire]] with heavy Germanic influences, especially during the [[early modern period]]. The Empire benefits from a great diversity of units and magic. They also field an extensive variety of [[Black powder|black-powder]] weapons, but its core troops are quite weak in comparison with those of other races.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Armies: The Empire'' (Games Workshop, 2000) {{ISBN|1-84154-059-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smaller states of the Old World===
* [[Marienburg (Warhammer)|The Westerland]]&amp;nbsp;– Akin to the [[Low Countries]], this low-lying land at the mouth of the River [[Reikland|Reik]] is home to Marienburg, one of the largest cities in the Old World. This region used to belong to the Empire when it was referred to as Westerland, but is now fiercely independent. Marienburg is a single city-state and is not covered by its own army book for Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Although the previous edition of Empire Army book contains a listing for a Marienburg army.
* [[Tilea]]&amp;nbsp;– South of the Irrana Mountains and the Vaults. The fractious city-states of Tilea embrace trade, exploration and civil war with equal passion. The bulk of armies in these lands are made up of powerful Legions, fighting on behalf of the wealthy rulers of the many republics and principalities, but there are also wandering mercenary armies who serve the self-proclaimed Merchant Princes and often fight further north in the service of the Empire. Merchant Prince armies can be represented by the [[Dogs of War (Warhammer)|Dogs of War]] army list, but the main Tilean armies have no official book, relying on unofficial sources written by independent players. Tilea roughly corresponds to the real world's  [[Roman Empire]], while the nature of the gypsy-like Merchant Princes more resemble [[Renaissance Italy]].
* [[Estalia]]&amp;nbsp;– A peninsula southwest of Bretonnia. They are far from the threat of Chaos, this land is home to a  kingdom, akin to the [[Iberian peninsula]] prior to the [[Reconquista]] along with some [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]] influences. The name "Estalia" is a mix-up of the names España (Spain) and Italia (Italy). Estalia was once occupied by forces from [[Araby (Warhammer)|Araby]] (which mirrors the real life Iberian peninsula which was once under [[Moorish]] control) but these were driven out by a combined effort by other Old World human realms.  There is no official Estalian army book or list published by Games Workshop at this time. However, one could use a Dogs of War army list as a basis for a royal or mercenary force from the peninsula or use one of the unofficial books published by independent players. Estalia's position in the Old World mirrors that of Spain and Portugal in Europe.
* [[Norsca]]- Bordered to the North by the [[Chaos Wastes]], to the South by the [[Sea of Claws]], and to the East by [[Troll Country]]. Norsca is a wild country based on [[Scandinavia]]. The tribal and [[Viking]] like Norse worship a large pantheon of gods, the most significant of which are the [[Chaos (Warhammer)#The Chaos Gods|Chaos Gods]], and are often found among the ranks of the [[Hordes of Chaos|Warriors of Chaos]] forming the majority of the Hordes as both marauder foot soldiers and Chaos Warrior shock troops.
* [[Kislev (Warhammer)|Kislev]]&amp;nbsp;– A  northern nation and an ally of the Empire under constant threat due to their close proximity to the maddening Realm of Chaos. This nation is reminiscent of medieval Russia and relatively similar to the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] countries. In the most recent incarnation, the Kislevites fantasy Russians, with Boyars, Kossars and the Tsar and Tsarina all being very similar adaptations of Russian realities. Kislevites can be taken as allies by some armies, and can be fielded as their own army through an Army Book published as a supplement with ''White Dwarf'' (in 2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070116025236/http://uk.games-workshop.com/empire/kislev/1/].

===The North, East, and South===
*'''Albion''' - based upon the [[British Isles]]. Albion is an island surrounded by mist and fog.&lt;ref&gt;Warhammer: Dark Shadows, (Games Workshop, 2001) {{ISBN|1-84154-198-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Games Workshop ran a worldwide summer campaign based around control of the Isle of Albion which included rules for adverse weather conditions and stone circles, which enhanced the abilities of magic users. Unofficial army books produced give army lists reminiscent of the Ancient Britons and Anglo-Saxons.
*[[Cathay (Warhammer)|Cathay]] - based upon ancient China.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Rulebook'' (Gamesworkshop, 1996) ASIN B000QGG4SA&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Nippon''' - based upon ancient Japan
*[[Araby (Warhammer)|Araby]] - based on the Islamic Near East during the medieval period with units based largely on ''Arabian Nights'' style fantasy. Earlier background describes it as being divided into several [[Theocracy|theocratic states]] comprising a large empire ruled by the "Sultan of All Araby".&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (main rulebook, 1986, reprint 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kingdoms of Ind - they are the equivalent to the [[Indian Subcontinent]] in the real [[world]]. In the relevant Army Books of Warhammer, there is little reference to the Kingdoms of Ind. The southern half of Ind is covered in forests containing a high concentration of [[Beasts of Chaos|Beastmen]].
There is an island just off shore of Ind, the equivalent of [[Sri Lanka]], mostly covered by forests on which a [[High Elves (Warhammer)|High Elf]] fortress known as the Tower of the Sun is situated. A collection of smaller islands are bunched up close to Ind, one of which has another High Elf outpost known as the Tower of Stars. Separating the Kingdoms of Ind from Grand [[Cathay]] is a leg of mountains from the [[Ogre Kingdoms]], the equivalent of the [[Himalayas]], where the Land of the Celestial Dragon Monks is. Just inside the nation of Ind is a coastal city called the City of Spires. The rulers of Ind are said to be attended by many servants and slaves, as well as being wealthy and generous.

The '''Sea of Claws''' is roughly equivalent to the real world [[Baltic Sea]]. The Sea is mentioned in many of the settings sourcebooks and maps. Its name comes from its abundance of sea creatures. On the shores of Sea of Claws are [[Empire (Warhammer)|Empire]], [[Kislev (Warhammer)|Kislev]], [[Bretonnia]], [[Norsca]] and also the great city of [[Marienburg (Warhammer)|Marienburg]]  roughly equivalent to 17th century Amsterdam. On the shores of sea is located Norsca city of [[Olricstaad]].

== Elves ==
The Elves were the third civilized race to walk the world. Brought from creation by the Old Ones, the Elves showed an adeptness to magic. Torn asunder many thousands of years ago by a great civil war, there are three major nations of Elves.

* '''[[Dark Elves (Warhammer)|Dark Elves]]'''&amp;nbsp;– The relentless and bitter Druchii of [[Naggaroth]] still follow Malekith, who was exiled but still claims to be the rightful heir to the throne of the Elven Kingdoms of Ulthuan.  The dark elves are sworn enemies of the high elves and try incessantly to invade their former homeland.  Dark elves enjoy nothing more than inflicting pain and suffering on others, and they frequently launch raids throughout the Old World in order to capture more slaves to feed their hunger for cruelty. Their priestesses, the Witch elves of [[Khaine]], perform blood rituals to rejuvenate their youth.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Armies: Dark Elves'' (Nottingham: Games Workshop Ltd., 1998) ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[High Elves (Warhammer)|High Elves]]'''&amp;nbsp;– The Asur carry on the ancient traditions of the Elven people on the island continent of [[Ulthuan]], as well as the burdens of many millennia of arrogance and warfare. Without them the daemons of chaos would overrun the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Armies: High Elves'' (Nottingham: Games Workshop, 1993) {{ISBN|978-1-872372-63-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Wood Elves (Warhammer)|Wood Elves]]'''&amp;nbsp;– The ruthless Asrai abandoned their kin to both protect and restrain the strange sentient forest of Athel Loren in the Old World. Considering Warhammer Fantasy's influcence from [[Tolkien]]'s Middle Earth universe, if the High Elves are likened to the Vanyar/Noldor races, the Wood Elves are mostly the Teleri (including Sindar) from Lothlórien and Mirkwood. They appear to be neither good nor bad, as likely to kill lost travelers as to aid them. They are mortal enemies to the [[Beasts of Chaos|Beastmen]], and wage a mostly unnoticed war against them.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Armies: Wood Elves'' (Nottingham: Games Workshop, 2006) {{ISBN|1-872372-45-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of the game, there were two other Elven armies noted: the "Sea Elves" and the "Night Elves". Sea Elves were essentially the Elves of the more practical and worldly Outer Kingdoms of Ulthuan, and the Night Elves are now considered part of the Dark Elves.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Dwarfs==
[[Image:Dwarf by BrokenMachine86.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Dwarf.]]
The Dwarfs live in city fortresses dug into the mountains of the Old World. Their Chaos brethren occupy one huge towering city in the lands to the south east of the Old World.

===Dwarf===

* [[Dwarf (Warhammer)|Dwarf]]s&amp;nbsp;– An ancient, grim, and determined race were integral in the founding of the Empire, the Dwarfs spend their days avenging grudges and counting gold.  Dwarfs are the greatest craftsmen in the Warhammer World and in addition to enjoying fine arms and armor, they implement the best heavy infantry and artillery in the game. Dwarf armies are well suited to defensive warfare, however due to their lack of mobility, they do not do well when forced to go on the offensive.  Dwarfs are legendary for their ability to never forget nor forgive a wrong against them, their finely crafted weapons and armor, their ability to consume large quantities of ale, extreme stubbornness, mistrust of elves, and hatred of greenskins. Dwarfs are the closest ally to Humanity, although the Elves of Ulthuan have united with the Humans as well in the last few hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Armies: Dwarfs'' (Nottingham: Games Workshop, 2000) {{ISBN|1-84154-066-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the horrid [[Dwarf (Warhammer)#The War of the Beard|War of the Beard]], Dwarves hold a grudge against the High Elves.

===Chaos Dwarfs===

* Chaos Dwarfs – are an offshoot of the [[Dwarf (Warhammer)|Dwarven]] race. Originally they were Dwarves, but began to worship the Gods of  [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]] and broke off to form a new society. This schism is similar to the one between the [[High Elves (Warhammer)|High Elves]] and [[Dark Elves (Warhammer)|Dark Elves]].

In many ways, Chaos Dwarves are the mirror-images of Dwarves. Where Warhammer Dwarves shun most magic (save for Runic magic, which is unique to this race) Chaos Dwarves have embraced it; where Dwarves worship their Ancestor Gods, Chaos Dwarves have turned to the worship of the evil Hashut, Father of Darkness; where Dwarves abhor slavery and "greenskin" races (Goblins, Orcs and the like), Chaos Dwarves hold masses of slaves and are allied with or are overlords of many greenskin tribes and peoples.  They are even responsible for the creation of the Black Orcs. 

Chaos Dwarves are depicted as having a rather Mesopotamian look; they wear Assyrian-style armor and sausage-curled beards.  The main physical difference between them and ordinary Dwarves is that Chaos Dwarves have long tusks jutting up out of their lower jaws.  Their capital city is in the form of a huge [[ziggurat]], called ''Zharr-Naggrund.''  They hate or despise all outsiders, and especially hate other Dwarves, who see their existence as an intolerable dishonor to the Dwarf race, meriting extinction.  

Chaos Dwarves were introduced through the magazine White Dwarf, and even given a limited rulebook of their own.  Unfortunately, the model range never caught on, and was slowly abandoned.  However, Games Workshop has recently hinted they may try rereleasing the Chaos Dwarves figurine line much to the enjoyment of its loyal cult following.

== Fimir ==
[[Image:Fimir warlord.jpg|thumb|right|A Fimir warlord in [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|Warhammer Fantasy]]]]

'''Fimir''' are a fantasy race created by [[Graeme Davis (game designer)|Graeme Davis]] and Jes Goodwin at the end of the 1980s for [[Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay|Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP)]] and the 3rd edition of [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|Warhammer Fantasy Battle (WFB)]].

===Fictional ecology===
Inspired by the [[Fomorians]] of [[Celtic myth]], they are depicted as humanoid, [[Cyclops|cyclopean]] creatures with barbed tails and beak-like snouts, with skins that varied from a dark green to a muddy brown colour. They are described as being part [[daemon (Warhammer)|Daemon]].

The Fimir inhabit the [[wetlands]] of the Warhammer world, typically within crudely constructed fortifications resembling nothing more than a pile of rocks.  From these locations, the Fimir raid the homes of humans, taking captives for daemonic sacrifices.  The Fimir loathe sunlight, and are followed by wreaths of mist to shield them from it, and their homes are always shrouded by it.

Fimir society is divided into a [[caste]] system, consisting of Meargh, the Dirach, the warriors, and the Shearl.   The Meargh - also known as witch-hags - are the leaders of Fimir colonies, as well as the only females.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Armies''. Games Workshop. Page 136. {{ISBN|1-869893-45-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Meargh would typically also be a very powerful user of magic.  The Dirach - described as "daemon-friends" - are a caste of wizards specialising in the worshipping of Daemons.  The warrior caste - consisting of Fimm (warriors), Fianna Fimm (elite warriors), and the various nobles - take the brunt of raiding and fighting.  The Shearls - the slaves of a Fimir settlement - exist only to work and die.  The ruling Meargh hold the clans together. In the event of a Meargh's death, the Fimir of her stronghold separate, either working as mercenaries for other evil creatures or seeking out another clan to join.  However the Meargh is [[Infertility|sterile]] and therefore unable to breed. So as to replenish their numbers the Fimir kidnap young fertile human women to use as breeding stock.

===Inclusion History===
The Fimir were created at the behest of [[Games Workshop]]'s then-owner, [[Bryan Ansell]] who wanted a race "to be as distinctive of Warhammer as the Broo are of Runequest".&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Davis, co-creator of the Fimir, discussing their origins on Usenet {{cite newsgroup|author="Graeme Davis"|title=Re: Questions on Firmirs and stuff|date=1998-05-20|message-id= 6jveko$1tq$1@news1.rmi.net|newsgroup=rec.games.miniatures.warhammer|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/rec.games.miniatures.warhammer/ugGRTZIHRas/EjGaVMLDgVEJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Fimir did not prove popular, and disappeared with the 4th edition of WFB, although this did give them time to make a guest-starring appearance in [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley's]] [[HeroQuest (board game)|HeroQuest]]. Very few (official) sources on Fimir exist and include the WFRP Bestiary, an article in ''White Dwarf'' No. 102, the third edition of WFB (Bestiary and ''[[Warhammer Armies]]'') and some references in supplements.

There are two Fimir [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] at the "correct scale" i.e. a size between 1.8m and 2.1m (in-game scale): Fimir (actually Fimm Warriors) from HeroQuest and some limited edition Fimm Warrior miniatures sold separately. One can also find Fimir by Nick Bibby the size of ogres, although these obviously do not integrate well with the "correctly" scaled models. Original concept sketches of the miniatures made by Jes Goodwin represented human-sized creatures and the published characteristics of the Fimir reflected this fact. However, when Nick Bibby started to sculpt the Fimir miniatures, he made them ogre-sized, leading to them being disproportionately weak for the size of their figurine in WFB. It was officially decided that this was the fault of the authors. Ultimately, WFRP was published with Fimir, but the race disappeared from the next edition of WFB.

The last official appearance of the Fimir was in the WFRP sourcebook ''Marienburg: Sold Down the River'', published in 1999. Since WFRP 2nd edition, the background has been brought into line with WFB and races such as [[Zoat]]s, Gnomes and Fimir have been quietly dropped. Games Workshop described such races as being in "interminable hiatus".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071209134309/http://forum.blackindustries.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5602  Black Industries Forums (via Wayback Machine)]&lt;/ref&gt; In response, several fan-written creations have been published, including a "Fimir special" issue 25 of the WFRP fanzine [[Warpstone (magazine)|Warpstone]].

There appears to be another reference to the Fimir in UK White Dwarf 310. Where in the article on the Gnoblar Horde, a new army list, there is a background piece on boglars, a sub-species of gnoblar that live in marshes. It says that "A large tribe in the Marshes of Madness have been rumored to be in alliance with strange, cyclopean creatures." While not being specific, this is almost certainly a reference to the Fimir.

The Fimir were mentioned in the time of Legends novel 'Empire', where creatures matching their description were encountered living in the marshes.

Fimir are referenced by name in the "Marshland" entry of the terrain rules section of the 8th Edition Warhammer Fantasy Battles rulebook.

The July 2011 "Storm of Magic" supplement has, at last, reintroduced Fimir into the Warhammer tabletop game, in the form of a Dirach wizard called a Balefiend, which can be used as a bound monster by any Warhammer army. The character is now a full-fledged monstrous infantry (i.e. ogre-sized) model, rather than regular infantry.

In December 2011, Warhammer Forge revealed three new models to be released in Q1 of 2012 as part of the supplement titled Monstrous Arcana.

In August 2016, a Fimiarch Noble miniature was revealed to be released by Games Workshop's Forge World division.

In July 2017, it was revealed that the Fimir would be re-appearing in an official Games Workshop tie-in product as a part of the Norscan Faction DLC for Total War: Warhammer.

== Lizardmen ==
*[[Lizardmen (Warhammer)|Lizardmen]]&amp;nbsp;– The Lizardmen have undergone many successive changes through the history of the Warhammer game. Originally they were the 'native' race of the Warhammer World who were driven underground by the Slann prior to their vast terraforming (which created the distinctive form of the continents compared to those of Earth). They fought an eons-long [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the amphibian aliens whose armies were then made up of Amazons, Pygmies, Lobotomised Slaves and Slann warriors.

In recent editions they have been reimagined to have been originally created by the Old Ones, thus being the second civilization to come to the Warhammer world. Preceded by the Old Ones and succeeded by the Elves to aid in their great genetic works, the Slann now lead the Lizardmen through prophesies containing ancient instructions from their gods, who may or may not some day return. The Lizardmen are based on the [[Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] cultures and are found in the New World, corresponding with ancient Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;''Warhammer Lizardmen'' (Nottingham: Games Workshop Ltd., 2005) {{ISBN|1-84154-644-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orcs and Goblins (Greenskins) ==
{{Main|Orcs and Goblins (Warhammer)}}
[[Image:Goblin by armandeo64.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Goblin.]]
The tribes of Orcs, Goblins and other Greenskins are spread across the Old World and into the east. They are mostly referred to in general as "Greenskins" for obvious reasons. The magic they use is called Waaaagh! and is drawn from the power and energy of excited, bloodthirsty Greenskins armies. A large horde led by a great Orc Leader (or sometimes a Goblin one) of Orcs and/or Goblins is called a Waaagh!&lt;ref name="Warhammer Armies: Orks and Goblins"&gt;''Warhammer Armies: Orks and Goblins'' (Games Workshop Lts, 2000) {{ISBN|1-84154-060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relative of the Common Goblin is the Gnoblar, which is found living with the Ogre Hordes in the Mountains of Mourn.&lt;ref name="Warhammer Armies: Ogre Kingdoms"&gt;''Warhammer Armies: Ogre Kingdoms'' (Games Workshop Lts, 2004) {{ISBN|1-84154-531-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; East of the Mountains of Mourn on the borders of Cathay live the Hobgoblins, a race of greenskins somewhere between a Goblin and an Orc, but more cunning than either. Hobgoblins can also be found as slaves or slavers within realm of the Chaos Dwarves.&lt;ref name="White Dwarf Presents Warhammer Chaos Dwarfs"&gt;''White Dwarf Presents Warhammer Chaos Dwarfs'' (Games Workshop Lts, 1994) {{ISBN|1-872372-80-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallest in size of all the Greenskin races are the Snotlings, They are considered the lowliest of greenskins and are most often bullied around by their larger, greener cousins.&lt;ref name="Warhammer Armies: Orks and Goblins"/&gt;

The toughest and most disciplined of the Orcs are the Black Orcs. These mean beasts are "armed to da teef" and are covered in heavy black armour. This is one reason why they are called Black Orcs, the other being their unusually dark green skin compared to their brethren. The most unusual thing about these Orks is that they take care of their weapons and armour (to an extent), cleaning them after each battle, while the other orcs like to leave pieces of their foes stuck to their gear.

Another form of Orc are the Savage Orcs, who, rather than use the modern technology of armour, language, and weapons of their cousins, stayed in their primitive savage form. Using mainly stones as their weapons, the Savage Orcs rush madly into battle, some clinging upon wild boars with only their feet. The Savage Orcs put so much faith in their warpaint that it works for intimidation.

== Chaos ==
The phrase "Slaves to Darkness" is used to cover all those who have fallen under the control of, or pledged themselves to, the Forces of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|the Chaos gods]]. While the energies of chaos touch all things magical, there are those who fully give themselves to the deities of this realm, and seek to conquer not just the works of the Old Ones, but the very fabric of reality itself.

There used to be a combined Chaos Army in the early 1990s, which was later split into the Beasts of Chaos and Hordes of Chaos army books. These books then subdivide the armies of Chaos further into Bestial, Mortal (humans), and Daemonic armies.

* Beastmen&amp;nbsp;– Are either born bestial to human parents or raised among mutants. Beastmen hate all that is civilized and untouched by the glories of chaos.
* [[Warriors of Chaos]]&amp;nbsp;– Primarily humans who are favored by the Four Great Gods of chaos. These marauders emerge from the areas below the Northern Warp Gate and also possess one of the strongest cavalries and infantries in the game.
* [[Daemon (Warhammer)|Daemons of Chaos]] - Servants of the chaos gods. They are made out of pure energy emerging from the northern and southern warp gates. These daemons only come out in times when the Chaos energies in the Warhammer World are strong.

==Skaven==
Skaven or "Children of the Horned Rat", are a Chaotic race of rat-men. The Skaven have a general Steampunk motif, in that they use primitive and magic-driven science similar to alchemy and medieval proto-science.

Some Skaven concepts might be inspired by the Old World's view of technology as imbalanced, or knowledge/science not held in check by morals. This is a theme which runs through the background of The Empire, in which wizards, engineers, and Sigmarite priests all try to limit or free themselves from the others influence.

==The Undead==
{{Main|Undead (Warhammer)}}
All undead in the Warhammer world are a result of the black sorceries devised by the first necromancer, [[Nagash (Warhammer)|Nagash]], in the long distant past. The Undead are effectively split into two distinct armies: that of the Tomb Kings which has a strong [[ancient Egypt]]ian feel with [[Mummy#Mummies in fiction|mummies]] and chariots driven by [[skeleton (undead)|skeletons]], and the army of the Vampire Counts which features [[vampire]]s, [[zombie]]s and so forth.

* [[Vampire Counts]]&amp;nbsp;– Disciples of Nagash who stole his secrets of eternal life, the Vampires and their minions have spread across the Old World, furthering their own aims. There are five playable vampire families, each with different ambitions, habits and powers: Von Carsteins, Necrarchs, Blood Dragons, Lahmians and Strigoi.  Their armies consist mainly of classic undead, such as [[zombies]], [[skeleton (undead)|skeletons]], [[vampire]]s, [[bat]]s, and [[ghost]]s. Anthropologists such as A. Asbjørn Jøn have analysed how subgroups of the Vampire Counts - such as the Blood Dragons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283318599_Vampire_Evolution|title = Vampire Evolution|last = Jøn|first = A. Asbjørn|date = 2003|journal = mETAphor|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 20 November 2015|issue = 3|page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Von Carsteins&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280805194_From_Nosteratu_to_Von_Carstein_shifts_in_the_portrayal_of_vampires|title = From Nosteratu to Von Carstein: shifts in the portrayal of vampires|last = Jøn|first = A.

* [[Tomb Kings]]&amp;nbsp;– In the hot desert lands of Nehekhara to the south of the Old World a race was once ruled by the necromancer Nagash. After a successful rebellion against his rule, he killed every mortal being in order to raise an unassailable army of the undead to conquer the world. He was stopped by the last king of Khemri. The aftermath of Nagash's great spell awakened several thousand years worth of the buried dead and their Kings as an undead army. Their armies consist mainly of Egyptian-style units, such as bowmen, light infantry and several chariots.

==The Ogres==
* [[Ogre (Warhammer)|Ogre Kingdoms]]&amp;nbsp;– Massive Eastern barbarians who will do any work for gold and will eat anything and anyone. They ride large beasts resembling [[mammoth]]s and [[sabre-tooth tiger]]s. Since ogres are guided solely by their stomachs, they spread devastation and destruction wherever they go.  Ogres are often considered to be a "neutral" army, and can end up fighting for any side, they hire themselves out as mercenaries to feed their lust for food. They have a resemblance to humans from the ice age or cave man.&lt;ref name="Warhammer Armies: Ogre Kingdoms"/&gt; Before the great cataclysm the ogre kingdoms lived in prosperity, However, the great cataclysm saw many ogre deaths and later, a huge warpstone meteorite landed in the ogre's lands and killed a huge amount more. When the dust cleared a huge mouth ( referred to by the ogres as 'the great maw' ) spanned the landscape surrounding the crash site, this massive, magical maw is what drives the ogre's endless hunger."/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6400">{{about|the humorous idea|the concept relating to the French Resistance|Résistancialisme}}
'''Resistentialism''' is a [[jocular]] theory to describe "seemingly spiteful behavior manifested by inanimate objects",&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hellwig, Insomniac's Dictionary (Ivy Books, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;  where objects that cause problems (like lost keys or a runaway bouncy ball) are said to exhibit a high degree of malice toward humans.  The theory posits a war being fought between humans and inanimate objects, and all the little annoyances that objects cause throughout the day are battles between the two. The concept was not new in 1948 when humorist [[Paul Jennings (UK author)|Paul Jennings]] coined this name for it in a piece titled "Report on Resistentialism", published in ''[[The Spectator]]'' that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/23rd-april-1948/11/report-on-resistentialism-h-atred-of-ones-father-a Report on Resistentialism], [[The Spectator]], 23 April 1948&lt;/ref&gt; and reprinted in ''[[The New York Times]]'';&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1948/06/13/archives/thingness-of-things-resistentialism-it-says-here-is-the-very-latest.html Thingness of Things]'', [[The New York Times]], 13 June 1948&lt;/ref&gt; the word is a blend of the Latin ''res'' ("thing"), the French ''resister'' ("to resist"), and the [[existentialism]] school of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordsmith.org/words/resistentialism.html A.Word.A.Day—resistentialism]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is a spoof of existentialism in general, and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in particular, Jennings naming the fictional inventor of Resistentialism as Pierre-Marie Ventre.  The slogan of Resistentialism is "''Les choses sont contre nous''" ("Things are against us").

==Similar concepts==
As discussed regarding [[Murphy's law#History|the history of Murphy's law]] and of similar laws or corollaries such as [[Finagle's law]] and [[Sod's law]], the perceived perversity of the universe has long been a subject of comment, and the concept may be as old as humanity. Examples from literature include the following:

* [[Friedrich Theodor Vischer]] (1807–1887), in his novel ''Auch Einer'', first published in 1879, developed the concept of ''Die Tücke des Objekts'' (the spite of objects), a comic theory that inanimate objects conspire against humans.
* [[M. R. James]] (1862–1936), in his horror short story "[http://www.thin-ghost.org/items/show/148 The Malice of Inanimate Objects]", first published in 1933, prefigures Jennings' theories, but suggests a more sinister aspect to the phenomenon involving supernatural sentience and malevolence.
* In the 1920s [[Theodore Menline Bernstein|Theodore M. Bernstein]] formulated what he jocularly called Bernstein's first law, which is that small dropped objects, such as cufflinks, will be found only in the place most inaccessible for retrieval.
* Writing in 1942, [[Louise Dickinson Rich]] mentioned the idea in a way plainly suggesting that it was not novel. Describing efforts to clear ground of brush and large stones for vegetable growing, she said facetiously, "I do believe in the malevolence of the inanimate, and of all inanimate objects, stones are the most malevolent."&lt;ref name="oclc_405243"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dickinson Rich |first=Louise |year=1942 |title=We Took to the Woods |page=119 |publisher=JB Lippincott Co |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PT0zAQAAIAAJ |lccn=42024308 |oclc=405243 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Resistentialism is the basis for the poem "Nightmare Number Three" by [[Stephen Vincent Benét]], which was dramatized by George Lefferts for the 1950s radio drama series ''[[X Minus One]]''.
* In [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s science fiction short story "Skirmish", first published in 1950, machines start to become self-aware and revolt against human control.
* In [[Avram Davidson]]'s science fiction short story "[[Or All the Seas with Oysters]]", first published in 1958, inanimate objects breed and undergo metamorphosis.
* The concept appears in the ''[[Discworld]]'' novels of English author [[Terry Pratchett]], where it is referred to as ''malignity'' or ''malignance''; one practical example the author gives is the tendency of garden hoses, no matter how carefully one coils and stores them, to unloop themselves overnight and tie the bicycle to the lawnmower. It is associated with Pratchett's [[Auditors of Reality]], and possibly also with [[Discworld gods#Anoia|Anoia]], whom he describes as a "goddess of things that stick in drawers." 
* [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[V.]]'' features the character of Benny Profane, who is under the impression that he can only deal successfully with animate objects. Throughout the novel, the dividing line between animate and inanimate objects become blurred, such as the Bad Priest, who is mostly [[cyborg|machine]], a talking [[protective suit]] named SHROUD, and [[sewer alligators|sewer-dwelling]] [[alligators]] who are aware that they were intended to be toy pets for children.
* [[Farin Urlaub]]'s single "[[Dusche]]" is a rock song in which the singer believes the contents of his house are planning to assassinate him.

'''Sheikh Kamal International Stadium''' ({{lang-bn|শেখ কামাল আন্তর্জাতিক স্টেডিয়াম}}), also known as '''Cox's Bazar Cricket Stadium''' ({{lang-bn|কক্সবাজার ক্রিকেট স্টেডিয়াম}}), is a newly developed [[cricket]] stadium in the tourist town of [[Cox's Bazar]], [[Bangladesh]].

It was built on leased land from [[Cox's Bazar Golf Course]]. The stadium was a shortlisted venue for the [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]], however it did not host any matches due to the construction of the ground not finishing in time for the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2014/content/story/683115.html|title=Sylhet wins, Cox's Bazaar misses out|date=27 October 2013|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first match played at the stadium was a [[Women's One Day International]] match between [[Bangladesh national women's cricket team|Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan national women's cricket team|Pakistan]] on 5 March 2014. It also hosted 2 matches of [[Youth's One Day International]] between [[Bangladesh national under-19 cricket team| Bangladesh]] and [[South Africa national Under-19 cricket team| South Africa]].

[[File:Memory-Text-shoes.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The plaque.]]
{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2014}}
The '''Shoes on the Danube Bank''' is a memorial in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. Conceived by film director [[Can Togay]], he created it on the east bank of the [[Danube River]] with sculptor [[Gyula Pauer]] to honour the Jews who were killed by [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Arrow Cross Party|Arrow Cross]] militiamen in Budapest during [[World War II]].  They were ordered to take off their shoes, and were shot at the edge of the water so that their bodies fell into the river and were carried away. It represents their shoes left behind on the bank.

==Memorial==
[[File:Shoes Danube Promenade IMGP1297.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The memorial.]]
The monument is located on the [[Pest (city)|Pest]] side of the [[Danube Promenade]] in line with where Zoltan Street would meet the Danube if it continued that far, about {{convert|300|m|ft}} south of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]] and near the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]; between Roosevelt Square and [[Kossuth tér|Kossuth square]].&lt;ref&gt;Népszabadság Online, April 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The composition titled 'Shoes on the Danube Bank' gives remembrance to the 3,500 people, 800 of them Jews, who were shot into the Danube during the time of the Arrow Cross terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sd7eAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=shoes+on+the+river+danube&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=shoes+on+the+river+danube&amp;f=false|title=Jews, Antisemitism, and the Middle East|first=Michael|last=Curtis|date=14 May 2018|publisher=Transaction Publishers|accessdate=14 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculptor created sixty pairs of period-appropriate shoes out of iron.  The shoes are attached to the stone embankment, and behind them lies a 40 meter long, 70 cm high stone bench.  At three points are cast iron signs, with the following text in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew: "To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944–45.  Erected 16 April 2005."&lt;ref&gt;MTI, Saturday, April 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of the Jews==
Most of the murders along the edge of the River Danube took place around December 1944 and January 1945, when the members of the [[Arrow Cross Party]] police ("Nyilas") took as many as 20,000 Jews from the newly established [[Budapest ghetto]] and executed them along the river bank.&lt;ref&gt;US Holocaust Memorial Museum, [https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005264].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommy Dick (writer)|Tommy Dick]] describes one surviving person's story from these operations in his book ''Getting Out Alive'' &lt;ref&gt;Goodreads books, [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213922-getting-out-alive].&lt;/ref&gt; and testimony.&lt;ref&gt;The Azrieli Foundation, [http://www.azrielifoundation.org/2014/05/the-last-victims-of-the-holocaust ].&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 1945, the Soviet forces liberated Budapest.

==January 1945==
During World War II, [[Valdemar Langlet]], head of the Swedish Red Cross in Budapest, with his wife Nina, and later the diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] and 250 coworkers were working around the clock to save the Jewish population from being sent to Nazi [[concentration camp]]s; this figure later rose to approximately 400. [[Lars Ernster|Lars]] and Edith Ernster, [[Jacob Steiner]], and many others were housed at the Swedish Embassy in Budapest on Üllői Street 2-4 and 32 other buildings throughout the city which Wallenberg had rented and declared as [[extraterritorial]]ly Swedish to try to safeguard the residents.

On the night of 8 January 1945, an Arrow Cross execution brigade forced all the inhabitants of the building on Vadasz Street to the banks of the Danube. At midnight, [[Karoly Szabo]] and 20 policemen with drawn [[bayonet]]s broke into the Arrow Cross house and rescued everyone (see also front page of 1947 newspaper below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacetime-sensor.de/wallenberg.htm|title=Karoly Szabo - Wallenberg, 1947, 1965|website=www.spacetime-sensor.de|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those saved were Lars Ernster, who fled to [[Sweden]] and became a member of the board of the [[Nobel Foundation]] from 1977 to 1988, and Jacob Steiner, who fled to [[Israel]] and became a professor at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Steiner's father had been shot dead by Arrow Cross militiamen 25 December 1944, and fell into the Danube.

In September 2014, the Israeli newspaper ''Ha'aretz'' reported that several bronze shoes were stolen from the Danube Holocaust memorial, citing the ''Budapest Beacon''. ''Ha'aretz'' noted that "it was not immediately clear whether the theft in Budapest, not far from the Hungarian parliament building, was an anti-Semitic act or a meaningless prank. Police said they were not investigating the case because no crime has been reported, said Hungarian newspaper ''Nepszabadsag''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.615154|title=Part of Holocaust Memorial Exhibit Stolen From Banks of Danube|first=|last=Haaretz|date=10 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8702">'''Stolipinovo''' ({{lang-bg|Столипиново}}) is a district of the Bulgarian city of [[Plovdiv]] and the most populous predominantly [[Romani people|Romani]]-inhabited district on the [[Balkans]]{{cn|date=April 2015}} with a population of about 50,000 people. It is a [[ghetto]] located on the outskirts of the city, in its northeastern part on the right bank of the [[Maritsa]].

[[Image:Stolipinovo_world_wind_20100820.jpg|right|300px|thumb|View northerly of Stolipinovo district, [[Plovdiv]] BG from [[NASA World Wind]].]]
Stolipinovo differs from other [[Roma in Bulgaria|Roma communities in Bulgaria]] as only 5,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanforum.net/news/18 European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025617/http://www.europeanforum.net/news/18 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabitants identify themselves as Christian and [[Romani language|romani-speaking]] Roma ("Dassikane Roma"), whereas the Muslim and [[Turkish language|Turkish-speaking]] majority claims to be of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] origin ("[[Xoraxane]] Roma").&lt;ref&gt;[http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/facta/pas/pas99/pas99-09.pdf "The Relations of Ethnic and Confessional Consciousness of Gypsies in Bulgaria", Elena Marushiakova, Vesselin Popov]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utilities==
Since the end of the socialist era in 1989 there have been almost no investments in the infrastructure of Stolipinovo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osservatoriobalcani.org/article/articleview/1035/1/43 osservatorio balcani, June 4, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In combination with the boom of illegal housing this led to severe problems with regards to electricity and water supply, sewerage and waste disposal.

Due to accumulated debts for electricity and water surpassing 3 million euro, in 2002 the (then state-owned) local supplier shut down electricity completely for all inhabitants of Stolipinovo. This kind of "kin liability" has been widely regarded as illegal by human rights organisations and led to a spontaneous riot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/power-cuts-spark-roma-riot/id_3923/catid_5 "Power Cuts Spark Roma Riot", sofiaecho.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After the situation calmed down, the district was supplied electricity for six hours per night. This regime has not yet been abolished, despite an October 31, 2006, ruling by the Plovdiv Regional Court, that the practice of the Austrian [[EVN Group|EVN]] monopolist was "discriminatory."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapool.bg/show/?storyid=123182&amp;srcpos=23 Режимът на тока в “Столипиново” – източник на дискриминация и корупция, mediapool.bg, 8. November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Stolipinovo is unique in having electricity [[distribution board]]s raised on poles several metres tall.

[[Sanitation]] is poor owing to the shortage of safe water, due to burst pipes. Piped water rarely reaches the highest floors of apartment buildings. In most of the illegal buildings there is no water supply at all. The sewers in Stolipinovo are mostly dysfunctional and overflowing, forming puddles in the streets. Illegal buildings are not connected at all. Household waste is typically hurled from windows and balconies of apartments onto heaps on the ground below.

Inevitably, these problems caused a [[Hepatitis A|hepatitis type A]] epidemic in the summer of 2006 which affected at least 637 persons in Stolipinovo, and spread to other parts of the city, [[Sheker Mahala]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''886 са заболелите от вирусен хепатит А в Пловдив | publisher=Plovdiv24.bg | url=http://news.plovdiv24.com//19318.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201191721/http://news.plovdiv24.com//19318.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=February 1, 2013 | accessdate=August 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, RIOKOZ of the [[Ministry of Health of Bulgaria|Ministry of Health]] completed a mass immunisation campaign of children in Plovdiv by the end of October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=''Завърши имунизацията против вирусен хепатит „А” в "Столипиново", "Шекер махала" и "Аджисан махала"| publisher=BG NewsRoom| url=http://bgnewsroom.com/singlenews/?ID=6840| accessdate=August 31, 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724225820/http://bgnewsroom.com/singlenews/?ID=6840| archivedate=July 24, 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other emergency measures undertaken by the municipality included dismantlement of illegal kiosks that had lined the streets and disposal of refuse left uncollected for years.

===Electricity debt===
The nonpayment of the bills for household services leads to accumulation of a debt that amounts to 3 million EUR for electricity and water supply. Due to this reason, in 2002 the local electricity company /by that time state-owned/ began cutting off the electricity supply of all inhabitants of Stolipinovo. This “joint responsibility” was considered as illegal approach by the human rights organizations and led to spontaneous riots in Stolipinovo. After the situation was all set up, the neighbourhood was put on a regime – electricity supply was on for six hours at night. The state company also decided to place electricity meters in exterior boards that were fixed several meters above the ground – something that appears to be a practice in the neighbourhoods inhabited with Roma people in Bulgaria. On October 31, 2006 the District Court in [[Plovdiv]] pronounced a decision, with which the electricity regime in Stolipinovo was proclaimed discriminatory.

The overcoming of this humanitarian and economic problem, which had been neglected for many years, was undertaken by [[EVN Group|EVN]] Bulgaria – a subsidiary of the Austrian utility company, which in 2004 acquired the Electricity Distributing Companies in South Eastern Bulgaria and inherited the debts, the regime, the damaged electricity grid, and the problematic relations with the clients. Company’s experts prepared a complete technical project, a programme for public-private partnership and an information campaign, the implementation of which took almost a year. The electricity grid was entirely renovated, including the installation of new on-ground boards, which allows a visual control on the readings of the electricity meters on behalf of the clients.

The project paid attention also to activities for improvement of the supplier-client relations. The old payments were stretched out according to a socially bearable scheme. Within the work on the project a lot of families, who had previously been illegally joined to the grid, were separated as new subscribers in compliance with the legal requirements. On one hand this improved the relations with the clients, and on the other restored their faith in the company. [[EVN Group|EVN]] appointed [[Romani people]] to consulting positions working in the neighbourhood. Their obligations are to consult the clients upon comprehending the readings of their electricity meters as well as to carry out information campaigns directed to energy efficiency. Company’s cash desks facilitating payments were opened in the neighbourhood.

As a result, since 2007 the Roma community in Stolipinovo has started receiving 24-hour electricity supply. About 3 million EUR has been invested in the entire replacement of 185 kilometers of electricity grid, renovation or construction of a total of 17 transformer stations, opening of 4 cash desks on the territory of the neighbourhood, joining 6 400 subscribers to the grid. Success has been achieved, which few believed in before: the collectability in the neighbourhood has been raised from 3% in 2006 to 85% after the fulfillment of the project, and the technological losses decreased from 40% to 5%. The success in Stolipinovo reassured the management of [[EVN Group|EVN]] Bulgaria to apply the programme in other Roma-inhabited neighbourhoods on the territory of South Eastern Bulgaria and to ensure electricity supply according to all present-day standards.

{{More footnotes|date=August 2009}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''stratum''' ([[Latin]] for "layer") or '''strate''' is a [[language]] that influences, or is influenced by another through [[language contact|contact]]. A '''substratum''' or '''substrate''' is a language that has lower power or prestige than another, while a '''superstratum''' or '''superstrate''' is the language that has higher power or prestige. Both substratum and superstratum languages influence each other, but in different ways. An '''adstratum''' or '''adstrate''' refers to a language that is in contact with another language in a neighbor population without having identifiably higher or lower prestige. The notion of "strata" was first developed by the Italian linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli (1829–1907), and became known in the English-speaking world through the work of two different authors in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Don't the English Speak Welsh?" Hildegard Tristram, in ''The Britons in Anglo-Saxon England'', N. J. Higham (ed.), The Boydell Press, pp. 192–214. [http://www.hildegard.tristram.de/media/tristram_manchester_30-07-07.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, both terms refer to a situation where an intrusive language establishes itself in the territory of another, typically as the result of [[human migration|migration]]. Whether the superstratum case (the local language persists and the intrusive language disappears) or the substratum one (the local language disappears and the intrusive language persists) applies will normally only be evident after several generations, during which the intrusive language exists within a [[diaspora]] culture. In order for the intrusive language to persist (''substratum'' case), the immigrant population will either need to take the position of a political [[elite]] or immigrate in significant numbers relative to the local population (i. e., the intrusion qualifies as an [[invasion]] or [[colonisation]]; an example would be the [[Roman Empire]] giving rise to [[Romance languages]] outside Italy, displacing [[Gaulish]] and many other [[Indo-European languages]]). The ''superstratum'' case refers to elite populations that eventually adopt the language of the lower classes. An example would be the [[Burgundians]] and [[Franks]] in France, who eventually abandoned their Germanic dialects in favor of other Indo-European languages of the Romance branch, profoundly influencing the local speech in the process.

==Substratum {{anchor|Substratum}}== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Saterland Frisian language]]. --&gt;

A substratum (plural: substrata) or substrate is a language that influences an intrusive language that supplants it. The term is also used of substrate interference; i.e. the influence the substratum language exerts on the replacing language. According to some classifications, this is one of three main types of [[language transfer|linguistic interference]]: substratum interference differs from both [[adstratum]], which involves no language replacement but rather mutual borrowing between languages of equal "value", and [[superstratum]], which refers to the influence a socially dominating language has on another, receding language that might eventually be relegated to the status of a substratum language.

In a typical case of substrate interference, a Language A occupies a given territory and another Language B arrives in the same territory (brought, for example, with migrations of population). Language B then begins to supplant language A: the speakers of Language A abandon their own language in favor of the other language, generally because they believe that it will help them achieve certain goals within government, the workplace, and in social settings. During the language shift, however, the receding language A still influences language B (for example, through the transfer of [[loanword]]s, [[place name]]s, or grammatical patterns from A to B).

In most cases, the ability to identify substrate influence in a language requires knowledge of the structure of the substrate language. This can be acquired in numerous ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|first=Janne|last=Saarikivi|title=Substrata Uralica: Studies on Finno-Ugrian substrate influence in Northern Russian dialects|year=2006|type=Ph.D.|publisher=University of Helsinki|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The substrate language, or some later descendant of it, still survives in a part of its former range;
* Written records of the substrate language may exist to various degree;
* The substrate language itself may be unknown entirely, but it may have surviving close relatives that can be used a base of comparison.

One of the first-identified cases of substrate influence is an example of a substrate language of the second type: Gaulish, from the ancient Celtic people the Gauls. The [[Gauls]] lived in the modern French-speaking territory before the arrival of the [[Roman empire|Romans]], namely the invasion of Julius Caesar's army. Given the cultural, economic and political advantages that came with being a Latin speaker, the Gauls eventually abandoned their language in favor of the language brought to them by the Romans, which evolved in this region until eventually it took the form of the French language that is known today. The Gaulish speech disappeared in the late Roman era, but remnants of its vocabulary survive in some French words (approximately 200) as well as place-names of Gaulish origin. It is also posited that some structural changes in French were shaped at least in part by Gaulish influence&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Pellegrini, "Substrata", in ''Romance Comparative and Historical Linguistics'', ed. Rebecca Posner et al. (The Hague: Mouton de Gruyter, 1980), 65.&lt;/ref&gt; including diachronic sound changes and [[sandhi]] phenomena due to the retention of Gaulish phonetic patterns after the adoption of Latin,&lt;ref&gt;Henri Guiter, "Sur le substrat gaulois dans la Romania", in ''Munus amicitae. Studia linguistica in honorem Witoldi Manczak septuagenarii'', eds., Anna Bochnakowa &amp; Stanislan Widlak, Krakow, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugeen Roegiest, ''Vers les sources des langues romanes: Un itinéraire linguistique à travers la Romania'' (Leuven, Belgium: Acco, 2006), 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Yves Lambert]], ''La Langue gauloise'' (Paris: Errance, 1994), 46-7. {{ISBN|978-2-87772-224-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[calque]]s such as ''aveugle'' ("blind", literally without eyes, from Latin ''ab oculis'', which was a calque on the Gaulish word ''exsops'' with the same semantic construction as modern French)&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Yves Lambert]], ''La Langue gauloise'' (Paris: Errance, 1994), 158. {{ISBN|978-2-87772-224-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other Celtic calques possibly including "oui", the word for yes,&lt;ref name="Matasovic"&gt;Matasović, Ranko. 2007. “Insular Celtic as a Language Area”. In Tristam, Hildegard L.C. 2007, ''The Celtic Languages in Contact''. Bonn: Papers from the Workship within the Framework	of the XIII International Congress of Celtic Studies. Page 106.&lt;/ref&gt; while syntactic and morphological effects are also posited.&lt;ref name="Matasovic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savignac, Jean-Paul. 2004. ''Dictionnaire Français-Gaulois''. Paris: La Différence. Pages 26, 294-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Filppula, Markku, Klemola, Juhani and Paulasto, Heli. 2008. ''English and Celtic in Contact''. New York: Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Pages 77-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of substrate languages are the influence of the now extinct [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] [[Norn language]] on the [[Scots language|Scots]] dialects of the [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]] and [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]] islands. In the Arab [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], colloquial [[Arabic language|Arabic]] dialects, most especially [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]], [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]], and [[Maghreb Arabic|Maghreb]] dialects, often exhibit significant substrata from other regional Semitic (especially [[Aramaic]]), Iranian, and Berber languages. [[Yemeni Arabic]] has [[Modern South Arabian]], [[Old South Arabian]] and [[Himyarite language|Himyaritic]] substrata.

Typically, [[Creole language]]s have multiple substrata, with the actual influence of such languages being indeterminate.

===Unattested substrata===
In the absence of all three lines of evidence mentioned above, linguistic substrata may be difficult to detect. Substantial indirect evidence is needed to infer the former existence of a substrate. The nonexistence of a substrate is [[Evidence of absence|difficult to show]],&lt;ref name="Matasovic14"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ranko|last=Matasović|authorlink=Ranko Matasović|title=Substratum words in Balto-Slavic|journal=Filologija|issue=60|year=2014|pp=75–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to avoid digressing into speculation, [[Burden of proof (philosophy)|burden of proof]] must lie on the side of the scholar claiming the influence of a substrate. The principle of [[uniformitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Don|last=Ringe|title=The Linguistic Diversity of Aboriginal Europe|website=[[Language Log]]|date=2009-01-06|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=980|accessdate=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and results from the study of [[Human evolutionary genetics|human genetics]] suggest that many languages have formerly existed that have since then been replaced under expansive language families, such as Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Uralic or Bantu. However, it is not a given that such expansive languages would have acquired substratum influence from the languages they have replaced.

Several examples of this type of substratum have still been claimed. For example, the earliest form of the [[Germanic languages]] may have [[Germanic substrate hypothesis|been influenced by a non-Indo-European language]], purportedly the source of about one quarter of the most ancient Germanic vocabulary. There are similar arguments for a [[substrate in Vedic Sanskrit|Sanskrit substrate]], a [[Pre-Greek substrate|Greek one]], and a substrate underlying the [[Sami languages]]. Relatively clear examples are the [[Chude]], [[Merya]], [[Muromian]] and [[Meshchera]]n languages: while unattested, their existence has been noted in medieval chronicles, and one or more of them have left substantial influence in the [[Northern Russian dialects]]. By contrast more contentious cases are the [[Vasconic substratum theory]] and [[Old European hydronymy]], which hypothesize large families of substrate languages across western Europe. Some smaller-scale unattested substrates that remain under debate involve alleged extinct branches of the Indo-European family, such as "[[Nordwestblock]]" substrate in the Germanic languages, and a "Temematic" substrate in [[Balto-Slavic]] (proposed by [[Georg Holzer]]).&lt;ref name="Matasovic14"/&gt;

When a substrate language or its close relatives cannot be directly studied, their investigation is rooted in the study of [[etymology]] and [[linguistic typology]]. The study of unattested substrata often begins from the study of ''substrate words'', which lack a clear etymology.&lt;ref name="Leschber16"&gt;{{cite book|first=Corinna|last=Leschber|contribution=On the stratification of substratum languages|title=Etymology and the European Lexicon: Proceedings of the 14th Fachtagung der Indogermanischen Gesellschaft, 17–22 September 2012, Copenhagen|year=2016|location=Wiesbaden|publisher=Reichert Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such words can in principle still be native inheritance, lost everywhere else in the language family; but they might in principle also originate from a substrate.&lt;ref name="Schrijver97"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Schrijver|contribution=Animal, vegetable and mineral: some Western European substratum words|year=1997|title=Sound Law and Analogy|pp=293–316|editor-first=A.|editor-last=Lubotsky|location=Amsterdam/Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound structure of words of unknown origin — their [[phonology]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] — can often suggest hints in either direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael|last=Witzel|title=Early Sources for South Asian Substrate Languages|journal=Mother Tongue|year=1999|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/%7Ewitzel/MT-Substrates.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matasovic14"/&gt; So can their meaning: words referring to the natural landscape, in particular indigenous fauna and flora, have often been found especially likely to derive from substrate languages.&lt;ref name="Schrijver97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matasovic14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leschber16"/&gt; None of these conditions, however, is sufficient by itself to claim any one word as originating from an unknown substratum.&lt;ref name="Matasovic14"/&gt; Occasionally words that have been proposed to be of substrate origin will be found out to have cognates in more distantly related languages after all, and therefore likely native: an example is Proto-Indo-European ''*mori'' 'sea', found widely in the northern and western Indo-European languages, but in more eastern Indo-European languages only in [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]].&lt;ref name="Schrijver97"/&gt;

==Superstratum==
A superstratum (plural: superstrata) or superstrate offers the counterpart to a substratum. When one language succeeds another, linguists label the succeeding language a superstratum and the earlier language a substratum.

A superstrate may also represent an imposed linguistic element akin to what occurred with [[English language|English]] and [[Norman language|Norman]] after the Norman Conquest of 1066 when use of the English language carried low prestige. The [[international scientific vocabulary]] coinages from Greek and Latin roots adopted by European languages (and subsequently by other languages) to describe scientific topics (sociology, zoology, philosophy, botany, medicine, all "[[-logy]]" words, etc.) can also be termed a superstratum, although for this last case, "[[adstratum]]" might be a better designation (despite the prestige of science and of its language). In the case of [[French language|French]], for example, [[Latin]] is the superstrate and [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] the substrate.

Some linguists contend that [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (and [[Japonic languages]] in general) consists of an Altaic superstratum projected onto an [[Austronesian language|Austronesian]] substratum.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict (1990), Lewin (1976), Matsumoto (1975), Miller (1967), Murayama (1976), Shibatani (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also argue for the existence of [[Altaic]] superstrate influences on [[varieties of Chinese]] spoken in [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Interrupted: Signs of Non-Native Acquisition in Standard Language Grammars|first=John|last=McWhorter|chapter=Mandarin Chinese: "Altaicization" or Simplification?|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, however, the superstratum refers to influence, not language succession. Alternate views detect ''sub''strate effects.&lt;ref&gt;Hashimoto (1986), Janhunen (1996), McWhorter (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adstratum==
An adstratum (plural: adstrata) or adstrate is a language that through its [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] is a source of lexical borrowings to another. Generally, the term is used about languages in particular geolinguistic or geopolitical contexts. For example, early in [[England]]'s history, [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] contributed an adstrate to the lexical structure of [[Old English]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''take'' replaced earlier ''niman'' in the lexical slot of a transitive verb for "to take", though archaic forms of ''to nim'' survived in England.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon is less common today in standardized linguistic varieties and more common in colloquial forms of speech since modern nations tend to favour one single linguistic variety (often corresponding to the [[dialect]] of the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and other important regions) over others. In [[India]], where dozens of languages are widespread, many languages could be said to share an adstratal relationship, but [[Hindi]] is certainly a dominant adstrate in [[North India]]. A different example would be the sociolinguistic situation in [[Belgium]], where the [[French language|French]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] languages have roughly the same status, and could justifiably be called adstrates to each other having each one provided a remarkable set of lexical specifications to the other.

The term is also used to identify systematic influences or a layer of borrowings in a given language from another language independently of whether the two languages continue coexisting as separate entities. Many modern languages have an appreciable adstratum from English due to the cultural influence and economic preponderance of the United States on international markets and previously colonization by the [[British Empire]] which made English a global [[lingua franca]]. The Greek and Latin coinages adopted by European languages (including English and now languages worldwide) to describe scientific topics (sociology, medicine, anatomy, biology, all the '-[[logy]]' words, etc.) are also justifiably called adstrata. Another example is found in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], which contain a heavy Semitic (particularly Arabic) adstratum; and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], which is a linguistic variety of [[High German]] with adstrata from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], mostly in the sphere of religion, and [[Slavic languages]], by reason of the geopolitical contexts Yiddish speaking villages lived through for centuries before disappearing during the Holocaust.

The '''Texas–U.S.S.R. Musicians' Exchange''' was a 1987 cultural exchange tour of the [[Soviet Union]] featuring a group of musicians from [[Texas]]. Among the musicians who performed on the tour were [[Butch Hancock]], Tomas Ramirez, [[Bobby Bridger]], Elouise Burrell, [[Bobby Mack]], Mike Shea, Deborah Giles, Bruce Truitt, Tom Ash, Steve Zirkel, Ron Rogers, Natasha Geddie, Jean Marie Houston, Bobby Williams, Ralph Taylor and Steve Parkess, who originally conceived of the project. The group performed and interacted with local musicians, artists and music fans in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], [[Moscow]] and [[Kiev]], and after leaving the Soviet Union the group opened for [[Chris Isaak]] at a concert in [[Helsinki, Finland]].  A limited-edition [[silk-screen]] print was created by [[graphic artist]] [[Nels Jacobson|Nels “Jagmo” Jacobson]] to publicize and commemorate the tour.

&lt;!-- NOTE: As the light novel is the PRIMARY work, the summary should be written for the light novel, not the manga or anime. --&gt;
In the 21st century, Earth is in a rapidly declining economic state and the {{nihongo|Integrated Enterprise Foundation|統合企業財体|Tōgō Kigyō Zaitai|also "Integrated Empire Foundation"}}, a [[megacorporation]], is created after the [[impact event]] {{nihongo|Invertia|{{ruby|落星雨|インヴェルティア}}|Inverutia}} destroyed most of the planet's cities and resulted in humans gaining superpowers to become the {{nihongo|Genestella|{{ruby-ja|星脈世代|ジェネステラ}}|Jenesutera}}. The city of {{nihongo|Rikka|六花}}, also called Asterisk, has six academies where the Genestella participate in tournaments called {{nihongo|"Festas"|{{ruby|星武祭|フェスタ}}|Fesuta}}. Battle performances at {{nihongo|Seidoukan Academy|星導館学園|Seidōkan Gakuen}}, the city's fifth top-ranking academy, are falling significantly and student council president, Claudia Enfield, is determined to find a solution. Kirin Toudou is the academy's top fighter, but Claudia, as well as Lieseltanian princess, Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld, are close behind.

Meanwhile, Ayato Amagiri investigates the disappearance of his sister, Haruka, a former student at Seidoukan. During his first day at the academy, Ayato is forced to fight Julis after discovering her half-dressed when returning her handkerchief to her. Claudia voids their duel and enrolls Ayato in Seidoukan. After rescuing Julis from a plot to cripple the Phoenix Festa, he sets out to become her protector and close friend. Eventually, Ayato wins against Kirin and is named the new top student at the academy. After Ayato participates in the Phoenix Festa with Julis to solve Seidoukan's performance crisis, they continue to participate in various Festas and also fight threats outside of the academy.
