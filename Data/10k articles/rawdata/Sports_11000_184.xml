'''[[List of association football clubs|Association Football club]] names''' are a part of the [[association football|sport]]'s culture, reflecting century-old traditions.  Club names may reflect the geographical, cultural, religious or political affiliations&amp;nbsp;– or simply be the brand name of a club's primary sponsor.  Because of the British [[History of association football|origin of the modern game]] and the prevalence of the English language, many clubs, even outside Europe, have their names written in English.

Official names often also contain common component (prepositions, conjunctions, etc.)

In Europe, many (if not most) clubs are named after their towns or cities (e.g. "[[Deportivo La Coruña]]", "[[Liverpool F.C.]]", "[[Hamburger SV]]"). In South America, clubs are more likely to have names that don't bear the city's name. Some clubs, like [[Hansa Rostock]] or [[Torpedo Moscow]] may have both.

==Common versus official usage==
{{See also|Lists of nicknames in association football}}
It is not uncommon for a club to be known in common usage by a name other than its official name, or the name on the badge.

Other clubs are more usually known by [[nicknames]] or contractions of their full names, for instance, [[Clube de Regatas Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] is usually called simply "Vasco", [[F.C. Internazionale Milano]] is contracted to ''Inter'' or ''Inter Milan'', [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] is often called ''Sporting'' or ''Sporting Lisbon''. [[Manchester United]] is often shortened to ''Man Utd'', and ''Lyon'' used instead of [[Olympique Lyonnais]].

Some clubs are commonly referred to by their initials, such as PSG for [[Paris Saint-Germain]] and PNE for Preston North End.

The '''Bergisel Ski Jump''' ({{lang-de|Bergiselschanze}}), whose stadium has a capacity of 26,000,&lt;ref&gt;http://berkutschi.com/de/front/hills/berg-isel&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[ski jumping hill]] located in [[Bergisel]] in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]]. It is one of the more important venues in the [[FIS Ski Jumping World Cup]], annually hosting the third competition of the prestigious [[Four Hills Tournament]].

Its first competitions were held in the 1920s using simple wood [[construction]]s. The larger hill was first built in 1930 and was rebuilt before the [[1964 Winter Olympics]] for the [[Ski jumping at the 1964 Winter Olympics|individual large hill event]]. [[1976 Winter Olympics|Twelve years later]], the venue hosted the [[Ski jumping at the 1976 Winter Olympics|same event]]. The hill in its current form was finished in 2003 and was designed by the [[Iraqis in the United Kingdom|British Iraqi]] [[architect]] [[Zaha Hadid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmwa.gv.at/BMWA/Presse/Archiv2002/2002121302.htm BMWA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040818174741/http://www.bmwa.gv.at/BMWA/Presse/Archiv2002/2002121302.htm |date=August 18, 2004 }} Austrian National Architecture Prize 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes at the Games compete in workouts that they learn about hours or days beforehand, consisting mostly of an assortment of standard aerobic, weightlifting, and gymnastics movements, as well as some additional surprise elements that are not part of the typical CrossFit regimen such as [[obstacle course]]s, ocean swimming, softball throwing, or ascending a pegboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://games.crossfit.com/article/major-announcement-individuals|title=Major Announcement for Individuals|website=CrossFit Games|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mensfitness.com/training/pro-tips/why-pegboard-challenge-crossfit-games-was-such-beast|title=Why the Pegboard Challenge at the CrossFit Games Was Such a Beast|website=Men's Fitness|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CrossFit Games stylizes their individual winners as the "Fittest on Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crossfit-and-btwb-unite-to-help-athletes-and-affiliates-improve-health-300670112.html |title=CrossFit And BTWB Unite To Help Athletes And Affiliates Improve Health |work=[[PR Newswire]] |date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2007, the first annual CrossFit Games were contested in [[Aromas, California]], on a small ranch owned by the family of Games director Dave Castro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.crossfit.com/2010/07/games-history.tpl|title=The History of the CrossFit Games by Dave Castro|website=CrossFit Journal|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the initial Games in 2007 and 2008, participation was open to anyone who made it to Aromas. The Games would also award an Affiliate Cup to the group from one CrossFit gym that had the best combined individual standings. In 2009, competitors had to qualify after over a hundred athletes had shown up in 2008. The athletes earned an invitation through either placing high enough in the previous year or through placing in the top worldwide in a set of qualifying events called Regionals hosted at a few CrossFit gyms. The CrossFit Games also added a separate set of team-based events for the Affiliate Cup, marking the first use of a designated Team Division, with teams of four (two men and two women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://games2009.crossfit.com/starthere.html |title=Start Here: An Introduction to the CrossFit Games |publisher=2009 CrossFit Games |access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest and participation in the event continued to grow, and in 2010, the qualification was adjusted to include hosting multiple Sectionals, a series of events open to all athletes in order to qualify for the one of the 17 Regionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://games.crossfit.com/region|title=Regionals|website=CrossFit Games|access-date=2016-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504044746/http://games.crossfit.com/region|archive-date=2016-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17 regions had Canada and the United States divided into 12 regions, with the remaining regions roughly corresponding the five other populated continents. The attendance at the Games also outgrew the ranch in Aromas and moved the [[Home Depot Center]] (later called the StubHub Center) in [[Carson, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://games.crossfit.com/article/games-tickets-2015|title=Games Tickets in 2015|website=CrossFit Games|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Games also expanded the Team Division to groups of six athletes and added a Masters Division for individual men and women 55-years-old and up.

In 2011, the open participation Sectionals were replaced by an online qualification called the Open. In 2011, 26,000 athletes signed up to compete in the Open. In 2012–2018, participation was 69,000, 138,000, 209,000, 273,000, 324,307, 380,000, and 415,000 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CrossFit®|title=Stats From the 2016 Open|date=2016-04-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9W-0bpqG_s|accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tabatatimes.com/how-fast-are-the-crossfit-games-growing-the-numbers-tell-the-story/ |title=How Fast Are the CrossFit Games Growing?

In 2015, the qualification format changed from 17 regional events to eight. Each "super-regional" event included qualifiers from two or three of the previously defined regions, totaling 40 or 50 athletes at each event.

Following seven years in Carson, the Games moved to the [[Alliant Energy Center]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/crossfit-games-moving-to-madison/article_771c7470-6841-5d7a-b65f-d9a93eab1691.html |title=CrossFit Games moving to Madison |publisher=''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' |date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the qualifying Regionals were once again realigned due to increased competitiveness and popularity outside of Canada and the US.&lt;ref name = "2018Changes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://games.crossfit.com/article/change-coming-2018-season/liftoff |title=CHANGE IS COMING TO THE 2018 SEASON |publisher=CrossFit Games |date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, there were nine Regionals hosted among 18 redefined regions with Europe increasing to three regions, Central America split from South America, while eliminating the Northern and Southern California regions.

CrossFit, Inc. founder Greg Glassman has stated that the format for the 2019 games will be changed again with the replacement of the typical Regionals for CrossFit-sanctioned international qualifying events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://morningchalkup.com/2018/08/23/how-greg-glassman-is-reshaping-the-crossfit-games/ |title=How Greg Glassman is Reshaping the CrossFit Games |website=MorningChalkUp.com |date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the changes, the 2019 games athletes qualify through being the top individual and team finishers from the sanctioned events, the top athlete from each country in the CrossFit Open, the top 20 overall finishers in the CrossFit Open, and four at-large athletes as chosen by CrossFit, Inc. Teams also no longer need to be created from one CrossFit-affiliated gym and can be formed from any four competitors.&lt;ref name="4more"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crossfit-announces-four-more-sanctioned-events-on-four-continents-300717444.html |title=CrossFit Announces Four More Sanctioned Events on Four Continents |website=prnewswire.com |date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sponsorship and prize money===
Participation and sponsorship have grown rapidly since the inception of the Games. The prize money awarded to each first-place male and female increased from $500 at the inaugural Games to $275,000 from 2013 to 2016. The largest jump in prize money came from the first Games sponsored by [[Reebok]] in 2011 when first place went from $25,000 in 2010 to $250,000 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sportsmoney/2011/07/22/crossfits-relationship-with-reebok-enhances-its-financial-and-commercial-credibility/#5d0d02653ab2 |title=CrossFit's Relationship with Reebok Enhances Its Financial and Commercial Credibility |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total prize payout in 2016 was $2,200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://games.crossfit.com/article/crossfit-games-prize-purse-grows |title=CrossFit Games Prize Purse Grows |publisher=CrossFit Games |date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of qualification (2019)==
As of the 2019 CrossFit Games, the season consisted of three stages of competition: the Open, sanctioned events, and the Games themselves. This format was changed for the 2019 season, in which the CrossFit, Inc. hosted Regionals were replaced by independently run CrossFit-sanctioned events.

===The Open===
The Open, introduced in [[2011 CrossFit Games|2011]] and so called because participation is open to anyone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://games.crossfit.com/about-the-games|title=About the Games|website=CrossFit Games|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; is held over five weeks in February–March; a new workout is released on each Thursday night ([[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]) and competitors complete the workout and submit their scores online by Monday evening, with either a video or validation by a CrossFit affiliate. Since 2013, Open workout announcements have been broadcast live, and featured two or more past CrossFit Games athletes competing head-to-head immediately following the workout description. Beginning with the 2019 Games, the top athlete from each country and the top 20 overall Open finishers qualify directly to the Games.

===Sanctioned events===
Between 2009 and 2018, competitors would qualify for the Games through participation an the Regionals. For the 2019 Games, CrossFit, Inc. decided to discontinue hosting the Regional qualifier and instead sanctioned previous independent fitness events as qualifiers separate from the Open. These sanctioned events were already widely participated in by CrossFit Games athletes, often used as a part of off-season training, around the world.

As of November 1, 2018, the sanctioned events for the [[2019 CrossFit Games]] are in chronological order: Dubai CrossFit Championship ([[Dubai]]), Wodapalooza ([[Miami]]), Australian CrossFit Championship ([[Broadbeach]]), CrossFit Fittest in [[Cape Town]], CrossFit Strength in Depth ([[London]]), CrossFit French Throwdown ([[Paris]]), Asia CrossFit Championship ([[Shanghai]]), Mid-Atlantic CrossFit Challenge ([[Baltimore]]), CrossFit Italian Showdown ([[Milan]]), Brazil CrossFit Championship ([[São Paulo]]), CrossFit Lowlands Throwdown ([[Apeldoorn]]), Down Under CrossFit Championship ([[Wollongong]]), Reykjavik CrossFit Championship ([[Reykjavik]]), [[Rogue Fitness|Rogue]] Invitational ([[Columbus, Ohio]]), and the Granite Games ([[St. Cloud, Minnesota]]).&lt;ref name="4more"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crossfit-inc-officially-sanctions-global-fitness-festival-wodapalooza-300722068.html |title=CrossFit, Inc. Officially Sanctions Global Fitness Festival Wodapalooza |website=PRNewswire.com |date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://morningchalkup.com/2018/10/10/crossfit-firms-up-games-changes-announces-four-sanctioned-events/ |title=CrossFit Firms Up Games Changes, Announces Four New Sanctioned Events |website=MorningChalkUp.com |date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/five-new-crossfit-sanctioned-competitive-events-announced-300739201.html |title=Five New CrossFit-Sanctioned Competitive Events Announced |website=PRNewswire.com |date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://barbend.com/2019-crossfit-games-rogue-invitational/ |title=16th Sanctioned Event Announced for the 2019 CrossFit Games |website=BarBend.com |date=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
The top athletes from each sanctioned event, each national champion in the Open, the top twenty overall finishers in the Open, and four at-large invitees advance to the CrossFit Games, which are held over three days in July or August.

==Divisions==
===Individual===
The marquee events at the CrossFit Games are the men's and women's individual competitions.  The first place prize for each currently stands at $300,000.

===Team===
Originally, teams were awarded the "Affiliate Cup" for having the best overall score from the individual athletes that had come from the same CrossFit-affiliated gym. In 2009, the Games began having a separate set of events for affiliate teams and consisted of four to six athletes from the same gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://games2009.crossfit.com/affiliatecup/the-crossfit-games-2009-affiliate-cup-challenge.html |title=Affiliate Cup Registration Opens Monday, May 11th |website=games2009.crossfit.com |date=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next season, the format was finalized to teams of three men and three women. In the 2018 games, each team was changed to four members, two men and two women.&lt;ref name = "2018Changes"/&gt; In 2019, CrossFit removed the stipulation that team members had to be from the same affiliate. Teams are subject to a similar qualification process as the individuals.

===Masters and Teens===
The Games include age-based divisions for younger and older competitors.  Masters divisions were introduced at the 2010 Games.  There are currently six divisions each for women and men: 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, and 60+.  Divisions for teenagers were introduced in 2015: the age ranges are 14–15 and 16–17, for both boys and girls. Rather than regional events, masters and teen athletes qualify for the games by a second online competition following the Open. The top 200 athletes in each division worldwide are invited to compete in this qualifier, of which the top 20 advance to the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://games.crossfit.com/article/2017-reebok-crossfit-games-season-schedule |title=2017 REEBOK CROSSFIT GAMES SEASON SCHEDULE |publisher=CrossFit Games |date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the introduction of these secondary online qualifiers, masters and teens competitors qualified for the Games directly from the Open.

==Controversies==
Due to CrossFit's official partnership with [[Reebok]], competitors at the [[2015 CrossFit Games|2015 Games]] were banned from wearing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] footwear.&lt;ref name="nikeban"&gt;{{cite web|title=CrossFit bans Nike shoe|url=http://www.mensfitness.com/life/gearandtech/crossfit-bans-nike-shoe|author=Lydia Bailey|publisher=[[Men's Fitness]]|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nike arranged for several trucks to be parked near the main entrance to the arena, which served as [[mobile billboards]] with the slogan "Don't ban our shoe, beat our shoe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nike Isn't Done Bullying Reebok Over CrossFit|url=http://solecollector.com/news/2015/07/nike-reebok-crossfit-games|author=Brendan Dunne|publisher=[[Sole collector|Sole Collector]]|date=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership also prohibits Nike from labeling its ''Metcon'' shoes as intended for CrossFit – the brand uses the term "high intensity training" instead.&lt;ref name="nikeban" /&gt;

CrossFit's decision to award winners of the [[2016 CrossFit Games|2016 Games]] with [[handguns]] resulted in widespread criticism from members and sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CrossFit Games come under fire for awarding Glocks as prizes|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-crossfit-games-glock-prizes-20160715-snap-htmlstory.html|author=Joseph Serna|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resulting protests forced the temporary closure of two CrossFit locations in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Gun LGBT Group Shuts Down Two CrossFit Locations Over Gun Giveaway|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gays-against-guns-crossfit-reeboks_us_5796448ce4b02d5d5ed24e7e|author=JamesMichael Nichols|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broadcasting ==
In 2011, [[ESPN]] began to broadcast the CrossFit Games, with live coverage streamed through [[ESPN3]], and some television coverage on [[ESPN2]]. As the event grew, ESPN expanded its television coverage; in 2014, the network entered into a multi-year deal to continue broadcasting the CrossFit Games, and coverage expanded to nine-and-a-half hours on ESPN and ESPN2 by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://boxlifemagazine.com/espn-the-crossfit-games-how-it-all-started-what-it-means-now-the-2015-tv-schedule/|title=ESPN &amp; the CrossFit Games: How It All Started &amp; What It Means Now (+ the 2015 TV Schedule)|work=BoxLife Magazine|access-date=2017-08-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the event began a new broadcast arrangement with [[CBS Sports]], with television coverage on [[CBS Sports Network]], and a total of 40 hours of digital streaming coverage. CrossFit also streamed coverage through [[Facebook]] and their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2017/08/04/crossfit-games-expand-pursuit-for-fittest-on-earth-with-new-network-partner-new-venue/|title=CrossFit Games Expand Pursuit of ‘Fittest on Earth’ With New Network Partner, New Venue|website=Sports Video Group|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deportes Magallanes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.svs.cl/institucional/mercados/entidad.php?auth=&amp;send=&amp;mercado=O&amp;rut=96913170&amp;grupo=&amp;tipoentidad=OTODP&amp;vig=VI&amp;row=AABcNzAB9AAAD62AAA&amp;control=svs&amp;pestania=1|title=DEPORTES MAGALLANES S.A.D.P. –  Identificacion – SVS|website=www.svs.cl|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a Chilean [[Football club|Football team]] based in San Bernardo, Chile. They currently play at the second level of Chilean football, the Primera B de Chile.

The club was founded on October 27, 1897 with the name Atlético Escuela Normal F.C.. In 1933 they became the first ever national champions of Chile. They won a hat trick of titles in the formative years of Chilean football (1933, 1934 and 1935) but their last major title came in 1938. Their latest participation in the first level was in 1986.

Deportes Magallanes, adopting their official name in 1904, is one of the oldest clubs in the country. Since the year 2000, after accepting the establishment of Policy number 20.019, the team has been managed by a [[Sociedad Anónima Deportiva|limited sports company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lmtavocats.de/fr/images_db/report_france_ba_2013__sport_ws_final.pdf|title=Football.

In this league, Magallanes won their first championship in 1933. In addition, they were the first club to win three consecutive professional championships in Chile.

The club adopted white and [[sky blue]] as their official colors in 1908. These colors are used in their sportswear as well as their [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|logo]], which depicts a [[Ship|Caravel]] on the ocean. Since August 2015, Magallanes has practiced in their hometown of San Bernardo&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=7b1da573-f07d-4852-b19d-d520e4443178@sessionmgr120&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=clelmercuriotxt267588&amp;db=pwh{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the city stadium, which seats 3,500 spectators. They often compete in the Metropolitan Classic against their longtime rival, [[Santiago Morning]]. In addition, they compete in a championship called de la Chilenidad, where they face off against another rival team, [[Colo-Colo]].

Magallanes is ranked sixth for national titles in the Premier Division, tying [[Everton de Viña del Mar]] and [[Audax Italiano]], with four each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chilechamp.html|title=Chile – List of Champions and Runners-up|website=rsssf.com|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been the runner up behind Colo-Colo, [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]], [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Católica]], [[C.D. Cobreloa|Cobreloa]] and [[Unión Española]]. They also have one title from the [[Chilean Tercera División|Third Division]] (Tercera Division),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/teams/chile/club-deportivo-magallanes/11184/trophies/|title=Chile – Club Deportivo Magallanes – Results, fixtures, squad, statistics, photos, videos and news – Soccerway|website=us.soccerway.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; one title from the [[Campeonato de Apertura (Chile)|Campeonato de Apertura]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=September 1, 2016|title=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rec.Sport.Soccer_Statistics_Foundation&amp;oldid=93335498|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; one from the Campeonato Relámpago and one from the Campeonato Absoluto. Despite their lack of titles in the last 70 years the club are still ranked as the seventh most successful team in the history of Chilean football.

'''Diamond Nation''' is a 65-acre baseball complex in [[Flemington, New Jersey|Flemington]], [[New Jersey]] that was established in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facility Overview|url=http://www.diamondnation.com/facility-overview.html|publisher=Diamond Nation|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to Jack Cust Baseball Academy and Jennie Finch Softball Academy making itself a premier baseball and softball tournament and training center in the country. Diamond Nation currently has seven fields in total. Five of them are with ninety foot base paths, which can be converted into two little league fields each. The other two are seventy foot base paths.

The New Jersey Diamond Jacks, which is run by Jack Cust Baseball Academy, was established as an elite 18U organization. The association has expanded to include teams from the 10U age to 18U.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamond Jacks|url=http://www.diamondnation.com/diamond-jacks.html|publisher=Diamond Nation|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple New Jersey high school baseball teams play games at Diamond Nation throughout the spring season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=James Kratch|title=Baseball: 8 Opening Day games to watch on Wednesday, April 1|url=http://highschoolsports.nj.com/news/article/-5151003507610760695/baseball-opening-day-games-to-watch-on-wednesday-april-1/|publisher=NJ.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=1 April 2015|quote=The game will be played at Diamond Nation in Flemington, so there should be no issues with getting this one in.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2012, Diamond Nation released '''Club Diamond Nation''' which is a virtual baseball and softball training academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cristina Rojas/Hunterdon County Democrat|title=Diamond Nation launching virtual baseball and softball academy July 20|url=http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2012/07/diamond_nation_launching_virtu.html|publisher=NJ.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, Diamond Nation made proposals to build another complex in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], [[Virginia]] that would be home to [[Minor League Baseball]] team, [[Hagerstown Suns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Benjamin Hill|title=Batting Around: A Minor League Baseball business roundup|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140116&amp;content_id=66676330&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_milb|publisher=[[Minor League Baseball]]|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=16 January 2014|quote=A 4,750-seat baseball stadium for the relocated minor league team and five artificial turf fields for Diamond Nation youth and amateur baseball and softball camps and tournaments will be built there.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facility ==
Located at Diamond Nation are the '''HealthQuest Fitness Club''', and the '''HealthQuest Sports Dome'''.  The Fitness Club was founded in 2001 and, open year round, is one of the top fitness clubs in the entire world with 104,000 square feet. The 140,000 square foot Sports Dome was built in 2003 and is the largest air structure in the [[United States]]. The Sports Dome temporarily covers HealthQuest Park from November to March to allow elite competition and training to continue to progress through the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hunterdon County Democrat|title=Inflatable dome rises over Raritan Township baseball academy for the 11th year|url=http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2012/11/inflatable_dome_rises_over_rar.html|publisher=NJ.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2443">'''Disqualifications in tennis''' can occur for unsporting conduct.

ATP rules state that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Players shall not at any time physically abuse any official, opponent, spectator or other person within the precincts of the tournament site. For purposes of this rule, physical abuse is the unauthorized touching of an official, opponent, and spectator or other person.{{cn|date=May 2013}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disqualified players==
Disqualifications in tennis are relatively rare:

*In 1990 [[John McEnroe]] was disqualified in his fourth-round match against [[Mikael Pernfors]] at the [[Australian Open]] for three code violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John McEnroe disqualified from the Australian Open|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/john-mcenroe-disqualified-from-the-australian-open|publisher=History.com|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*In 1995 [[Tim Henman]] was disqualified for hitting a ball girl with a shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18477343|title=Wimbledon archive: Henman disqualified for hitting ball girl|accessdate=2013-05-30|date=17 June 2012|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1996 [[Irina Spîrlea]] was disqualified for abusive language directed at an official.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/246797/Nova-and-out-for-shamed-Ana.html?print=yes Nova and out for shamed Ana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2007 [[Anastasia Rodionova]] was disqualified for hitting a ball at spectators cheering her opponent [[Angelique Kerber]]. Kerber was awarded the match 4–6, 6–4, 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6903967.stm BBC SPORT | Tennis | Russian disqualified in WTA event&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2012 [[David Nalbandian]] was disqualified for injuring an official after kicking an advertising board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2160617/Argentine-tennis-player-David-Nalbandian-booted-Queens-Club-final-wild-kick-line-judge.html?ito=feeds-newsxml Argentine tennis player David Nalbandian booted out of Queen's Club final after wild kick at line judge | Mail Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoiseach and fellow dual star Jack Lynch, athlete Sonia O'Sullivan|website=[[JOE.ie]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used in [[Irish English]] to describe someone who competes in multiple sports - for example in Victorian Ireland [[cricket]] and [[hurling]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sport and society in Victorian Ireland: the case of Westmeath'' Page 157 Tom Hunt - 2007 "The dual player was also common in Kilkenny cricket and hurling circles. ... In 1887 the Kells GAA club played a cricket match against Gaulstown of Tullaroan"&lt;/ref&gt; The term today in [[Gaelic games]] typically describes a male player who plays both [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] or, if a female player, a player of [[ladies' Gaelic football]] and [[camogie]]. The player does not necessarily have to play at the same standard in both sports. The number of dual stars at county level has decreased recently due to the increasing demands placed upon the best players of both sports.

In 1990, [[Teddy McCarthy]] of Cork became the first player to win both a football ''and'' a hurling All-Ireland in the same year. This unique achievement remains intact as of 2015.

Ex-[[Taoiseach]] [[Jack Lynch]] won one football and five hurling All-Irelands with Cork during the 1940s. To this day he is the only player in history to have won All-Ireland senior medals in six consecutive years.

==List of dual players with All Stars in both codes==
A few players have won [[GAA GPA All Stars Awards|All Star Awards]] in both codes. These include:
* [[Jimmy Barry-Murphy]]
* [[Ray Cummins]]
* [[Liam Currams]]
* [[Brian Murphy (dual player)|Brian Murphy]]

Ray Cummins has uniquely won an All Star Award in both hurling and Gaelic football in the same year, 1971.

==Dual county==
[[Dual county]] is a similar term for counties that have teams that play at the same level in both football and hurling.

==Unión Magdalena==
Since its opening in 1951, Estadio Eduardo Santos has been home to the [[football (soccer)|football]] club [[Unión Magdalena]], and witnessed the birth of prominent figures of Colombian football, including former captain Colombia Carlos '[[El pibe]]' ('The Kid') Valderrama.&lt;ref name=eltiempo&gt;{{Cite web|language=es|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/caribe/ARTICULO-WEB-PLANTILLA_NOTA_INTERIOR-7661107.html|title=Policía lidera campaña para recuperar el estadio Eduardo Santos, en Santa Marta|trans-title=Police lead campaign to recover Eduardo Santos stadium in Santa Marta|publisher=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]|author=Paola Benjumea Brito |date=23 March 2010 | accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a monumental sculpture of [[Carlos Valderrama]] was unveiled at the stadium entrance in a grand ceremony with fireworks attended by about 14,000 people, including 3,000 special guests.&lt;ref name=IEDJackeline&gt;{{cite web |language=es|url=http://prezi.com/kloedpkq4nkf/estadio-eduardo-santos|title=ESTADIO EDUARDO SANTOS|publisher=I.E.D Jackeline Kennedy|author=Jonny Parra Sanchez |date=25 March 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emol&gt;{{cite web |language=es|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2002/11/24/99212/levantan-monumento-en-honor-a-carlos-valderrama.html|title=Levantan monumento en honor a Carlos Valderrama|trans-title=Monument erected in honor of Carlos Valderrama|publisher=[[El Mercurio]] Online ([[emol]]) |date=24 November 2002|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 6.5 meter high, eight ton monument sculpted by [[Amilkar Ariza]], is considered the world's largest bronze for a footballer.&lt;ref name=IEDJackeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=emol/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariza&gt;{{cite web |language=es|url=http://www.fundacionamilkarariza.org/Pibe.php|title=Escultura Monumental Del "Pibe" Valderrama|trans-title=Monumental Sculpture of "El Pibe" Valderrama|publisher=Fundación Amilkar Ariza|author=[[Amilkar Ariza]]|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become the most visited sculpture in Santa Marta.&lt;ref name=IEDJackeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariza/&gt;

[[File:Westenberg.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A semi-professional ultimate game in North America]]

==History==
{{Main|Ken Westerfield|Flying disc freestyle}}
The flying disc was developed in 1948 by [[Walter Frederick Morrison|Walter Morrison]]. In 1957 January 13, [[Wham-O]] bought the rights to the invention and released it later under the trademarked name [[Frisbee]].

Although playing catch with discs as a pastime and proto-golf games are documented from the early 1900s, and doubtlessly has occurred from time to time before, disc sports began to flower in the late 1960s. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a frisbee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|url=https://www.amazon.com/Countercultural-Sports-America-History-Ultimate/dp/3838311957|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What started with a few players, in the sixties, like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and [[Ken Westerfield]] experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a disc, later would become known as playing [[Flying disc freestyle|disc freestyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freestyle Players Hall of Fame|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/hall-of-fame/|work=Inductees|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized disc sports, in the 1970s,  began with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada).  These took the form of [[Frisbee#Disc sports|national tournaments]] and Frisbee show tours at universities, fairs and sporting events. Disc sports such as [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]], [[double disc court]], [[Guts (game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc|work=History of the Flying Disc|accessdate=October 20, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095944/http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc|archivedate=October 19, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two sports, the team sport of [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi-professionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Disc Golf Association|url=http://www.pdga.com/|work=PDGA Official Website|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Ultimate Disc League|url=http://theaudl.com/|work=AUDL Official Website|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Flying Disc Federation]], [[Professional Disc Golf Association]], and the Freestyle Players Association, are the official sanctioning organizations for disc sports worldwide.

[[Guts (game)|Guts]] was invented by the Healy Brothers in the 1950s and developed at the International Frisbee Tournament (IFT) in [[Marquette, Michigan]]. [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]], the most widely played disc sport, began in the late 1960s with [[Joel Silver]] and Jared Kass. In the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with the creation of the [[Ultimate Players Association]] with Dan Roddick, Tom Kennedy and Irv Kalb. [[Double disc court]] was invented and introduced in the early 1970s by Jim Palmeri. In 1974, [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]] competition was created and introduced by [[Ken Westerfield]] and [[Discraft]]s Jim Kenner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Formative Years|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#chapter2|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging standards were developed by the Freestyle Players Association. In 1976, the game of [[disc golf]] was standardized with targets called "pole holes" invented and developed by [[Wham-O]]'s Ed Headrick and the [[Professional Disc Golf Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Ultimate Frisbee and Disc Sports|url=https://ultimatediscsport.com/|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1974, the International Frisbee Association (IFA), under the direction of Dan Roddick, became the regulatory organization for all of these sports.

==Ultimate==
[[File:Ultimate field.svg|360px|thumb|right|Ultimate playing field]]
{{main|Ultimate (sport)}}
Ultimate (also called Ultimate Frisbee) is a competitive non-contact [[team sport|team]] [[sport]]. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to a team member in the opposing teams end zone. Players may not run while holding the disc. Catching is done with one hand or both hands on the rim or hands simultaneously on the top and bottom sometimes referred to as a clap-catch. When one-hand catching on the rim, care must always be taken in hand placement and making sure to  catch on the correct side of the disc, according to which way the disc is spinning. One side will tend to spin out of your hand, while the other side will spin into your hand, making for a more secure catch. Many players avoid this problem by always catching with both hands when possible. The most popular throws used in a game of ultimate are [[Flying disc techniques#Techniques|backhand, sidearm/forehand, hammer and scoober]]. Being a deep threat with multiple throwing techniques and the ability to pass the disc before the defense has had a chance to re-set, is always optimal. Some players use a throw and catch [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]] practice to help improve their ultimate handling skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freestyle the Ultimate Edge|url=http://www.ultimaterob.com/2014/08/25/freestyle-the-ultimate-edge/|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was invented in 1968 as an evening pastime by Jared Kass. Ultimate is distinguished by its [[Ultimate (sport)#Spirit of the Game|Spirit of the Game]] - the principles of fair play, [[sportsmanship]], and the joy of play. [[USA Ultimate]] and [[Ultimate Canada]] are the rules and sanctioning organizations for ultimate in the US and Canada. The [[American Ultimate Disc League]] (AUDL) and [[Major League Ultimate]] (MLU) are the first semi professional ultimate leagues. The [[Major League Ultimate]] (MLU) ceased operation on December 21, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ultiworld.com/2016/12/21/breaking-major-league-ultimate-suspends-operations/|title=BREAKING: Major League Ultimate Suspends Operations|date=21 December 2016|last=Eisenhood|first=Charlie|work=Ultiworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games based on Ultimate===
[[Image:Schtick Disc Field Diagram.png|right|thumb|488px|The Schtick Disc field, showing opposing team territories and scoreboxes.]]
A number of games have evolved which are derived or similar to Ultimate, but played with different rules. These games are often played when available fields or teams are too small for a full sized ultimate game.

==Disc Golf==

{{main|Disc golf}}
Disc golf is a game based on the rules of [[golf]] (referred to by disc golfers as "ball and stick golf").  It uses discs smaller and denser than an ultimate disc.  The discs are [[Flying disc techniques|thrown]] towards a target, which serves as the "hole".  The official targets are metal baskets with hanging chains to catch the discs.

==Urban disc golf==

Before there were standardized targets called pole holes, [[disc golf]] used to be played in parks and urban settings using natural objects as targets. In some cases courses were created by the players themselves as they played, with each player taking turns determining targets and throwing designations (mandatories and out of bounds)

==Freestyle play and competition==
{{Main|Ken Westerfield|Flying disc freestyle}}
[[File:Ken Westerfield Heel Kick.jpg|160px|thumb|left|[[Ken Westerfield]], playing freestyle, 1960s-70s.]]
Disc freestyle, also known as freestyle Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name, is a sport and performing art characterized by creative, acrobatic, and athletic maneuvers with a flying disc. Freestyle is performed individually or more commonly in groups, both competitively and recreationally. Freestyle, in the early 1970s, before the invention of the "nail-delay", catching possibilities would depend on the throw you were given, it was always spontaneous and unpredictable. Play of this type of freestyle was performed with two players standing 30-40 yards apart, the throws were fast and varied and the catches were right off the throw, except for the occasional kick or slap-up and rarely a pause between the catch and the throw back. At advanced levels, the throws and catches would become a flow that was created once you mastered the basics. It was fast and fluid and visibly would resemble martial arts and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decade Awards Pre-Modern|url=http://freestyle-frisbee.com/skippy/1970s_pre_modern.html|work=Freestyle History|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most competitive freestyle today centers around the [[Flying disc freestyle#Basic maneuvers|nail-delay]] with many players using what are called [[Flying disc freestyle#Getting started|delay-aids]] (plastic nails and silicone sprays).

Many players of other disc sports will often use a throw and catch (no plastic nails or sprays) version of freestyle, to warm up for their disc games. Ultimate disc players often use freestyle to improve their throwing and catching skills as well as a good way to add focus and flexibility to their game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freestyle the Ultimate Edge|url=http://www.ultimaterob.com/2014/08/25/freestyle-the-ultimate-edge/|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flying disc freestyle|Freestyle]] competition is an event where teams of two or three players perform a routine which consists of a series of creative throwing and catching techniques set to music. The routine is judged on the basis of difficulty, execution and presentation. The team with the best total score is declared the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Rodney and Bethany|title=Freestyle Frisbee Basics|url=http://freestyledisc.org/learnToPlay.html|accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=Freestyle Players Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109224407/http://www.freestyledisc.org/learnToPlay.html|archive-date=9 November 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Ken Westerfield]] and Jim Kenner (founder and CEO of [[Discraft]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freestyle|url=http://www.discraft.com/freestyle.html|work=Discraft Freestyle|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduce and win the first [[flying disc freestyle]] competition at the 3rd annual [[Ken Westerfield#The Canadian Open Championships and the first Frisbee freestyle competition|Canadian Open Frisbee Championships]], [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada and the Vancouver Open Frisbee Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ira's Abs Athletic Challenges and Achievements|url=http://www.irasabs.com/?tag=ken-westerfield|work=Ken Westerfield Frisbee Pioneer|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Freestyle Routine|url=http://freestyle-frisbee.com/skippy/1970s_pre_modern.html#pairs_routine|work=The Decade Awards 1970-75 Top Routine|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first Frisbee freestyle competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Development of Frisbee in Canada|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#appendix1|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later the American Flying Disc Open (AFDO) [[Rochester, New York]], the Octad in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] and the 1975 World Frisbee Championships, held at the Rose Bowl in [[Pasadena, California]], adopted Westerfield and Kenners freestyle competition format as one of their events. Today this same freestyle event is now accepted as one of the premier events in [[Flying disc]] tournaments worldwide.

The Freestyle Players Association was formed to oversee the competitive aspects of freestyle frisbee, and to help new players learn how to freestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freestyle Players Association|work=About Freestyle|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/sport|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guts==
{{main|Guts (game)}}
Guts or Guts Frisbee is a disc sport inspired by dodgeball, involving teams throwing a flying disc (rather than balls) at members of the opposing team. One to five team members stand in a line facing the opposing team across the court, with the two teams lined up parallel to each other. Which team begins play is determined "flipping the disc", an action similar to a coin toss, but using the disc itself. One member of the team is then selected to start play.[[File:Pascal bid.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Guts Frisbee is the oldest disc sport (1957)]]
That member then raises an arm to indicate readiness to throw, at which point the members of the opposing team freeze in position.  If the thrower misses the "scoring area" (a demarcated area a bit larger than the space occupied by the opposing team), the receiving team scores a point. If a member of the receiving team catches the disc cleanly, neither team scores a point. If the throw is within the scoring area and the receiving team fails to catch, or catches but drops the disc, the throwing team gets a point. The receiving team then picks up the disc and becomes the throwing team. The receiving team must catch the disc cleanly in one hand, and may not move from position until after the disc leaves the hand of the thrower. The disc may not be trapped between the hand and any other part of the body, including the other hand. This frequently results in a challenging sequence of "tips" or "bobbles", which are rebounds of the disc off of receivers' hands or body to slow the disc down and keep it in play until it can be caught. This often involves multiple players on the receiving team.
Play continues until at least 21 points have been scored by one of the teams and there is a difference in score of at least 2 points.

==Double Disc Court==

[[File:DDC field.png|340px|thumb|right|The Double Disc Court field]]
Double disc court (DDC) invented and introduced by [[Frisbee]] Hall of Fame inductee Jim Palmeri of [[Rochester, NY]], is a sport played with two [[flying disc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Palmeri|url=http://www.gutsfrisbee.com/hall-of-fame/1984/jim-palmeri|work=Hall of Fame|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two teams of two players each stand in their own courts. The goal is to defend a court from an attack by the opposing team.  Two identical square courts are located on a level playing field of grass measuring 13 meters on a side.  The distance between the courts is 17 meters.  Attacks are made in two ways: by throwing a disc in play into the opponents' court in an attempt to have the disc come to rest within that court without ever having touched out-of-bounds, or by causing both discs to be touched by a player or players on the opposing team at the same time (called a "double"). A team scores a point whenever they make a successful attack or whenever an opponent throws a disc out-of-bounds. The first team to score the requisite number of points as determined by the competitive format wins the game.

==Canine Disc==
{{main|Disc dog}}
Canine Disc (or dog disc) is a dog sport and a disc sport. In canine disc competitions, dogs and their human flying disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching. The sport celebrates the bond between handler and dog, by allowing them to work together.

==Disc games adapted from non-disc games==

These games originated when the rules of another game were adjusted to use a flying disc in place of a ball.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1306">'''International Judge of Chess Compositions''' is a title award by [[FIDE]] via the [[World Federation for Chess Composition]] (WFCC; until 2010 ''Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions'', PCCC) to individuals who have judged several [[chess problem]] or [[study (chess)|study]] tournaments and who are considered capable of judging such awards at the highest level.

The title was first awarded in 1956. In the past, a number of famous over-the-board players have also been International Judges, including [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Vasily Smyslov]], [[David Bronstein]], [[Paul Keres]], [[Yuri Averbakh]] and [[Wolfgang Unzicker]], though in modern times the title is generally held by individuals largely unknown outside the world of problems. Many notable problem and study composers are also International Judges, including [[Genrikh Kasparyan]].

'''Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre''' is located in the north of [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]] and is owned and managed by [[Lee Valley Regional Park Authority]].
The £30 million Centre was opened in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;1.	https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/27929540.

http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/summer-olympics/2012/1020931-lee-valley-hockey-and-tennis-centre-officially-opened-after-30-million-revamp&lt;/ref&gt; It is made up of two outdoor hockey pitches and four indoor and six outdoor tennis courts. It was designed by architects [[Stanton Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanton Williams]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre is located on a part of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park known as [[Eton Manor]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eton Manor]]&lt;/ref&gt; which during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games staged the Paralympic Wheelchair Tennis Competition. The primary hockey pitch has a capacity of 3,000 which can be increased to 15,000 for major events.

== Major events ==

Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre will stage a number of major international events. These include the [[European Hockey Championships]] in [[2015 Women's EuroHockey Nations Championship|2015]], the Women’s Champions Event in 2016, the [[2016–17 Men's FIH Hockey World League|Men’s World League Round 3 in 2017]] and the [[Women's Hockey World Cup|Hockey Women’s World Cup]] in [[2018 Women's Hockey World Cup|2018]].&lt;ref&gt;2.	http://eurohockey2015.co.uk/
http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/page.asp?section=1662&amp;sectionTitle=The+Venue&lt;/ref&gt;

It has already staged the [[Wheelchair Tennis Masters]] competition in November 2014, comprising the world’s leading tennis players, with two more editions taking place in 2015 and 2016. In June 2014, the Investec Hockey Cup, an international invitation event involving four men and four women’s teams, took place at Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre.

== London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games ==

During the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Eton Manor, the site on which Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre stands, was the only purpose-built Paralympic venue. The venue was made up of nine competition courts and four warm-up courts.&lt;ref&gt;3.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9073961/London-2012-Paralympics-wheelchair-tennis-venue-Eton-Manor-completed.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a total of 10,500 seats for spectators, with a 5,000 capacity centre court. The 27 acre site also housed temporary training pools for participants in aquatics events, including three 50m pools for swimmers and smaller pools for synchronised swimmers and water polo competitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itftennis.com/media/126768/126768.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eton Manor poem ==

Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy was commissioned to write a poem which has been installed at Eton Manor, to celebrate its history and the legacy it will leave for the community after the Games.

The poem is erected onto a brass plaque at the entrance to the venue and was part of the Winning Words initiative, a national poetry scheme inspired by London 2012 which integrated permanent and temporary poetry on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17112824&lt;/ref&gt;

It is home to the [[Fairfield Stags]] men's and women's lacrosse and soccer teams.  Previously named Varsity Field it was renovated in 2002 including the installation of high-durability sod, a new irrigation and drainage systems, new lights for night games and new stands with capacity for 600 fans. Lessing Field is named in honor of Stephen Lessing '76, a former member of the Fairfield Stags men's tennis team and current member of the Fairfield University Board of Trustees whose generosity allowed for the stadium renovations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairfieldmirror.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=40e68c24-6664-42d9-a5c7-1944306980b0 Ali Bart, ''Lessing field to host upcoming MAAC tournaments,'' [[Fairfield Mirror]], September 23, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The finals for all the 2006 and 2007 Championship events were aired live on [[ESPNU]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairfieldstags.com/media/facilities_page Fairfield Stags facilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710234413/http://www.fairfieldstags.com/media/facilities_page |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorable moments==
*'''The Goal:'''  On April 16, 2005, playing before 1,376 fans at Lessing Field, the No. 20 [[Fairfield Stags men's lacrosse]] team was knotted at 11 goals apiece with eight seconds left in a game against the No. 11 [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]].  The Stags' three-time All-American midfielder [[Greg Downing|Greg Downing '07]] took possession of the ball out of a timeout, beat his defender and rocketed a shot past the Notre Dame goalie to give the Stags the upset win.  "The Goal", which was Downing's fifth of the day, came with three seconds left on the clock and gave the Stags a program record-tying seventh straight win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.fairfieldmirror.com/media/storage/paper148/news/2005/04/21/Sports/Seventh.Heaven.Mens.Lacrosse.Stuns.Fightin.Irish.In.Dramatic.Fashion-932594.shtml Dan Akeson, ''Seventh heaven: Men's lacrosse stuns Fightin' Irish in dramatic fashion,'' [[Fairfield Mirror]], April 21, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  Four weeks later before 2,486 fans at Alumni Field, the No. 17 Stags led by a hat-trick from Tom Werney '05 upset the No. 12 [[University of Denver|Denver Pioneers]] to clinch their second [[Great Western Lacrosse League|GWLL]] Championship and berth in the [[2005 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2005 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairfieldstags.com/sports/m-lacros/recaps/050805aaa.html Fairfield University Athletics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On November 5, 2006, in front of a national audience on [[ESPNU]] the [[Fairfield Stags men's soccer]] team won the 2006 [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference|MAAC]] Soccer Championship and earned a berth to the [[2006 Division I Men's College Cup|2006 NCAA Men's Soccer Championship]] with a 1-0 victory over St. Peter's College. The lone goal came during the 69th minute when Tom Clements '08 sent a free kick to the left corner where Alex Cunliffe '07 found room inside the box.  Drawing a double-team about 25 yards from the near post, Cunliffe sent a cross to the feet of Mike Troy '07. Troy dribbled along the end line until he sent a shot on goal from 10 yards which deflected off the St. Peter's goalkeeper and into the corner of the net for the game-winning score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairfieldstags.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/110506aaa.html Fairfield University Athletics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lynx F.C.''' is a [[association football|football]] club from the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. They play in the [[Gibraltar Football Association]]'s [[Gibraltar Premier Division|Premier Division]]. The club colours are yellow and black.

==History==
The club was formed in 2007 and has been managed by Albert Parody for the majority of its history, making him the country's longest serving manager. After winning the [[Gibraltar Second Division]] in 2012, thus earning promotion to the [[Gibraltar Premier Division]], the club have established themselves as a top flight team. Lynx recorded an impressive 4th place in the 2013-14 season, Gibraltar's first season with an 8 team league as members of UEFA. Since then, the club have settled into mid-table.

In 2015 they appointed former national team coach [[Allen Bula]] as a sporting director, as well as becoming a feeder club to Slovakian side [[MFK Košice]], for whom Bula was an academy coach before managing Gibraltar. Another mid-table finish followed, however, squad changes over the summer left them struggling in the bottom of the table for the first half of the [[2016–17 Gibraltar Premier Division|2016-17 season]] leaving question marks over Albert Parody's future at the club. Changes in January 2017 saw the signing of key players including goalkeeper Dany Fernandes and defender Charlie Mitchell, and an upturn in form saw a comfortable 6th place finish at the end of the season. On 2 June Albert Parody, the longest serving manager in the Gibraltar Premier Division, resigned and was replaced by Allen Bula. However, after 4 games and 4 defeats without any goals scored, it was reported that Bula had parted ways with the club on 27 October.

==Plot==
[[J. B. Bernstein]] is a big-time [[sports agent]] who, along with his partner [[Ash Vasudevan]], recently formed their own company. Unfortunately, all of J. B.'s clients have retired, and he is unable to reel in star football player Popo Vanuatu. Desperate to find new clients, J. B. realizes [[India]], with over one billion people, has real potential for untapped baseball talent. He approaches investor Mr. Chang with his proposal—a talent contest staged in India called "Million Dollar Arm." Contestants score points by demonstrating they can pitch a baseball with speed and accuracy. Along with the prize money, two winners will be flown to the U.S. and receive coaching to become legitimate baseball prospects within two years. Chang commits to providing the funding, on the condition the prospects are ready within only one year. With no alternative, J. B. reluctantly assures Chang the winners will be ready for a major-league try-out within one year.

J. B. approaches veteran [[baseball]] [[Pitch (baseball)|pitching]] coach [[Tom House]] who explains that [[cricket]], the main sport played in India, and baseball have very different motions for [[Bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and pitching, and getting a good recruit ready for a try-out in one year is extremely unlikely, if not impossible. J. B. points how House has nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking up the challenge, and House agrees.

While Ash is holding down the fort in Los Angeles, J. B. flies to India. He is bewildered by the traffic, the overcrowding, and the lax way Indians conduct business. He is joined by the curmudgeonly Ray Poitevint, a longtime major league scout, and hires Amit Rohan as his interpreter. After lengthy try-outs in numerous cities, two youngsters emerge as the winners — [[Rinku Singh]] and [[Dinesh Patel]], and they are flown to the U.S. to begin their baseball training. The pair, who grew up in poverty in India and do not speak or understand English, are instantly overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of America, although Rinku immediately develops a liking for [[pizza]]. Things soon come to a crunch when they are detained by hotel security for messing with elevator emergency controls, inadvertently getting themselves stuck and setting off the fire alarm. J. B. is subsequently forced to invite them to stay at his home. For their baseball training, J. B. dumps the pair by House and his staff while he runs off to close more deals. In being treated so, the pair feels like social outcasts. J. B.'s tenant Brenda Fenwick is the only person who genuinely seems interested in their well-being.

When J. B. takes the boys and Amit to a party thrown by Popo, whom J. B. hopes to sign, things get worse when Amit gets drunk after mistakenly drinking a punch with alcohol and Rinku becomes sick from [[overeating]] and as a result, both [[vomit]] on J. B.'s [[windshield]], forcing an enraged J. B. to drive them home, and forfeit the deal with Popo, who signed with someone else. Brenda calms him down and makes him realize he is treating the two boys like a business deal. The next day, J. B. trades in his [[Porsche]] for a [[Dodge Caravan]] and joins the boys for their prayers. Ignoring J. B.'s pleas of the two boys' lack of readiness, Chang insists his terms be fulfilled and the boys demonstrate their baseball skills one year from the time they arrived in the US. [[ESPN]], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', and local media are joined by numerous major-league scouts to watch the boys pitch. The try-out is a complete disaster, as the pair is both very nervous and pitch without speed or control, failing to impress anyone.

Brenda convinces J. B. that the boys be given another try-out. Chang refused to go along with it, and no scouts are interested in wasting their time on another fiasco. All hope is lost until Ray arranges for J. B. to meet the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] head scout who was away in [[Puerto Rico]] for the first try-out, and agrees to come. Chang changes his mind and sees the second try-out of Singh and Patel. This time, J. B. insists the boys relax and have fun. The scouts are quickly impressed as the pair consistently deliver 90+&amp;nbsp;mph [[fastballs]] thrown accurately, and both are offered a contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates. 

Unfortunately, on the boys way back to India for a final reunion with their families, they are killed in a plane crash. The movie ends with a slow and dark shot of J.B. receiving this news and passing out. This twist is completely unexpected and many argue that it takes away from the film's overall vibe. Disney executives stand behind this creative choice and received much flak as a result.

==Production==
In 2008, television sports producers and brothers Neil and Michael Mandt began documenting the training and tryouts that Singh and Patel were undergoing at the [[University of Southern California|USC]] campus. Using original footage they had shot, they created a nine-minute trailer as a presentation piece for a projected movie about the two players. In December 2008, the Mandts began a collaboration with producers [[Mark Ciardi]], Gordon Gray and [[Joe Roth]]. In early 2009, the screen rights to Singh and Patel's life story were purchased by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] for development at [[Columbia Pictures]], which hired [[Mitch Glazer]] to write a screenplay.&lt;ref name=deadline2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|title=Sony Sparks To 'Million Dollar Arm' Pitch|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/04/sony-sparks-to-million-dollar-arm-pitch/|accessdate=June 16, 2013|website=Deadline Hollywood |date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was eventually put in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] and in 2010, producers Roth and Ciardi set the film up at [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. Upon acquiring the film, Disney hired [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Thomas McCarthy]] to write a script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title=Tom McCarthy to Pen Disney Sports Drama 'Million Dollar Arm' (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-mccarthy-pen-disney-sports-97425|accessdate=June 16, 2013|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, [[Jon Hamm]] was hired to play [[J.

===Critical response===
&lt;!-- WHEN UPDATING REVIEW AGGREGATOR SCORES, PLEASE BE SURE TO UPDATE EVERYTHING IN THE CITATION FIELDS, INCLUDING THE ACCESS DATES. --&gt;
The film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that prior to release ''Million Dollar Arm'' received a 65% approval rating from critics, based on 141 reviews with an [[Weighted mean|average score]] of 6/10. The site's consensus reads: "Pleasant to a fault, ''Million Dollar Arm'' is a middle-of-the-plate pitch that coasts on Jon Hamm's considerable charm without adding any truly original curves to Disney's inspirational sports formula."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/million_dollar_arm/|title=Million Dollar Arm|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Million Dollar Arm |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/million-dollar-arm |publisher= [[CBS Interactive]] [[Metacritic]] | accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as a "sharp, slickly produced addition to the Disney sports movie canon [that] works as both a stirring underdog tale and as a revealing look at the expanding global footprint of the American sports-entertainment machine." Foundas also praised McCarthy's screenplay and Gillespie's direction, elaborating that they "put across the movie's many cliches with a certain verve, and find room for unexpected detours and grace notes in an overall familiar trajectory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foundas|first=Scott|title=Film Review: 'Million Dollar Arm'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-million-dollar-arm-1201167439/|accessdate=May 15, 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "Dutifully covering all the requisite inspirational sports movie/fish-out-of-water bases yet still managing to throw a few fresh curves into the mix, Disney's ''Million Dollar Arm'' assuredly hits a home run."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Michael|first=Rechtshaffen|title=Million Dollar Arm: Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/million-dollar-arm/review/697908|accessdate=May 15, 2014|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "B-" grade, comparing it to ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', and calling Hamm's performance as one of film's highlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|title=Million Dollar Arm (2014)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20483133_20804817,00.html|accessdate=May 15, 2014|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alonso Duralde]] of ''[[The Wrap]]'' criticized the film's predictability and excessive sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duralde|first=Alonso|title='Million Dollar Arm' Review: Jon Hamm Gets a Walk to First in Sentimental Underdog Tale|url=http://www.thewrap.com/million-dollar-arm-review-jon-hamm-sentimental-baseball-drama|accessdate=May 15, 2014|publisher=[[TheWrap.com]]|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==31 October 2005==
*[[MLB]]: A day after he was offered a $4.5&amp;nbsp;million, 3-year contract extension, [[Theo Epstein]] resigns as the general manager of the [[Boston Red Sox]], only one year after he built the team that won the [[2004 World Series]].
*[[National Football League|NFL]] [[Monday Night Football]]:
**[[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 20, [[Baltimore Ravens]] 19: ''In only the fifth [[Halloween]] game in the history of MNF, [[Jeff Reed (football player)|Jeff Reed]]'s 37-yard field goal with 1:37 left gives the Steelers the win over their divisional rivals.''
*[[Cricket]]: [[India national cricket team|India]] (303 for 4, [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni|Dhoni]] 183 [[not out]]; [[Muttiah Muralitharan|Muralitharan]] 2–46) beat [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] (298 for 4, [[Kumar Sangakkara|Sangakkara]] 138 [[not out]], [[Mahela Jayawardene|Jayawardene]] 71; [[Ajit Agarkar|Agarkar]] 2–62) by six wickets at [[Sawai Mansingh Stadium|Jaipur]] in the third ODI of the seven-match series to take a 3–0 lead. Dhoni's 183 not out is the sixth-highest score of all time in ODIs, the highest by a number three batsman, the highest by a batsman in a chasing side in a 50-over game, and the highest by a wicket-keeper.

*[[Soccer]]: MLS Cup 2005 Playoffs: Conference semifinals
**[[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] 4, [[D.C. United]] 0
***''Game 2's score is also the series' final aggregate. The Fire stun over 20,000 raucous fans at [[RFK Stadium]] to knock out the defending [[MLS Cup]] champions. [[Ivan Guerrero]] scores two for [[Chicago]], both in the first half, including a highlight reel-making, one-timer blast in the fifth minute of stoppage time from outside the box, eliciting a loud "Oh my!" from [[ESPN2]]'s Rob Stone that [[Dick Enberg]] would have been proud of. In the 55th minute, the United's [[Christian Gómez]] is [[Misconduct (football)|sent off]] for spitting on the Fire's [[C.J. Brown]] after the two tangle while fighting for the ball. The Fire will take on the [[New England Revolution]] in next Sunday's Eastern Conference Final.''
*[[Major League Baseball]]: [[Al López]], who led two [[American League]] teams — the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1954 and the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1959 — to pennants, died of a heart attack at the age of 97.

**[[Denver Broncos]] 49, [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 21: ''[[Jake Plummer]] throws four touchdown passes; three come before [[Donovan McNabb]] completes his first pass.''
**[[San Francisco 49ers]] 15, [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 10: ''[[Ken Dorsey]] throws for only 40&amp;nbsp;yards against his old team, but the 49ers win thanks to three takeaways, five sacks and five [[Joe Nedney]] field goals.

***WP: [[Freddy García]]. LP: [[Brad Lidge]]. SV: [[Bobby Jenks]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9308">[[Image:Basketball official.jpg|thumb|right|200px|NCAA official Moe Kincaid making a call in a 2008 college basketball game]]

In [[basketball]], an '''official''' (usually called a '''referee''') enforces the rules and maintains order in the game. The title of official also applies to the [[Basketball statistics|scorers]] and timekeepers, as well as other personnel that have an active task in maintaining the game. Basketball is regarded as among the most difficult sports to officiate due to the  speed of play, complexity of rules, the case-specific interpretations of rules, and the instantaneous decision required.

There is one lead referee and one or two '''umpires''', depending on whether there is a two- or three-person crew. In the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], the lead official is called the '''crew chief''' and the other two officials are '''referees'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/.element/pdf/2.0/sect/officiating/Official_NBA_Rule_Rook_09-10.pdf NBA Official Rules (2009–2010)] Rule 2, Section I, a. Retrieved July 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]]-sanctioned play, two-man crews consist of a referee and an umpire, and three-man crews contain a referee and two umpires. 

Regardless, both classes of officials have equal rights to control almost all aspects of the game. In most cases, the lead official (in FIBA, the referee) performs the [[jump ball]] to begin the contest, though [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] and NCAA have allowed the referee to designate which official (referee or umpire) shall perform the [[jump ball]].

==Uniforms==
In American [[high school]] and [[college basketball]], officials wear black-and-white-striped shirts with black side panels, black pants, and black shoes. Some state high school association allow officials to wear grey shirts with black pin-stripes instead of black-and-white-striped shirts. 

[[National Basketball Association|NBA]] officials wear light grey shirts with black slacks and black shoes. The NBA shirt is light grey with one black colored stripe on either shoulder, a black stripe on either side, the official's number in the center at the top on the back, and the NBA logo above the breast. NBA officials sometimes wear alternate uniforms consisting of a white shirt with light gold shoulders and black stripes. [[NBA Summer League]] officials wear the same light grey shirt but with blue shoulders. The [[WNBA]] referee shirt is similar to the NBA referee shirt except that its shoulder and sleeve colors are orange, and the WNBA logo takes the place of the NBA logo.&lt;ref&gt;http://phillyref.com/basketball/wnbarefs/lauren_holtkamp.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; 

FIBA officials wear a grey (torso) and black (sleeves) shirt, black trousers, black socks, and black shoes. Officials in competitions organized by [[Euroleague Basketball (company)|Euroleague Basketball]] – the [[Euroleague]] and [[Eurocup Basketball|Eurocup]] – wear an orange shirt. Officials in the [[Israel Basketball Association]] wear the [[Euroleague]]'s orange shirt but sometimes wear royal blue shirts for contests between two Israeli teams. [[National Basketball League (Australia)|NBL]] officials wear grey shirts with black shoulders and orange stripes on the sides. The NBL logo is atop the breast and a sponsor's name is on the back. Shirts are V-neck, without a collar, and pants lack belts.

All officials wear a [[whistle]] that is used to stop play as a result of a foul or a violation on the court. Hand signals are used to indicate the nature of the infraction or to administer the game.

In higher levels of college and professional basketball, officials wear a timing device on the belt-line called PTS (Precision Timing System). The device is used by on court officials to start and stop the game clock in a timely manner, rather than waiting for the scoreboard operator (timekeeper) to do so.

== Positions and responsibilities==
[[File:Basketball official positions.svg|thumb|right|A diagram of the relative positions of basketball officials in "three-person" mechanics. The lead official (L) is normally along the baseline of the court. The trail official (T) takes up a position approximately level with the top of the three-point line. The center official (C) stands across the court near the free throw line.]]
The officials must ensure that the game runs smoothly, and this encompasses a variety of different responsibilities, from calling the game to player and spectator management. They also carry a duty of care to the players they officiate and to ensure that the court and all equipment used is in a safe and usable condition. Should there be an issue that inhibits the safe playing of the game, then it is the job of the officials to rectify the problem. Quite often, the job of an official surpasses that of the game at hand, as they must overcome unforeseen situations that may or may not have an influence on the game.

There are two standard methods for officiating a basketball game, either "two-person" or "three-person" mechanics depending on how many officials are available to work the game. 
In "two-person" mechanics, each official works either the '''lead''' or the '''trail''' position. The lead position is normally along the baseline of the court, with the trail position having its starting point at the free throw line extended on the left side of the court facing the basket. Officials change position often during the game to cover the area in the best possible way. As the game transitions from one end of the court to the other, the lead becomes the trail and vice versa. Between the two positions, each is responsible for a specific part of the court as well as two each of the side, base or back court lines. Officials change position after certain calls (mostly when the lead official calls a defensive foul). This allows officials to alternate between positions to increase the speed of play; one official will approach the bench whilst another, usually the closest to the bench at that time, will move to occupy his position. This also prevents one official from always working one particular team's basket throughout the course of the game.

In "three-person" mechanics, the court is further divided among three officials, with the lead (baseline) official determining the position of the other two officials. Normally, the lead official will move to the side of the court in which the ball is located (strong side), particularly if there is a "post-up" player in that position. The official that is on the same sideline as the lead official then takes up a position approximately level with the top of the three-point line and becomes the "trail" official, while the third official will stand across the court near the [[free throw]] line in what is called the '''center''' position. This creates a [[triangle]] coverage of the court. Often, the lead will switch sides of the baseline during a play, requiring the trail to move down to be level with the free-throw line and become the new center, while the center will move up and become the trail. As the ball moves to the other end of the court in transition, the lead will become the trail, the trail will become the lead, and the center official will remain in the center (unless the new "lead" moves across the baseline to cover the strong side, in which case the center official and trail would then switch positions.)

== Difficulty ==
[[File:Tom Washington, Monty McCutchen, Brent Barnaky on March 30, 2011.jpg|thumb|right|NBA officials [[Monty McCutchen]] (center), Tom Washington (#49) and Brent Barnaky reviewing a play.]]
Basketball is regarded by many fans as among the most difficult sports to officiate.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Usually basketball officials have only a brief moment to determine if an infraction has occurred, due to the speed of play of the game and the officials' proximity to the action. Especially difficult is the "charge/block" call as to which player is responsible for contact. Officials often rely on [[instant replay]] to review plays.

Despite the misconception that basketball is a non-contact sport, officials often let a large amount of marginal or incidental contact pass uncalled. An official must always be wary of not just what is happening around the ball, but the roughness of play going on around the whole court, adding to the job of the official.

Further complicating the job of an official is the proximity to the crowds. Unlike football or baseball, the crowd is nearly always located within a few feet of the official, as are coaches and other players on the bench. To combat this, officials are able to remove a fan from the arena with an ejection.

== Duties ==
=== Violations ===
When a violation occurs, game action is immediately stopped. These include [[Traveling (basketball)|traveling]], [[Double dribble|illegal dribbles]], out-of-bounds, and other violations. The official is required to blow the whistle and immediately stop play and award the ball over to the opposing team which allows for fair play in the game.

'''Planica Nordic Centre''' ({{lang-sl|Nordijski center Planica}}) is a [[nordic skiing]] complex with one [[ski flying]] hill, seven [[ski jumping]] hills and [[cross-country skiing]] track in [[Planica]], Slovenia. It is the only nordic centre in the world with eight hills in one place and the only one of this kind with hills of all sizes at one place: small, medium, normal, large and flying hills.

The origins of ski flying started in 1936 in Planica, when 18-year-old Austrian [[Josef Bradl|Josef "Sepp" Bradl]] became the first man in history to land a ski jump of over 100 metres (330&amp;nbsp;ft). It is a place where the most of the ski jumping world records were set on two different hills, and also the historic first jumps over 100 meters by Sepp Bradl on [[Bloudkova velikanka]] and over 200 meters by [[Toni Nieminen]] on [[Letalnica bratov Gorišek]]. Complex consists of eight hills in function and three abandoned hills. [[Sigmund Ruud]] gave Bloudkova velikanka name "Mammoth Hill". In 2015, the complete reconstruction was finished with total new cross-country skiing track derived through the valley of Planica.

Letalnica bratov Gorišek flying hill is also hosting annual [[Red Bull 400]] world series event, the stepeest 400 metres uphill run in the world, with over 1,000 competitors from around the globe.

{{For|details|Letalnica bratov Gorišek}}
[[Letalnica bratov Gorišek]] (English: ''Flying hill of Gorišek brothers'') is a 1969 [[ski flying]] [[ski jumping hill|hill]] located in [[Planica]], [[Slovenia]]. Hill is named after the original constructors and brothers [[Vlado Gorišek|Vlado]] (alias "Lado") and [[Janez Gorišek]]. With total of [[List of the longest ski jumps#Men|28 world records]] set it is the world leading ski jump hill in this statistics. They installed the world's steepest [[zip-line]] with average incline at 38.33% (20.9°) and maximum incline at 58.7% (30.5°) which opened on 19 September 2015.

It's the biggest of totally eight hills at Planica Nordic Centre. Yugoslavian ski jumper [[Miro Oman]] was honoured to make a premiere 135&amp;nbsp;m (443&amp;nbsp;ft) long jump on 6 March 1969 at hill test. The first ever [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships]] was organized on this hill in [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships 1972|1972]]. After [[Matti Nykänen]] set world record 191 meters at [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships 1985|SFWC 1985]], new rule by [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] was accepted where no points for jumps over this distance was awarded in order to prevent world record hunting. On 17 March 1994 [[Andreas Goldberger]] touched the snow with his hand at 202 m and made first ever over two hundred meters jump, but it was invalid. Just a few minutes later [[Toni Nieminen]] landed on his feet at 203 m and officially became the first man in history who jumped over two hundred meters. This hill is a historic place where a man for the first time jumped over 200 m.

=== Large hill ===

{{For|details|Bloudkova velikanka}}
[[Bloudkova velikanka]] (also: ''Rožman/Bloudkova velikanka'', ''Old Bloudkova velikanka'', ''Large Rožman/Bloudek Hill'', ''Mammoth Hill'') is a large ski jump hill in [[Planica]], [[Slovenia]] opened in 1934 by Joso Gorec's initiative. Hill was originally constructed by Ivan Rožman, that's why he resent that hill was first named after [[Stanko Bloudek]] and not him and backed up. Posthumous and many years later they credited and honoured him to rename hill as Rožman/Bloudkova velikanka. A year after opening [[Stanko Bloudek]] became in charge as main constructor improving this hill 'till his death and with his vision and skills made Planica world-famous and brought [[ski jumping]]/[[ski flying]] to a whole new dimension. As a constructor he is credited with thirteen world records and first jump in history over 100 metres in 1936 and that's how new discipline was born right on this hill. Hill's axis and name are under national monument protection and can not be changed. After almost a decade of hibernation hill was completely renovated with same characteristics as old one and opened in 2012. Right next to this one they built a brand new normal hill, which replaced the old demolished one. They chose this location mostly because of their bid for the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships|Nordic World Ski Championships]].

=== Abandoned hills ===
* In 1930, the first K20 hill was built in the middle of way next to the road between [[Bloudkova velikanka]] and [[Rateče]] hills. Abandoned but profile still seen today.
* In 1935, the first K60 hill was built in [[Rateče]] at entrance crossroad to Planica valley, later another hill added. Last time in function as K50 and 70 m in 1996. Abandoned but profile still well preserved today.
* In 1949, the [[Srednja Bloudkova]] K90 hill constructed by [[Stanko Bloudek]] was opened, in use until 2007 and completely demolished in 2012. Now replaced with complete new HS62 and 80 m hills.
* In 1952, Bloudek constructed three small K8, 30 and 40 m hills for kids to practice called »Planica school hills«, later covered with plastic and demolished in 2012. Replaced with new HS15, 30 and 45 m hills in 2014.

==Zip line==
[[Zip-line]] on the flying hill is the steepest in the world with 40 seconds of adrenalin fall. It was installed by Slovenian ski manufacturer [[Elan (company)|Elan]] in August 2015. It's the first ever zip line installed on any of ski flying hills around the world. Former Slovenian alpine skier [[Jure Košir]] was honoured to be the first person who tested and descended down on 1 September 2015. For daily visitors and tourists was opened on 19 September 2015.

==Key people==
{{double image|right|Lado Gorišek.jpg|118|Janez Gorišek (1).jpg|100|[[Vlado Gorišek]]|[[Janez Gorišek]]}}

===Joso Gorec===
He is known as the "creator" of Planica, key figure and the most significant person in the whole story. All credits go to him, without him there will be nothing. He was a Slovene sport worker, sport enthusiast and member of ''Ilirija Sport Club''. His intention was to build the biggest hill in the world and to make relatively unknown [[Slovenia]] famous. He is the initiator and responsible that ''Ilirija House'', now called ''Planica House'', was built in 1931. A year later Gorec asked his club co-worker, engineer [[Stanko Bloudek]], to draw plans for large hill. Bloudek draw plans for K80 hill, as much as [[International Ski Federation]] rules allowed at that time and found the fantastic location for it. But in 1933, suddenly out of nowhere Ivan Rožman, a construction company's owner working at time in Planica, draw plans for new, bigger K90 hill, now known as [[Bloudkova velikanka]]. Joso Gorec decided to rather build the hill by his plans. Another big achievement if Gorec was his fight for recognition of Planica and ski-flying as new discipline in annual FIS congress held in 1938 in [[Helsinki]]. He was defending plans of Stanko Bloudek, who didn't want to go there. Gorec fantastically presented Planica and ski-flying in front of FIS. But he was lucky to get a full support from [[Arnold Lunn]], who had the same problems with FIS years ago at recognition of [[slalom skiing|slalom]]. Lunn told FIS that they or anyone else couldn't stop ski-flying in Planica. After the end of presentation, Gorec said that FIS adopted rules only for K80 and not yet have any rules for a new discipline called ski-flying. He invited FIS to accept new rules for ski-flying as soon as possible. After this meeting FIS allowed ski-flying but only in study purposes.

===Ivan Rožman===
Original constructor of K-90 Bloudkova velikanka hill, which was built in two months, from October to December 1933 hill was completed. Opening competition was National Championships in February 1934, where Rožman as a first person in history used snow cement. Gorec gave him and his company permission to build the hill. He contributed all the money for the construction, together with two other business partners: manufacturer [[Rado Hribar]] from [[Ljubljana]] and with father of Slovene actor [[Demeter Bitenc]] who was renting "Bitenc Hotels". At first locals didn't want to sell the land needed for construction and the local priest [[Lavtižar]] preached to locals at liturgy and convinced them to sell the land. Soon after hill was opened Rožman and Bloudek got into conflict about original authorship and name of Bloudkova velikanka. While Joso Gorec took side with his friend Bloudek, he step out as constructor. Soon a year later Bloudek continued his work on Bloudkova velikanka. Rožman died in 1937 and conflict about authorship was forgotten for many years. Many years later they recognized him as original constructor. The full official name of the hill is now "Rožman/Bloudkova velikanka".

=== Stanko Bloudek === 
[[File:Bloudek Stanko.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Stanko Bloudek]] ]] 
[[Stanko Bloudek]] was a constructor and the father of the first ever ski flying hill. In 1932 he was hired by Joso Gorec to draw plans for hill with size K-80. He drew plans and found an excellent location in Planica, but didn't make to realize his plans at first. Ivan Rožman who draw plans for K-90 built the original ''Bloudkova velikanka'' on location found by Bloudek. He took the one-year-old hill over in 1935, then upgraded it, enlarged it and improved it several times until his death in 1959. He is responsible for eleven world records on Bloudkova velikanka and for the first jump over 100 meters in 1936. ''Bloudkova velikanka'' was unfairly named after him, although original plan wasn't his, but he was closer to Gorec who decided about everything.

===Vlado Gorišek===
[[Vlado Gorišek]] (1925–1997), born in [[Ljubljana]], more known as Lado, was the older brother of [[Janez Gorišek]]. He is known as co-constructor of [[Letalnica bratov Gorišek]], a flying hill built in 1969, although he didn't actually draw the plans, but his younger brother Janez did while he was working in [[Libya]] in the 1960s.

===Janez Gorišek===
[[Janez Gorišek]] and his older brother Vlado are born in [[Ljubljana]] and they together constructed the flying hill in 1969. Janez was the main mastermind who actually draw the plans alone, but he could not be present at the construction site, because at the time he was working in [[Libya]]. However, his brother Vlado was present at the construction site from the start to the end as the main supervisor with nonstop contacts to his younger brother Janez through telephone and mail. They are responsible for a hill with the most world records, twenty-eight and for the first jump in history over 200 meters in 1994.

== World records ==
List of all world records from both large and flying hill. Some sources claim that three world records set on 2 March 1941 by Franz Mair (109 m), Hans Lahr (111 m) and [[Paul Krauß]] (112 m) on large hill were actually not world records. They claim those jumps were actually set after [[Rudi Gering]]'s 118 m world record.

== Red Bull 400 ==
{{For|details|Red Bull 400}}

Red Bull 400 is an extreme running-up-the-hill sport event sponsored by [[Red Bull]]. It is the steepest uphill race that takes place in Europe. It is a tough 400-meter vertical sprint up the face of a ski-jump slope in Planica, Slovenia. Runners have to beat 400 meters distance from bottom to the top of the inrun of the flying hill. Runners coming from all over [[Europe]] had to beat steepest part 38° angle on the older hill and at 36° on modernized hill. First two editions on the Letalnica bratov Gorišek were held in 2012 and 2013 and cancelled in 2014 because the hill was under renovation. Competition returned in 2015 on a modernized and even bigger hill than before with totally new concrete inrun.

The '''Sebenza''' is a folding [[pocket knife]] manufactured by [[Chris Reeve Knives]] of [[Boise, Idaho]].  It is constructed with a [[stainless steel]] [[blade]] and [[titanium]] handle.&lt;ref name="Ayres"&gt;
{{Citation | surname=Ayres | given=James |title=Gentlemen's Folders | journal=Sporting Knives 2003 | isbn= 0-87349-430-X | year=2003 | pages=138–143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its handle functions as the lock mechanism similar in concept to the [[Walker linerlock]] differing in that the handle itself forms the lock bar which holds the blade open.  This mechanism was invented by [[Chris Reeve]], and is called the Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L).&lt;ref name ="SD1"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Dick  | first = Steven  | title = The Chris Reeve Sebenza Folding Hunter  | journal = National Knife Magazine  | volume =   | issue =   | pages = 16–18  | publisher =   | location =   | date = 09/01/1993  | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also commonly referred to as the Framelock, and is one of the most widely implemented locking systems in the folding knife industry, where lock strength and reliability is a product requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Delavigne|first=Kenneth|title=Spyderco Story: The New Shape of Sharp (Hardcover)|year= 2004|publisher=Paladin Press |location=Colorado |isbn=1-58160-060-7 |pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name '''Sebenza''' is derived from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word meaning "Work," a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South African origins.&lt;ref name ="Covert"/&gt;

== Design and history ==
[[File:Constrictor-Releasing.jpg|thumb|right|A small Sebenza cutting a knot]]

There are currently two size models of the Sebenza 21, small and large. The Small 21 has a 2.94" (75mm) blade and the Large 21 has a 3.625" (92mm) blade.

First introduced in 1990, the current basic model has a sand-blasted titanium handle and a stonewashed finish [[CPM S35VN steel]] blade.&lt;ref name = "Gardner"&gt;
{{Citation  | last = Gardner  | first = James  | title = Duel of the Titans: two exceptional folders exemplify state-of-the-art  | journal = Guns Magazine  | volume = 27  | issue = 6  | pages = 145–151  | date = June 2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are numerous options for the embellishment of the Sebenza's titanium handles, such as computer-generated graphics, custom (unique) graphics, or inlays such as exotic wood, micarta, or mammoth ivory.
Originally the Chris Reeve Sebenza was available with a blade of ATS-34 steel.&lt;ref name ="Covert"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Covert  | first = Patrick  | title = Points Of Perfection  | journal = American Handgunner Magazine  | volume = 24  | issue = 5  | pages = 130  | date = Sept–October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1996, the blade material was changed to BG-42 blade steel, and later in 2001, the Sebenza blade material transitioned to CPM S30V steel.  CPM S30V was developed by Crucible Steel with the collaboration of Chris Reeve.&lt;ref name = "Gardner"/&gt;  [[Damascus steel]] blades are also available as an option on the Sebenza. Since 2012, all Chris Reeve knives have transitioned to CPM S35VN steel.
A feature of the Sebenza that is highly praised by users is the ease of maintenance, as CRK actually encourages the customer to disassemble and maintain the knife by including a hex wrench, as well as small tube of fluorinated grease (to lubricate the pivot) and a tube of [[Loctite]] (for screws) in the box. Another feature of the Sebenza is the use of a bushing system around the blade's pivot that keeps the blade at a constant tight fit which is always centered.
This bushing allows the user to tighten the pivot screw completely without having to manually adjust the pivot tension.

As of May 2008, the two production models—the Regular and Classic Sebenza models—were discontinued and replaced by the 'Sebenza 21' (named so as to commemorate the 21st year of the Sebenza's production).  The Sebenza 21 is based upon the previous Classic's design, and differs from the Classic only in small details.

At the 2012 Blade Show the 'Sebenza 25' (named so as to commemorate the 25th year of the Sebenza's production) was introduced.  Significant changes include a more sculpted handle, the introduction of a ceramic ball lockup/detent system and the use of 'Large Hollow Grind Technology" on the blade grind.  The 21 model continues in production as well. The 'Sebenza 25' was discontinued in mid-2016 and replaced by the [[Inkosi]] which shares many similarities with the 25 but with additional refinements.

== Awards ==
1987:  Knifemaker’s Guild of Southern Africa -- "Best Folding Knife" (Sebenza predecessor)&lt;br /&gt;
1993:  [[Knifemakers' Guild]] -- "Most Innovative Folder at the Show" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Winter | first = Butch | title = The 1993 Knifemakers Guild Show | journal = The National Knife Magazine | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 32–34 | date = February 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2005:  [[Blade Show]] -- "Collector Knife of the Year" (21st Anniversary Sebenza) &lt;br /&gt;
2006:  Grays Sporting Journal -- “Gray's Best” Award

''Knives Illustrated'' magazine named the industry's top five tactical folders of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Elias  | first = Abe | title = The Top Five Tactical Folders: A Panel Picks Its Favorites | journal = Tactical Knives  | volume = 13  | issue = 8 | pages = 12–18  | date = August 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The author, Abe Elias, describes a tactical folder as "a knife used by people who need a dependable piece of solidly build equipment, a folder that gives you -- in all cases -- confidence".
His article goes on to say that "At the top of the list is the Sebenza by Chris Reeve."

Inaugurated in 1959, it was designed by the architects [[Enrico Del Debbio]] and [[Aniballe Vitellozzi]] to host the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics|swimming]], [[Diving at the 1960 Summer Olympics|diving]], [[Water polo at the 1960 Summer Olympics|water polo]], and swimming portion of the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics|modern pentathlon]] events for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. 

The venue was refurbished to host the [[European LC Championships 1983|1983 European Aquatics Championships]], and reconfigured and expanded for the [[1994 World Aquatics Championships]] . The stadium was the main venue of the World Championships again in [[2009 World Aquatics Championships|2009]].

'''Target Field''' is a [[baseball park]] in the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|historic warehouse (or North Loop) district]] of downtown [[Minneapolis]]. It is the home ballpark of the [[Minnesota Twins]], the state's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise. It also has served as the occasional home of [[Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball]], and other local and regional baseball events.

The ballpark officially opened with a capacity of 39,504 on April 12, 2010, and has since hosted the [[2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120829&amp;content_id=37546072&amp;vkey=pr_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Minnesota Twins awarded the 2014 All-Star Game|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an open-air ballpark, and not considered "roof-ready" in any way. Though designed as a baseball venue, it can accommodate football, soccer, and outdoor concerts. Its extensive banquet and conference facilities are marketed for corporate and other non-Twins and non-baseball events.

In 2010, ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' ranked Target Field as the #1 baseball stadium experience in North America.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportsnation/teamrankings/_/category/stx#table|title=Ultimate Team Rankings|work=ESPN The Magazine|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Target Field April 2010.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Target Field during a game vs. Kansas City in 2010]]
Target Field is the Twins/Senators sixth ballpark, and the franchise's third in Minnesota. The Twins had played 28 seasons at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], and before that 21 seasons at [[Metropolitan Stadium]]. The Twins shared both facilities with the [[Minnesota Vikings]], and the Metrodome with the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football team]].

The final budget for construction was $435 million, of which $175 million was paid by the Twins and $260 million was paid by [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]] by way of a 0.15% county-wide sales tax. An additional $120 million in infrastructure costs were split between the county ($90 million), the team ($20 million), [[Target Corporation]] ($4.5 million), the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] ($3.5 million) and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority ($2 million) bringing the project's total cost to US$555 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ballparkauthority.com/Budget.html|title=Target Field Construction Budget - Minnesota Ballpark Authority|website=www.ballparkauthority.com|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Target Field.jpg|thumb|Armed Services Appreciation Day, on July 3, 2011. The Twins set a three-game series attendance record (123,385) against the Milwaukee Brewers.]]

==History==

=== Background ===
The Twins were in their 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; season in the Metrodome when they formally declared their desire to find a new home on July 18, 1994. [[Carl Pohlad]], owner of the Twins, told the [[Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission]] (owners of the Metrodome) the current facility was "economically obsolete" due to changes in the economy of Major League Baseball.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Target Field|last=Berg|first=Steve|publisher=MVP Books|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7603-3842-1|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=49-71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration started a process which would culminate nearly 16 years later with the opening of Target Field. In the intervening years, many ideas, financing plans and possible locations came and went. The long process included threats of relocation, infighting between the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] of [[Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], and numerous pieces of legislation (both passed and not passed) at various levels of government. The process spanned the terms of three [[List of Governors of Minnesota|Minnesota governors]], five mayors of [[List of mayors of Minneapolis|Minneapolis]] or [[List of mayors of Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], and even two long-tenured [[List of Minnesota Twins managers|Twins managers]].

=== Early plans (1994-1999) ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Newpark lg (twins mpls).jpg|left|thumb|Original concept drawing for the first new Twins stadium plan. This illustration was commissioned circa 1996 by the Minnesota Twins, and created by the Minneapolis architectural firm Ellerbe Becket.]] --&gt;
Immediately following Pohlad's 1994 declaration of intent, the Twins began making plans to build a new, retractable-roof stadium on a site just north of the Metrodome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_n-tQUGWEkC&amp;lpg=PA240-IA12&amp;ots=D_ABd3Qjt-&amp;dq=twins%20retractable%20mississippi%201997&amp;pg=PA240-IA12#v=onepage&amp;q=twins%20retractable%20mississippi%201997&amp;f=false|title=Stadium Games: Fifty Years of Big League Greed and Bush League Boondoggles|last=Weiner|first=Jay|date=January 1, 2000 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816634354|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive conceptual work went into the site and stadium. At that time, the [https://www.google.com/maps/@44.9770583,-93.2544665,17.75z desired site] was largely underused as surface parking, despite being adjacent to the Mississippi River, and located in the city's [[Mill District, Minneapolis|historic milling district]]. It included land which would be used for the [[Guthrie Theater]] (2006), [[Gold Medal Park]] (2007), and high-end housing.

==== 1996 ====
The riverfront plan formed the basis for all of the early discussions, and was first presented to the Minnesota Legislature during the [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/timecapsule/session?sess=79 1996 session]. It did not pass, largely due to widespread public sentiment that Pohlad, Minnesota's second most wealthy citizen, should pay for a new facility himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_n-tQUGWEkC&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;ots=D_ABe0Xev2&amp;dq=1996%20pohlad&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q=1996%20pohlad&amp;f=false|title=Stadium Games: Fifty Years of Big League Greed and Bush League Boondoggles|last=Weiner|first=Jay|date=January 1, 2000 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816634354|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1997 ====
After that failure, private negotiations between Pohlad and [[Arne Carlson|Governor Arne Carlson]] yielded a deal which was brought to the [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/timecapsule/session?sess=80 1997 legislative session]. The Twins had agreed to make an up-front financial contribution to kick-start the project, as well as sell 49% of team ownership to the state. This plan unraveled when local media reported that the complicated "contribution" to be made by the team amounted to a loan from Pohlad which was to be repaid with interest. Public outrage made passing this plan impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_n-tQUGWEkC&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;ots=D_ABe0Xev2&amp;dq=1996%20pohlad&amp;pg=PA224#v=onepage&amp;q=1996%20pohlad&amp;f=false|title=Stadium Games: Fifty Years of Big League Greed and Bush League Boondoggles|last=Weiner|first=Jay |date=January 1, 2000 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816634354|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that same year, the voters in Minneapolis overwhelmingly approved a referendum which prevented the city of Minneapolis from ever spending more than $10 million on a professional sports facility without approval from voters. This effectively removed the city from consideration as a financial partner for a new Twins ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/05/us/the-1997-elections-referendums-oregon-stays-with-its-law-on-suicides.html|title=THE 1997 ELECTIONS: REFERENDUMS; Oregon Stays With Its Law On Suicides|last=Ayres|first=B. Drummond|date=November 5, 1997 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 19, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1998 ====
Meanwhile, the Twins’ Metrodome lease was set to expire in 1998. Governor Carlson felt the issue pressing enough that he called a special session of the Minnesota Legislature for that fall. In advance of the session, Pohlad announced he had signed a letter of intent to sell the team to a potential ownership group in North Carolina ([[Piedmont Triad]]) led by [http://businessnc.com/don-beaver/ Don Beaver].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/04/sports/baseball-playoffs-notes.html|title=BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; NOTES|date=October 4, 1997 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 19, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale would be nullified if either a new stadium was approved in Minnesota, or a referendum to build a new stadium in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] failed.

St. Paul mayor [[Norm Coleman]] jumped into this void with an enthusiastic pitch to move the Twins to his city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199907/02_jansene_commit-s/index.shtml|title=MPR: St. Paul Takes Lead in Stadium Push|last=Radio|first=Minnesota Public|website=news.minnesota.publicradio.org|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several downtown locations were offered, the most likely option being adjacent to the new [[Xcel Energy Center]] (though another site considered was in the [[Lowertown Historic District (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Lowertown]] neighborhood, a location which eventually became [[CHS Field]], home of the [[St. Paul Saints]]). A referendum was scheduled to ask St. Paul voters to approve a sales tax increase for the city's contribution to the project, which would have been an open-air ballpark. Once again, Pohlad agreed to "sell" the team contingent upon the outcome of a referendum. This sale would have been to a group led by Minnesota-based billionaires [[Glen Taylor]] and [http://www.espn.com/espn/sportsbusiness/owner?id=Naegele%20Jr. Robert Naegele].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199910/08_khoom_pohladsells/index.shtml|title=MPR: Pohlad Agrees to Sell Twins|last=Radio|first=Minnesota Public|website=news.minnesota.publicradio.org|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Pohlad was so unpopular, it was thought that removing him from the transaction might help the prospects of the referendum, but it did not.

=== Warehouse District site identified (2000) ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HOK Original rendering.JPG|left|thumb|Original concept drawing for a ballpark on the Rapid Park site. This illustration was commissioned in 2000 by Lambrecht and Pogin, and created under the direction of Earl Santee at HOK Sport (later Populous).]] --&gt;
The threat of the Twins moving to St. Paul had caught the attention of the business community in Minneapolis, which, up to this point, had been largely silent on the issue. During the run-up to the St. Paul referendum in 1999, an independent working group was formed by Minneapolis businessmen Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin, representatives of a group of investors which owned the Rapid Park parking lot in the [[Warehouse District, Minneapolis|historic warehouse district]] on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis. This group, initially known as Minnesota Urban Ballpark, and later as MN Twinsville, formed with the express purpose of bringing their land into the discussion about sites for a new Twins ballpark.

At first, the 8-acre site appeared to be an extremely unlikely location for a modern professional baseball facility. Besides being far smaller than most MLB sites (modern facilities typically require 16-20 acres), it was hemmed in by railroad tracks, a [[Interstate 394|freeway]], and two city streets passing on bridges. Though very near to [[Target Center]], it was also adjacent to the [http://www.hennepin.us/your-government/facilities/hennepin-energy-recovery-center Hennepin Energy Recovery Center] (HERC), more commonly known as the city's "garbage burner," considered by some to be an undesirable neighbor for a ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/01/29/draft-study-garbage-burner-wont-harm-fans-at-new-twins-stadium/|title=Draft study: Garbage burner won’t harm fans at new Twins stadium – Twin Cities|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the site’s perceived liabilities were easily offset by significant assets. Careful measurements were made by Lambrecht and local architect David Albersman, which proved that there was enough room for a baseball field and the amenities associated with a Major League ballpark. The site was adjacent to three large, underused [http://www.abc-ramps.com/ parking ramps], and at the potential nexus of a light rail line then being planned (ultimately the [[Metro Blue Line (Minnesota)|Metro Transit Blue Line]]), and a commuter rail line also under consideration (the eventual [[Northstar Line]]). It was also controlled by a single owner who would be a willing seller. This fact alone would significantly simplify the process of acquisition by a governmental entity for a large-scale project. Owing largely to these logistical advantages, as well as an expansive view of the Minneapolis skyline, and the persistence of Lambrecht and Pogin's group, this site would eventually come to house Target Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.stthomas.edu/realestate/2011/02/17/the-little-idea-that-could-the-untold-story-about-the-development-of-target-field/|title=The Little Idea That Could: The untold story about the development of Target Field – Real Estate Matters|website=blogs.stthomas.edu|language=en-US|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.targetfieldhistory.com|title=History of Target Field: The Impossible Ballpark|website=www.targetfieldhistory.com|language=en|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2000, Lambrecht’s group commissioned a visit by [http://populous.com/profile/earl-santee/ Earl Santee] of [[Populous (company)|Populous]] (then known as HOK Sport) to evaluate whether the site had the potential to house Major League Baseball. His visit, independent of the Twins and all government entities, happened with no publicity whatsoever. Santee reviewed the site and reacted with skepticism, but saw no fatal flaws, nothing that made a ballpark impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citypages.com/news/earl-santee-talks-about-his-target-field-architecture-6546199|title=Earl Santee talks about his Target Field architecture {{!}} City Pages|last=Spicer|first=Judd|website=City Pages|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed to provide the working group with a concept drawing of a ballpark on that site, an image which was first published in August 2000, and quickly became the center of their ultimately successful campaign.

As Santee's dramatic drawing became more widely published, and Lambrecht and Pogin ramped up their lobbying efforts, others began to realize the advantages of the site. This included Mark Oyaas, founder of New Ballpark, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnvideovault.org/mvvPlayer/customPlaylist2.php?id=10159&amp;select_index=5&amp;popup=yes#5|title=tpt OnDemand Video: NewsNight Minnesota {{!}} Stadium - Discussion|website=www.mnvideovault.org|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a separate group of downtown Minneapolis business leaders, who sought to create a private financing plan for a stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savetheminnesotatwins.com/articles/06.06.2000.html|title=Save the Minnesota Twins.com - Articles - Business leaders will propose privately funded ball park|website=www.savetheminnesotatwins.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly settled on Rapid Park as their preferred ballpark site, which enhanced its visibility significantly. The Twins, however, completely ignored Rapid Park, and kept their distance from all of the ad hoc working groups. They would eventually go on record as believing that the Rapid Park site was too small and constrained to house the type of facility they sought to build.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalmpls.com/news/2002/11/twins-not-set-on-rapid-park-site/|title=Twins not set on Rapid Park site|date=November 19, 2002 |work=The Journal|accessdate=April 20, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Committees, contraction and competition (2000-2002) ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:C-17 cover.jpg|left|thumb|The cover of the C-17 report, commissioned by the city of Minneapolis, featured the Rapid Park concept drawing prominently.]] --&gt;

==== 2000 ====
No less than three committees were created in 2000 to offer recommendations on how to proceed.

The city of Minneapolis created a panel of citizens known as C-17 to consider various financing models. Their [http://www.ballparkmagic.com/_resources/c17report.pdf final report], issued in February 2001, while not specifically recommending a site, heavily featured the concept drawing of the Rapid Park site on multiple pages. The committee recommended that the city continue its discussions with New Ballpark, Inc., in the hopes of finding a private financing solution. Even before the work of the C-17 was complete, another (unnamed) group of staff analysts within city government, working with the Metropolitan Community Development Agency (MCDA), formally recommended the Rapid Park site to the City Council.

Simultaneously, the Twins assembled a 130-member advisory group, dubbed Minnesotans for Major League Baseball,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200101/11_wilcoxenw_stadium/members.shtml|title=MPR: Members of Minnesotans for Major League Baseball|last=Radio|first=Minnesota Public|website=news.minnesota.publicradio.org|language=en|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which met to discuss possible stadium alternatives.

Late in 2000, Twins CEO Chris Clouser proposed playing three games in a temporary outdoor stadium to be built adjacent to the [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington, MN]]. He hoped to demonstrate the pleasures of outdoor baseball as a way of jump-starting the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/13/sports/sp-3775|title=Twins Would Like a Little Fresh Air|last=STAPLETON|first=ARNIE|date=August 13, 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 20, 2017 |language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal ran into problems from insurance companies, the Minnesota Vikings (who stood to lose Metrodome revenue) and Major League Baseball. It was ultimately scrapped.

==== 2001 ====
During the [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/timecapsule/session?sess=82 2001 legislative session], the Twins pushed for a new financing plan based on ideas gleaned from their advisory committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200101/31_mccalluml_stadium/|title=MPR: Legislators Warming to Stadium Idea|last=Radio|first=Minnesota Public|website=news.minnesota.publicradio.org|language=en|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $300 million site-neutral plan would have featured a $150 million contribution from the Pohlads, $50 million from private enterprises, and the remaining $100 million in the form of an interest-free loan from the state of Minnesota. Many viewed the deal as significantly better for taxpayers than the 1997 plan. But the details of the financial arrangements once again were very complicated. Ultimately, the proposal fell victim to a political climate filled with distaste for the economics of baseball, general anti-stadium sentiments, and an unrelated budget standoff which nearly shut down the Minnesota government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/29/us/minnesota-lawmakers-rush-to-avoid-a-state-shutdown.html|title=Minnesota Lawmakers Rush To Avoid a State Shutdown|date=June 29, 2001 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 20, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200105/21_mccalluml_blamegame/|title=MPR: Lawmakers Cast Blame For Unfinished Business|last=Radio|first=Minnesota Public|website=news.minnesota.publicradio.org|language=en|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite that legislative misfire, in the summer of 2001 the city of Minneapolis became quite serious about the warehouse district site for a ballpark, after selecting the Twins' preferred riverfront site to house the new Guthrie Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chippewa.com/guthrie-theater-names-french-architect-jean-nouvel-to-build-new/article_6b7a6e54-205d-54c9-95a9-bf7506686dcc.html|title=Guthrie Theater names French architect Jean Nouvel to build new theater center on riverfront|work=Chippewa Herald|accessdate=April 20, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though no deal was struck to purchase the Rapid Park land at that time, an initial valuation of $10 million was assumed by the city for a roughly 10 acre parcel. Though not a realistic amount, it did fall conveniently within the restrictions of the 1997 referendum. The Twins were not involved in these discussions, and still exhibited no public interest whatsoever in the warehouse district location.

The Twins, stung by the repeated rejections, and feeling that they had no real prospects for a new ballpark in the Twin Cities, next became officially associated with Major League Baseball's long-rumored "contraction" plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savetheminnesotatwins.com/articles/11.04.2001.3.html|title=Save the Minnesota Twins.com - Articles - Why eliminate Twins?

This attempt at placing more pressure on decision-makers ultimately failed -- spectacularly and quickly -- when, a mere 10 days later, [http://www.twincities.com/2007/10/26/judge-who-spared-baseballs-twins-to-retire/ Hennepin County District Court Judge Harry Crump] ruled that the Twins, by virtue of Major League Baseball's federal anti-trust exemption, could not act as a typical business and simply buy out their Metrodome lease.

Even as the Twins were forced to continue playing in 2002, the seeds of the eventual financing solution were sown when [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]], in which the city of Minneapolis is located, began to express interest in being a financial partner in a ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savetheminnesotatwins.com/articles/02.19.2002.html|title=Save the Minnesota Twins.com - Articles - Hennepin County chairman to offer Twins ballpark plan|website=www.savetheminnesotatwins.com |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the Twins, Minnesota governor [[Jesse Ventura]] wanted to foster competition between the various localities, thinking it would spur more creativity in the structure of any deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savetheminnesotatwins.com/articles/03.16.2002.html|title=Save the Minnesota Twins.com - Articles - Ventura pitches Twins plan|website=www.savetheminnesotatwins.com |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, St. Paul legislators, led by new mayor [[Randy Kelly]], and aided by Hennepin County legislators wanting to keep their constituents off the hook, played hardball, and amended the ballpark bill so that only cities -- not counties -- could become financial partners in a ballpark.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Duncan Malloch Rendering (sized).JPG|left|thumb|Concept drawing for "Twinsville" created by Duncan Malloch.]] --&gt;

==== 2003 ====
With the [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/timecapsule/session?sess=83 2003 Minnesota Legislature] locked in bitter budget issues, the ballpark was never a central focus. No ballpark bill was passed during the session.

New governor [[Tim Pawlenty]], who, as a legislator, had been against public spending on stadiums, created the 20-member [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2004/other/040634/Stadium/www.stadium.state.mn.us/index-2.html Stadium Screening Committee] to "solve Minnesota's stadium conundrum." The committee was notable primarily for focusing equally on facilities for the Vikings and the Twins. They requested proposals from anyone anywhere with an idea for a stadium, and received 26, some more serious than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/01/16_khoom_stadiumplans/|title=MPR: Stadium committee awash in ballpark proposals|last=Radio|first=Minnesota Public|website=news.minnesota.publicradio.org|language=en |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious baseball proposals were received from Hennepin County/City of Minneapolis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2003/12/22/daily24.html |title=Minneapolis proposes baseball stadium at downtown site |website=www.bizjournals.com |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the City of St. Paul.

In the end, the recommendations in their [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2004/other/040634/Stadium/www.stadium.state.mn.us/rec/report_plus.pdf final report] (issued on February 2, 2004) were so general that they added nothing new to the debate, and the committee was dismissed as being for appearances only.

Separately, Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin reframed the discussion of their site with a proposal to create "Twinsville" as a neighborhood anchored by the new Twins ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A Downtown Ballpark Village?|last=St. Anthony|first=Neil|date=September 18, 2003|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concept drawings showed apartment buildings, commercial buildings and townhouses flanking the ballpark to the north and south, all clustered around a newly daylighted [[Bassett Creek (Crystal, Minnesota)|Bassett Creek]] (which runs in a deep culvert beneath the land). In a nod to Pawlenty's football focus, one provocative drawing included a football stadium to the west (on the current HERC site), sharing a retractable roof with the baseball facility. But this concept also hinted at the possibility that the land might have more valuable uses than as a home for the Twins, an idea which would play a significant role later. Nevertheless, their reframing succeeded in jump-starting interest in the project as plans began to form for bringing about action during the forthcoming 2004 legislative session.

The year ended with Minneapolis officially authorizing negotiations with Land Partners II (the investment group which owned the Rapid Park site) to gain control of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Minneapolis approves Warehouse site for Twins ballpark|last=Olson|first=Rochelle|date=December 30, 2003|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Twins6.jpg|left|thumb|Concept drawing of a retractable-roof stadium commissioned circa 2003 by the Minnesota Twins.]] --&gt;

==== 2004 ====
Early in 2004 the Twins unveiled a new vision of a stadium which could be built on any site with a footprint of at least four square blocks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Two concept drawings, with and without a retractable roof, were accompanied by a scale model (with roof) which was displayed at TwinsFest in January at the Metrodome. 

The report of Gov. Pawlenty's Stadium Screening Committee set off what the Star-Tribune described as "bitter financing competition between St. Paul and Hennepin County."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Ballpark: Fix and advance the bill|last=Board|first=Editorial|date=April 30, 2004|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though never seriously in the running, St. Paul's efforts effectively sabotaged Hennepin County again. Pawlenty advanced a plan that could build up to three stadiums (Twins, Vikings, and Gophers) albeit with uncertain financing. That uncertainty, combined with dollar amounts now in the billions, and intense partisan bickering over unrelated budget issues, meant that the stadium bill took a back seat and was not passed during the [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/timecapsule/session?sess=83 2004 session].

Behind the scenes in 2004, Hennepin County, led by commissioner [[Mike Opat]], continued negotiations with the Twins, settling on the rough framework for financing which was ultimately used.

And the city of Minneapolis, acting on the recommendation of its own advisory committee, worked out an option (assignable to Hennepin County) to purchase the Rapid Park land.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=$10 reserves site for possible Twins park|last=Sitaramiah|first=Gita|date=February 14, 2004|work=St. Paul Pioneer Press|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They agreed to pay $12.95 million plus 5 acres of adjacent land in exchange for the rights to purchase the 8-acre main ballpark site, effectively agreeing to pay $4.3 million per acre. This agreement expired at the end of 2004 when no stadium bill was passed, but it would play a key role in the later condemnation proceedings.

==== 2005 ====
2005 is remembered as the year that all parties thought a deal could get done, but it never happened.

On April 26, 2005, Hennepin County and the Twins announced that they had reached a deal on financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/04/25_williamsb_twins/|title=MPR: Pohlad: Contribution to Twins ballpark `fair, substantial'|last=Radio|first=Minnesota Public|website=news.minnesota.publicradio.org|language=en |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It closely matched what would be the eventual funding solution. In it, the Twins essentially relinquished their desire to put a roof on any new facility, accepting that it was not a financial possibility.

Though the ballpark was a subject of sometimes intense discussion in the [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/timecapsule/session?sess=84 2005 Minnesota Legislative session], it fell victim to a political climate which resulted in a lengthy shutdown of Minnesota government due to a budget impasse. No action was taken in either the regular session or the special session which resolved the budget dispute. Until the very end of the year, proponents held out hope that Pawlenty would call a second special session just for the purpose of dealing with the stadium issue, but he did not.

=== Success (2006) ===
With the entire Minnesota Legislature up for reelection in 2006, the session began with no expectation that a ballpark bill could pass. All parties were now committed to both the Hennepin County financing plan and the Rapid Park site, meaning all of the building blocks were in place for a deal, but optimism among the stakeholders was almost impossible to find.

It took Twins fan and blogger [https://www.lib.umn.edu/about/staff/shane-nackerud Shane Nackerud] to discover that the votes were there. He had long maintained a detailed spreadsheet of legislator statements on the ballpark issue, and was shocked to find, at the beginning of 2006, that the totals ran counter to the conventional wisdom. Both the House and the Senate contained enough "yes" votes to make passage possible. He passed his information to Lambrecht and Pogin, who made sure his spreadsheet got the widest possible distribution. This spurred all parties to push hard for the passage of a bill in the [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/timecapsule/session?sess=84 2006 session].

On April 18, 2006 Hennepin County formally approved a plan to contribute $392 million to a Twins ballpark on the Rapid Park site. The funds would be raised through a county-wide 0.15% sales tax which would also raise funds to support the [[Hennepin County Library|Hennepin County Libraries]] and youth sports activities within the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tcdailyplanet.net/hennepin-county-falls-back-sales-tax-base-support-libraries-0/|title=“Ballpark Mondays” will open some Minneapolis libraries|work=Twin Cities Daily Planet|accessdate=April 21, 2017|language=en-US}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was exempted from any public referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-fever.com/showthread.php?41956-Hennepin-board-OKs-Twins-stadium-plan|title=Hennepin board OKs Twins stadium plan|website=www.baseball-fever.com|language=en |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Final deliberations in the legislature centered on whether a referendum either was or should be required for any portion of the financing. All sides recognized that such a requirement would kill the project, and thus it became a proxy for deciding whether a ballpark should be built at all.

On May 20, 2006 the Minnesota Legislature approved a bill&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;f=HF2480&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2005|title=HF 2480 Status in the House for the 84th Legislature (2005 - 2006)|website=www.revisor.mn.gov|language=en |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; authorizing a new Twins ballpark on the Rapid Park site at an initial budgeted cost of $522 million. The cost was to be split between the Minnesota Twins (25%) and Hennepin County (75%). The Twins agreed to a total contribution of $130 million. A public referendum was not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://votesmart.org/bill/865/3132/3749/thomas-bakk-voted-yea-passage-hf-2480-baseball-stadium-financing-construction-and-operation#.WPo3UW_yvmg|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|website=Vote Smart|language=en-US |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2006, Governor Tim Pawlenty signed the legislation in front of a large crowd at the Metrodome before the start of a Twins game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.twins.mlb.com/news/article/1473342/|title=Gov.

Several procedural votes were still necessary by the Hennepin County Board, any of which had the potential to derail the project. The final of these was held on August 29, 2006, officially authorizing the imposition of the sales tax, effective January 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2006/08/29/stadiumtaxvote|title=Twins win Hennepin County stadium sales tax|last=Williams|first=Brandt |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the success of this vote, all legislative pieces were in place to formally authorize the ballpark, though acquisition of the Rapid Park land remained.

Construction of Target Field began on May 21, 2007.

=== Land Dispute (2007) ===
As work began on the ballpark, a final major snag threatened to derail the entire project for almost a year.

The bill authorizing the financing of Target Field specified a cap of $90 million for onsite infrastructure costs, which included land acquisition. Surprisingly, even though they were now authorized, Hennepin County did not take any action to acquire the land until very late in 2006.

Eventually, it was revealed that the county had budgeted $13.5 million for the land, or about $1.7 million per acre for 8 acres,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pressreader.com/usa/star-tribune/20070106/281535106509221|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; mistakenly assuming they could acquire it for roughly the dollar amount of the 2004 option agreement between the city of Minneapolis and Land Partners II (the investment group which owned Rapid Park). The dollar amount on that deal had been $12.9 million, though the deal had also included 5 acres of adjacent land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Effectively, it would have paid for only three acres of the 8-acre site that Hennepin County now needed to acquire, at a proposed price of $4.3 million per acre.

In addition to those numbers being far apart, much had changed since the 2004 deal expired. The Hiawatha Light Rail (later Blue Line) had opened and become a huge success. Funding for the Northstar commuter rail line had been approved. As anticipated, these two lines would eventually converge on the northwest corner of the Rapid Park Site, now the likely location for a future [[Target Field (Metro Transit station)|multi-modal transportation hub]]. The site itself had been rezoned in 2005, allowing its development into high end commercial and residential space. Land Partners II had entered into a development agreement with [[Hines Interests Limited Partnership|Hines Corporation]] for this purpose, as a backup in the event that the land was not chosen as home for the Twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citypages.com/news/stealing-home-6689395|title=Stealing Home {{!}} City Pages|last=Robson|first=Britt|website=City Pages |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the scarcity of land available in downtown Minneapolis, the land owners had multiple reasons to believe that the land’s value had, in fact, increased substantially since 2004, with or without a ballpark.

Still, Lambrecht and Pogin, now acting as spokesmen for Land Partners II and Hines, had long been on record as “willing sellers” of the land for a ballpark, stipulating only that their investment group would expect “fair market value.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emdo.blogspot.com/2007/01/stadium-squeeze-not-by-us-minneapolis.html|title=Eminent Domain Watch: Stadium 'squeeze'?

Anderson|website=City Pages |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hennepin County claimed that accepting the price set by an eminent domain judge was not an option for them, due to the infrastructure cap. Any additional money needed for the land would have to come out of some other piece of infrastructure. If the price set by a judge came in over their budget, they would have no funds to pay, and the project could collapse. But eminent domain did offer them the advantage of getting started on construction while working out the details of the land price later.

On September 19, 2006, Hennepin County officially authorized acquisition of the land, including doing so under eminent domain proceedings, if necessary. In late October the initial county appraisal of the land came in at the same $13.5 million that had been budgeted. Eminent domain proceedings were then initiated on November 1, 2006 as a precaution in case no agreement on land value could be reached by the time construction needed to start. The county set March 1, 2007 as the target date for finalizing acquisition of the Rapid Park site. There had still been no negotiations between the county and the land owners.

After months passed without an agreement, a harsh war of words erupted in the media in February 2007.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Twins angrily cancelled a planned unveiling of the ballpark design scheduled for February 15, declaring that the entire project was in jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/02/11/land-flap-prompts-twins-to-keep-stadium-design-under-wraps/|title=Land flap prompts Twins to keep stadium design under wraps – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Bell of the Twins and Mike Opat of Hennepin County gave multiple interviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnvideovault.org/mvvPlayer/customPlaylist2.php?id=7626&amp;select_index=2&amp;popup=yes#2|title=tpt OnDemand Video: Almanac {{!}} New Stadium Woes|website=www.mnvideovault.org |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they described the land owners as being “unwilling sellers,”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A Great Divide|last=Kaszuba|first=Mike|date=February 14, 2007|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; “greedy,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/02/19/pitch-in-twins/|title=Pitch in, Twins – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; “lawyered-up,”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=News Report|last=KARE-11|first=|date=February 11, 2007|work=KARE-11 News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; painted them as “greedy landowners in black hats,”&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnvideovault.org/mvvPlayer/customPlaylist2.php?id=7649&amp;select_index=4&amp;popup=yes#4|title=tpt OnDemand Video: Almanac {{!}} The New Twins Stadium|website=www.mnvideovault.org |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as not negotiating in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/02/09/hennepin-county-land-deal-holding-up-new-twins-ballpark/|title=Hennepin County / Land deal holding up new Twins ballpark – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambrecht and Pogin continued to insist that they had an obligation to their investors to secure nothing more than “fair market value” for the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/02/12/no-peek-at-stadium-plan-just-yet/|title=No peek at stadium plan just yet – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They repeatedly said that they would accept whatever valuation was determined in eminent domain proceedings,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lacrossetribune.com/news/state-and-regional/mn/site-dispute-puts-twins-stadium-in-unclear-situation/article_7d36788a-eb57-5fea-b334-36c7cc93575a.html|title=Site dispute puts Twins stadium in unclear situation|work=La Crosse Tribune |accessdate=April 22, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; while media reports would later reveal their internal valuation (required by eminent domain laws) to be $65 million.

In early April 2007 Hennepin County received assurances that the Twins would provide additional funds, if necessary, to cover cost overruns on infrastructure, including the land acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/04/09/hennepin-county-reaches-deal-on-twins-stadium-land/|title=Hennepin County reaches deal on Twins stadium land – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the initiation of [http://www.wtplaw.com/documents/2011/04/basics-of-condemnation “quick take”] proceedings, and the county gained control of the site effective May 1, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/05/01/county-takes-title-of-land-puts-twins-ballpark-closer-to-reality/|title=County takes title of land, puts Twins ballpark closer to reality – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a final sale price to be determined later. This effectively mitigated the problem of the infrastructure cap and allowed the unveiling of the ballpark design on April 12, and construction to begin on May 21, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/05/15/minneapolis-clearing-of-ballpark-site-begins-monday/|title=Minneapolis / Clearing of ballpark site begins Monday – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the beginning of construction, the land stalemate dragged on for months, as did the harsh rhetoric in the media. Some members of the media and public placed blame on Hennepin County for not securing the land before getting authorization to build the ballpark, while others laid the blame on the sellers for allegedly increasing their price once the legislation passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2007/07/05/landvaluefight|title=Hennepin County, land owners remain far apart on value of ballpark site|last=Williams|first=Brandt |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 2007, a three-member condemnation panel set the value of the land at $23.8 million by a vote of 2 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/08/19/panel-twins-ballpark-site-worth-23-8m/|title=Panel: Twins ballpark site worth $23.8M – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a separate opinion valuing the land at $33.2 million was filed by the dissenting judge. The landowners immediately announced that they would appeal the condemnation ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/08/23/land-price-ruling-for-twins-stadium-site-to-be-appealed/|title=Land price ruling for Twins stadium site to be appealed – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a court date was set for November.

Ten days later, on August 30, 2007, the ceremonial groundbreaking took place,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/08/30/after-all-the-nastiness-infield-grass-and-blue-sky/|title=After all the nastiness, infield grass and blue sky – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the ongoing land dispute (the event had been scheduled for August 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/06/18/twins-groundbreaking-for-new-stadium-aug-2/|title=Twins: Groundbreaking for new stadium Aug. 2 – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was postponed in the aftermath of the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge|I-35W bridge collapse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/08/09/twins-shift-new-ballpark-groundbreaking-back-to-aug-30/|title=Twins shift new ballpark groundbreaking back to Aug. 30 – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Eventually, after exchanging divergent values for several weeks, both parties agreed to mediation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/09/12/county-landowners-agree-to-mediation-over-stadium-site-dispute/|title=County, landowners agree to mediation over stadium site dispute – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the November court date fast approaching, the final agreement was reached on October 12, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/10/14/hennepin-county-to-pay-28m-for-twins-ballpark-land-pohlad-to-pay-15m-more/|title=Hennepin County to pay $28M for Twins ballpark land; Pohlad to pay $15M more – Twin Cities |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a negotiated price of $29 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2007/10/15/stadiumlanddeal|title=Two sides agree on stadium land sale, but don't sound happy|last=Williams|first=Brandt |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make the deal possible, the Twins had agreed to make up the $15 million difference between that price and what Hennepin County had originally budgeted. In exchange, they received the right to develop several acres near the ballpark. Land Partners II received property and air rights over Dock Street, which was to be created for access to the ballpark from the north.

With the establishment of the land value, the final potential obstacle to the completion of Target Field was resolved.

=== Naming ===
On September 15, 2008, the Twins and Minneapolis-based [[Target Corporation]] announced that the ballpark would be named Target Field. Financial terms of the [[naming rights]] agreement were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Minnesota Twins and Target Announce New Partnership|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080915&amp;content_id=3479747&amp;vkey=pr_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's investment also funded a pedestrian bridge from the ballpark to downtown, Target Plaza, more seating, canopies and public art.&lt;ref name="Bruch"&gt;{{cite news |title=New Ballpark Will Be Named 'Target Field'|first=Michelle|last=Bruch|url=http://www.downtownjournal.com/index.php?&amp;story=12363&amp;page=65&amp;category=86|work=Downtown Journal|publisher=Minnesota Premier Publications|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is about the same size as that of [[Fenway Park]], and the ballpark holds roughly the same number of seats. The site is bounded by 3rd Avenue (southeast, right field, across from Target Center); 5th Street North (northeast, left field); 7th Street North (southwest, first base); Hennepin Environmental Recovery Center [garbage [[incinerator]]] and 6th Avenue North (northwest, third base). 3rd Avenue is a westbound one-way street which dips down under the right field seats and serves as a ramp to I-394 westbound. A separate, small westbound segment of 3rd Avenue, connecting 7th Street North with Glenwood Avenue, was renamed "Twins Way". The ballpark's street address, "1 Twins Way", is at the "foot" of the renamed street.

===LEED Certification===
Target Field was initially awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, the second LEED-certified professional sports stadium in the United States, after [[AT&amp;T Park]]. It is one of 3 baseball stadiums with LEED certification (the other being [[Nationals Park]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Heather|last=Benjamin|title=LEED Link: Find a LEED stadium near you|url=https://www.usgbc.org/articles/leed-link-find-leed-stadium-near-you|publisher=[[U.S. Green Building Council]]|date=May 23, 2017|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, Target Field was recertified LEED Gold, the first sports site in the nation to be so designated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rochelle|last=Olson|title=Target Field honored as greenest ballpark in America|url=http://www.startribune.com/target-field-honored-as-greenest-ballpark-in-america/420152943/|publisher=[[StarTribune Media, LLC|Star Tribune]]|date=April 23, 2017|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upgrades===
[[File:New 2nd scoreboard.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The right field scoreboard, photo taken March 2011.]]

On February 12, 2008, the Twins announced $22.4 million in upgrades to the original design, and increased the Twins ownership stake in the ballpark to $167.4 million, bringing the total ballpark cost to $412 million.&lt;ref name=MNTwins021208&gt;Jim Molony, {{cite web|title=Twins Kick in Extra Funds for Ballpark|first=Jim|last=Molony|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080212&amp;content_id=2371679&amp;vkey=ballpark_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=February 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316012919/http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080212&amp;content_id=2371679&amp;vkey=ballpark_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min|archive-date=March 16, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MNTwins021408&gt;{{cite web |title=Ballpark Enhancements Help Ensure Superior Fan Experience|first=Dave|last=St. Peter|url=http://twinsballpark.mlblogs.com/twinsballpark/2008/02/ballpark_enhanc.html|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upgrades were mainly based around increasing fan experience and comfort. The upgrades included an enlarged canopy [[soffit]] (the largest in baseball), protecting fans further from the elements, in light of the stadium not having a roof. The Twins also upgraded the scoreboard – the fourth-largest in Major League Baseball – from standard definition to a high definition display from [[Daktronics]] measuring {{convert|101|ft|m}} long and {{convert|57|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name=scoreboard&gt;{{cite news|title=Twins Scoreboard: Larger Than Life, and Twice As Gizmo-y|first=Paul|last=Walsh|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/32897324.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUqCP:iUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiU|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=October 23, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026150129/http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/32897324.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUqCP:iUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiU|archive-date=October 26, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Daktronics&gt;{{cite press release |title=Minnesota Twins Open Target Field with Integrated Daktronics Super System|url=http://www.daktronics.com/Company/NewsReleases/Pages/MinnesotaTwinsTargetField.aspx|publisher=[[Daktronics]]|date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other upgrades included warming shelters, changing {{convert|100000|sqft|m2}} of the exterior surface to [[Kasota limestone|Kasota stone]], and increasing the number of restrooms and concession areas. The park features a modernized version of the original "Minnie and Paul Shaking Hands" logo used on the team's original uniforms from 1961 until 1986 (the logo has also been on the home uniforms since 2001). When a Twins player hits a home run, the Minnie and Paul sign lights up with strobe lights surrounding the Minnesota state outline and Minnie and Paul shake hands, akin to the Liberty Bell used at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in Philadelphia. The original flagpole from [[Metropolitan Stadium]] – completely restored – is located on the right field plaza. The flagpole was located at the [[American Legion]] post in [[Richfield, Minnesota|Richfield]] after Metropolitan Stadium's closing, and was donated back to the Twins by the Legion as a gesture of goodwill.

On November 10, 2010, the Twins announced a number of upgrades to Target Field, all of which were completed in time for the 2011 season. Highlights among the upgrades included a scoreboard in right-center field and the "Twins Tower" (a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} tall illuminated tower), next to the new scoreboard. Other changes include free [[Wi-Fi]] service for fans, expanded concession stand menus, and the addition of more radiant heaters and artwork around the ballpark. In total, the changes were expected to cost the Twins $4–6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Target Field Set for Upgrades|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5789289|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the 14 black spruce trees located in the [[batter's eye]] were removed, following hitters' complaints that the trees interfered with the ability to see pitches as they would sometimes sway in the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Twins Clear-Cut Target Field|url=http://ballparkdigest.com/201103013616/major-league-baseball/news/twins-clear-cut-target-field|work=Ballpark Digest|date=March 1, 2010|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The batter's eye wall itself was covered in a black material designed to reduce glare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Batter's Eye Draws Positive Reviews|first1=Rhett|last1=Bollinger|first2=Jordan|last2=Schelling|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20110409&amp;content_id=17555492&amp;notebook_id=17567806&amp;vkey=notebook_min|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=April 9, 2011|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2013, Target Field has hosted every summer the Skyline Music Festival, named so because its seating, with only the seats around third base in an [[Amphitheatre]]-like manner, allows for extensive views of the Minneapolis skyline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/261812231.html Melissa Etheridge to headline at Target Field for Skyline Music Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural edition was held on July 26, 2013, featuring three of four bands in a package tour – [[Soul Asylum]], [[Matthew Sweet]] and [[Big Head Todd and the Monsters]], each of whom played one of their past albums in their entirety – along with Minnesota band [[Gear Daddies]]. The 6,752 tickets allowed by the section were sold out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twincities.com/music/ci_23742748/review-twins-hit-home-run-skyline-music-festival ]&lt;/ref&gt; The following edition was extended to two nights.

==Features==
{{prose|section|date=December 2017}}

===The stadium===
*The popular left-field [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] roof deck features mostly standing room and the only bonfire in the Majors.
*The bullpens are "double-decker" style in left-center field.  The Twins' pen is farthest from the field, with the opposing team's pen below it, closest to the field.
*The batter's eye featured 14 young [[Picea mariana|black spruce]] trees (each about 6 feet high) the first year.  After criticism from Twins and opposing players concerning the shadows that they cast, the trees were removed prior to the second year.  Some were auctioned to fans and ticket holders while the rest were donated to [[List of Minnesota state parks|Minnesota state parks]].
*[[Kasota limestone]] is used in much of the stadium and is from [[Kasota, Minnesota|Kasota]], near [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]].
*The admission gates are numbered according to former Twins legends and roughly located near to the positions that they played;
**Left field gate is #6 honoring [[Tony Oliva]] (with his bronze statue nearby)
**Centerfield gate is #3 for [[Harmon Killebrew]]
**Target Plaza gate (in right field) is #34 in tribute to [[Kirby Puckett]]
**Right field gate is #29 in tribute to [[Rod Carew]]
**Home plate gate is #14 in honor of [[Kent Hrbek]] (featuring his bronze statue)

===Target Plaza===
Target Plaza is the gathering area behind the right field gate (Gate 34). On the wall of the adjacent parking garage facing the ballpark is a wind veil that makes waves as the wind blows.  At night, color-changing lights add to the effect. Near the wind veil there are 9 topiary frames each {{convert|40|ft|m}} high shaped like baseball bats with hops growing on them. They are lit up every night with the same color changing scheme as the veil, however, during games they are lit up red, in sequential order, to denote the current inning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/90324237.html Visuals big part of trip to Target Field] ''[[Star Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  In this plaza are statues of former players [[Kirby Puckett]], [[Rod Carew]], [[Kent Hrbek]] and [[Harmon Killebrew]], as well as former owners [[Calvin Griffith]], [[Carl Pohlad]] and his wife, Eloise Pohlad and Twins mascot TC Bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carew Supports Griffith Statue Being Placed Near His Target Field Gate|first=Paul|last=Walsh|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/101657538.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=August 27, 2010|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A large "Golden Glove" sits in the plaza in recognition of all Twins players to win the Gold Glove Award.  The statue can be sat on and is a popular photo attraction.  It is located exactly {{convert|520|ft|m}} from home plate, the distance of Harmon Killebrew's longest home run at Met Stadium (although his was hit into the left field upper deck).

There is also a monument that shows all the venues that Minnesota-based baseball teams played in. On the rails of the pedestrian skybridge are pennants that contain the rosters of all the Twins teams, and pennants of players, coaches, front office people, and other contributors who have been elected to the Twins Hall of Fame.

===The field===
The main flagpoles are in right field near the Plaza.  The largest pole, which flies the Stars and Stripes, is the original pole used at [[Metropolitan Stadium]].  It was relocated to the Richfield Legion Post 435 after the Met was demolished, and, after being cut in half and refurbished, was re-installed for baseball at Target Field.  The first flags--both US and POW/MIA--donated by Post 435 were raised at the first Twins exhibition game by veteran and flagpole historian B.W. McEvers of Bloomington. On September 6, [[Jim Thome]] hit a solo home run against the [[Kansas City Royals]] that hit the flag pole. 

The championship banners fly on small flagpoles located on the upper rim of the stadium beyond left field.  Each pole recognizes each division, league, and world championship since the team's arrival in {{mlby|1961}}.  On the stadium's upper rim in right-center field are small flagpoles that fly the flag for all the teams (including the Twins) in the division.  The order that the flags fly are determined by the divisional standings.  

Home plate is the same one used at the Metrodome.  After the Twins' final dome game (Game 3 of the [[2009 American League Division Series|2009 ALDS]]), the plate was dug up and later installed at Target Field. In addition, several handfuls of dirt were taken from the sliding pit and pitcher's mound areas from the Metrodome and scattered near their counterparts at Target Field.

===Twins bars and restaurants===
At Target Field, there are three prominent bars and restaurants:

*The Town Ball Tavern is located on the upper concourse by the left field corner, and is famous for serving the [[Jucy Lucy]] burger. The wood flooring is the same used on the basketball court at the [[Minneapolis Armory]] during the NBA [[Minneapolis Lakers]] stay, before leaving for Los Angeles.
*Hrbek's is located on the main concourse behind home plate, and is named after former Twins [[first baseman]] [[Kent Hrbek]].
*There are two bars located on the upper concourse behind home plate, collectively called the Two Gingers Pubs. In one of these bars, fans can watch the Target Field organist, Sue Nelson, perform during games. Out of these three bars and restaurants, the Two Gingers Pub (formerly known as the Twins Pub) is the only one that does not serve food, however it is the only one in which the field is visible from inside.

Concessions throughout also include several Minnesota favorites like walleye, wild rice soup, Kramarczuk's sausages, as well as a "State Fair Foods" stand where many items are served "on a stick", such as the J.D. Hoyt's pork chop.

In 2018, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] declared Target Field number one on its annual list of [[vegan]]-friendly ballparks, thanks to the availability of foods like tofu vindaloo, vegan Sriracha Brats and Italian Sausages, [[Daiya]] cheese pizza, and Field Roast burgers and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Reichard, "Target Field Leads List of Vegan-Friendly Ballparks," [https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/06/04/target-field-leads-list-of-vegan-friendly-ballparks/ BallparkDigest.com], 4 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minnie and Paul logo===
[[File:Minnie and Paul.jpg|thumb|right|300px.|Minnie and Paul, representing the Twin Cities, is the logo for the Minnesota Twins.]]
A large version of the Twins' original "Minnie and Paul" logo (designed by local artist, Ray Barton &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ray Barton obituary|url=http://www.harrisfam.org/rootspersona-tree-2/ray-alphonzo-barton/|work=Harris family genealogy site|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) stands in center field.  It shows two players wearing the uniforms of the two minor-league teams that played in the Twin Cities before the Twins' arrival, the [[Minneapolis Millers]] and [[St. Paul Saints (1901–60)|St. Paul Saints]], shaking hands across the [[Mississippi River]].  During various points in the game, the strobe lights surrounding the logo flash. This sign was a concept designed and illustrated by RipBang Studios but built by others.

When the Twins score a run by any means other than a home run, the strobe lights trace the border from the bottom-left corner for each Twins player that crosses home plate, symbolizing that a Twins player rounded the bases. For each strikeout, the corners of the sign flash to portray the strike zone. The strobe lights will flash at the end of the top of an inning if the Twins do not surrender a run during the inning. After a Twins home run, the strobe lights flash, Minnie and Paul shake hands, and the Mississippi River flows. After a Twins victory, the "T" and "s" in "Twins" will blink to show the message "Twins win" in addition to the animation shown following a Twins home run.

==METRO and commuter rail connections==
The stadium is well-connected to the city's transit network, being immediately adjacent to the "A" and "B" [[parking ramp]]s of the large ABC Ramps complex at the end of [[Interstate 394]], which include two major transit bus terminals and link to the rest of downtown Minneapolis via [[skyway]].  Over 8,000 people typically arrive to each game via the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] and [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]], both of which terminate at [[Target Field (Metro Transit station)|Target Field Station]], just 10 yards from the park's Gate 6. For fans arriving from the northwest suburbs, the [[Northstar Line]] commuter rail terminates in downtown Minneapolis with a station underneath the ballpark.

: *This is the official capacity.  However, Standing Room Only (SRO) tickets are available that can increase this capacity by approximately 2,500+.
: **6,000 seats were covered by a curtain; these and others made the stadium expandable to 55,883 during baseball playoffs and certain games in the last homestand and one-game playoff in October 2009.
: ***Controlled by the [[Minnesota Vikings]] football team.

Field dimensions are roughly comparable, with the left field area being a few feet closer to the plate, and the center field area being bounded by a 45° facet instead of a quarter-circle.

The Twins' previous homes in the Twin Cities, [[Metropolitan Stadium]] and the Metrodome, were friendly to hitters. The team intended to build Target Field as a "neutral" park, favoring neither hitters nor pitchers. However, following the 2010 regular season, statistics showed that the park definitely played more to the favor of pitchers than hitters.{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/sports/baseball/05twins.html?src=un&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjson8.nytimes.com%2Fpages%2Fsports%2Fbaseball%2Findex.jsonp|title=Power Still Off at Twins’ New Home|last=Borzi|first=Pat|date=October 5, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become well known as a "pitcher's park" in that it is difficult for batters to hit home runs and the pitcher has an advantage. Twins star [[Justin Morneau]] spoke for many of the players' concerns by calling "right-center to left-center... ridiculous" and that it is "almost impossible for a right-handed hitter to [homer to the] opposite field and very difficult for lefties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Justin Morneau Laments Target Fences|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5796135|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=November 12, 2010|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
