The '''Asian Civilisations Museum''' (ACM) is an institution which forms a part of the four museums in Singapore, the other three being the [[Peranakan Museum]] at [[Old Tao Nan School]], the [[National Museum of Singapore]] and the [[Singapore Art Museum]].

It is one of the pioneering museums in the region to specialise in pan-Asian cultures and civilisations. The museum specialises in the material history of China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia, from which the diverse ethnic groups of Singapore trace their ancestry.

==History==
The museum first opened at the [[Old Tao Nan School]] building on 22 April 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Story of Our Museums|url = http://acm.org.sg/about-us/story-of-our-museums|website = Asian Civilisations Museum|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Armenian Street, with exhibits largely centred on Chinese civilisation. With the restoration of the [[Empress Place Building]], the museum established its new flagship museum there on 2 March 2003, rapidly expanding the collection to other areas of Asia. The Armenian Street branch closed for renovations on 1 January 2006 and reopened on 25 April 2008 as the [[Peranakan Museum]], specialising in [[Peranakan]] culture. 


On 16 September 2006, the Museum officially launched its new logo with a new slogan ''The Asian Civilisations Museum&amp;nbsp;– Where Asian Cultures Come Alive!''. This new logo reflects the museum's unique location by the historic Singapore River, the source and origin of Singapore multicultural society, which the ACM presents in its collection. The brown reflected image also alludes to the museum as a place for reflection, while the vibrant orange is an invigorating colour which represents activity and energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=The ACM logo |date=13 September 2006 |publisher=Ancient Civilizations Museum |url=http://www.acm.org.sg/pressroom/newsdetail.asp?generalNewsID=5 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, after undergoing a rebranding exercise, the Museum launched its new logo with a new slogan ''Singapore's Museum of Asia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acm.org.sg/about-us/story-of-our-museums|title=Story of Our Museums|date=19 September 2016|website=Story of Our Museums – Asian Civilisations Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2014, the Museum was named the top museum in Singapore and ranked ninth in Asia by [[TripAdvisor]]’s Travellers’ Choice awards. The Museum was the only Singapore museum ranked among Asia's top 10 museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Asian Civilisations Museum ranked top museum in Singapore: TripAdvisor|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/asian-civilisations-museum-ranked-top-museum-singapore-tripadvisor|accessdate=17 September 2014|agency=TODAY|publisher=MediaCorp|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2015, the Museum unveiled its new spaces after it started its revamp in 2014. The revamp is carried out in phases: Phase 1 was unveiled on 14 November 2015. Phase 2 was completed in April 2016, with further enhancements to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acm.org.sg/about-us/new-spaces|title=New Spaces|year=2015|website=New Spaces|publisher=Asian Civilisations Museum|access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection highlights==
[[File:Gandharan sculpture - head of a bodhisattva front view.jpg|thumb|upright|Head of a Bodhisattva, [[Gandhara]], ca. 4th century]]
The Chinese collection is represented by fine Dehua porcelain figures, Taoist and Buddhistic statuary, export porcelain, calligraphy and other examples of decorative art.

The South Asian Galleries feature statuary from a broad spectrum of periods including some fine [[Chola]] bronzes. Of particularly note is the Chola bronze sculpture of Uma, the consort of [[Shiva]] and that of [[Somaskanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acm.org.sg/collections/top-20-highlights/somaskanda-shiva-parvati-and-their-son-skanda |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827053541/http://acm.org.sg/collections/top-20-highlights/somaskanda-shiva-parvati-and-their-son-skanda |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-08-27 |title=Somaskanda (Shiva, Parvati, and their son Skanda) |work=Asian Civilisations Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Buddhist art of India is also represented by works hailing from the [[Mathura]] and [[Gandhara]] schools, including a rare sandstone Mathura Buddha dating to the [[Kanishka]] era,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acm.org.sg/collections/top-20-highlights/seated-buddha |title=Seated Buddha |work=Asian Civilisations Museum |access-date=4 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828004547/http://acm.org.sg/collections/top-20-highlights/seated-buddha |archive-date=28 August 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the head of a Gandharan [[Bodhisattva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acm.org.sg/collections/top-20-highlights/head-of-a-bodhisattva |title=Head of a Bodhisattva |work=Asian Civilisations Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of note include South Indian woodwork, Nepali-Tibetan bronzes, textiles, late medieval miniatures and colonial prints.

The Southeast Asian collections are broad in scope and are rich in ethnological material. Representing the aristocratic art of ancient Southeast Asia are Khmer sculptures, [[Java]]nese temple sculpture (some on loan from Leiden), later Buddhist art from [[Burma]]/[[Thailand]] and the Sinicised temple art of [[Vietnam]]. [[Peranakan]] gold, textiles, tribal ornament and theatrical masks are other strengths of the collection.

The Khoo Teck Puat Gallery is the permanent home for the cargo recovered from the [[Belitung shipwreck|Tang Shipwreck]], a sunken 9th century trading ship bound for Iran and Iraq, discovered in 1998 off [[Belitung]] Island in the Java Sea. The recovered cargo comprises more than 60,000 well-preserved ceramics produced in China during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), as well as objects of gold and silver. 

Certain gallery rooms are also used for temporary exhibitions. A recent exhibition included the display of the spectacular [[Bronze Age]] masks from [[Sanxingdui]], Sichuan Province, China.

==Facilities==
The museum has a restaurant, Empress, featuring traditional Chinese dishes in a contemporary setting, and a café, Privé ACM, offering all day dining. There are ballrooms and halls available for functions. The museum shop has souvenirs and a wide range of books on Asian art.

The '''Association for Recorded Sound Collections''' (ARSC) is a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to the preservation and study of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]].  Established in 1966, members include [[record collector]]s, [[discography|discographers]], and [[audio engineer]]s, together with [[librarian]]s, [[curator]]s, [[archivist]]s, and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ARSC was founded in 1966&lt;ref&gt;Howard Klein, "The Voice of the Collector Is Heard in the Land," ''New York Times'', March 6, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; by a group of academics, primarily music librarians, who felt that contemporary professional associations such as the [[Music Library Association]] (MLA) were not paying enough attention to the special needs of recorded sound archives, and that scholars were giving too little attention to historical recorded sound as opposed to printed sources.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brooks, "ARSC:  Association For Recorded Sound collections -- An Unusual Organization", ''Goldmine'', February, 1983, pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to professional organizations such as the MLA and the [[American Library Association]], ARSC by design also welcomed private record collectors, since they held (and needed to preserve) many important recordings that were not present in institutional collections. Furthermore, ARSC was intended to bring together collectors from all genres, classical, jazz, popular, etc., as well as those concerned with spoken word recordings.

After three organizational meetings in 1965 and 1966, and the election of its first president, Philip L. Miller, Chief of the Music Division, New York Public Library, ARSC's first annual conference was held at Indiana University in March 1967. Its first publication was the ''Preliminary Directory of Sound Recording Collections in the United States and Canada'' (1967), listing 1,500 public and private collections. This was followed by the launch of the ''ARSC Journal'' (1968), the ''ARSC Newsletter'' (1977), and other publications. Other important projects have included The [[Rigler-Deutsch Index]], a union catalog of the 615,000 78 rpm holdings of five major public archives.&lt;ref&gt;Elwood McKee, "ARSC/AAA: Fifteen Years of Cooperative Research," ''ARSC Journal'', Volume 20 No. 1 (Spring 1989), 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Data from this massive project is now part of the [[WorldCat]] online library catalog.

ARSC is governed by an eight-person board of directors, seven of whom are elected biennially by the membership. The eighth, the executive director, is appointed by the president with the approval of the board, is non-voting, and handles day-to-day operations. In the early years ARSC's leadership consisted primarily of professional archivists, but in later years it broadened to include scholars and private collectors, several of whom have served as president. A historical listing of officers and committee chairs can be found on the association's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arsc-audio.org/pdf/past_officers_and_chairs.pdf |title=ARSC Officers and Committee Chairs |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ARSC is based in the U.S., about ten percent of its membership is located in other countries. The association maintains close relations with the [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives]] (IASA) and is a member of the [[Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations]] (CCAAA), an international umbrella group concerned with audiovisual preservation matters worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccaaa.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual conference==

ARSC has held an annual conference each year since 1967.  It generally takes place over three days between April and June in a city in the United States, though two conferences have taken place in [[Canada]] and one in [[London]]. Several conferences have been held jointly with the [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/pastconferences.html&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, there are two session tracks, one focusing on artists and repertoire, musical genres, collecting, and discographies, the other on technical issues of audio preservation and restoration, library cataloging issues, the history of recorded sound, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/conference/2015/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cumulatively, approximately 1,200 papers and panels have been presented through 2015, and nearly all have been professionally audio (and sometimes video) recorded and made available to members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/cds.html&lt;/ref&gt; A project is currently underway to digitize and post them online. In addition, since 2012 workshops conducted in conjunction with the conference have been streamed live.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Fishman and Aaron Bittel, "Copyright Workshop Kicks Off ARSC Conference 2012 with Live Webcast," ''ARSC Newsletter'' No. 129 (Summer 2012), 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The ''ARSC Journal'' is a [[academic journal|peer-reviewed journal]] that has been in existence since 1968.  Currently published semi-annually, it “serves to document the history of sound recording and includes original articles on many aspects of research and preservation: biography; cataloging; copyright law; current research; discography; technical aspects of sound restoration, etc., etc.”  It also includes reviews of books and sound recordings, as well as an ongoing bibliography of articles of interest that have appeared in other journals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/journal.html&lt;/ref&gt; In all, more than 2,200 articles and reviews have been published through 2015, all of which are now available online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/journal-index/home.php&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ARSC Newsletter'', containing association news, is published three times a year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsc-audio.org/newsletter.html |title=ARSC newsletter|accessdate=2016-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''Membership Directory'' is published electronically each year. Other publications include the ''ARSC Guide to Audio Preservation'' (2015), a guide for smaller public and private collections.&lt;ref&gt;"New ARSC Guide Offers Sound Preservation Advice," ''ARSC Newsletter'' No. 138 (Summer 2015), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Beginning in 1991 ARSC has presented a number of Awards for Excellence “to authors and publishers of books, articles, or recording liner notes, to recognize outstanding published research in the field of recorded sound.”  Each year, a Lifetime Achievement Award is presented for recorded sound research and publication, and an Award for Distinguished Service to Historical Recordings is presented for other contributions to the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/awards/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grants==

The Research Grants Program supports the research involving audio preservation and sound recordings, including discographies and historical studies of the sound recording industry.  The Preservation of Classical Music Historical Recordings Grants Program supports “the preservation of historically significant sound recordings of Western Art Music.”  ARSC also provides a modest number of Travel Grants for first-time attendees at the annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/committees/grant-programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Email discussion list and social media==

ARSClist is an unmoderated [[electronic mailing list|email discussion list]] sponsored by ARSC.  Subscription is open to members and to the archival community at large.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/arsclist.html&lt;/ref&gt; ARSC also has a presence on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[LinkedIn]], and [[YouTube]], among other places.

==Committees==

===Copyright and Fair Use===

Since 2005, the Copyright and Fair Use Committee has led the organization in advocating for changes in U.S. copyright laws to ensure the preservation of and public access to historical sound recordings. This has included testimony at U.S. Copyright Office hearings and a number of studies and position papers. Currently, there are no sound recordings in the [[Public domain in the United States|public domain]]. Recordings made after 1972 are covered by Federal copyright laws; pre-1972 recordings remain under state laws until 2067 (assuming that copyright term will not be extended again).  Making copies of recordings is a violation of copyright law; therefore, libraries and archives may not legally be able to perform necessary [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] work. Public access is limited by rights holders who will neither release historical material nor allow others to do so. In 2009 ARSC was instrumental in securing legislation directing the Copyright Office to study the status of pre-1972 recordings, which resulted in a Copyright Office recommendation that Congress address this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brooks, "ARSC Secures Historic Legislation," ''ARSC Newsletter'', No. 120 (Summer 2009), 1, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; ARSC also favors changes in copyright law related to [[Orphan works in the United States|orphan works]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brooks, "The Association for Recorded Sound Collections and the Movement to Reform Copyright in the United States," ''Popular Music and Society'', Volume 35, Issue 5, 2012, pp. 683-689.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 ARSC co-founded with other organizations the Historical Recording Coalition for Access and Preservation to pursue these issues,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recordingcopyright.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the Copyright and Fair Use Committee keeps members informed of news related to sound recording copyright and fair use issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsc-audio.org/copyright-committee.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A comparison between [[American football]] and [[rugby league]] is possible because of their shared origins and similar game concepts.  Along with [[Canadian football]], rugby league is the most similar sport to American football. Both sports involve the concept of a limited number of downs/tackles and scoring touchdowns/tries takes clear precedence over goal-kicking.

Generally, American football games last much longer than 80-minute rugby league matches. Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football, it is much slower-paced than the more hectic rugby league, in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play. Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league; defending players interfering with any other attacking player (and vice versa) will incur a penalty. Passing in the two sports also differs: while [[Lateral pass|backward]] passing is common to both sports, in American football players are allowed to throw the ball [[forward pass|forward]] in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal.  Rugby league players have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield. To score a try or touchdown in rugby league, the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone, whereas in American football the player has to simply cross the line.  American football also requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment, including helmets, gloves and padding around the body, whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league, usually amounting to light padding (if any) and soft head gear (hard helmets being illegal). 
The rugby [[Rugby league playing field|pitch]] and American football field are both similar in size with a pitch being 100 meters while a football field is 100 yards.

==Origins==
Both sports descend from the older game of [[rugby football]] in the 19th Century when its two offshoots developed.  British colonists and the British military in Canada brought football to North America. It became popular in American and Canadian universities and prep schools. At the time, [[association football]] and rugby football were not as differentiated as they are now and teams would negotiate the rules before playing each game. The sports of [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]] evolved from these intercollegiate games.

Meanwhile, in England a schism developed in rugby football between those who favoured strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. In 1895, this resulted in the formation of a break-away sport, [[rugby league]], which permitted player payments.  At first, the two rugby codes differed only in how they were administered; over time, their playing rules diverged to the point that they are now distinctly different forms of football.

==The field==
[[File:AmFBfield.svg|thumb|right|251px|An American football field]]
[[File:NRL Rugby League field.svg|thumb|A rugby league field]]

American football is played on a rectangular field {{convert|120|yd|m|lk=on}} long by 53 1⁄3 yards (48.8 m) wide. Near each end of the field is a ''goal line'', which are {{convert|100|yd}} apart. A scoring area called an [[end zone]] extends {{convert|10|yd}} beyond each goal line. Yard lines cross the field every {{convert|5|yd}}, two rows of hash marks run parallel to the side lines near the middle of the field. At the back of each of the end zones, there are a set of goalposts. American football goalposts were formerly H-shaped and were located on the goal line, but; in 1967, the NFL adopted the current modern offset-fork design, made from extruded steel pipes. The goalposts currently consist of two vertical posts 18.5 feet (5.6 m) apart (24 feet (7.3 m) in high school football) rising from a horizontal crossbar, which is mounted on a single central support post that raises the crossbar to a height of 10 feet (3.0 m), resulting in a two-tined fork shape. The central vertical post is offset from the crossbar toward the rear, placing it as far as possible from the field of play; it is also usually padded to minimize collision-related injuries. In 1974, in the effort to create a safer, unimpeded field of play in the end zone, calculated to produce more passing touchdowns, the NFL relocated the goalposts from the goal line to the end line.    

A rugby league field has very similar dimensions, being up to {{convert|120|m|yd|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|68|m|yd}} wide. Lines cross the field marking every {{convert|10|m|yd}}.  The goal posts are separated by exactly {{convert|100|m|yd}} and the area beyond each goal post, known as the ''in-goal area'', extends for another {{convert|6-11|m|yd}}. In rugby league, goal posts are usually H-shaped, each post being {{convert|16|m|ft}} high and {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} apart, with the cross bar being {{convert|3|m|ft}} high.  American football "tuning fork" goal posts are allowed in rugby league, provided the posts and cross bar are at the required dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrl.com/portals/nrl/RadEditor/Documents/NRL%20Rules%20book%202013FINAL.pdf Rugby League Laws], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal posts are used for other forms of point scoring in rugby league: [[Drop goal (rugby)|drop goals or field goals]], [[penalty (rugby)|penalty goals]] and [[Try#Conversion|conversions]].

==Players==
{{further|American football positions|Rugby league positions}}

As four replacements in a rugby league team, with only twelve interchanges of players allowed to be made throughout the game (ten in the Australian [[NRL]]). If the interchanges are used up and a player becomes injured and cannot continue, the team simply has to play [[short handed]]. All players must attack and defend and there is no equivalent of special teams.

Prior to the 1960s, and in [[arena football]] (an indoor variant of the American game) from 1988 to 2007, American football did use a [[one-platoon system]] in which most players were required to play all facets of the game, severely limiting substitution, much as rugby league (and most other sports) continue to do. Most levels of American football abolished the one-platoon system in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although college football re-implemented it for a short time in the 1950s and 1960s.

Broadly speaking, offensive and defensive linemen in American football correspond to [[Rugby league positions#Forwards|forwards]] in rugby league and other players are somewhat similar to [[Rugby league positions#Backs|backs]]. Basically the job of the forwards in rugby league is to get the ball over the advantage line and give the backs space and a chance to be creative and move the ball around, which will hopefully result in points. However, rugby league players are far less specialised than American football players.

Many of the positions have similar names but in practice are very different. A fullback in American football is very different from a fullback in rugby league. However, some of the positions are fairly similar: for instance, the [[Rugby league positions#Stand-off|stand-off/five-eighth]] and [[Rugby league positions#Scrum half|halfback]] carry out a similar role to a [[quarterback]] in American football.

==Advancing the ball==
In American football, the team that's in possession of the ball (the offense) has four "[[Down (football)|downs]]", to advance the ball 10 yards towards the end zone. When the offense gains 10 yards, it gets another set of four downs. If the offense fails to gain 10 yards after 4 downs, it loses possession of the ball.

A down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:
* The player with the ball is tackled.
* A [[forward pass]] goes out of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an [[incomplete pass]]. The ball is returned to the original "[[line of scrimmage]]" for the next down.
* The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds.
* The player either goes or is forced out of the field (out of bounds)
* The offense turns the ball over to the defense.
* A team scores.

This closely resembles the six-tackle rule in rugby league. The team in possession has a "[[Playing rugby league#Six tackle rule|set of six]]" tackles before having to hand over possession. A key difference is that there is no automatic way of earning a new set of tackles in rugby league. Each set is effectively a chance to score, with failure to do so resulting in relinquishing possession. Another major difference is that play stops briefly when the player in possession of the ball is tackled and resumes once he gets to his feet and returns the ball to play.

Players can advance the ball in two ways in American football:
* By running with the ball, also known as [[Rush (football)|rushing]]. One ball-carrier can hand the ball to another; this is known as a '''handoff'''.
* By [[forward pass|passing the ball forwards]] to a teammate. This can only be performed once on a down, and cannot be attempted after the ball crosses the line of scrimmage. The illegal forward pass rule has changed several times, with the current NFL rule being that the passer's entire person must be beyond the line of scrimmage for a forward pass to be illegal. The passer (most often the [[quarterback]] but not always so) can therefore straddle the line of scrimmage, or even be mostly beyond it, but still legally pass the ball, regardless of where the ball is in relation to the line of scrimmage.

In rugby league the ball cannot be passed forward, so players can advance the ball by either running with it, or kicking it ahead and chasing it. This concept is preserved in American football; any player may pass the ball backwards, regardless of player position and location of the field. In addition, a ball passed backwards remains live, even if not caught, so long as it remains in play, similar to rugby league.

Following a down, the ball is returned to play within a restricted time limit by a "[[Snap (American football)|snap]]" in American Football. All players line up facing each other at the line of scrimmage. One offensive player, the [[Center (football)|center]], then passes (or "snaps") the ball back between his legs to a teammate, usually the [[quarterback]] and play commences.

In rugby league the ball is returned to play following a tackle via the "play the ball", in which the tackled player gets back to his feet and rolls the ball back to a teammate, usually the [[Rugby league positions#Hooker|hooker]]. The tackled player will usually try to return to the ball to play as quickly as possible before the defensive line can re-form.

Possession may change in different ways in both games:-

# An automatic handover takes place when the team in possession runs out of downs / tackles.
# When the ball is kicked to the opposing team. This can be done at any time but it is normal to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on the last down / tackle.
# Following an unsuccessful kick at goal.
# When an opposing player [[Interception|intercepts]] a pass.
# In rugby league the opposition are awarded a [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] if the player in possession drops the ball forwards or makes the ball go forwards with any part of his body other than his feet. This is called a ''knock-on''.
# When the player in possession drops the ball and it is recovered by an opposition player. This is called a [[fumble]] in American football and a knock-on in rugby league.
# In rugby league if the ball goes out of play, the opposition are awarded a scrum the "loose head and feed" of the scrum. Penalties and 40/20 kicks are exceptions to this rule.
# In American football possession changes hands following a successful score and the team scoring kicks off to the opposition. In contrast, in rugby league the team who conceded the points must kick off to the team who scored.  (In some amateur levels of American football, and in Canadian football, the team who conceded the points has the option of kicking off to the opposition rather than receiving the kickoff, but this option is extremely rarely invoked.)
# In American football, on a kickoff following a score the kicking team may try an [[onside kick]] to attempt to retain possession for themselves. The kicker either dribbles the ball forward or, more popularly, drives the ball into the ground in an attempt to make it bounce high into the air for a teammate to catch.  The ball must travel 10 yards before it is touched by the kicking team, or be first touched by the receiving team.  A similar tactic is used in rugby league, called a short kickoff. A high cross-field kick towards jumping receivers is popular. The kick must travel at least 10 metres forward before being caught. In both codes the tactic is most often attempted by a team that is behind late in a game, but may be tried at other times as a surprise tactic.

In both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play. However, kicking in general play is more common in rugby league. Kicking is far more heavily restricted in American football; the rules currently prohibit a player from kicking the ball after he has crossed the line of scrimmage, whereas a rugby league player can kick the ball at any time, from any point on the field. In rugby league, a player can receive a kick (and still maintain possession) if he is behind the kicker at the time of the kick; that feature is not allowed in the American game, except in the onside kick scenario described above.

==Passing==
In American football, the offense can throw the ball forward once on a play from behind the line of scrimmage. The [[forward pass]] is a distinguishing feature of American and Canadian football as it is strictly forbidden in rugby league.

The ball can be thrown sideways or backwards without restriction in both games. In American football this is known as a [[Lateral pass|lateral]] and is much less common than in rugby league. The lateral is most commonly seen on plays at the very end of the game when a team needing a touchdown with only time on the clock for one more play attempts to avoid being tackled by passing to any teammate behind him that may advance the ball. A common trick play called the [[hook and ladder play|hook and ladder]] combines the two - a short forward pass is thrown, with the player catching the pass immediately throwing a lateral to a trailing teammate who is hopefully unnoticed by defensive players. Laterals are also seen in ''pitch'' or ''pitchout'' plays, where the quarterback tosses the ball to a back behind him, rather than handing it off.

There is also a minor distinction in what constitutes a forward or backward pass in the two sports. In rugby league (as in rugby union), a pass is considered forward (and thus illegal) if the person catching the ball is ahead of the player throwing it. In American football, a pass is considered forward only if the path of the ball itself has a forward component to it. For instance, the [[Music City Miracle]] (a play in which the receiving end of a lateral pass was ahead of the person throwing it, but the path was not forward) was a legal lateral in American football but would have been an illegal forward pass had it been attempted in rugby.

In both codes, if the ball is caught by an opposition player this results in an [[interception]] and possession changes hands.

}}In both games it is permitted to bring down the player in possession of the ball and prevent them making forward progress. Play then restarts from the next down or tackle. In rugby league, it is common for the player in possession to 'off-load' the ball, passing out of the tackle (before forward progress is halted) in order not to use up a tackle and to keep the play alive. This is much less common in American football, where the [[lateral pass]] is most commonly used as a desperation strategy when trailing near the end of a game.

In American football, players are allowed to '[[blocking (American football)|block]]' players without the ball, within certain restrictions. This is not permitted in rugby league and would be considered 'obstruction'. Players not in possession of the ball may not interfere with each other.

==Scoring==
A [[touchdown]] is the American football equivalent of rugby league's [[try]]. Despite the names, a try requires the ball to be 'touched down' to the ground, whereas a touchdown doesn't. In American football it is sufficient for the player carrying the ball to cause the ball to enter the [[end zone]] (in-goal area) while still in bounds, by carrying it in or holding the ball in or through the imaginary plane of the goal line. In rugby league the ball must be pressed to the ground in the in-goal area. An American football touchdown scores 6 points and a rugby league try is worth 4 points.

In both games, following a try / touchdown, there is the opportunity to score additional points by kicking the ball between the posts and over the bar. In American football this is called an [[extra point]] or a "point after touchdown" (PAT) in the NFL (worth 1 point), in rugby league it is known as a [[Try#Conversion|conversion]] (worth 2 points). There are two key differences between an extra point and a conversion, conversions cannot be charged down like an extra point attempt but they must be taken from the same position as the try was scored. Hence it is important to score under the posts rather than in the corner, which makes for a difficult kick. Rugby league has no equivalent to American football's [[two-point conversion]], in which the scoring team chooses not to kick at goal, but attempt a second touchdown from short range.

In American football teams often opt to go for a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown. The rugby league equivalent, also called a field goal, is worth only one point and is much less common. The key difference between a field goal in the two sports is that an American football field goal attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby league the field goal is attempted using a [[drop-kick]].

A similar concept in rugby league is the [[Penalty (rugby)|penalty goal]]. Following the award of the penalty, the attacking team may opt to kick for goal rather than advance the ball by hand or punting. This scores 2 points in league. The penalty goal is similar to a field goal in American football in that the ball is kicked from the ground and may be held by a teammate (although almost never is), but it cannot be charged down. The nearest equivalent in American football is the rarely used [[fair catch kick]].

American football has one further method of scoring which does not exist in rugby league. If a ball carrier is tackled in their own endzone (in-goal area) with the ball or steps out the back of the end zone with the ball, this results in a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]] which scores 2 points for the opposing team. In rugby league this does not result in any points but causes the team in possession to kick the ball back to the opposition from under the posts.

==Cross Code Matches==
At least one cross-code match between American football and rugby league has been played. On August 1, 2009 the [[Jacksonville Axemen]] of the [[AMNRL]] played the [[Jacksonville Knights]] of the [[Florida Football Alliance]]. The first half was played under American football rules, the second half was played under rugby league rules. The score at half-time was Jacksonville Axemen 6 - Jacksonville Knights 27. The final score was Jacksonville Axemen 38 - Jacksonville Knights 27.

The typical duration of a vinyl album is about 15 to 25 minutes per side. Classical music and spoken word recordings can extend to over 30 minutes on a side.  If a side exceeds the average time, the maximum groove amplitude is reduced to make room for the additional program material.  This can cause hiss in the sound from lower quality amplifiers when the volume is turned up to compensate for the lower recorded level.  An extreme example, [[Todd Rundgren]]'s  ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' LP, with 36 minutes of music on one side, has a "technical note" at the bottom of the inner sleeve: "if the sound does not seem loud enough on your system, try re-recording the music onto tape." The total of around 40&amp;ndash;45 minutes often influences the arrangement of tracks, with the preferred positions being the opening and closing tracks of each side.

Although the term [[extended play|EP]] is commonly used to describe a 7" single with more than two tracks, technically they are not different from a normal 7" single. The EP uses reduced dynamic range and a smaller run-off groove area to extend the playing time. However, there are examples of singles, such as [[The Beatles]]' "[[Hey Jude]]" or [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", which are six minutes long or more. (in 1989, RCA released 'Dreamtime' by the band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]], which clocks at 8:40). These longer recordings would require the same technical approach as an EP. The term EP has also been used for 10" 45 rpm records, typically containing a reduced number of tracks.

Vinyl albums have a large 12" (30 cm) [[album cover]], which also allows cover designers scope for imaginative designs, often including fold-outs and leaflets.

'''Coventry Transport Museum''' (formerly known as the '''Museum of British Road Transport''') is a motor [[museum]], located in [[Coventry]] city centre, England. It houses a collection of British-made [[road transport]]. It is located in Coventry because the city was previously the centre of the British car industry. There are more than 240 [[Automobile|cars]] and commercial vehicles, 100 [[motorcycle]]s, 200 [[bicycle]]s.

Admission to the museum is free. It has a full-time archive department, which deals with an array of historical items, and offers a public enquiry service answering questions and finding items and information.

In March 2014 it was announced that a £8.5&amp;nbsp;million redevelopment would begin on 31 March 2014 and include the restoration of the nearby [[Old Grammar School, Coventry|Old Grammar School]] to be used as an exhibit, education and event space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-26665112|title=Coventry Transport Museum unveils £8.5m revamp|date=20 March 2014|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Exhibits ==

Notable exhibits in the museum are [[Thrust2]] and [[ThrustSSC]], the British jet cars which broke the [[land speed record]] in 1983 and 1997, respectively, and some of the Royal cars - Queen Mary's and King George V's State limousines.

As part of the Museum's redevelopment project, both Thrust SSC and Thrust 2 cars were relocated by specialist haulier from their position in the Museum's Spirit of Speed Gallery to the new Biffa Award Land Speed Record Gallery which opened in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collett.co.uk/index.php/about-us/latest-news/125-record-breaking-transport-for-collett |title=Thruse SSC takes to the road|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1983">'''''De Valence v Langley Fox Building Partnership (Pty) Ltd''''' is an important case in South African law, heard by the Witwatersrand Local Division. On 13 August 1982, the respondent, Mrs Patricia Poupinel de Valence, was a successful audiometrician. She conducted a private practice in partnership with a Mr Carter. On that day she was walking on a sidewalk outside Hunt's Corner, a building situate in the central business district of Johannesburg. A wooden beam had been suspended between two trestles at right-angles across the sidewalk. The respondent struck the left side of her forehead against the beam. At first the injury caused thereby was thought to have been minor. However, it had the most serious and unfortunate consequences for the respondent.

Van Schalkwyk J held that the appellant, Langley Fox Building Partnership (Pty) Ltd, was negligent in relation to the erection of the wooden beam and he ordered it to pay damages to the respondent in the amount of R181 408,45 and the costs of suit.

The appellant appealed to the Appellate Division, in ''[[Langley Fox Building Partnership v De Valence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1991 (1) SA 1 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; against the finding that it was liable to compensate the respondent for any loss sustained by her. In turn, the respondent cross-appealed, claiming that she should have been awarded damages in the amount of R593 070. Goldstone AJA found on the appeal, "in all the circumstances," that "the learned trial Judge correctly held the appellant liable to compensate the respondent for the damages sustained by her."&lt;ref&gt;14G-H.&lt;/ref&gt; The cross-appeal was also upheld.&lt;ref&gt;16B.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="946">A '''drop registrar''' is a [[domain name registrar]] who registers expiring Internet [[domain names]] immediately after they expire and are deleted by the [[domain name registry]].  A drop registrar will typically use automated software to send up to 250 simultaneous domain name registration requests in an attempt to register the domain name first. In recognition of the potential abuse of such a "domain [[land rush]]", [[ICANN]] and [[VeriSign]] limited the number of  simultaneous requests to 250 since July 17, 2001.&lt;ref name=ICANNadvisory&gt;ICANN [http://www.icann.org/announcements/icann-pr16jul01.htm Advisory], July 16, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  

Drop registrars usually work for a [[domain back-order]] service, and receive a percentage of the final auction price.

'''''Eustace''''' is an historic narrow boat built for the [[Wolverhampton]]-based company  [[Albert Baldwin Bantock|Thomas Bantock &amp; Co.]] for railway transhipment work in the English [[Black Country]]. In the 1950s a cabin was added and Alfred Matty &amp; Co of Deepfields, Coseley converted the hull to a spoon dredger for canal clearance work. Following a fire it was cut up but the fore end of the boat is now owned by the [[Black Country Living Museum]] where it can be seen on the path at the rear of the boat dock. The boat is a rare survivor of a type of construction unique to Thomas Bantock &amp; Co. {{as of|March 2013}} it was shortly due to be restored.

'''Frank Caplan''' (June 10, 1911 – September 28, 1988) was a youth worker, educator, folk [[toy]] collector, and pioneer in developing and manufacturing [[educational toys]] for children. He co-founded [[Creative Playthings]] in 1945 with his wife [[Theresa Caplan|Theresa]], and worked with artists, architects, and designers, such as [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Henry Moore]], Robert Winston, and the Swiss toymaker, [[Antonio Vitali]], to create innovative educational play objects and [[playground]] designs for children.&lt;ref name=Ogata&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ogata|first=Amy F.|title=Creative Playthings: Educational Toys and Postwar American Culture|journal=[[Winterthur Portfolio]]|date=Summer–Autumn 2004|volume=39|issue=2/3|pages=129–156|doi=10.1086/433197}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, Creative Playthings had gained international recognition and expanded to become one of the most important manufacturers and suppliers of materials for [[early childhood education]].&lt;ref name=Oakland&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Oakland Public Library]]|title=Creative Playthings Puppet Family|url=http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/aamlo/collection/puppets.htm |date=March 31, 2008 |accessdate=1 July 2011| archiveurl=http://archive.li/8E2hK| archivedate=23 October 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Frank Caplan founded The Princeton Center for Infancy and Early Childhood. He researched and co-authored a national bestselling series on early childhood development with Theresa Caplan, which included, ''The First Twelve Months of Life'' (1977), ''The Second Twelve Months of Life'' (1978), and ''The Early Childhood Years: The 2 to 6 Year Old'' (1983). Together they also co-authored ''The Power of Play'' (1973). He was one of the first male nursery school teachers in the U.S. and together with Theresa Caplan collected over 50,000 American and international folk toys, folk art, and contemporary playthings, which in 1984 the couple donated to [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] for a permanent gallery on folk, fantasy, and play.&lt;ref name=Oakland/&gt;

==Education and youth work==
Frank Caplan was born in [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[England]], on June 10, 1911, to [[Russian Jew]]ish parents.&lt;ref name=Caplan&gt;{{cite book|last=Caplan|first=Theresa &amp; Frank|title=Frank Caplan: Champion of Child’s Play|year=1999|publisher=Vantage Press|location=New York|isbn= 0-533-12955-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1914, his family immigrated to the [[United States]] and settled in [[Harlem, New York]]. He graduated from [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] in 1927 and began attending [[City College of New York]] at night. After graduating in 1931 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[sociology]] and history, he took a job as the director of the Block Recreation Project, working with street gangs to create club centers for leadership training. His interest in toys began when working as one of the first male nursery school teachers in the U.S. under Caroline Pratt, founder and director of [[City and Country School]] in [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]]. Later, he worked at the Jewish Center in [[Far Rockaway]], Long Island (along with his future wife, Theresa Caplan, and artist, [[Mark Rothko]]), where he made puppets and simple playthings for children. In 1934, he set up a cooperative farm-camp for city children.&lt;ref name=Caplan/&gt;

On May 30, 1934, Frank Caplan married Theresa Caplan (b. Kupferberg, June 6, 1913 – April 13, 2010). In 1936, he received his [[master's degree]] in the Philosophy of Education from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] and began work as Senior Project Supervisor of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) [[National Youth Administration|Youth Service Division]] of the [[New York City Board of Education]], a novel experiment to develop education programs for 16- to 25-year-olds living in economically distressed areas of New York City.&lt;ref name=Caplan/&gt;

{{Main|Creative Playthings}}

==Research and publications==
In 1975, Frank and Theresa Caplan co-founded The Princeton Center for Infancy and Early Childhood, a pioneering organization that researched and prepared books and pamphlets for parents and professionals. The center authored ''The Parenting Advisor'' (1977), ''Parents’ Yellow Pages'' (1978), and ''Growing Up Years: Your Child’s Record Keeping Book'' (1978).  Frank and Theresa co-authored ''The Power of Play'' (1973), ''The First Twelve Months of Life'' (1977), ''The Second Twelve Months of Life'' (1978), and ''The Early Childhood Years: The 2 to 6 Year Old'' (1983), which covered the mental, physical, language and social development of [[early childhood]] with advice for parents and answers to common concerns. The series was praised for embracing both mothers and fathers as well as supporting diverse family types.

==Folk toy collecting==
In the 1950s, Frank and Theresa Caplan began collecting folk toys on their numerous international travels. Their casual collecting grew into more formal collecting of folk toys from around the world in the hopes of establishing a Museum of Fantasy and Play. In 1984 they donated their collection of over 50,000 folk toys, folk art, and contemporary playthings to [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]. The collection, now known as the [[Caplan Collection]], was first used in the exhibit "Passport to the World."&lt;ref name=McGovern&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGovern|first=Justine|title=Folk Fantasy and Play: Selections from the Caplan Collection of The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis|journal=[[The Journal of American Folklore]]|date=Summer 1993|volume=106|issue=421|pages=370–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Caplan died on September 28, 1988. Theresa Caplan died on April 13, 2010, survived by their daughter, [[Judith Inglese]], and son, Richard Caplan.&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Frank Caplan, 77, Toy Developer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/30/obituaries/frank-caplan-77-toy-developer.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 20, 2018|date=September 30, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final volume, McMillan discussed Fredric Brown material that was still uncollected, with particular reference to a column that Brown wrote from 1937 to 1946 called ''The Proofreader's Page'', mentioning that these would "take a book in themselves". Twenty years later that book was published, including both the columns and a selection of other uncollected fiction, poetry and non-fiction as:

[[Image:La galerie de géologie du jardin des plantes à Paris.jpg|thumb|250 px|Left-side [[pediment]] and [[peristyle]] in the façade of the ''galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie'', constructed between 1833 and 1837 following plans of architect [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]] (1801-1875).]]
The '''Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology''' (in [[French language|French]], ''galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie'') is a part of the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|French National Museum of Natural History]] (''Muséum national d'histoire naturelle'', MNHN). It is situated in the ''[[Jardin des plantes]]'' ('Garden of the Plants') in [[Paris]] near the ''[[gare d'Austerlitz]]'' train station. The gallery displays a collection of [[crystals]], [[gemstone]]s and [[minerals]] ''parmi les plus anciennes et les plus prestigieuses du monde'' ('among the oldest and the most prestigious in the world').

== History ==
The collection is older than the building. It began in 1625, when [[minerals]] with medicinal properties were deposited in ''le droguier du roi'' ('the royal drug cabinet'). Thereafter, the ''droguier'' and its minerals were moved to the ''Jardin royal des plantes médicinales'' ('Royal Garden of the Medicinal Plants'), founded in 1635 under the rule of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. The ''Jardin royal des plantes médicinales'', as a location, corresponds in the present day to the still existing ''[[Jardin des Plantes|Jardin des plantes]]'', but as an institution it nowadays corresponds to the French National Museum of Natural History. In 1635, when the Royal Garden was being founded, the mineral collections and the royal drug cabinet were transported to a ''[[château]]'' situated in the same property as the garden itself. In the same year, the so-mentioned château was also destined to receive the ''cabinet du roi'' (the '[[Cabinet of curiosities|Royal Cabinet of Curiosities]]'). Later, during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the mineralogical collection of the ''cabinet du roi'' was enriched on the orders of the king and put on public display as of 1745.

Years later the [[French Revolution]] broke out, spanning from 1789 to 1799. During the period, on June 1793, the revolutionaries who were ruling France transformed the ''Jardin royal des plantes médicinales'' into the still existing ''[[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]]'', but at this point in time the mineralogical and geological samples remained in the old ''cabinet du roi''. After the French Revolution and after the reign of [[Napoleon]], monarchy in France was back and ruled the country again. It was not until the reign of [[Louis Philippe I]] that a new building was planned in order to receive the mineralogy collections. Construction works started in 1833 and the new building was inaugurated in 1837 in the presence of the king. This building, designed by architect [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]] and still currently in use to show to the public the mineralogical collections, was the first in France to be designed as a museum. The building is partitioned, contiguously, into three different parts: a central nave originally destined to receive the mineralogy and geology collections, and two wings, one on the right-hand side of the central nave, the other on the left-hand side. The right-hand wing was originally intended to receive the ''Muséum''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s main library, as still stated in the right-side [[pediment]] of the building, where the word ''Bibliothèque'' ('Libray') still can be read. The left-side wing of the building was originally destined to receive the ''Muséum''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[herbarium]], but a new nearby building, the ''galerie de Botanique'' ('Gallery of Botany'), was inaugurated in 1935 with the purpose of preservation of all ''Muséum''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s vegetal samples, so the herbarium left its old allocated location and was sent to the new one, where it is still preserved.

In the late months of 1959, the old ''cabinet du roi'' was demolished in order to build on its footprint the current central library of the ''Muséum''. As a consequence, during the 1960s, the rooms in the former library, situated in the Gallery's right wing, were destined to receive a chosen set of mineral samples. This area in the building, the former library, is still nowadays the current main exhibition space in the ''galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie''.

In 1972, as per the ''Muséum''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s herbarium had left the Gallery's left-wing since 1935, French paleontologist Jean-Pierre Lehman opened a ''galerie de Paléobotanique'' ('Gallery of [[Paleobotany]]') in this area of the building. The ''Muséum''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s paleobotanical collections were on exhibit at this new paleobotanical gallery until 1998, when it was definitely closed to the public. The Gallery of Paleobotany was permanently dismantled in 2005, although a few of its fossil plants are currently on exhibition at the [[galerie de Paléontologie et d'Anatomie comparée]] and at one of the greenhouses of the ''Muséum''.

In 1982 the ''Muséum'' bought a collection of Brazilian giant crystals known as the Ilia Deleff collection. Born in 1921, Ilia Deleff, who had sold the collection to the French ''Muséum'', is a Bulgarian physician and geologist who started collecting these unique giant crystals in the late 1950s. The Ilia Deleff collection of giant crystals is on exhibit at the ''galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie'' since 1983.

Closed in 2004 for renovation, the ''galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie'' reopened ten years later, in 2014, showing a completely new kind of path tour for its new permanent exhibition called ''Les Trésors de la Terre'' ('Treasures of the Earth'). It is much more [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]], focusing on [[crystallography]] and the [[Classification of minerals (disambiguation)|classification of minerals]]. This permanent exhibition currently shows approximately 600 mineralogical specimens,

{{italic title}}
{{no footnotes|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|300px|right| ''Gesta Danorum'' ([[Angers Fragment]]), page 1, front.]]
'''''Gesta Danorum''''' ("Deeds of the Danes") is a patriotic work of [[Denmark|Danish]] history, by the 13th century author [[Saxo Grammaticus]] ("Saxo the Literate", literally "the Grammarian"). It is the most ambitious literary undertaking of [[medieval]] Denmark and is an essential source for the nation's early history. It is also one of the oldest known written documents about the [[history of Estonia]] and [[History of Latvia|Latvia]].

Consisting of sixteen books written in [[Latin]] on the invitation of [[Archbishop]] [[Absalon]], ''Gesta Danorum'' describes Danish history and to some degree [[Scandinavia]]n history in general, from prehistory to the late 12th century. In addition, ''Gesta Danorum'' offers singular reflections on European affairs in the [[High Middle Ages]] from a unique Scandinavian perspective, supplementing what has been handed down by historians from [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Southern Europe]].

== Books ==
The sixteen books, in prose with an occasional excursion into poetry, can be categorized into two parts: Books 1-9, which deal with [[Norse mythology]], and Books 10-16, which deal with medieval history. Book 9 ends with [[Gorm the Old]], the first factual documented [[King of Denmark]]. The last three books (14-16), which describe Danish conquests on the south shore of the Baltic Sea and wars against [[Slavic peoples]] (the [[Northern Crusades]]), are very valuable for the history of West Slavic tribes ([[Polabian Slavs]], [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]]) and [[Slavic mythology|Slavic paganism]]. Book 14 contains a unique description of the temple on the island of [[Rügen]].

=== Chronology ===
When exactly ''Gesta Danorum'' was written is the subject of numerous works; however, it is generally agreed that ''Gesta Danorum'' was not finished before 1208. The last event described in the last book (Book 16) is King [[Canute VI]] of Denmark subduing [[Pomerania]] under Duke [[Bogislaw I]], in 1186. However the preface of the work, dictated to Archbishop [[Anders Sunesen]], mentions the Danish conquest of the areas north of the [[Elbe]] in 1208.

Book 14, comprising nearly one-quarter of the text of the entire work, ends with [[Absalon]]'s appointment to archbishop in 1178. Since this book is so large and ''Absalon'' has greater importance than King [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]], this book may have been written first and comprised a work on its own. It is possible that Saxo then enlarged it with Books 15 and 16, telling the story of King Valdemar I's last years and King Canute VI's first years.

It is believed that Saxo then wrote Books 11, 12, and 13. [[Svend Aagesen]]'s history of Denmark, ''[[Brevis Historia Regum Dacie]]'' (circa 1186), states that Saxo had decided to write about "The king-father and his sons," which would be King [[Sweyn Estridson]], in Books 11, 12, and 13. He would later add the first ten books. This would also explain the 22 years between the last event described in the last book (Book 16) and the 1208 event described in the preface.

=== Manuscripts ===
The original manuscripts of the work are lost, except for four fragments: the [[Angers Fragment]], [[Lassen Fragment]], [[Kall-Rasmussen Fragment]] and [[Plesner Fragment]]. The Angers Fragment is the biggest fragment, and the only one attested to be in [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]’s own handwriting. The other ones are copies from ca. 1275. All four fragments are in the collection of the [[Danish Royal Library]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.

The text has, however, survived. In 1510–1512, [[Christiern Pedersen]], a Danish translator working in Paris, searched Denmark high and low for an existing copy of Saxo’s works, which by that time was nearly all but lost. By that time most knowledge of Saxo’s work came from a summary located in ''[[Chronica Jutensis]]'', from around 1342, called ''[[Compendium Saxonis]]''. It is also in this summary that the name ''Gesta Danorum'' is found. The title Saxo himself used for his work is unknown.

Christiern Pedersen finally found a copy in the collection of Archbishop [[Birger Gunnersen]] of [[Lund]], Skåne (Skåne is now part of [[Sweden]], but at the time was still part of Denmark), which he gladly lent him. With the help of printer [[Jodocus Badius]], ''Gesta Danorum'' was refined and printed.

=== Printing ===
[[File:Saxo Chr P front version 001.jpg|thumb|right|Front page of [[Christiern Pedersen]]'s Saxo version, [[Paris]] 1514.]]
The first printed press publication and the oldest known complete text of Saxo’s works is Christiern Pedersen's Latin edition, printed and published by Jodocus Badius in Paris, France on 15 March 1514 under the title of ''Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae'' ("History of the Kings and heroes of the Danes"). The edition features the following [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]: ...''impressit in inclyta Parrhisorum academia Iodocus Badius Ascensius Idibus Martiis. MDXIIII. Supputatione Romana.'' (the [[Ides of March]], 1514).

The full front page reads (with abbreviations expanded) in Latin:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae stilo eleganti a Saxone Grammatico natione Zialandico necnon Roskildensis ecclesiae praeposito, abhinc supra trecentos annos conscriptae et nunc primum literaria serie illustratae tersissimeque impressae.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Danish language]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''De danske Kongers og Heltes Historie, skrevet i pyntelig Stil for over 300 Aar siden af Saxo Grammaticus, en Sjællandsfar og Provst ved Kirken i Roskilde, og nu for første Gang oplyst ved et Register og omhyggeligt trykt''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

English language:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Histories of the Kings and heroes of the Danes, composed in elegant style by Saxo Grammaticus, a [[Zealand]]er and also provost of the church of [[Roskilde]], over three hundred years ago, and now for the first time illustrated and printed correctly in a learned compilation.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Gesta Danorum'' is also translated partially in other English, [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] releases.

== Hamlet ==
{{Main|Sources of Hamlet}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
Certain aspects of ''Gesta Danorum'' formed the basis for [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]''. It is thought that Shakespeare never read ''Gesta Danorum'', and instead had access to an [[Ur-Hamlet|auxiliary version of the tale]] describing the downfall of the Prince of Denmark, whose real name, [[Amleth]], was used in [[anagram]] by Shakespeare for Hamlet.

Saxo’s version, told of in Books 3 and 4, is very similar to that of Shakespeare’s ''Hamlet''. In Saxo's version, two brothers, [[Horwendill|Orvendil]] and [[Feng (Claudius)|Fengi]] are given the rule over [[Jutland]] by King [[Hrærekr slöngvanbaugi|Rørik Slyngebond]] of the Danes.  Soon after, Orvendil marries King Rørik’s daughter, Geruth (Gertrude in ''Hamlet''). Amleth is their first and only child.

Fengi becomes resentful of his brother’s marriage, and also wants sole leadership of Jutland, so therefore murders Orvendil. After a very brief period of mourning, Fengi marries Geruth, and declares himself sole leader of Jutland. Eventually, Amleth avenges his father’s murder and plans the murder of his uncle, making him the new and rightful King of Jutland. However, while Hamlet dies in Shakespeare's version just after his uncle's death, in Saxo's version Amleth survives and begins ruling his kingdom, going on to other adventures.

{{nihongo|'''''Guardians of the Louvre'''''|千年の翼、百年の夢|Sennen no Tsubasa, Hyakunen no Yume|{{lit.}} "A Thousand Years' Wings, A Hundred Years' Dream"; {{lang-fr|Les Gardiens du Louvre}}|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[seinen manga]] written and illustrated by [[Jiro Taniguchi]]. The manga revolves around an artist visiting the [[Louvre]] for five days and learning about artists whose works are there and figures who were part of its history. Commissioned by the Louvre, Taniguchi worked on the manga after spending a month in the museum in May 2013. The manga was serialized in [[Shogakukan]]'s manga magazine ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' in late 2014 and collected into a [[tankōbon]] published on February 20, 2015. The Louvre and Futuropolis published the manga in France on November 21, 2014. The manga was licensed in North America by [[NBM Publishing]], which published the manga on May 13, 2016.

== Plot ==
After a comics festival in [[Barcelona]], a Japanese artist visits Paris, but falls sick. After feeling a little better, he visits the [[Louvre]]. When he feels dizzy, he is transported to what is described as the "space-time of [his] reveries" by a guardian of the Louvre. The guardians are the souls of each piece of art, with the guardian he meets being of the ''[[Winged Victory of Samothrace]]''. On his second day at the Louvre, he looks at the paintings of [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]. While looking at ''[[Recollection of Mortefontaine]]'', he meets [[Asai Chū]], who had worked on introducing Western-style art to Japan. He is then transported to an art gallery in [[Ueno]] which is exhibiting Chū's works posthumously and hears the writer [[Natsume Sōseki]] speaking of Chū's work. Transported into another Corot drawing, he meets Chū again and they glance upon Corot working on that drawing. On Sunday, the man travels to [[Auvers-sur-Oise]], the final resting place of [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Going behind [[The Church at Auvers|the church of Auvers]], he meets van Gogh, who lets him visit his apartment and see his paintings. Back in the present, he visits [[Charles-François Daubigny]]'s house and finally, van Gogh's grave. A few days later, on a Tuesday when the Louvre is closed, he is transported to Paris in 1939 during the [[Evacuation of the Louvre museum art collection during World War II|evacuation of the museum at the start of World War II]]. The man learns about the difficult process, which was led by [[Jacques Jaujard]], including the transport of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', and the ''Winged Victory of Samothrace''. On his final day in Paris, the man visits the tomb of [[Philippe Pot]], and reunites with his own dead wife Keiko.

== Reception ==
Response to the manga has been mixed, with praise going towards its art and mood, but the plot being criticized. Hans Rollman of ''[[PopMatters]]'' said that ''Guardians of the Louvre'' "demonstrates that contemporary manga artists can hold their own against the greatest in the pantheon of western art", commending its artwork and atmosphere, while describing the plot as minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rollman|first1=Hans|title=European Fine Art Meets Japanese Manga in 'Guardians of the Louvre'|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/guardians-of-the-louvre-by-jiro-taniguchi/|website=PopMatters|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the manga "coolly and resplendently drawn, if rather indifferently written".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guardians of the Louvre|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-68112-034-8|website=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katherine Dacey of MangaBlog was critical of the manga's "[[middlebrow]] sensibility" and attempt to dictate how art should be appreciated, but commended its sensual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dacey|first1=Katherine|title=The Manga Revue: Guardians of the Louvre|url=http://mangablog.mangabookshelf.com/2016/05/20/the-manga-revue-guardians-of-the-louvre/|website=MangaBlog|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer Hayes of ''[[Booklist]]'' liked the use of color in the manga to "heighten emotion, create distance, and echo artistic styles", concluding that while the story has seams, the manga is a "voyeuristic trip" showing the relationship between art and life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Summer|title=Guardians of the Louvre|url=http://staging.booklistonline.com/ProductInfo.aspx?pid=8178963|website=Booklist|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:hansard-1832.jpg|right|thumb|''Hansard'' title page from 1832]]
'''''Hansard''''' is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary Debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after [[Thomas Curson Hansard]] (1776–1833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the parliament at Westminster.

==Origins==
Though the history of the ''Hansard'' began in the British parliament, each of Britain's colonies developed a separate and distinctive history. Before 1771, the British Parliament had long been a highly secretive body. The official record of the actions of the House was publicly available, but there was no record of the debates. The publication of remarks made in the House became a breach of Parliamentary privilege, punishable by the two Houses of Parliament. As the populace became interested in parliamentary debates, more independent newspapers began publishing unofficial accounts of them.

The many penalties implemented by the government, including fines, dismissal, imprisonment, and investigations, are reflective of "the difficulties faced by independent newspapermen who took an interest in the development of Upper Canada, and who, in varying degrees, attempted to educate the populace to the shortcomings of their rulers".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

Several editors used the device of veiling parliamentary debates as debates of fictitious societies or bodies. The names under which parliamentary debates were published include ''Proceedings of the Lower Room of the Robin Hood Society'' and ''Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia''.&lt;ref name="C-H"&gt;[http://www.commonwealth-hansard.org/chea_story.asp Story of Hansard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223040314/http://www.commonwealth-hansard.org/chea_story.asp |date=2011-02-23 }} — Commonwealth Hansard Editors Association&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate of Magna Lilliputia was printed in [[Edward Cave]]'s ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', which was first published in 1732. The names of the speakers were carefully "[[Fillet (redaction)|filleted]]"; for example, Sir [[Robert Walpole]] was thinly disguised as "Sr. R―t W―le".&lt;ref name=Trewin&gt;{{cite book|last=Trewin|first=J.C|title=Printer to the House: The Story of Hansard|year=1952|publisher=The Chapel River Press|location=Andover, Hants, Great Britain|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1771 [[Brass Crosby]], who was [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]], had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of Parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the [[Tower of London]], but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dougsaunders.net/2010/12/brass-crosby-julian-assange-wikileaks/|title=Brass Crosby: The Julian Assange of 1771|author=|date=17 December 2010|website=dougsaunders.net|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318133153/http://dougsaunders.net/2010/12/brass-crosby-julian-assange-wikileaks/|archivedate=18 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of [[John Wilkes]] on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the ''Parliamentary Register'' published by [[John Almon]] and [[John Debrett]] began in 1775 and ran until 1813.

[[William Cobbett]] (1763–1835), a noted radical and publisher, began publishing ''Parliamentary Debates'' as a supplement to his ''[[Political Register]]'' in 1802, eventually extending his reach back with the ''Parliamentary History''. Cobbett's avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On June 5, 1810 [[William Cobbett]] stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by [[Thomas Curson Hansard]]. Cobbett was found "guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence".&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; The court sentence read: "The court do adjudge that you, [[William Cobbett]] pay to our Lord the King a fine of £1000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years—yourself in the sum of £3000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of £1000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid".&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; The sentence was described by J. C. Trewin as "vindictive".&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; The Court argued that [[Thomas Curson Hansard]], who had "seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all"&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the [[King's Bench Prison]].

Cobbett's reports were printed by [[Thomas Curson Hansard]] from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett's finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the ''Parliamentary Debates'' and ''Parliamentary History'', which then "passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; ''Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates'' became ''Hansard Parliamentary Debates'', "abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; From 1829 the name "Hansard" appeared on the title page of each issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansard-westminster.co.uk/story.asp ::: Department of the Official Report (Hansard) – Story of Hansard :::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817171411/http://www.hansard-westminster.co.uk/story.asp |date=2009-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Cobbett nor Hansard ever employed anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers. For this reason, early editions of ''Hansard'' are not to be absolutely relied upon as a guide to everything discussed in Parliament.

Hansard outlasted competitors including Almon and Debrett, and the later ''Mirror of Parliament'' published by J. H. Barrow from 1828 to 1843; Barrow's work was more comprehensive but he checked each speech with the Member and allowed them to "correct" anything they wished they had not said. The last attempt at a commercial rival was ''[[The Times]]'' which published debates in the 1880s. In 1878 a subsidy was granted to the Hansard press and at that point reporters were employed.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; Despite hiring contract reporters there were still widespread complaints about the accuracy of the debate reports. In 1889 Henry Hansard, the son of Thomas Hansard, broke the family connection with the debates.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==

The ''Hansard'' of today, a comprehensive account of every speech, began in 1909 when [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] took over the publication and established its own staff of official ''Hansard'' reporters. At the same time the decision was made to publish debates of the two houses in separate volumes, and to change the front cover from orange-red to light blue. A larger page format was introduced with new technology in 1980.

''Hansard'' is not a word-for-word transcript of debates in Parliament. Its terms of reference are those set by a House of Commons Select Committee in 1893, as being a report

{{quote|which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes (including grammatical mistakes) corrected, but which, on the other hand, leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.&lt;ref name="Hansard terms of reference"&gt;Ian Church, "Official Report [HANSARD] Centenary Volume", 2009, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One instance of such an eliminated redundancy involves the calling of members in the House of Commons. In that House, the Speaker must call on a member by name before that member may speak, but ''Hansard'' makes no mention of the recognition accorded by the Speaker. Also, ''Hansard'' sometimes adds extraneous material to make the remarks less ambiguous. For example, though members refer to each other as "the hon. Member for ''Constituency Name''{{-"}} rather than by name, ''Hansard'' adds, in parentheses, the name of the member being referred to, the first time that Member is referred to in a speech or debate. When a Member simply points at another whose constituency he or she cannot remember, ''Hansard'' identifies him or her.

Any interruption to debate  will be marked with the word "(Interruption)". This understated phrase covers a variety of situations, ranging from members laughing uproariously to the physical invasion of the chamber. Interjections from seated members, such as heckling during [[Prime minister's questions|Prime Minister's Questions]], are generally only included if the member who is speaking responds to the interjection.

''Hansard'' also publishes written answers – known as [[written ministerial statement]]s – made by Government [[Minister (government)|ministers]] in response to questions formally posed by members. In 1839, Hansard, by order of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], printed and published a report stating that an [[obscenity|indecent]] book published by a Mr. Stockdale was circulating in [[Newgate Prison]]. Stockdale sued for [[defamation]] but Hansard's defence, that the statement was true, succeeded. On publication of a reprint, Stockdale sued again but Hansard was ordered by the House to plead that he had acted under order of the Commons and was protected by [[parliamentary privilege]]. In the resulting case of ''[[Stockdale v Hansard]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1839) 9 Ad &amp; El 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;State Trials (New Series) III, 723.&lt;/ref&gt; the court found that the House held no privilege to order publication of defamatory material. In consequence, Parliament passed the [[Parliamentary Papers Act 1840]] to establish privilege for publications under the House's authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bradley, A.W.  |author2=Ewing, K.D. | year=2003 | title=Constitutional and Administrative Law | publisher=Pearson | location=London | edition=13th | pages=219–220 | isbn=0-582-43807-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stockdale, E.

(eds) | title=Luke Graves Hansard's Diary 1814–1841 | year=1962 | location=Oxford | publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1909—and for important votes before then—''Hansard'' has listed how members have voted in [[Division (vote)|divisions]]. Furthermore, the proceedings and debates in committee are also published in separate volumes. For many years the House of Commons ''Hansard'' did not formally acknowledge the existence of parties in the House, except obliquely, with Members' references to other Members of the same party as "hon. Friends", but in 2003 this changed and members' party affiliations are now identified. The ''Hansard'' of the House of Lords operates entirely independently of its Commons counterpart, but with similar terms of reference. It covers parliamentary business in the House of Lords Chamber itself, as well as the debates in the Moses Room, known as Grand Committee. Parliamentary Written Answers and Statements are also printed. Emma Crewe notes that "Editors view reporters in general as a hive of revolution and anti-establishment attitudes, while they perceive themselves as calm and uncomplaining".&lt;ref name="Crewe2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crewe |first=Emma |title=Lords of parliament: manners, rituals and politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VHpIwkpFOCkC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=lords+of+parliament+hansard+revolutionary#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 January 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-7207-9 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet, with the help of volunteers, has made the UK ''Hansard'' more accessible. The UK ''Hansard'' is currently being digitised to a high-level format{{clarify|date=November 2014}} for on-line publication.{{citation needed|date=November 2016|reason=Some citation talking about these voluntary efforts, etc?}} It is possible to review and search the UK ''Hansard'' from 1803, with the exception of Standing Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/|title=House of Commons Hansard archives|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518231458/http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/|archivedate=2014-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/|title=Hansard Online - commencing May 2010|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113141245/https://hansard.parliament.uk/|archivedate=2016-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because ''Hansard'' is treated as accurate, there is a parliamentary convention whereby if a member of parliament makes an inaccurate statement in parliament, he/she must write a correction in the copy of ''Hansard'' kept in the House of Commons library.

==Canada==
[[File:Hansard, Canada, Dominion Parliament (July 17, 1895).jpg|thumb|Sample of ''Hansard'' from the Canadian House of Commons, 1895. Shows sample of several members speaking as described in the text.]]

===House of Commons===
As with the Westminster ''Hansard'', the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding "repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors". Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent ("The member for Halifax West", etc.) or by their cabinet post. ''Hansard'' supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day—"'''Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP''')" or "'''Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC.)'''"—and by name only when they rise later to speak.

If interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as "'''Some hon. members: Oh, oh!'''" The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1|title=Debates (Hansard) No. 159 - November 28, 2005 (38-1) - House of Commons of Canada|author=|date=|website=www2.parl.gc.ca|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309095935/http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=38&amp;Pub=hansard&amp;Ses=1|archivedate=9 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
Given the [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] nature of the Canadian federal government, two equivalent Canadian ''Hansard''s are maintained, one in [[French language|French]] and one in [[English language|English]]. This makes it a natural [[Parallel text alignment|parallel text]], and it is often used to train French–English [[machine translation]] programs. In addition to being already translated and aligned, the size of the ''Hansard''s and the fact that new material is always being added makes it an attractive [[text corpus|corpus]]. However, its usefulness is hindered by the fact that the translations, although accurate in meaning, are not always literally exact.

The Canadian ''Hansard'' records make note of the language used by the members of parliament, so as not to misinterpret the words of the person who has the floor. If the member speaks in French, the English ''Hansard'' records would state that the member spoke in French and refer the reader to the French ''Hansard'' record.

In one instance, during a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[filibuster]] in the [[Senate of Canada]], Senator [[Philippe Gigantès]] was accused of reading one of his books only so that he could get the translation for free through the ''Hansard''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Claire. ''Nice Work: The Continuing Scandal of Canada's Senate'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newfoundland===
In Newfoundland the struggle for the free press was much more violent. Henry Winton, editor of ''Saint John's Ledger'', "had his ears cut off and was left unconscious by thugs who had been lying in wait for him after dark".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; The fate of Winton was to be his printer's as well. 
The Authorities, who were not on friendly terms with the ''Ledger'', made little to no effort to apprehend the culprits.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; In another case, a "Gentleman by the name Parsons", of the ''Newfoundland Patriot'', "was sentenced to three months imprisonment in another incident".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

===Nova Scotia===
As was the case in many early Canadian regions, the newspapers were the first source of the Parliamentary debates. Canada's first newspaper, the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]'', was printed on Grafton street in Halifax in 1752. The two most prominent papers in Parliamentary reporting were the ''[[Acadian Recorder]]'', founded in 1813 by Anthony Henry Holland, and the ''Free Press'', established in 1816 by Edward Ward.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=John|title=The Hansard Chronicles|year=1980|publisher=Deneau and Greenberg Publishers Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=0-88879-023-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both newspapers reported the debates of the House of Assembly starting in 1817.

The [[Family Compact]] of Nova Scotia, nicknamed "the little compact", "viewed the admission of reporters to the Assembly with disdain" and "were not slow to react whenever they felt the slightest affront".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; There are many cases which exemplify the "struggle to obtain freedom of the press and parliamentary reportings in the Maritimes" as in the case of William Minns in 1823, who was forced to appear before the bar of the house, and William Milne, who was jailed for not being able to pay his debts.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

''The Novascotian'' newspaper would soon become Nova Scotia's most prominent paper after its launch in 1824, which was highly influenced by [[George Young (reporter)|George Young]] who was instrumental in its establishment.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; [[George Young (reporter)|George Young]] sought permission from the Assembly to report its debates. Permission was granted, yet he was not provided with very many privileges in the House. They didn't make it easy for him and didn't allow him a seat in the lower deck.

In 1827 [[Joseph Howe]] bought the ''Novascotian'' from Young. "There was no more powerful an advocate of parliamentary debates than Howe".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; In 1835 [[Joseph Howe]] was "prosecuted over a publication of a letter in the ''Novascotian''".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; He was charged with libel. This case was infamous and is considered to be a "cornerstone in the establishment of freedom of the press in Canada".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; Howe, who defended himself in court, was found to be Not Guilty. This is why his case is viewed as a milestone in the development of the free press.

===Ontario===
[[File:Ontario Hansard 1953.jpg|right|thumb|Cover page of ''Hansard'' for the Province of Ontario, February 12, 1953]]
No official record of the debates in the provincial Legislature was produced before 1944. The debates were reported in various newspapers; the provincial archives clipped and collected these reports in a series of scrapbooks until 1953.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/about/library_l21.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial website now posts ''Hansard'' online, with records from March 29, 1977 to current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/ |title=Legislative Debates Search Page |publisher=Hansardindex.ontla.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-09-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619023323/http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/ |archivedate=2016-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alberta===
[[Alberta]] adopted a ''Hansard'' in 1972.&lt;ref name="assembly.ab.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/pib/hansard_home.htm|title=ALL ABOUT HANSARD - Legislative Assembly of Alberta|author=|date=|website=www.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1905 to 1971, local newspapers reported on legislative proceedings, and from these articles the Legislature Library has compiled a Scrapbook ''Hansard'', which is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://librarysearch.assembly.ab.ca/client/en_CA/scrapbookhansard|title=Scrapbook Hansard|author=|date=|website=librarysearch.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; News reporters were allowed to take handwritten notes in the Chamber, but they could not to make sound recordings, and members of the public were not allowed to take notes.&lt;ref&gt;Standing Orders of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/standing/standing_orders.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 a recording system was installed in the Chamber. Initially the Clerk’s office provided transcription only for special events, such as throne speeches, but requests from MLAs for transcripts increased, and by 1971 all House proceedings were being recorded. On March 8, 1972, the government introduced a motion to create ''Alberta Hansard'', and the following day they brought forward a motion allowing audio and video recording in the Chamber and also permitting visitors to the galleries to take notes. Assembly standing orders 115 and 116 set out the rules for broadcast media in the Chamber and at committee meetings, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/pib/hansard_AB_history.htm|title=ALL ABOUT HANSARD - Legislative Assembly of Alberta|author=|date=|website=www.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hansard'' staff verifies the names of individuals and entities mentioned in the House. Like other ''Hansard''s, ''Alberta Hansard'' follows editorial guidelines established in the 19th century, and transcripts are substantially verbatim. Revisions are limited to “the correction of grammar, spelling and punctuation, ensuring that the correct parliamentary forms are observed, and minimizing superfluous repetition and redundancies, but no material alterations shall be made, nor any amendments that would in any way tend to change the sense of what has been spoken.”&lt;ref&gt;Standing Order 113, https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/standing/standing_orders.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcripts for [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] proceedings from 1972 onward are available online, and current issues are usually posted within 12 hours of the day’s sitting. A transcript for a regular afternoon Assembly sitting of 4.5 hours contains more than 30,000 words.&lt;ref name="assembly.ab.ca"/&gt; Also available online are transcripts for meetings of committees of the Legislative Assembly from the 1990s onward, earlier for some committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=adr_home|title=Assembly Documents and Records- Legislative Assembly of Alberta|author=|date=|website=www.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Columbia===
No complete official record of the debates in the British Columbia Legislature was produced until 1972; a partial record was issued beginning in 1970. Unlike the Ottawa ''Hansard'', opposition members and government backbenchers are identified only by initial and last name: "'''J. Horgan'''". Current cabinet ministers have their names prefaced with "Honourable": "'''Hon. S. Hagen'''". Interjections giving rise to a call for order by the Speaker are reported only as "Interjection". Other interjections are reported as spoken if they are clearly audible and if they are responded to in some way by the member who has the floor. While the details of approval or negativing of motions and bills closely parallel the House of Commons, the reporting is simplified to a style line ("Motion approved" or "Motion negatived").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/38th3rd/H70531p.htm Hansard, Thursday, May 31, 2007 p.m., Vol. 22, No. 3 (HTML)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926212412/http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/38th3rd/H70531p.htm |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
The [[Parliament of Australia]] also keeps record of debates, using the term ''Hansard''.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard | title=Hansard – Parliament of Australia | publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] | work=Parliament of Australia website | accessdate=22 November 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015021919/http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard | archivedate=15 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peo.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/records_parliament.html | title=Fact Sheets – Records of the Parliament | publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] | work=Parliamentary Education Office website | accessdate=22 November 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130164509/http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/records_parliament.html | archivedate=30 November 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The records are published by the [[State Law Publisher]].&lt;ref name="parliament.wa.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/webcms/webcms.nsf/content/hansard | title=Parliament of WA – Hansard | publisher=[[Parliament of Western Australia]] | work=Parliament of Western Australia website | accessdate=22 November 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204110751/http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/WebCMS/WebCMS.nsf/content/hansard | archivedate=4 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of South Australia]] was the first convict free state colony to use ''Hansard''; where it became a convention from 1857.

==New Zealand==
{{Main|Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)}}

On 9 July 1867 a team of five reporters, led by Chief Reporter [[C.C.N. Barron]], produced the first official report of debates of the [[Parliament of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18920711.2.10|title=A Quarter of a Century.|author=|date=11 July 1892|publisher=|pages=2|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=Papers Past|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218154551/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18920711.2.10|archivedate=18 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18880709.2.8|title=Evening Post.

Today ''Hansard'' is produced by a team of 17 [[Full-time equivalent|FTE]] Hansard Editors within the [[Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives]]. ''Hansard'' is published on the [[New Zealand Parliament]] website each day the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]] sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.

Speeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the [[debating chamber]] to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words [[MPs]] use in the [[debating chamber]]. ''Hansard'' is as close to [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. [[MPs]] are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website. [[MPs]] can request correction of inadvertent factual inaccuracies but they are unable to significantly change what they said in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/what-is-hansard/|title=What is Hansard?|author=|date=|website=www.parliament.nz|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129044314/https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/what-is-hansard/|archivedate=29 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews270420091/650th-bound-edition-of-hansard-published|title=Features (pre 2016)|author=|date=|website=www.parliament.nz|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218130306/https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews270420091/650th-bound-edition-of-hansard-published|archivedate=18 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Parliament==
The [[European Parliament]] has its verbatim report of proceedings of the plenary sessions, often referred to by its name in French {{lang|fr|compte rendu in extenso}} (CRE). It is eventually available in nearly all of the [[languages of the European Union|Union's languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/cre.do|title=Home - Plenary - European Parliament|author=|date=|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830133034/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/cre.do|archivedate=30 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Hundi''' is a [[financial instrument]] that developed in [[Medieval India]] for use in trade and credit transactions. Hundis are used as a form of remittance instrument to transfer money from place to place, as a form of credit instrument or IOU to borrow money and as a [[bill of exchange]] in trade transactions. The [[Reserve Bank of India]] describes the Hundi as "an unconditional order in writing made by a person directing another to pay a certain sum of money to a person named in the order."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbi.org.in/scripts/ms_hundies.aspx Hundies], Reserve Bank of India, 2013. Retrieved 26 November 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126010531/http://rbi.org.in/scripts/ms_hundies.aspx |date=November 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Watermark on an Indian 2a Hundi.jpg|thumbnail|right|Government issued hundis included a [[watermark]] to prevent forgery.]]
Hundis have a very long history in India. Written records show their use at least as far back as the sixteenth century. The merchant Banarasi Das, born 1586, received a hundi for 200 rupees from his father to enable him to borrow money to start trading.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/h/hundi_indian_bill_of_exchange.aspx Hundi (Indian bill of exchange),] [[British Museum]], 2013. Retrieved 26 November 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126011955/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/h/hundi_indian_bill_of_exchange.aspx |date=November 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, the British government regarded the hundi system as indigenous or traditional, but not informal. They were reluctant to interfere with it as it formed such an important part of the Indian economy and they also wished to tax the transactions taking place within the system.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/indiaatlse/2013/01/16/hundihawala-in-india/ Between informality and formality: Hundi/Hawala in India], Marina Martin, [[London School of Economics]] India Blog, 16 January 2013. Retrieved 26 November 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530023156/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/indiaatlse/2013/01/16/hundihawala-in-india/ |date=May 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Official hundi forms were produced incorporating revenue stamps bearing the image of British monarchs, including Queen Victoria, and disputes between merchants often entered the court system, so in no way was the system an underground one even though it did not take place through normal banking channels.

==Types of Hundi==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
*'''Sahyog Hundi''': This is drawn by one merchant on another, asking the latter to pay the amount to a third merchant. In this case the merchant on whom the hundi is drawn is of some 'credit worthiness' in the market and is known in the bazaar. A sahyog hundi passes from one hand to another till it reaches the final recipient, who, after reasonable enquiries, presents it to the drawee for acceptance of the payment. Sahyog means co-operation in Hindi and Gujrati, the predominant languages of traders. The hundi is so named because it required the co-operation of multiple parties to ensure that the hundi has an acceptable risk and fairly good likelihood of being paid, in the absence of a formalized credit monitoring and reporting framework.
*'''Darshani Hundi''': This is a hundi payable on sight. It must be presented for payment within a reasonable time after its receipt by the holder. Thus, it is similar to a demand bill.
*'''Muddati Hundi''': A muddati or miadi hundi is payable after a specified period of time. This is similar to a time bill.

There are few other varieties; the Nam-jog hundi, Dhani-jog hundi, Jawabee hundi, Jokhami hundi, Firman-jog hundi, etc.

* Nam-jog hundi - such a hundi is payable only to the person whose name is mentioned on the Hundi. Such a hundi cannot be endorsed in favour of any other person and is akin to a bill on which a restrictive endorsement has been made.
* Furman-jog Hundi - such a hundi can be paid either to the person whose name is mentioned in the hundi or to any person so ordered by him. Such a hundi is similar to a cheque payable on order and no endorsement is required on such a hundi.
* Dhani-jog Hundi - when the hundi is payable to the holder or bearer,it is known as a dhani jog hundi. It is similar to an instrument payable to bearer.
* Jokhim-Hundi - normally a hundi is unconditional but a jokhim hundi is conditional in the sense that the drawer promises to pay the amount of the hundi only on the satisfaction of a certain condition. Such a hundi is not negotiable, and the prevalence of such hundis is very rare these days because banks and insurance companies refuse to accept such hundis.
* Jawabi Hundi - if money is transferred from one place to another through the hundi and the person receiving the payment on is to give an acknowledgement (jawab) for same, then such a hundi is known as a Jawabi Hundi.
* Khaka Hundi - a hundi which has already been paid is known as a Khaka Hundi.
* Khoti Hundi - In case there is any kind of defect in the hundi or in case the hundi has been forged, then such a hundi is known as a khoti hundi.

The '''Jewett City Vampires''' refers to an incident surrounding the Ray family, a large farming family of [[Griswold, Connecticut]] in the 1840s and 1850s, who upon the death of multiple family members concluded they were plagued by [[vampires]], and in 1854 disinterred the dead relatives and consumed their forces to "protect" themselves from the [[undead]].&lt;ref name="Kent2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donna Kent|title=Ghost Stories and Legends of Eastern Connecticut: Love, Mysteries and Secrets Revealed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23hfMiOQTosC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2007|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-59629-317-5|pages=113–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baird|first1=Megan|title=Jewett City Vampires|url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/folklore/jewett-city-vampires.html|website=mysteriousbritain.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Sometime in the mid 19th century one member of the Ray family had contracted [[tuberculosis]], and the first fatality came with the death of 24-year-old Lemuel Ray in 1845.&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires"/&gt; Shortly after Lemuel Ray's father Henry B. Ray died in 1851, two years later 26-year-old Elisha Ray, Lemuel's brother died in 1853, only one year after that in 1854 Henry Ray; Henry B. Ray's eldest son and Lemuel and Elisha's brother died from the disease.&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires, Griswold"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bendici|first1=Ray|title=Jewett City Vampires, Griswold|url=http://www.damnedct.com/the-jewett-city-vampires-griswold|website=www.damnedct.com/|publisher=Damned Connecticut|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body with the "skull and crossbones", found in a coffin with the markings JB-55, had characteristics consistent with a death from tuberculosis, as well as two surrounding bodies, all presumably buried in the 1790s.&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires"/&gt; "JB-55" is the only visually confirmable practice of the bone disruption that the Ray family was supposed to have used to keep dead family members "dead." Another common method to ensure that dead family members remained that way was to cut out the heart of the deceased member and burn it to cure the rest of the family and put the spirit to rest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ringel|first1=Faye|title=New England's Gothic Literature: History and Folklore of the Supernatural from the Seventeenth through the Twentieth Centuries|date=1995|publisher=Mellen Publishing|location=Lewiston, NY|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ray family died from the deadly and highly contagious disease of tuberculosis, then known as consumption over a period of nine years.&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires, Griswold"/&gt;

==Modern rediscovery==
In the early 1990s a few children were playing near a hillside gravel mine in [[Jewett City]], [[Connecticut]], there they discovered the unmarked Walton Family graveyard.&lt;ref name="Kent2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires, Griswold"/&gt; 29 graves were uncovered collectively belonging to both the Walton family and the Ray Family.&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires"/&gt; One such grave had a body which was buried, exhumed, then reburied with its skull dislocated from its spine placed face down with its femers placed in an "X" below the skull.&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewett City Vampires, Griswold"/&gt;

'''''Jikji''''' ({{IPA-ko|tɕiktɕ͈i}}) is the abbreviated title of a [[Korean Buddhism|Korean Buddhist]] document, whose title can be translated "Anthology of Great Buddhist Priests' [[Zen#Seon in Korea|Zen]] Teachings".&lt;ref name=unesco2&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-1/baegun-hwasang-chorok-buljo-jikji-simche-yojeol-volii-the-second-volume-of-anthology-of-great-buddhist-priests-zen-teachings/ Baegun hwasang chorok buljo jikji simche yojeol (vol.II), the second volume of "Anthology of Great Buddhist Priests' Seon Teachings"], unesco.org, accessed June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Printed during the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 1377, it is the world's oldest extant book printed with [[Movable type|movable metal type]]. [[UNESCO]] confirmed ''Jikji'' as the world's oldest metalloid type in September 2001 and includes it in the [[Memory of the World]] Programme.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-1/baegun-hwasang-chorok-buljo-jikji-simche-yojeol-volii-the-second-volume-of-anthology-of-great-buddhist-priests-zen-teachings/ Memory of the World], unesco.org, accessed November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jikji'' was published in Heungdeok Temple in 1377, 78 years prior to [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s acclaimed [[Gutenberg Bible|"42-Line Bible"]] printed during the years 1452–1455.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan (editor)|first=Nicole|title=Michelin Green Guide South Korea|publisher=[[Michelin Guide]]|page=387|year=2012|isbn=978-1907099694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koreatimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jikji: An Invaluable Text of Buddhism|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2015/10/293_63447.html|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|date=April 1, 2010|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater part of the ''Jikji'' is now lost, and today only the last volume survives, and is kept at the Manuscrits Orientaux division of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]].&lt;ref name="koreatimes"/&gt;

== Authorship ==
The ''Jikji'' was written by the Buddhist monk Baegun (1298–1374, Buddhist name Gyeonghan), who served as the chief priest of Anguk and Shingwang temples in [[Haeju]], and was published in two volumes in Seongbulsan in 1372. Baegun died in Chwiam Temple in [[Yeoju]] in 1374.

== Contents ==
The ''Jikji'' comprises a collection of excerpts from the {{linktext | analects}} of the most revered Buddhist monks throughout successive generations. Gyeonghan compiled it as a guide for students of [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]], then Korea's national religion under the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918–1392).

The text propounds on the essentials of [[Korean Buddhism#Seon|Seon]], the predecessor to Japan's [[Zen]] Buddhism.

The ''Jikji'' consists of two volumes. The metal-print ''Jikji'' that was published in Heungdeok Temple is kept in the ''Manuscrits Orientaux'' division of the National Library of France, with the first page of the last volume (Book 1 in Chapter 38) torn off. A wood-carving print of ''Jikji'' published in Chwiamsa Temple contains the complete two volumes. This is kept in the [[National Library of Korea]] and Jangsagak and Bulgap temples as well as in the [[Academy of Korean Studies]].

== Printing ==
[[File:JikjiType.gif|thumb|Movable type used to print the first printed book - the ''Jikji'' - in Korea]]
On the last page of ''Jikji'' is recorded details of its publication, indicating that it was published in the 3rd Year of [[U of Goryeo|King U]] (July 1377) by metal type at Heungdeok temple in [[Cheongju]]. The ''Jikji'' originally consisted of two volumes totaling 307 chapters, but the first volume of the metal printed version is no longer extant.

There is a record indicating that in 1377 Baegun's students, priests Seoksan and Daldam, helped in the publication of ''Jikji'' by using moveable metal type and the priestess Myodeok contributed her efforts as well.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

The surviving metal type's dimensions are 24.6 x 17.0&amp;nbsp;cm. Its paper is very slight and white. The whole text is doubly folded very slightly. The cover looks re-made. The title of ''Jikji'' also seems to be written with an Indian ink after the original. The cover on the surviving volume of the metal type edition records in French "The oldest known Korean book printed with molded type, with 1377 as date", written by Maurice Courant.

The lines are not straight, but askew. The difference of the thickness of ink color shown on drawn letter paper is large, and spots often occur. Even some characters, such as 'day' (日) or 'one' (一), are written reversely, while other letters are not printed out completely. The same typed letters are not shown on the same paper, but the same typed letters appear on other leaves.{{clarify|date=September 2014}} There are also blurs and spots around the characters.

Towards the end of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], a French diplomat bought the second volume of the ''Jikji'' in Seoul and took it off to France, where it is now kept at the [[National Library of France]] in [[Paris]].

According to UNESCO records, the ''Jikji'' “had been in the collection of [[Victor Emile Marie Joseph Collin de Plancy]], a chargé d'affaires with the French Embassy in Seoul in 1887 during the reign of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]. The book then passed into the hands of Henri Véver, a collector of classics, in an auction at Hotel Drouot in 1911, and when he died in 1950, it was donated to the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, where it has been ever since.” Today only 38 sheets of the second volume of the metal print edition are extant.

In May 1886, Korea and France concluded a treaty of defense and commerce, and as a result in 1887 official diplomatic relations were entered into by the treaty's official ratification by Kim Yunsik (1835–1922) and [[Victor Emile Marie Joseph Collin de Plancy]] (1853–1924). Plancy, who had majored in law in France and went on to study Chinese, had served for six years as translator at the French Legation in China, between 1877 and 1883. In 1888 he went to Seoul as the first French consul to Korea, staying until 1891. During his extended residence in Korea, first as consul and then again as full diplomatic minister from 1896–1906, Victor Collin de Plancy collected Korean ceramics and old books. He let Kulang, who had moved to Seoul as his official secretary, classify them.

Although the channels through which Plancy collected his works are not clearly known, he seems to have collected them primarily from the early 1900s. Most of the old books Plancy collected in Korea went to the National Library of France at an auction in 1911, while the metal-printed ''Jikji'' was purchased in that same year for 180 francs by Henri Véver (1854–1943), a well-known jewel merchant and old book collector, who in turn donated it to the French National Library in his will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=1643|title=The Earliest Surviving Book Printed from Movable Metal Type (1377) :  HistoryofInformation.com|website=www.historyofinformation.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rediscovery ==
The metal-printed ''Jikji'' became known to the world in 1901 through its inclusion in the appendix of the ''Hanguk Seoji'', compiled by the French Sinologist and scholar of Korea, Maurice Courant (1865–1935). In 1972 the ''Jikji'' was displayed in Paris during the "[[International Book Year]]" hosted by the [[National Library of France]], gaining it worldwide attention for the first time. The book was "rediscovered" by Dr. Park Byung Sun who was working as a librarian in the National Library of France. Dr. Park died in 2011.

The ''Jikji'' was printed using metal print in Heungdeok Temple outside Cheongjumok in July 1377, a fact recorded in its postscript. The fact that it was printed in Heungdeok Temple in Uncheondong, Cheongju, was confirmed when Cheongju University excavated the Heungdeok Temple site in 1985.

Heungdeok Temple was rebuilt in March 1992. In 1992, the Early Printing Museum of Cheongju was opened, and it took the ''Jikji'' as its central theme from 2000.

Only the final volume of the ''Jikji'' is preserved by the Manuscrits Orientaux department of the National Library of France.

On September 4, 2001, the ''Jikji'' was formally added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World]]. The [[Jikji prize|Jikji Memory of the World Prize]] was created in 2004 to commemorate the creation of the ''Jikji''.

== Controversy ==
The right of ownership remains disputed, with the French National Library maintaining that the ''Jikji'' should remain in France, while Korean activists argue it should belong to Korea.&lt;ref name=cceia&gt;[http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_12/online_exclusive/5153.html cceia.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821170254/http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_12/online_exclusive/5153.html |date=2010-08-21 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The National Library of France says that as an important historical artifact of all mankind, the ''Jikji'' should remain in France as it represents a common, worldwide heritage, and does not belong to any one country. In addition, they claim the ''Jikji'' would be better preserved and displayed in France because of the prestige and resources the Library possesses. On the other hand, Korean organizations claim that it should belong to its country of origin and that it carries historical significance for the Korean people.
The Committee to Bring Jikji Back to Korea led by the American [[Richard Pennington (writer)|Richard Pennington]]&lt;ref&gt;http://richardpennington.com/index.php/publications/entry/the-jikji-prize-award-ceremony-in-cheongjuseptember-12-2013&lt;/ref&gt; is one such organization in [[Seoul]], [[Korea]] that is working to repatriate the Jikji back to Korea from [[France]].
The French President [[François Mitterrand]] promised to investigate ways to return various Korean books including the ''Jikji'', should the French high-speed rail technology be exported to Korea.&lt;ref name=cceia&gt;[http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_12/online_exclusive/5153.html cceia.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821170254/http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_12/online_exclusive/5153.html |date=2010-08-21 }}

'''Landolt–Börnstein''' is the largest collection of critically evaluated property data in [[materials science]] and the closely related fields of [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]] published by [[SpringerNature|Springer Nature]].
[[File:LB-image.gif|thumb]]

==History==
On July 28, 1882, Dr. [[Hans Heinrich Landolt]] and Dr. [[Richard Börnstein]], both professors at the "[[Agricultural University of Berlin|Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule]]" (Agricultural College) at Berlin, signed a contract with the publisher Ferdinand Springer on the publication of a collection of tables with physical-chemical data. The title of this book "Physikalisch-chemische Tabellen" (Physical-Chemical Tables) published in 1883 was soon forgotten. Owing to its success the data collection has been known for more than a hundred years by each scientist only as "The Landolt-Börnstein".

1250 copies of the 1st Edition were printed and sold. In 1894, the 2nd Edition was published, in 1905 the 3rd Edition, in 1912 the 4th Edition, and finally in 1923 the 5th Edition. Supplementary volumes of the latter were printed until as late as 1936. New Editions saw changes in large expansion of volumes, number of authors, updated structure, additional tables and coverage of new areas of physics and chemistry.

The 5th Edition was eventually published in 1923, consisting of two volumes and comprising a total of 1,695 pages. Sixty three authors had contributed to it. The growth that had already been noticed in previous editions, continued. It was clear, that "another edition in approximately 10 years" was no solution. A complete conceptual change of the Landolt-Börnstein had thus become necessary. For the meantime supplementary volumes in two-year intervals should be provided to fill in the blanks and add the latest data. The first supplementary volume of the 5th Edition was published in 1927, the second in 1931 and the third in 1935/36. The latter consisted of three sub-volumes with a total of 3,039 pages and contributions from 82 authors.

The 6th Edition (1950) was published in line with the revised general frame. The basic idea was to have four volumes instead of one, each of which was to cover different fields of the Landolt-Börnstein under different editors. Each volume was given a detailed table of contents. Two major restrictions were also imposed. The author of a contribution was asked to choose a "Bestwert" (optimum value) from the mass of statements of an experimental value in the publications of different authors, or derive a "wahrscheinlichster Wert” (most possible value). The other change of importance was that not only diagrams became as important as tables, but that text also became necessary to explain the presented data.

== The New Series ==
The new concept of the 6th Edition – splitting of the edition in four volumes with a yet unknown number of sub-volumes – was a slight progress, but eventually, it has not proven to be of much use. Instead of publishing new editions of the data collection one after the other, the "New Series" concept was intended to publish independent volumes that were each to cover a certain closed theme. It was flexible enough to follow the changes in the scientific interest and abandon the previous structuring of physics and chemistry in favor of new themes. Thus, new subjects such as solid-state physics could easily be comprised in groups of volumes. This concept has been adhered to up to now.

The New Series represents over 520 books published between 1961 and 2018 and includes more than 220,000 pages covering [[Mechanical properties|mechanical]], [[Optical properties|optical]], [[Acoustics|acoustical]], [[thermal]], [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]], [[Electricity|electrical]] and [[Magnetism|magnetic]] properties among others. The New Series offers critically evaluated data by over 1,000 expert authors and editors in materials science. 

== Landolt-Börnstein Online ==
Landolt–Börnstein books have gone through various digitization initiatives, from CD-ROM to FTP and PDF formats. Landolt–Börnstein books content is now available on SpringerMaterials, a comprehensive database for identifying material properties which covers data from materials science, physics, physical and inorganic chemistry, engineering and other related fields. SpringerMaterials offers advanced materials science-specific search functionality that allows easy retrieval of accurate results. Recently introduced [https://materials.springer.com/about-springer-materials-interactive SpringerMaterials Interactive] is a set of advanced functionalities for visualizing and analyzing materials property data. Examples of these functionalities include interactive graphs, dynamic data tables, and side-by- side comparisons of materials/properties.

*[[Condensed matter physics|Condensed matter]]
*[[Nuclear physics]]
*[[Physical property|Physical]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of [[Molecule|molecules]] and [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]]

[[Magical thinking]] in various forms is a [[cultural universal]] and an important aspect of [[religion]].
Magic is prevalent in all societies, regardless of whether they have organized religion or more general systems of [[animism]] or [[shamanism]].
Religion and magic became conceptually separated with the development of western [[monotheism]], where the distinction arose between supernatural events sanctioned by mainstream religious doctrine ([[miracle]]s) and magic rooted in folk belief or occult speculation.
In pre-monotheistic religious traditions, there is no fundamental distinction between religious practice and magic; tutelary deities concerned with magic are sometimes called hermetic deities or spirit guides.

== Magical practices in prehistory ==

=== Anthropological and psychological perspectives ===
{{Main|Magical thinking|Evolutionary origin of religion}}

It is a postulate of modern [[anthropology]], at least since early 1930s, that there is complete continuity between magic and religion.&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.122-3. Quotation: {{quotation|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ranulph Marett]] (1932) [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;TOC=True ''Faith, Hope and Charity in Primitive Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119025854/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;TOC=True |date=2011-11-19 }}, in [[Gifford Lectures]]. Lecture II [https://archive.is/20120731050138/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;ArticleID=3  ''Hope'']. Quotation: {{quotation|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of The Golden Bough, would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional differences between religion and magic==
Early sociological interpretations of magic by [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Henri Hubert]] emphasized the social conditions in which the phenomenon of magic develops.&lt;ref name='Pasi'&gt;Pasi, M. 2006. "Magic". in von Stuckrad, K. (ed.) ''The Brill Dictionary of Ancient Religion. Volume III. M-R.'' Leiden and Boston, Brill. 1134-1140.&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, religion is the expression of a social structure and serves to maintain the cohesion of a community (religion is therefore public) and magic is an individualistic action (and therefore private).&lt;ref name='Pasi' /&gt;

[[Ralph Merrifield]], the [[British people|British]] archaeologist credited as producing the first full-length volume dedicated to a [[Material culture|material]] approach to magic,&lt;ref name='Materiality'&gt;Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. 'Introduction: The materiality of the materiality of magic', in Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. (eds.) ''The Materiality of Magic: An artefactual investigation into ritual practices and popular beliefs''.Oxford and Philadelphia, Oxbow Books. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; defined the differences between religion and magic: 
"'Religion' is used to indicate the belief in supernatural or spiritual beings; 'magic', the use of practices intended to bring occult forces under control and so to influence events; 'ritual', prescribed or customary behaviour that may be religious, if it is intended to placate or win favour of supernatural beings, magical if it is intended to operate through impersonal forces of sympathy or by controlling supernatural beings, or social if its purpose is to reinforce a social organisation or facilitate social intercourse".&lt;ref name='Merrifield'&gt;Merrifield, R. 1987. ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic''. London, Guild Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Henk Versnel argued that magic and religion function in different ways and that these can be broadly defined in four areas: Intention - magic is employed to achieve clear and immediate goals for an individual, whereas religion is less purpose-motivated and has its sights set on longer-term goals; Attitude – magic is manipulative as the process is in the hands of the user, “instrumental coercive manipulation”, opposed to the religious attitude of “personal and supplicative negotiation”; Action – magic is a technical exercise that often requires professional skills to fulfil an action, whereas religion is not dependent upon these factors but the will and sentiment of the gods; Social – the goals of magic run counter to the interests of a society (in that personal gain for an individual gives them an unfair advantage over peers), whereas religion has more benevolent and positive social functions.&lt;ref name='Versnel'&gt;Versnel, H. S. 1991. “Some Reflections on the Relationship Magic-Religion.” Numen 38 (2). 177-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

This separation of the terms 'religion' and 'magic' in a functional sense is disputed. It has been argued that abandoning the term magic in favour of discussing "belief in spiritual beings" will help to create a more meaningful understanding of all associated ritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, B-C. 2013. "Towards Historicizing 'Magic' in Antiquity", ''Numen'' 60. 308-347.&lt;/ref&gt; However using the word 'magic' alongside 'religion' is one method of trying to understand the supernatural world, even if some other term can eventually take its place.&lt;ref name='Versnel' /&gt;

==Religious practices and magic==
Both magic and religion contain [[ritual]]s.&lt;ref name='Merrifield' /&gt; 
Most cultures have or have had in their past some form of magical tradition that recognizes a [[shamanistic]] interconnectedness of spirit. This may have been long ago, as a folk tradition that died out with the establishment of a major world religion, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam or Buddhism, or it may still co-exist with that world religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitemagicwitch.com/magic-and-religion/ Magic and Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714235043/http://whitemagicwitch.com/magic-and-religion/ |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names of the gods ===
There is a long-standing belief in the power of [[true name]]s, this often descends from the magical belief that knowing a being's true name grants  power over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

If names have power, then knowing the name of a god regarded as supreme in a religion should grant the greatest power of all.  This belief is reflected in traditional [[Wicca]], where the names of the Goddess and the Horned God - the two supreme deities in Wicca - are usually held as a secret to be revealed only to initiates. This belief is also reflected in ancient Judaism, which used the [[Tetragrammaton]] (YHWH, usually translated as "&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;" in small caps) to refer to God in the [[Tanakh]]. The same belief is seen in [[Hinduism]], but with different conclusions; rather, attaining transcendence and the power of God is seen as a ''good'' thing.  Thus, some Hindus chant the name of their favorite deities as often as possible, the most common being [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="CHU"&gt;{{cite book

{{main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible|Christian views on magic}}
Magic and [[Abrahamic religions]] have had a somewhat checkered past.  The [[King James Version]] of the Bible included the famous translation "''Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live''" (Exodus 22:18),&lt;ref name="KJV"&gt;{{cite book
 | title = [[King James Version of the Bible]]
 | year = 1611 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul]] is rebuked by God for seeking advice from a diviner who could contact spirits. On the other hand, seemingly magical signs are documented in the Bible: For example, both the staff of Pharaoh's  sorcerers as well as [[The Staff of Moses|the staff of Moses]] and Aaron could be turned into snakes (Exodus 7:8-13). However, as Scott Noegel points out, the critical difference between the magic of Pharaoh's magicians and the non-magic of Moses is in the means by which the staff becomes a snake. For the Pharaoh's magicians, they employed "their secret arts" whereas Moses merely throws down his staff to turn it into a snake. To an ancient Egyptian, the startling difference would have been that Moses neither employed secret arts nor magical words. In the Torah, Noegel points out that YHWH does not need magical rituals to act.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/snoegel/PDFs/articles/Noegel%2019%20-%20JANES%201996.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The words 'witch' and 'witchcraft' appear in some English versions of the Bible. One verse that is probably responsible for more deaths of suspected witches than any other passage from the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) is Exodus 22:18.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In the King James Version, this reads: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." The precise meaning of the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', here translated as 'witch' and in some other modern versions, 'sorceress', is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]] it was translated as ''pharmakeia'', meaning 'pharmacy', and on this basis, [[Reginald Scot]] claimed in the 16th century that 'witch' was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Scot|Scot, Reginald]] (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2381">'''Mixed twins''' are [[fraternal twins]] born to [[multiracial]] families which differ in [[human skin color|skin color]] and other traits considered to be [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] features.

From a biological point of view, the differences in these fraternal or dizygotic [[twins]] from two biracial parents are not surprising. In [[humans]], a relatively small number of [[genes]] are thought to be responsible for [[human skin color]]. Different alleles or gene variants code for differences in the melanin found within the skin. Within some groups are high frequencies of dark skin alleles, while others have high frequencies of light skin alleles, for example. The parents of such twins, who are typically both of mixed race, have a combination of alleles for light and dark skin in their [[genome]]. 

Each [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] or [[Ovum|egg]] cell possesses a random selection of genes from its mother or father. While not the most probable event, a sperm or egg may randomly acquire, for example, mostly alleles that confer light skin coloration or mostly alleles that confer dark skin coloration. In such cases, fraternal twins can differ from each other quite dramatically in terms of skin color or other physical characteristics.

Numerous sets of mixed twins have been born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/journallive/thejournal/tm_headline=black-and-white-twins-are-one-in-a-million%26method=full%26objectid=17986229%26siteid=50081-name_page.html Black and white twins are one in a million]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_objectid=16415539&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=exclusive--ebony-and-ivory-name_page.html EXCLUSIVE: EBONY AND IVORY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flatrock.org.nz/topics/odds_and_oddities/twins_in_black_and_white.htm Twins in Black and White]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://concreteloop.com/2006/10/another-pair-of-black-white-twins ANOTHER PAIR OF BLACK &amp; WHITE TWINS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much more rarely, mixed twins can arise as a result of [[heteropaternal superfecundation]].&lt;ref name="superf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/30864533/ns/today-parenting_and_family/t/mother-gives-birth-twins-different-dads/#.VPYzzkvnaUk|title=Mother gives birth to twins with different dads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

----
'''Selection Criteria'''

The selection criteria for all of the awards are '''excellence''', '''innovation''', and '''enhancement''' of the quality of life.  Individual candidates must be citizens or long-term residents of the United States and have been practicing design for at least 7 years.  Corporations and institutions must have their headquarters in the United States.  Honorees are selected for a body of realized work, not for any one specific project.

Candidates are proposed by an official Nominating Committee and are invited to submit materials for a jury's review.  Submissions consist of resumes, portfolios, publications by and about the candidates, and professional-quality audio-visual samples.

----
'''Jury'''

The jurors are chosen by the museum based on their prominence and expertise in the design world.  Once selected, jurors are briefed on the Museum mission and criteria for the Awards.  Decisions are asked to be based on the core criteria: excellence, innovation, and contribution to the quality of life.  '''Museum staff does not enter into the selection process.'''

The jury meets over a two-day period to thoroughly review every submission.  The submissions are assessed in terms of the work's relationship to and impact on contemporary life.  Special emphasis is placed on the extent to which the nominee's designs and achievements have benefit the general public.

----
'''Purpose'''

The annual Awards program celebrates design in various disciplines as a vital humanistic tool in shaping the world, and seeks to increase national awareness of design by educating the public and promoting excellence, innovation, and lasting achievement.

The National Design Awards is one of the few programs of its kind structured to continue to benefit the nation long after the Awards ceremony and gala.  A suite of educational programs is offered every year in conjunction with the Awards by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum's Education Department.  These programs include: lectures, round-tables, workshops, and fairs based on the vision and work of the Awards' winners.

----
'''People's Design Award'''

In 2006, the first ever People's Design Award was created in order to give the general public a chance to nominate and vote for their favorite design.

Individuals can nominate and vote for their favorite designers via the official website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1395">'''Natural magic''' in the context of [[Renaissance magic]] is that part of the [[occult]] which deals with [[Fundamental forces|natural forces]] directly, as opposed to [[ceremonial magic]], in particular [[goety]] and [[theurgy]], which deals with the summoning of [[spirit]]s. [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] so uses the term in his 1526 ''de vanitate''.
Natural magic so defined thus includes [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and disciplines that we would today consider fields of [[natural science]], such as [[astronomy]] and [[chemistry]] (which developed and diverged from astrology and alchemy, respectively, into the modern sciences they are today) or [[botany]] (from [[herbology]]). In a modern context, [[white magic]] may be referred to as "high magic" (not to be confused with the alternate meaning of "high magic", which denotes ceremonial or ritual magic).

The site also shows groups of companies which are legally part of the same conglomerate.&lt;ref name="Groupings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencorporates.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/introducing-corporategroupings-where-fuzzy-concepts-meet-legal-entities/|title=Introducing CorporateGroupings: where fuzzy concepts meet legal entities|publisher=OpenCorporates|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic company information is available as [[open data]] in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] format.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

The OpenCorporates Advisory Board exists to advise OpenCorporates on policy, practice and principles, and to ensure that OpenCorporates remains true to its central mission of the opening of company data for the public good. It was formed by three members: David Eaves, Kaitlin Lee and Andrew Stott.&lt;ref&gt;[https://opencorporates.com/info/advisory_board Advisory Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

The same team also operate '''OpenCharities''', compiling data on [[registered charity|registered charities]].&lt;ref name="OpenCharities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencharities.org/info/about|title=About|publisher=OpenCharities|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
[[File:Chris Taggart 2013.JPG|thumb|Chris Taggart ''(pictured)'' created OpenCorporates with Rob McKinnon]]

In 2011, the site was an award winner in the OpenDataChallenge (3rd Prize App),&lt;ref name="ODC-win"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opendatachallenge.org/#winners|title=Open Data Challenge winners|accessdate=2 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816002600/http://opendatachallenge.org/#winners|archivedate=16 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose judging panel included web founder [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and Laura Creighton, who said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is an incredibly powerful and useful app. It combines information collected by scraping the web with Open Data from government bodies, with a new feature for [[crowdsourcing]].  It makes accessing government information about companies trivial. This tool is invaluable for those who want to find out more about what it is that corporations are doing.  It is a remarkable step forward for transparency and accountability. I could play with this thing for days.&lt;ref name="ODC-win" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In launching the competition, [[Neelie Kroes]], Vice-President of the [[European Commission]] said of the site:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the kind of resource the (Digital) Single Market needs and it is encouraging to see that it is being built.&lt;ref name="Kroes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/neelie-kroes/getting-out-the-data/|title=Getting out the Data|last=Kroes|first=Neelie|work=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The project was subsequently represented on the [[European Union]]'s Core Vocabularies Working Group's Core Business Task Force.&lt;ref name="EU-2012-02-15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/core_business/document/core-vocabularies-working-group-members|title=Core Vocabularies Working Group Members|date=15 February 2012|work=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012, the project was appointed to the [[Financial Stability Board]]'s advisory panel on a [[Legal Entity Identification for Financial Contracts]].&lt;ref name="FSB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_120203a.pdf|title=FSB Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) Initiative Industry Advisory Panel -  Membership|year=2012|publisher=Financial Stability Board|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, OpenCorporates was a finalist in both the Business and Publisher categories at the [[Open Data Institute]] Awards, the only entity to reach the finals in more than one category.&lt;ref name=odi-finalists&gt;{{cite web|title=ODI Awards 2015 Finalists|url=http://awards.theodi.org/2015-finalists/|website=Open Data Award 2015|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the awards ceremony on 9 July OpenCorporates was announced as the winner of the Open Data Business Award, in recognition of its work with promoting data transparency in the corporate sector.&lt;ref name="ODI-award"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating Generation Open – ODI awards network thinkers who are changing the world|url=http://theodi.org/news/odi-2015-award-winners|website=open data institute|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hera Hussain, Communities and Partnerships Manager at OpenCorporates, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We’re delighted and proud to have won this award. When we launched OpenCorporates we had a vision for an open database with tens of millions of companies from all over the world. We’re now in sight of 100 million companies, used regularly by journalists, investigators, governments, even banks. This is a testament not just to the power of OpenCorporates, but of open data itself.&lt;ref name="ODI-award" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The award was presented by Open Data Institute founders Sir [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and Sir [[Nigel Shadbolt]].

'''OpenDNSSEC''' is a [[computer program]] that manages the security of [[domain name]]s on the Internet. The project intends to drive adoption of [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]] (DNSSEC) to further enhance Internet security.

OpenDNSSEC was created as an open-source turn-key solution for DNSSEC. It secures [[DNS zone]] data just before it is published in an [[Domain Name System#Authoritative name server|authoritative name server]]. OpenDNSSEC takes in unsigned zones, adds [[digital signature]]s and other [[Resource record#DNS resource records|records]] for DNSSEC and passes it on to the authoritative name servers for that zone. All keys are stored in a [[hardware security module]] and accessed via [[PKCS11|PKCS #11]], a standard [[application programming interface|software interface]] for communicating with devices which hold [[cryptographic]] information and perform cryptographic functions. 

OpenDNSSEC uses the [[Botan (programming library)|Botan]] [[cryptographic]] library, and [[SQLite]] or [[MySQL]] as [[back-end database|database back-end]]. It is used on the &lt;code&gt;.se&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.dk&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.nl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.uk&lt;/code&gt; top-level domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenDNSSEC|url=https://www.iis.se/english/domains/tech/opendnssec/|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pastoral letter''', often called simply a '''pastoral''', is an [[open letter]] addressed by a [[bishop]] to the [[clergy]] or [[laity]] of a [[diocese]] or to both, containing general admonition, instruction or consolation, or directions for behaviour in particular circumstances. In the [[Catholic Church]], such letters are also sent out regularly at particular [[ecclesiastical]] seasons, particularly at the beginning of [[fasting|fasts]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pastoral Letter |volume=20 |page=898 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most episcopal church bodies, clerics are often required to read out pastoral letters of superior bishops to their congregations. 

In the non-[[episcopal polity|episcopal]] [[Protestant]] [[church body|churches]] a pastoral letter is any open letter addressed by a [[pastor]] to his congregation, more especially to one customarily issued at certain seasons, for example, by the moderator of a [[Presbyterian]] assembly or the chairman of a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] or [[Baptist]] union.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

'''Paul Vachon''' (born May 14, 1938) is a Canadian retired [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He is a member of the [[Vachon family|Vachon wrestling family]].

==Professional wrestling career==
Paul Vachon grew up as one of thirteen children of Ferdinand Vachon, a [[Montreal]] police officer. In 1957, he followed his brother [[Maurice Vachon|Maurice]] into professional business, adopting his brother's, the "Mad Dog", vicious [[heel (wrestling)|heel]] style and the moniker "Butcher Vachon". He wrestled in the [[American Wrestling Association]], [[World Wrestling Federation]] (now WWE), [[National Wrestling Alliance]] and [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (later would become WCW).

He often teamed with his brother "Mad Dog" Vachon, with whom he won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]].

In the early 1970s he appeared alongside his sister [[Vivian Vachon]] in the motion picture ''Wrestling Queen''.

He wrestled under a mask as "Spoiler #2" for [[Jim Crockett Promotions]]' "Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling" in 1975.  His angle involved getting revenge on [[Wahoo_McDaniel|Wahoo McDaniel]], [[Paul_Jones_(wrestler)|Paul Jones]], and [[Rufus R. Jones]] for running Super Destroyer ([[Don Jardine]]) out of the territory.  (In fact, Jardine left JCP on short notice and booker [[George_Scott_(wrestler)|George Scott]] wanted a masked heel on the roster.)   Vachon stayed in JCP for a few months and before leaving lost a series of matches against Paul Jones and Rufus Jones in which the mask was at stake (as was Paul Jones' U.S. title in their matches).

Paul retired in 1984. Proving his talents extend beyond the wrestling ring, one of his final appearances was singing [[La Vie en Rose]] on [[Tuesday Night Titans]].

==Personal life==
He was the adoptive father of wrestler [[Luna Vachon]]. He is the brother of wrestlers [[Maurice Vachon|Maurice]] and [[Vivian Vachon]] and former father-in-law of wrestlers [[Gangrel (wrestler)|David "Gangrel" Heath]] and Tom Nash. In total, Vachon has six children and has been married four times.

After his wrestling career, Paul Vachon joined the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] and ran as a federal candidate in 1988, 1993 and 1995.

In 1993, he was diagnosed with colon cancer and had half of his colon removed.&lt;ref name=cancer/&gt; Then, in 2003, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. Vachon underwent 40 treatments, one on each week day for five straight weeks, to overcome the throat cancer.&lt;ref name=cancer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/11/25/267579.html|title=Butcher Vachon beats down cancer|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-07-20|date=November 25, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he had the disease burned out of his tonsils and his teeth removed.&lt;ref name=cancer/&gt; As a result of the radiation treatments, he underwent reconstructive jaw surgery in early June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2479395/Wrestling-News-and-Gossip-from-The-Sun-Mike-Aldrens-WGN-Wrestling-Globe-Newsletter.html|title=Daily wrestling news and gossip|last=Aldren|first=Mike|accessdate=2009-06-19|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|location=London|date=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vachon also suffers from [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name=magnet/&gt;

Vachon and his wife Rebecca travel to flea markets and fairs to sell therapeutic magnets, a business they began in 1995.&lt;ref name=magnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/05/14/87185.html|title=Magnets pull on Butcher Vachon|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM!

'''''R v Betts and Ridley''''' (1930) 22 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 148 is a landmark case in [[English criminal law]] from 1930, which established that to be convicted of a crime under the doctrine of [[Common purpose]], it was not necessary for an accessory to actually be present when the offence was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article4179652.ece |title=The cases that changed Britain: 1917-1954 |publisher=[[Times Online]] |location=London |first=Gary |last=Slapper |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Victor Betts and Herbert Ridley agreed to rob a man, William Thomas Andrews, as he was on his way to the bank. Their plan was that Betts would push the individual to the ground and snatch his bag. Meanwhile Ridley would be waiting around the corner in a getaway car. However, Betts struck Andrews with such force that he died as a result of the blow.

==Judgment==
Both were subsequently convicted of murder and sentenced to death. An appeal against the murder conviction by both men was dismissed. However, the Home Secretary advised the King to respite the capital sentence in the case of Ridley to penal servitude for life.

Despite a petition with 12,000 signatures, Betts was hanged at [[Birmingham Prison]] on 3 January 1931 by [[Thomas Pierrepoint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hanged1.html |title=English &amp; Welsh executions 1900 - 1931 |publisher=Capital Punishment U.K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A crowd of several hundred people gathered as a nearby factory sounded its whistle to mark the fateful hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bond.edu.au/study-areas/law/publications/BLR/vol2-2/Cato2_2.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801102803/http://www.bond.edu.au/study-areas/law/publications/BLR/vol2-2/Cato2_2.pdf |archivedate=August 1, 2008 |title=Foresight of Murder and Complicity in Unlawful Joint Enterprises Where Death Results |first=Charles |last=Cato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7710">'''Skuld''' was a princess of Scandinavian legend who married [[Heoroweard]] and encouraged him to kill [[Hroðulf]] (Hrólfr Kraki). The accounts of her vary greatly from source to source. ''[[Skuld]]'' is derived from the Old Norse verb ''skulla'', "need/ought to be/shall be";&lt;ref&gt;http://runeberg.org/nfbf/0272.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shall |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning is "that which should become, or that needs to occur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/svetym |title=Swedish Etymological dictionary |publisher=Runeberg.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hrólfr Kraki's saga''==
''[[Hrólfs saga kraka|Hrólfr Kraki's saga]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jesse L. Byock, ''The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn Jones, ''Eirik the Red and Other Icelandic Sagas'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anders Fryxell, ''The History of Sweden'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Norman Garmonsway, Jacqueline Simpson, Hilda Roderick Ellis Davidson, ''Beowulf and Its Analogues'', 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Turville-Petre, ''The Heroic Age of Scandinavia'', 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; tells that one [[Yule]], Helgi (appears as [[Halga]] in ''[[Beowulf]]'') was visited by [[loathly lady|an ugly being]] while he was in his hunting house. No person in the entire kingdom allowed the being to enter the house, except Helgi. Later, the thing asked to sleep in his bed. Unwillingly he agreed, and as the thing got into the bed, it turned into an [[Elf|elvish]] woman, who was clad in silk and who was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He raped her, and made her pregnant. Helgi forgot the woman and a couple of days after the date had passed, he was visited by the woman, who had '''Skuld''' on her arms. The daughter would marry Hjörvarđr ([[Heoroweard]]).

Much later, when her half-brother [[Hrólfr Kraki]] was King of the Danes, Skuld began to turn her husband against Hrólfr. Under the pretext that they would wait three years before paying the accumulated tribute at one time, Skuld assembled a large army which included strong warriors, criminals, elves and [[norns]]. She was a great [[Witchcraft|sorceress]] and used [[seiðr]] (witchcraft) to hide the great muster from Hrólfr and his champions. They then arrived at [[Lejre]] one [[Yule]] for the midwinter [[blót]]s, with all the weapons hidden in wagons to ambush the king at night. A battle ensued and, in the account found in ''Gesta Danorum'', Bödvar Bjarki fought in the [[berserker|shape of a spirit bear]] until he was awakened by Hjalti. To overcome him, Skuld cast the most powerful spell to resuscitate her fallen warriors and after a long fight Hrólfr and all his eleven champions fell, with the sole exception of [[Vöggr]] who promises to avenge the king.

As Hjörvarđr was also killed in the battle, Skuld became the Queen of Denmark but did not rule well and only for a short time. Bödvar Bjarki's brothers Elk-Froði and Thorir (Þorir) Houndsfoot went to Denmark to avenge their brother. The Swedish queen [[Yrsa]] gave them a large Swedish army headed by Vöggr. They seized the wicked elf queen by surprise, just as she had suddenly attacked the king, tying her arms so she could not use her magic arts. With no spells to prevent it, they then slew all of her supernatural rabble. After this, a cruel vengeance was exacted on the captured Skuld in retribution for her treachery and [[fratricide]] and she was tortured to death through a variety of the most dreadful ways. The rule over the kingdom was then restored to King Hrólfr's daughters. When all this was accomplished, everyone went home.

==''Skjöldunga saga''==
The ''[[Skjöldunga saga]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14878 ''The Relation of the Hrolfs Saga Kraka and the Bjarkarimur to Beowulf'' by Olson, 1916, at Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; relates that Helgo (Halga) was the [[King of Denmark]] together with his brother [[Hroðgar|Roas (Hroðgar)]]. Helgo raped Olava, the [[Queen of Saxony|Queen of the Saxons]], and she bore a daughter named Yrsa. The girl later married [[Eadgils|King Adillus (Eadgils)]], the [[King of Sweden]]. Yrsa and Adillus had a daughter, '''Scullda'''.

Yrsa and Adillus married their Scullda to Hiørvardus, the King of [[Öland]] (also called ''Hiorvardus'' and ''Hevardus'', and who corresponds to [[Heoroweard]] in ''[[Beowulf]]''). As her half-brother Rolfo (Hrólfr Kraki, Hroðulf) was not consulted about this marriage, he was infuriated and he attacked Öland and made Hiørvardus and his kingdom [[Tributary state|tributary]] to Denmark.

Hiørvardus and Queen Skullda rebelled against Rolfo and killed him. However, Hiørvardus did not live long after this and was himself killed.

==''Gesta Danorum''==
The ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (book 2), by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], tells that Roluo (Hrólfr Kraki) defeated Athislus (Eadgils) and gave Sweden to young man named Hiartuar (Heoroweard), who was seized by passion to Roluo's beautiful but heartless sister '''Skulde'''  and married her.

The ambitious Skulde, however, did not like the fact that her husband had to pay taxes to Roluo and so incited Hiartuar to rebel against him. They so went to [[Lejre]] (a town which Roluo had built) with arms hidden in the ships, under the pretense that they wanted to pay tribute. They were well-received, but after the banquet, when most people were drunk asleep, the Swedes and the [[Goths]] (i.e. the [[Geats]]) proceeded to kill everyone at Roluo's residence. After a long battle, involving Roluo's champion [[Bjarki]], who fought in the shape of a spirit bear until he was awakened by his comrade Hjalti the Geats won and Roluo was killed.

Hiartuar asked Wigg (Vöggr) if he wanted to fight for him, and Wigg said yes. Hiartuar wanted to give Wigg a sword, but he insisted on receiving it by taking the hilt. Having the hilt in his hand, Wigg pierced Hiartuar with the sword and so avenged Roluo. Swedes and Geats then rushed forward and killed Wigg. The Swedish king Høtherus (based on the god [[Höðr]]), the brother of Athislus, succeeded Roluo and became the king of a combined Sweden and Denmark.

==''Chronicon Lethrense'' and ''Annales Lundenses''==
The ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'' (and the included ''Annales Lundenses'') tell that Rolf Krage's  sister '''Skulda''' was married against Rolf's will to Hartwar/Hiarwarth&lt;ref&gt;''Hartwar'' according to the ''Chronicon Lethrense'', but ''Hiarwarth'' according to the ''Annales Lundenses''.&lt;/ref&gt; (Heoroweard), a German earl of [[Skåne]], but reputedly Rolf had given Skulda to him together with Sweden.

Hjartwar arrived in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] with a large army and said that he wanted to give his tribute to Rolf, but killed the sleeping Rolf together with all his berserkers after these intoxicated themselves at a banquet Rolf had given in honor of his sister's arrival. Only one survived, Wigge (Vöggr), who played along until he was to do homage to Hjartwar. Then, he pierced Hartwar with a sword, and so Hjartwar was only king one morning. However, according to a reputation, it was instead an [[Åke]] who killed Hjartwar with seven dagger-stabs and so became king.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Christian Sinding, ''History of Scandinavia'', 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra''' ('''SJMO''') is the national [[jazz orchestra]] of the United States. It is based at the [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where it is the orchestra-in-residence. The SJMO was founded in 1990 with the dual mission of  performing and preserving American jazz masterworks and raising public awareness and understanding of the genre.&lt;ref name = "Herzig" /&gt;

==History==
An [[Act of Congress]] established the orchestra in 1990 with an appropriation to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] of $242,000. In 1991 [[Gunther Schuller]] and [[David Baker (composer)|David Baker]] became the original artistic and musical directors of the orchestra, which began performing in 1991. Five years later Baker became its sole artistic and musical director.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fox, Margalit| title =David Baker, Who Helped Bring Jazz Studies Into the Academy, Dies at 84 | journal =[[The New York Times]] | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location =New York, New York | date =March 29, 2016| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/arts/music/david-baker-who-helped-bring-jazz-studies-into-the-academy-dies-at-84.html | accessdate =June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mansky&gt;{{cite web| author= Mansky, Jackie| title = Jazz Legend David Baker's Soaring Legacy | work = | publisher =Smithsonian Institution | date =March 28, 2016 | url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/jazz-legend-david-bakers-soaring-legacy-180958584/ | format = | accessdate =July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The inaugural season, jointly conducted by Schuller and Baker, consisted of six weekends of free concerts for which the conductors collected or commissioned transcriptions of the original arrangements of the works to be presented and provided the orchestra's members with tapes of the original performances.&lt;ref name = "Martin"&gt;{{cite book | author=Martin, Henry, and Keith Waters | title =Essential Jazz | publisher =Cengage Learning | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2013 | location = | page=217 | url =https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qVoWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT243 | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kirchner"&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirchner, Bill | title =The Oxford Companion to Jazz | publisher =Oxford University Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2005 | location = | page=518 | url =https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dIyO-dQwkDwC&amp;pg=PA518 | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Broder, David| title =Smithsonian Jazz Orchestra Keeps Music Of Masters Alive | journal =[[Spokane Chronicle]] | volume = | issue = | page=B7 | publisher = | location =Spokane, Washington | date =August 28, 1991| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1345&amp;dat=19910828&amp;id=K1pYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DvoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4162,3841129&amp;hl=en| accessdate =April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991 the SJMO has performed in nine foreign countries and twenty-six U.S. states, in addition to numerous free concerts in Washington, D.C. Appearances outside their base at the National Museum of American History have included a performance at the [[White House]] in 1993 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]; the Cultural Olympiad at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta, Georgia; and a 1999 tour of the United States to present concerts in tribute to the 100th anniversary of [[Duke Ellington]]'s birth that included a concert performance at the [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] featuring Ellington's ''Suite Thursday'', which was commissioned for the festival.&lt;ref name = "Herzig"&gt;{{cite book| author=Herzig, Monika, and Nathan Davis| title =David Baker: A Legacy in Music |year=2011 |location=Bloomington |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z9lv_LV-La4C&amp;pg=PA281 |page=281 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=9780253356574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Stevens" /&gt; Among the orchestra's notable performances under Baker's leadership outside the United States was a concert in [[Egypt]] in 2008, when it played at the [[Cairo Opera House]], the Alexandra Opera House, and at the [[Giza pyramid complex|Pyramids]].&lt;ref name=Mansky/&gt;

==Early life==
Sun Myung Moon was born Moon Yong Myeong on 25 February 1920, in modern-day [[North Pyongan|North P'yŏng'an]] [[Provinces of Korea|Province]], North Korea, at a time when [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea was under Japanese rule]]. He was the younger of two sons in a farming family of eight children.&lt;ref name="WP Obit" /&gt;  Moon's family followed [[Confucianist]] beliefs until he was around 10 years old, when they converted to [[Christianity]] and joined the [[Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref name="massmarr"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1997/unification_church/34821.stm Unification Church: Mass Moonie Marriage in the US], BBC News, Saturday, 29 November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Moon began studying [[electrical engineering]] at [[Waseda University]] in Japan.&lt;ref name=Businessweek /&gt; During this time he cooperated with [[Communist Party]] members in the [[Korean independence movement]] against [[Imperial Japan]].&lt;ref name="moon"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Moon |  first=Sun Myung  | title =As a Peace-Loving Global Citizen | publisher =Gimm-Young Publishers  | year =2009  | isbn = 0-7166-0299-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he returned to Seoul and married [[Sun Kil Choi]] on 28 April 1945. On 2 April 1946 their son, [[Sung Jin Moon]] was born.&lt;ref name="NYT OBIT" /&gt;  In the 1940s, Moon attended a church in Sangdo [[Dong (administrative division)|dong]] that was led by the messianic minister Baek Moon Kim, who claimed that he had been given by Jesus the mission to spread the message of a "new Israel" throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breen|first1=Michael|title=Sun Myung Moon: the early years 1920-53|date=1997|publisher=Refuge Books|location=Hurstpierpoint West Sussex, U.K.|isbn=978-0953163700|pages=69, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time Moon changed his given name to Sun Myung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breen|first1=Michael|title=Sun Myung Moon: the early years 1920–53|date=1997|publisher=Refuge Books|location=Hurstpierpoint West Sussex, U.K.|isbn=978-0953163700|pages=69, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding the Unification movement==
Moon emerged from his years in the labor camp as a staunch anti-communist.&lt;ref name="WP Obit" /&gt; His teachings viewed the [[Cold War]]  between democracy and communism as the final conflict between [[God]] and [[Satan]], with divided Korea as its primary [[front line]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christianity: A Global History'', David Chidester, HarperCollins, 2001, {{ISBN|0062517708}}, 9780062517708, pages 514 to 515&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1954, Moon formally founded the [[Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity]] in Seoul. He quickly drew young acolytes who helped to build the foundations of [[List of Unification Church affiliated organizations|church affiliated business and cultural organizations]].&lt;ref name="WP Obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=NBC News staff and news services|title=Sun Myung Moon, founder of Unification Church, dies at 92|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/02/13622427-sun-myung-moon-founder-of-unification-church-dies-at-92?lite|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=WORLDNEWS on NBC NEWS|date=2 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606202931/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/02/13622427-sun-myung-moon-founder-of-unification-church-dies-at-92?lite|archivedate=6 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At his new church, he preached a conservative, family-oriented value system and his interpretation of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=usatoday2012-09-02a /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC Obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unification Church founder Rev.

Moon has said that when he was fifteen years old Jesus anointed him to carry out his unfinished work by becoming parent to all of humanity.&lt;ref name="NPR Obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN OBIT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTOBIOGRAPHY"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moon|first=Reverend Sun Myung|title=As a peace-loving global citizen|year=2010|publisher=Washington Times Foundation|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0615393772|edition=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Divine Principle'' or ''Exposition of the Divine Principle'' (Korean 원리강론/原理講論, translit. ''wonli ganglon'') is the main [[theology|theological]] textbook of the Unification movement. It was co-written by Moon and early disciple [[Hyo Won Eu]] and first published in 1966. A translation entitled ''Divine Principle'' was published in English in 1973. The book lays out the core of Unification theology, and is held to have the status of [[Holy Scripture|scripture]] by believers. Following the format of systematic theology, it includes (1) God's purpose in creating human beings, (2) the fall of man, and (3) restoration – the process through history by which God is working to remove the ill effects of the fall and restore humanity back to the relationship and position that God originally intended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jul1978/v35-2-article3.htm Korean Moon: Waxing of Waning?], Leo Sandon Jr., ''Theology Today'', Vol 35, No 2, July 1978, "The movement's official doctrinal statement, and a part of the revelation, is the Divine Principle. Both an oral tradition and a written one and published in several versions, Divine Principle is the Completed Testament. The Rev. Moon claims to have come not to destroy or abrogate the Old and New Testaments, but to fulfill them-to "complete" them. To his Moonist followers, the Rev. Moon is primarily "true father," probably the Messiah, and only secondarily a theologian. In an effort to systematize Moon's teachings, several members of the Unification Church in Korea have put together a developing theological system in Divine Principle which is impressive in its imaginative nature, coherence, and consistency, if not in its Christian orthodoxy. As the most complete expression of Moonist teachings to date, Divine Principle is the basic text of the Unification Church. The two major divisions of the system are the doctrines of Creation and Restoration. There are many subsets to these major divisions, but Creation and Restoration are the foci for the Moonist theological system."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[God]] is viewed as the creator, whose nature combines both masculinity and femininity, and is the source of all truth, beauty, and goodness. Human beings and the universe reflect God's personality, nature, and purpose.&lt;ref name="Sontag102"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Sontag  | first =Fredrick   | title =Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church  | publisher =Abingdon  | year =1977  | page =102 | isbn =0-687-40622-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Give-and-take action" (reciprocal interaction) and "subject and object position" (initiator and responder) are "key interpretive concepts",&lt;ref name="Sontag107"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Sontag  | first =Fredrick   | title =Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church  | publisher =Abingdon  | year =1977  | page =107 | isbn =0-687-40622-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the self is designed to be God's object.&lt;ref name=Sontag107 /&gt; The purpose of human existence is to return joy to God.

==Second marriage and blessing ceremonies==

===Marriage to Hak Ja Han===
Moon married his second wife, [[Hak Ja Han]], on 11 April 1960, soon after he turned 40 years old, in a ceremony called the Holy Marriage.  Han is called "Mother" or "True Mother". She and Moon together are referred to as the "True Parents" by members of the Unification Church and their family as the "True Family".&lt;ref name="Chryssides2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/sunmyungmoon98/SM980914-NewYorker.htm Moon At Twilight: Amid scandal, the Unification Church has a strange new mission], [[Peter Maass]] ''[[New Yorker Magazine]]'', 14 September 1998.

Blessing ceremonies have attracted a lot of attention in the press and in the public imagination, often being labeled "mass weddings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/chi-0604sushi-1-sidebar,0,6972307.htmlstory Despite controversy, Moon and his church moving into mainstream] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725201717/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/chi-0604sushi-1-sidebar,0,6972307.htmlstory |date=25 July 2008 }} [[Chicago Tribune]], 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some couples are already married and those that are engaged are later legally married according to the laws of their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/wedd97.htm At RFK, Moon Presides Over Mass Wedding], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 3 November 1997, "Church and stadium officials estimated that more than 40,000 people, mostly couples, attended the event, including the Moon-matched couples who took their marriage vows on the football field and exchanged gold rings displaying the church symbol.

Moon said that he matched couples from differing races and nationalities because of his belief that all of humanity should be united: "International and intercultural marriages are the quickest way to bring about an ideal world of peace. People should marry across national and cultural boundaries with people from countries they consider to be their enemies so that the world of peace can come that much more quickly."&lt;ref name=usatoday2012-09-02a /&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianObit /&gt;&lt;ref name=AUTOBIOGRAPHY /&gt;

==Move to United States==

In 1971, Moon moved to the United States, which he had first visited in 1965. He remained a citizen of the [[Republic of Korea]] and maintained a residence in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tparents.org/Library/Moon/Photos/Mph-1954/TF-1965.jpg| title=Image of Moon's arrival| accessdate=29 April 2006| format=JPG}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Moon founded the [[International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences]], a series of scientific conferences.&lt;ref name="excerpt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=crimson&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=270162 Kety Quits Moon-Linked ICF Conference] [[Harvard Crimson]], 10 August 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The first conference had 20 participants, while the largest conference in Seoul in 1982, had 808 participants from over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icus.org/index.php?cat=info&amp;top=purpose|title=ICUS|website=www.icus.org|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/image.htm Church Spends Millions On Its Image] ''[[The Washington Post]]''. 17 September 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants  included [[Nobel laureate]]s [[John Carew Eccles|John Eccles]] (Physiology or Medicine 1963, who chaired the 1976 conference)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/8/10/kety-quits-moon-linked-icf-conference-pa/|title=Kety Quits Moon-Linked ICF Conference - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Moon asked church members in the United States to support President [[Richard Nixon]] during the [[Watergate scandal]] when Nixon was being pressured to resign his office.  Church members prayed and fasted in support of Nixon for three days in front of the [[United States Capitol]], under the motto: "Forgive, Love and Unite." On 1 February 1974 Nixon publicly thanked them for their support and officially received Moon. This brought the church into widespread public and media attention.&lt;ref name="Introvigne, Massimo 2000, page 16"/&gt;

In the 1970s, Moon, who had seldom before spoken to the general public, gave a series of public speeches to audiences in the United States, [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]]. The largest were a rally in 1975 against North Korean aggression in Seoul and a speech at an event organized by the Unification Church in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington 1976"/&gt;

===''United States v. Sun Myung Moon''===
{{main|United States v. Sun Myung Moon}}
   
In 1982, Moon was convicted in the United States of filing false federal [[income tax]] returns and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]. His conviction was upheld on appeal in a split decision. Moon was given an 18-month sentence and a $15,000 fine. He served 13 months of the sentence at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury]] before being released on good behavior to a [[halfway house]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/profit.htm Moon's Japanese Profits Bolster Efforts in U.S.], Washington ''Post'', 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Washington Times}}

In 1982 ''[[The Washington Times]]'' was founded  by [[News World Communications]], an international media conglomerate associated with Moon which also owned newspapers in [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[South America]], as well as the [[news agency]] [[United Press International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/us/around-the-nation-sun-myung-moon-paper-appears-in-washington.html | title = Sun Myung Moon Paper Appears in Washington | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 18 May 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political views of ''The Washington Times'' have often been described as [[conservative]].&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite news| last =Hall| first =Mimi| title =Bush, aides boost access of conservative media| work =USA Today| date =22 March 2001| url =https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-03-22-media.htm#more| accessdate =25 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glaberson"&gt;{{cite news| last =Glaberson| first =William| title =The Media Business; Conservative Daily Tries to Expand National Niche| work =The New York Times| date =27 June 1994| url =https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/27/business/the-media-business-conservative-daily-tries-to-expand-national-niche.html| accessdate =25 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ojr.org"&gt;[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/people/nikkiusher/200812/1604/ New business models for news are not that new], Nikki Usher, Knight Digital Media Center, 2008-12-17, "And the Washington Times' conservative stance pursues its agenda from the Rev.

That kind of political access has given The Times, after nearly a decade of publication, its own genuine, if limited, place in the capital's rich media mix.  "It's the other half of the political picture, and without it I found I would be missing a lot of what was going on in conservative thinking," said Stephen G. Smith, news editor of the Knight-Ridder Newspapers bureau here. "While its circulation is small, its influence is out-sized."   But The Washington Times has always been and remains a very expensive and unsuccessful business, losing an estimated $35 million a year.  Part of The Times's problem is being the city's second-ranked daily newspaper during a deep advertising recession. The market is dominated in circulation and advertising by The Times's more liberal archrival, The Washington Post.  Almost since it was started in 1982, The Times has seen its average weekday circulation hover at about 100,000, compared with nearly 800,000 for The Post. And The Times estimates that about two-thirds of its subscribers also take The Post.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =As the Rev.

==Activities and interests==

===Politics===
In 1964 Moon founded the [[Korean Culture and Freedom Foundation]], which promoted the interests of South Korea and sponsored Radio Free Asia.  Former [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] [[Harry S Truman]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Richard Nixon]] were honorary presidents or directors at various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korean denies influence peddling|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19761102&amp;id=y6kzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yjgHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3422,903462|publisher=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Moon predicted the decline of [[communism]], based on the teachings of the ''Divine Principle'': "After 7,000 biblical years — 6,000 years of restoration history plus the millennium, the time of completion — communism will fall in its 70th year. Here is the meaning of the year 1978. Communism, begun in 1917, could maintain itself approximately 60 years and reach its peak. So 1978 is the border line and afterward communism will decline; in the 70th year it will be altogether ruined. This is true. Therefore, now is the time for people who are studying communism to abandon it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Books/sm-gww/GWW-07.htm The Way of Restoration], (April, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has contributed $500,000 to finance an anticommunist lobbying campaign headed by John T. (Terry) Dolan, chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC)."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, it produced the anti-communist documentary film ''[[Nicaragua Was Our Home]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1555 Public TV Tilts Toward Conservatives], [[Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting]] "While conservatives dismiss Bill Moyers' world-class documentaries on our constitutional checks and balances as "propaganda," they never mention PBS's airing of unabashed right-wing agitprop films such as Nicaragua Was Our Home (the pro-contra film produced by Rev.

In August 1985, seven years before the [[fall of Soviet Union]], the [[Professors World Peace Academy]], an organization founded by Moon, sponsored a conference in [[Geneva]] to debate the theme "The situation in the world after the fall of the communist empire."&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-14440148/Projections-about-a-post-Soviet.html Projections about a post-Soviet world-twenty-five years later.] // Goliath Business News&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1990, Moon visited the [[Soviet Union]] and met with President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

It owns [[United Press International]], ''The World and I'', ''Tiempos del Mundo'' (Latin America), ''The Segye Ilbo'' (South Korea), ''The Sekai Nippo'' (Japan), the ''Zambezi Times'' (South Africa), and ''The Middle East Times'' (Egypt).&lt;ref name="Yahoo!

On 2 November 2010, Sun Myung Moon and a group of former ''Times'' editors purchased the ''Times'' from News World.&lt;ref name="Shapira C1" /&gt;

In 1982, Moon sponsored the film ''[[Inchon (film)|Inchon]]'', an [[historical drama]] about the [[Battle of Inchon]] during the [[Korean War]]. It was not successful critically or financially, and was criticized for its unfair treatment of the North Korean government.&lt;ref name="kempley"&gt;{{cite news | last =Kempley | first =Rita | title =Mooning Over MacArthur  | work =The Washington Post | page =Weekend At The Movies; Pg. 13  | date =17 September 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race relations===

Moon took a strong stance against [[racism]] and [[racial discrimination]]. In 1974 he urged Unification Church members to support an African American president of the United States:  "We have had enough of white presidents. So, let's this time elect a president from the Negro race. What will you do if I say so? There's no question there. We must never forget that we are brothers and sisters in a huge human family. In any level of community, we must become like a family."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/SunMyungMoon75/SunMyungMoon-750323.htm Restoration Through Indemnity And America's Role] 1974-03-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 he said that he himself was a victim of racial prejudice in the United States (concerning his prosecution on tax charges in [[United States v. Sun Myung Moon]]),  saying:  "I would not be standing here today if my skin were white or my religion were [[w:Presbyterian|Presbyterian]]. I am here today only because my skin is yellow and my religion is Unification Church. The ugliest things in this beautiful country of America are religious bigotry and racism."&lt;ref&gt;On the tax charges against him, in a speech at Foley Square in New York City (22 October 1981); published in a full page advertisement in ''The New York Times'' (5 November 1981), as quoted in US Court of Appeals document [[s:U.S. v. Sun Myung Moon 718 F.2d 1210 (1983)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several African American organizations and individuals spoke out in defense of Moon at this time including the [[National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus]], the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], the [[National Conference of Black Mayors]],&lt;ref&gt;Raspberry, William, "Did Unpopular Moonie Get a Fair Trial?", ''[[Washington Post]]'',  19 April 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Lowery]] who was then the head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.&lt;ref name="signaturebooks.com"/&gt;
 
In a later controversy over the use of the word [[Moonie (nickname)|"Moonie"]] by the American news media, which was said to be offensive, Moon's position was supported by  civil rights activists [[Ralph Abernathy]]&lt;ref name="gorenfeld"&gt;{{cite book | last =Gorenfeld | first =John | title =Bad Moon Rising | publisher =PoliPointPress | year =2008 | page =96 | isbn =0-9794822-3-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leigh"&gt;{{cite news | last =Leigh | first =Andrew | title =Inside Moon's Washington – The private side of public relations improving the image, looking for clout | work =[[The Washington Post]] | page =B1 | publisher =[[The Washington Post Company]] | date =15 October 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="funnels"&gt;{{cite news | last=[[Knight-Ridder Newspapers]] | title =Unification Church funnels millions to U.S. conservatives | work =[[The Dallas Morning News]] | page =4A | publisher =The Dallas Morning News Company | date =20 December 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and  [[James Bevel]].&lt;ref name="hatch"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Hatch | first = Walter | title = Big names lend luster to group's causes – Church leader gains legitimacy among U.S. conservatives | newspaper = [[The Seattle Times]] | page = A1 | publisher = Seattle Times Company | date = 13 February 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Moon and [[The Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]] got together to sponsor the [[Million Family March]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/16/us/families-arrive-in-washington-for-march-called-by-farrakhan.html Families Arrive in Washington For March Called by Farrakhan], ''[[New York Times]]'', 16 October 2000&lt;/ref&gt; a rally in [[Washington D.C.]] to celebrate family unity and racial and religious harmony; as well as to address other issues, including abortion, capital punishment, health care, education, welfare and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] reform, substance abuse prevention, and overhaul of the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/10/16/million.family.march.02/index.html Million Family March reaches out to all] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528195304/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/10/16/million.family.march.02/index.html |date=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his keynote speech Farrakhan called for racial harmony.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |  title =Nation Of Islam – who are they? | work =[[BBC]] | date =21 July 2001 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1466283.stm | accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance===

In 1962, Moon and other church members founded the [[Little Angels Children’s Folk Ballet of Korea]], a children's dance troop which presents traditional [[Korean dance|Korean folk dances]]. He said that this was to project a positive image of [[South Korea]] to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sewell  |first=Rhonda B. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vWRPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KwQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3834,3951179&amp;dq=korean-culture-takes-the-stage&amp;hl=en |title =Korean Culture Takes the Stage |work=[[The Blade (Toledo)|The Blade]] |page=D11 |date=28 February 2003 |quote=The colors, sounds, and heritage of South Korea will come alive tonight as the Little Angels, an all-girls Korean folk ballet company, performs in the Ritz Theatre in Tiffin...

In 2004, at event in the [[Dirksen Senate Office Building]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], Moon was honored as the [[Messiah]].

Several months after his death, an award named after him and his wife ([[Sunhak Peace Prize]]) was proposed, inheriting his will to "recognize and empower innovations in human development, conflict resolution and ecological conservation."

==Criticisms==

Moon's claim to be the [[Messiah]] and the [[Second Coming of Christ]] has been disputed by both Christian and Jewish scholars.&lt;ref name="Dialogue with the Moonies"&gt;Rodney Sawatsky, 1978, [http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/apr1978/v35-1-criticscorner3.htm Dialogue with the Moonies] ''Theology Today.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913685-2,00.html Mad About Moon], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 10 November 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Divine Principle''  was labeled as [[Heresy|heretical]] by Protestant churches in South Korea, including Moon’s own [[Presbyterian Church]]. In the United States it was rejected by ecumenical organizations as being non-Christian.&lt;ref name="Chryssides2003"&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2003/vil2003_chryssides.htm Unifying or Dividing? Sun Myung Moon and the Origins of the Unification Church] George D. Chryssides, University of Wolverhampton, U.K. 2003, Since doctrine looms large in Christian thought, it is understandable that its objections to Unificationism are principally on doctrinal grounds.  Although the Christian counter-cult literature does not always expound Unification teachings fairly, it is almost unanimous in identifying the respects in which Unificationism diverges from mainstream Christianity: it is unbiblical; teaches erroneous doctrines of God, Christ and salvation; Divine Principle usurps the status of the Judaeo-Christian Bible; it teaches that Jesus did not fully accomplish his mission and that a new messiah is needed to complete it; it introduces new rituals and forms of worship; and it is spiritist.  As new religions progress, they occasionally gain acceptance into the mainstream fold, as happened with Seventh-day Adventism, and, even more strikingly, with the Worldwide Church of God. At the turn of the 21st century, however, Unificationism seems no more likely to gain recognition by mainstream Christians.&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant commentators have also criticized Unification Church teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of [[Sola fide|salvation by faith alone]].&lt;ref name="Daske, D 2005, p142"&gt;Daske, D. and Ashcraft, W. 2005, ''New Religious Movements'', New York: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-0702-5}} p142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamamoto, J 1995, p40"&gt;Yamamoto, J. 1995, ''Unification Church'', Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Press, {{ISBN|0-310-70381-6}}  p40&lt;/ref&gt;   In their influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (first published in 1965), [[Walter Ralston Martin]] and [[Ravi K.

In the 1990s when Moon began to offer the Unification Church marriage blessing ceremony to members of other churches and religions he was criticized for creating possible confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signaturebooks.com/excerpts/unification.htm excerpt] The Unification Church Studies in Contemporary Religion, Massimo Introvigne, 2000, Signature Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, {{ISBN|1-56085-145-7}} "From a different perspective, it is true that participation of people who are not members of the Unification Church in certain Unificationist activities, such as marriage blessings, may be of concern to established churches.  They perceive the possibility that their own members may become confused by their participation in such Unificationist activities and fear that they may in fact end up converting to Unificationism." -p 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, journalist [[Peter Maass]] reported that some Unification Church members were dismayed and grumbled when Moon extended the Blessing to non-members because they had not gone through the same course that members had.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petermaass.com/core.cfm?p=1&amp;mag=48&amp;magtype=1 Moon at Twilight], [[Peter Maass]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'' "The campaign has dismayed some church members, because a blessing from Moon used to be a hard-won privilege, typically attained only after a person had joined the church, worked in it for several years, and agreed to marry someone--usually a stranger--selected by Moon. But grumblings about the blessing campaign are just the beginning of Moon's current troubles."&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, the Unification Church came into conflict with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] when Catholic archbishop [[Emmanuel Milingo]] and Maria Sung, a 43-year-old [[Korea]]n acupuncturist, married in a Unification Church Blessing ceremony, presided over by Rev. and Mrs. Moon.

''The New Republic'' also criticized the relationship between the [[Unification Church and Islam]], especially following the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] in New York City; as well as the relationship between Moon and his family and the family of then [[United States Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]].&lt;ref name="https"/&gt;

==Views on the role of Moon to church members==

The ''[[Divine Principle]]'' itself says about Moon: "With the fullness of time, God has sent one person to this earth to resolve the fundamental problems of human life and the universe. His name is Sun Myung Moon. For several decades he wandered through the spirit world so vast as to be beyond imagining. He trod a bloody path of suffering in search of the truth, passing through tribulations that God alone remembers. Since he understood that no one can find the ultimate truth to save humanity without first passing through the bitterest of trials, he fought alone against millions of devils, both in the spiritual and physical worlds, and triumphed over them all. Through intimate spiritual communion with God and by meeting with Jesus and many saints in Paradise, he brought to light all the secrets of Heaven."&lt;ref&gt;[[Divine Principle]] (translated 1966), [http://www.unification.org/ucbooks/expodp/DivinePrinciple-intro.html Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628141405/http://www.unification.org/ucbooks/expodp/DivinePrinciple-intro.html |date=28 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Rodney Sawatsky wrote in an article in ''Theology Today'': "Why trust Rev. Moon's dreams and visions of the new age and his role in it, we ask? Most converts actually have had minimal contact with him. Frederick Sontag (Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church, Abingdon, 1977) in his interviews with Moon appears to have found a pleasant but not an overwhelming personality. Charisma, as traditionally understood, seems hardly applicable here. Rather, Moon provides a model. He suffered valiantly, he knows confidently, he prays assuredly, he lives lovingly, say his followers. The Divine Principle is not an unrealizable ideal; it is incarnate in a man, it lives, it is imitable. His truth is experienced to be their truth. His explanation of the universe becomes their understanding of themselves and the world in which they live."&lt;ref name="Dialogue with the Moonies"/&gt;

In 1980 [[sociologist]] [[Irving Louis Horowitz]] commented: "The Reverend Moon is a fundamentalist with a vengeance. He has a belief system that admits of no boundaries or limits, an all-embracing truth. His writings exhibit a holistic concern for the person, society, nature, and all things embraced by the human vision. In this sense the concept underwriting the Unification church is apt, for its primary drive and appeal is unity, urging a paradigm of essence in an overly complicated world of existence. It is a ready-made doctrine for impatient young people and all those for whom the pursuit of the complex has become a tiresome and fruitless venture."&lt;ref&gt;Irving Louis Horowitz, [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6720&amp;mode=toc Science, Sin, and Society: The Politics or Reverend Moon and the Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211142618/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6720&amp;mode=toc |date=11 December 2008 }}, 1980, MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 [[investigative journalist]] [[Peter Maass]] wrote in an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'': "There are, certainly, differing degrees of devotion among Moon's followers; the fact that they bow at the right moment or shout ''Mansei!'' in unison doesn't mean they believe everything Moon says, or do precisely what he commands. Even on important issues, like Moon's claiming to be the messiah, there are church members whom I met, including a close aide to Moon, who demur. A religious leader whom they respect and whose theology they believe, yes; the messiah, perhaps not."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Maass]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20010411094005/http://www.petermaass.com/core.cfm?p=1&amp;mag=48&amp;magtype=1 Moon at Twilight], ''The New Yorker'' 14 September 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 book ''The New Religious Movement Experience in America'' [[Eugene V. Gallagher]] wrote: "The ''Divine Principle's'' analysis of the Fall sets the stage for the mission of Rev. Moon, who in the last days brings a revelation that offers humankind the chance to return to an Edenic state. The account in the ''Divine Principle'' offers Unificationists a comprehensive context for understanding human [[suffering]]."&lt;ref name = gallagher2004&gt;Eugene V.

TIMIT was designed to further acoustic-phonetic knowledge and automatic speech recognition systems.  It was commissioned by [[DARPA]] and corpus design was a joint effort between the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[SRI International]], and [[Texas Instruments]] (TI). The speech was recorded at TI, transcribed at MIT, and verified and prepared for publishing by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).&lt;ref&gt;

'''''The Whole Beast: Nose to Tail Eating''''' is a [[2004 in literature|2004 book]] by [[Fergus Henderson]] that deals with how to cook every part of a [[pig]], including parts rarely used in [[American cuisine]], such as [[offal]]. It was originally released as '''''Nose to Tail Eating: A Kind of British Cooking''''' in England in 1999, but was updated and revamped to be more comprehensive for the American edition,&lt;ref name="Lunch"&gt;{{cite news |title=For a Genius of the Off-Cut, Lunch Time Is the Right Time |author=Amanda Hesser |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/15/dining/for-a-genius-of-the-off-cut-lunch-time-is-the-right-time.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 October 2003 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also re-released in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Donna Lee Brien |date=October 2010 |title="Porky Times": A Brief Gastrobiography of New York’s The Spotted Pig |journal=The Australian Journal of Media &amp; Culture |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewArticle/290 |accessdate=18 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated release featured a [[foreword]] written by [[Anthony Bourdain]], author of ''[[Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly|Kitchen Confidential]]''.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Swine of the times |author=Ian Douglas |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3315464/Swine-of-the-times.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=25 October 2004 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' has described the book as the "'Ulysses' of the whole [[Slow Food]] movement" because of its international readership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Cooks |author= |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4971342/TWO-COOKS-Fergus-Henderson-Alain.html |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |date=5 September 2005 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[New York Magazine]]'' considered it to be a "cult cookbook".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Thin Line between Yum and Yuck |author=Daniel Maurer |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/food/features/11956/ |newspaper=[[New York Magazine]] |date=21 May 2005 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, ''The Whole Beast'' was given the [[André Simon Award]] for gastronomic literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Don't Try This at Home: Culinary Catastrophes from the World's Greatest Chefs |last=Witherspoon |first=Kimberly |authorlink= |author2=Friedman, Andrew  |year=2007 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |location= |isbn= |page=154 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utanWjNMqyAC&amp;pg=PA154 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The book features a number of recipes that, in total, utilize every part of the pig. In addition, it features a number of "techniques for brining, salting, pickling and preserving in fat", including explanations on how to "clear stock with egg whites and shells, how to bone out a trotter and how to bake bread using a tiny quantity of yeast for tastier results."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; It also includes descriptions on methods of "making stocks and the old-fashioned skill of rendering".&lt;ref name="Taste"&gt;{{cite news |title=All in the best possible taste (mostly) |author=Aileen Reid |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3632835/All-in-the-best-possible-taste-mostly.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 December 2004 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also includes a few black and white photos that serve as decoration and example for the dishes and pieces of meat involved and discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Isabelle de Solier |title=Cookery Books as History: Australian and New Zealand Approaches |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=[[The University of Adelaide]] |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=https://scholar.google.com/ |accessdate=18 June 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131002221/http://scholar.google.com/ |archivedate=31 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous quote from the book, and personal slogan of Henderson that is often cited by newspapers and used by master chefs reads, "''If you're going to kill the animal it seems only polite to use the whole thing.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Words to Eat By: Five Foods and the Culinary History of the English Language |last=Lipkowitz |first=Ina |authorlink= |year=2011 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location= |isbn= |page=204 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5Q9Zklcl_kC&amp;pg=PA204 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[Amanda Hesser]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' said that Henderson has "a lovely writing voice, as well, so the text, largely recipes, has a rare lyrical charm. An ingredient might be 'a large knob of butter' or 'a good supply of toast.'"&lt;ref name="Lunch"/&gt; Kurt Timmermeister, author of ''Growing a Farmer: How I Learned to Live Off the Land'', stated that the book "has a style...that I love: clean, crisp and confident with a touch of humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Growing a Farmer: How I Learned to Live Off the Land |last=Timmermeister |first=Kurt |authorlink= |year=2011 |publisher=[[W.

You can almost see and hear his curvaceous smile, joyful [[wikt:semaphore|semaphore]] and barks of 'Ah ha!'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buying the book of the meal |author=Fay Maschler |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/restaurants/review-473128-buying-the-book-of-the-meal.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120914001732/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/restaurants/review-473128-buying-the-book-of-the-meal.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 September 2012 |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=1 June 1999 |accessdate=18 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Jonathan Reynolds of the ''[[New York Times]]'' praised Henderson's use of various, generally undesirable parts of the pig and pointed out that the book was "filled with sly observations and unpredictable advice about ingredients other than offal" as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FOOD; Sexy Beast |author=Jonathan Reynolds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/magazine/food-sexy-beast.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 June 2004 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also for the ''New York Times'', Dwight Garner called the book a "terrifically dour, Edward Gorey-ish guide to cooking with offal: everything from pig's trotters and lamb's kidneys to brains, tripe, spleen, heart and tongue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cooking |author=Deight Garner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/books/review/06COOKING.html?ex=1087099200&amp;amp%3Ben=ac371486960e0085&amp;amp%3Bei=5062&amp;amp%3Bpartner=GOOGLE |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 June 2004 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Johnson of ''[[The Journal News]]'' considered first editions of the book to be "collector's items" because of its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Going whole hog |author=Elizabeth Johnson |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/lohud/access/1792111871.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+04%2C+2005&amp;author=Elizabeth+Johnson&amp;pub=The+Journal+News&amp;desc=Going+whole+hog&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=[[The Journal News]] |date=4 May 2005 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Waverman of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' said that its "dry humour and vivid imagery is a refreshing change from traditional recipe writing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comfort food supreme from two seasoned chefs |author=Lucy Waverman |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/recipes/lucy-waverman/article1908716.ece |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aileen Reid of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called it a "surprisingly refined book" that is "beautifully and elegantly written".&lt;ref name="Taste"/&gt; Stephanie Alexander of ''[[The Age]]'' considered it to be an "absolute gem" and a "triumph of book design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A nice bit of tail |author=Stephanie Alexander |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Epicure/A-nice-bit-of-tail/2004/11/29/1101577404601.html |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=30 November 2004 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later for ''The Age'', Necia Wilden wrote that the book was "a sleeper that went from underground classic to foodies' must-have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Getting an earful |author=Necia Wilden |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/epicure/getting-an-earful/2006/11/27/1164476102444.html |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=28 November 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Titus Crow''' is the main character in the eponymous series of [[horror fiction]] books by [[Brian Lumley]]. The books are based on [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]].

==Description==
In a departure from many Cthulhu Mythos stories, Lumley's characters are not helpless victims of unimaginable forces which can drive humans mad by merely manifesting themselves. Instead, Titus Crow, his friend Henri-Laurent de Marigny, and other Lumley characters confront [[Cthulhu]]'s minions in a series of increasingly large-scale encounters, in which humans, although outmatched, try to fight back. In a letter to the journal ''[[Crypt of Cthulhu]]'', Lumley wrote:

:I have trouble relating to people who faint at the hint of a bad smell. A meep or glibber doesn't cut it with me. (I love meeps and glibbers, don't get me wrong, but ''I'' go looking for what made them!) That's the main difference between my stories...and HPL's. My guys fight back. Also, they like to have a laugh along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lumley, "Mail-Call of Cthulhu", ''Black Forbidden Things'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crow has been known to survive any number of encounters with [[monster]]s, although he may not always be able to defeat the creatures. For instance, he may fall unconscious upon running into a monster that kills anything that moves.

In [[The Transition of Titus Crow]] Crow, fleeing from the Hounds of Tindalos, is almost totally destroyed when the Clock crashes. (Pt.4 -Fragments). He is slowly recreated from surviving cells &amp; his memories stored in the Clock, as a cyborg over many decades, by a robot who theorized that robots were originally created by organic beings. As a cyborg he now has powers that can better deal with the monsters of the mythos.

He is described as a man who spends most of his money on [[commodity|commodities]] and keeps the rest of it in the bank. Crow owns several Cthulhu Mythos objects, including the Clock of Dreams. The Clock is a time-space machine in the form of a [[coffin]]-shaped [[clock]]. It was previously owned by [[Randolph Carter]] and by de Marigny's father, and is referred to as "de Marigny's clock" in many of the early short stories.

==Inspiration==
In an interview with Lumley, [[Robert M. Price]] suggests various possible models for Crow, including Miro Hetzel, [[Jack Vance]]'s futuristic detective, [[Doctor Who]], [[Mervyn Peake]]'s [[Titus Groan]], [[August Derleth]]'s [[The Trail of Cthulhu#Laban Shrewsbury|Dr. Laban Shrewsbury]], [[William Hope Hodgson]]'s [[Carnacki]] and [[Seabury Quinn]]'s [[Jules de Grandin]]. Lumley doesn't acknowledge any of these as conscious inspirations, saying that Crow's time-clock (which derives from Lovecraft's "[[Through the Gates of the Silver Key]]") long predates Who; that he's never read Peake's ''[[Gormenghast (novel)|Gormenghast]]'' and that the similarity of names is coincidental; and that he "was never too keen on" Derleth's Shrewsbury. He does admit, however, to having "always had a soft spot" for [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Abraham Van Helsing]].&lt;ref&gt;["An Interview with Brian Lumley"], by Robert M. Price, ''Nightscapes'' No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9833">The '''Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy''' ('''UDRP''') is a process established by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) for the resolution of disputes regarding the registration of internet [[domain names]].  The UDRP currently applies to all [[Generic top-level domain|generic top level domains]] ([[.com]], [[.net]], [[.org]], etc...),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/udrp/ ICANN – Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policies]&lt;/ref&gt; some [[country code top-level domains]], and some older top level domains in specific circumstances.

==Historical background==
When ICANN was first set up, one of the core tasks assigned to it was "The Trademark Dilemma",&lt;ref&gt;See US Government White Paper http://www.icann.org/en/about/agreements/white-paper&lt;/ref&gt; the use of trade marks as domain names without the trademark owner's consent.  By the late 1990s, such use was identified as problematic and likely to lead to consumers being misled.  In the United Kingdom, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] described such domain names as "an instrument of fraud".&lt;ref&gt;British Telecommunications plc v One in a Million Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 903, [[Aldous LJ]] at 920.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of ICANN's first steps was to commission the United Nations [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) to produce a report on the conflict between trademarks and domain names.  Published on 30 April 1999, the WIPO Report&lt;ref&gt;The Management of Internet Names and Addresses: Intellectual Property Issues, 30 April 1999. http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/amc/en/docs/report-final1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; recommended the establishment of a "mandatory administrative procedure concerning abusive registrations", which would allow for a "neutral venue in the context of disputes that are often international in nature."  The procedure was not intended to deal with cases with competing rights, nor would it exclude the jurisdiction of the courts.  It would, however, be mandatory in the sense that "each domain name application would, in the domain name agreement, be required to submit to the procedure if a claim was initiated against it by a third party&lt;ref&gt;See WIPO Mandatory Uniform UDRP Administrative Dispute Procedure. http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/processes/process1/report/finalreport.html#IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The WIPO Report sets out the now familiar three stage test of the UDRP.

Following adoption by ICANN, the UDRP was launched on 1 December 1999, and the first case determined under it by WIPO was ''World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc v. Michael Bosman'', involving the domain name worldwrestlingfederation.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/1999/d1999-0001.html WIPO Domain Name Decision: D1999-0001]. Wipo.int. Retrieved on 2014-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Providers of the UDRP are:

* [http://www.adndrc.org/mten/index.php The Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (ADNDRC)]
* [http://domains.adrforum.com/ National Arbitration Forum (NAF)]
* [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO)
* [http://www.adr.eu/index.php Czech Arbitration Court, Arbitration Center for Internet Disputes]
* [http://acdr.aipmas.org/default.aspx The Arab Center for Dispute Resolution (ACDR)]

===How it is made mandatory===
When a registrant chooses a domain name, the registrant must "represent and warrant", among other things, that registering the name "will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party", and agree to participate in an [[arbitration]]-like proceeding should any third party assert such a claim.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Process==
A complainant in a UDRP proceeding must establish three elements to succeed:

* The domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a  [[trademark]] or [[service mark]] in which the complainant has rights; 
* The registrant does not have any rights or legitimate interests in the domain name; and 
* The domain name has been registered and the domain name is being used in "[[bad faith]]".

In a UDRP proceeding, a panel will consider several non-exclusive factors to assess bad faith, such as:

* Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark;
* Whether the registrant registered the domain name to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, if the domain name owner has engaged in a pattern of such conduct; and 
* Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or 
* Whether by using the domain name, the registrant has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, internet users to the registrant's website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark.

The goal of the UDRP is to create a streamlined process for resolving such disputes. It was envisioned that this process would be quicker and less expensive than a standard legal challenge. The costs to hire a UDRP provider to handle a complaint often start around [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000 to $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = InterNIC &amp;#124; FAQs on the UDRP
 | url = http://www.internic.net/faqs/udrp.html
 | accessdate = 2009-10-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a party loses a UDRP proceeding, in many jurisdictions it may still bring a lawsuit against the domain name registrant under local law.  For example, the administrative panel's UDRP decision can be challenged and overturned in a U.S. court of law by means of e.g. the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]]. If a domain name registrant loses a UDRP proceeding, it must file a lawsuit against the trademark holder within ten days to prevent ICANN from transferring the domain name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybersquatting.com An Informational Website About Cybersquatting Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The UDRP process has already been used in a number of well-known cases, such as [http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2000/d2000-0847.html ''Madonna Ciccone, p/k/a Madonna v. Dan Parisi and "Madonna.com"'']. In this case, the arbitration panel found against the defendant registrant based on all three of the above factors and ordered the domain name turned over to Madonna.

Often there is contention over similar but not identical domain names, in which the offended party files a court action claiming [[trademark]] or [[copyright infringement]]. For example, actor [[Robert De Niro]] has claimed ownership of all domain names incorporating the text "[[Tribeca]]" for domain names with any content related to film festivals. In particular, he has a dispute with the owner of the website http://tribeca.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cinematical.com/2007/01/02/robert-de-niro-raging-bully/ | title = Robert De Niro: Raging Bully? | date = 2 January 2007 | last = Davis | first = Erik | website = Cinematical}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12312006/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm |title=I am Tribeca, De Niro claims |date=31 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403050416/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12312006/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domain name disputes under new gTLDs==
In 2012, ICANN launched a process to create [[.events|new generic top-level domains]]. Over 1,900 applications were made. As part of the expansion of the domain name system, ICANN introduced a number of new brand protection mechanisms.  Opinions differ as to whether or not these new processes will be effective.  Industry commentators predict that the UDRP will continue to be used, and that there will be a "substantial increase in cybersquatting".&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg BNA, Cyberlaw Predictions 2013, http://www.bna.com/cyberlaw-predictions-2013-b17179871639/&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence from previous expansions of the namespace, however, indicates the continued dominance of .com both in size and as the first-choice domain for cybersquatting (based on number of disputes).&lt;ref&gt;"Previous expansions of the namespace have failed to capture the public imagination or to pose a competitive threat to the gorilla in the market, .com.  According to WIPO, of 42,000 UDRP filings to date, 80% were for .com domains, and of the new gTLDs, only .info has attracted any volume of UDRP disputes (3% of cases filed)." http://www.emilytaylor.eu/2013/01/online-brand-protection-what-to-expect.html#.UQqKlL9Wx8E&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vinologue''' is a publisher of an [[enotourism]] [[Guide book|guidebook]] series of the same name.  It was founded by [[Miquel Hudin]] in 2007 with Èlia Varela i Serra as editor and the guides are designed to allow those interested in enotourism to visit "Big Wines from Small Regions" as they focus exclusively on the wines as well as the [[gastronomy]] and local culture of small regions throughout the world.&lt;ref name="tresc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

The first Vinologue Guide was for [[Dalmatia]] in [[Croatia]] and was released in 2008.

==History==
After several trips throughout Europe in the early 2000s the founders discovered that traditional travel guidebooks made little to no mention of the wines or the culture and gastronomy that surrounds it.  In 2007 they started researching a guide for the coastal Dalmatia region in Croatia.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scout" /&gt;  While researching the guide, they found the wines of neighboring [[Herzegovina]] to be of high quality as well and decided to release two guides instead of the original one.&lt;ref name="herzegovina" /&gt;

All of the guides were initially released in the digital [[EPUB]] format.  They slowly added other titles such as [[Stellenbosch]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="ara" /&gt;  It was in 2012 that they released their first official print guide (alongside the digital version) for the [[Empordà]] region of [[Catalonia]] due to demand from the winemakers.&lt;ref name="moments" /&gt;  It was the first English language enotourism guide of its kind in all of [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="ara" /&gt;  This was followed by a guide in print and digital for [[Priorat (DOQ)|DOQ Priorat]] that was released simultaneously in separate English and Catalan editions.  It was the first enotourism guide and first complete guide to the internationally renowned wines of the region.&lt;ref name="directe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="324cat" /&gt;

After the first edition of the Priorat book unexpectedly sold out in 2014, they released a fully revised and much larger second edition in mid-2015.&lt;ref name="diari1" /&gt;

==Methodology==
The guides are different from other travel guidebooks in that in addition to providing travel information, history, and basic language information, they also provide reviews of the wines produced by each winery covered creating a hybrid book that is part travel guide and part wine guide, thus the name, 'vinologue' which is a [[portmanteau]] of 'vino' and 'travelogue'.&lt;ref name="racimo" /&gt;  The guides work to make wine both approachable and affordable for any audience and they purposefully don't award numeric scores to wines given that beyond tasting notes, they believe scores to be highly subjective and personal.&lt;ref name="scout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="priorat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="envinats" /&gt;

Both the print and digital editions of the guides are focused on being "21st century books" with GPS coordinates from wineries, QR Codes, and other digital media integration.&lt;ref name="scout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="secret" /&gt;

Each guide requires a great deal of work by the authors involved as they live in the region for several months while working on the research in order to achieve a full first person point of view.&lt;ref name="directe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="racimo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="envinats" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lo" /&gt;  The guides are written fully independently with the wineries and other businesses mentioned not paying for inclusion and the local governmental bodies not funding publication.&lt;ref name="disclaimer" /&gt;

The comprehensive tasting notes for the wines of the regions and accompanying scores are derived from a panel of professional sommeliers who perform all the tastings fully blind.&lt;ref name="diari1" /&gt;

==Titles==
* Vinologue Dalmatia (2008)
* Vinologue Herzegovina (2008)
* Vinologue Stellenbosch (2011)
* Vinologue Empordà (2012)
* Vinologue Priorat 1st Ed. (2013)
* Vinologue Menorca (2013)
* Vinologue Montsant (2014)
* Vinologue Priorat 2nd Ed. (2015)
* Georgia: A guide to the cradle of wine (2017)

==Awards==
Vinologue Empordà received the Gourmand Award of "Best Enotourism Book" from a United States publisher in 2012.&lt;ref name="gourmand" /&gt;

Vinologue Priorat 1st Edition was a finalist for "Best Wine Book in the World" from the Gourmand Award.&lt;ref name="gourmand2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cookbookfair.com/index.php/gourmand-awards/winners-2014-gg/gourmand-awards-2014-winners-may-20/book/11?page=23 Gourmand Award Winners by Country 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vinologue Priorat 2nd Edition was praised highly in the annual wine book reviews on the website of [[Jancis Robinson]] stating, "Quite simply, every wine region deserves an enotourism guide of this calibre, and every wine traveller wants a wine guide this good." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/book-reviews-2015-spain-and-madeira Jancis Robinson - Book reviews 2015 - Spain and Madeira]&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia: A guide to the cradle of wine was named, "the definitive guide to this unique country's wines" in The Guardian. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/01/the-best-books-on-drink-of-2017 The Guardian - The best books on drink of 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
They were the first to coin the term, '''flying wine''' to describe wines that were made in rented facilities that they winemaker didn't own. These differ from [[Winemaker#Négociant|négociants]] in that the wines are usually side projects of a winemaker at the winery made in their spare time primarily for experimentation as opposed to the négociant which primarily for commercial purposes.  Flying wines are often encountered in Priorat, neighboring [[Montsant DO|DO Montsant]], and other regions where winemaking is the dominant aspect of day-to-day life.&lt;ref name="directe" /&gt;

A '''wind atlas''' contains data on the [[wind speed]] and [[wind direction]] in a region. These data include [[map]]s, but also [[time series]] or [[frequency distribution]]s. A [[meteorology|climatological]] wind atlas covers hourly averages at a standard height (10 meter) over even longer periods (30 years). But depending on the application there are variations in averaging time, height and period.

==Application==
A wind atlas is employed when pre-selecting [[wind farm]] sites. The required data include 10-minute averaged wind at heights between 30 and 100 meter over a 10 to 20-year period.

==Examples==
At least one wind atlas covers the globe, and other wind atlases cover the [[EU12]] countries and the [[Europe]]an offshore regions. Wind atlases have also been compiled for many countries or regions.

[[File:Graunde-abridgement.jpg|thumb|''La Graunde Abridgement'' was a collection of cases compiled out of the '''Year Books''' by Sir [[Anthony Fitzherbert]]; this printed edition appeared in 1577.]]

The '''Year Books''' are the modern English name that is now typically given to the earliest [[law report]]s of England.  Substantial numbers of manuscripts circulated during the later medieval period containing reports of pleas heard before the Common Bench. In the sixteenth century versions of this material appeared in print form. These publications constituted the earliest [[legal precedent]]s of the [[common law]].  They are extant in a continuous series from 1268 to 1535, covering the reigns of King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] to [[Henry VIII]].  The language of the original manuscripts and editions was either [[Latin]] or [[Law French]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 5th Edition. (West, 1979) {{ISBN|0-8299-2045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Maitland and others have considered that the medieval manuscripts were compiled by law students, rather than being officially sanctioned accounts of court proceedings.

The best-known printed version is the so-called "Vulgate" edition, which appeared in a series of volumes between 1678 and 1680, and which became the standard edition consulted by practising [[lawyer]]s.   More recent editions for the use of lawyers and historians have been made by the [[Selden Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/law/seipp/ Legal History: The Year Books] ([[Boston University School of Law]])&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, they have been divided into eleven separate series:

# Maynard's Reports, temp. [[Edward II of England|Edw. II]].; also divers Memoranda of the [[Exchequer]], temp. Edward I.
# Reports in the first ten years of [[Edward III of England|Edw. III]].
# Reports from l7 to 39 Edward III.
# Reports from 40 to 50 Edward III.
# Liber [[Assize|Assisarum]]; or [[Pleas of the Crown]], temp. Edw. III.
# Reports temp. [[Henry IV of England|Hen. IV]]. and [[Henry V of England|Hen. V]].
# Annals, or Reports of [[Henry VI of England|Hen. VI]]. during his reign, v. 1
# Annals, or Reports of Hen. VI. during his reign, v. 2
# Annals of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]].
# Long Quinto; or Reports in 5 Edward IV.
# Cases in the reigns of [[Edward V of England|Edward V]], [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and Henry VIII.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawyerintl.com/modules/dictionary/search.php?q=Year+Book ''Bouvier's Law Dictionary'', 1856]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[abridgement]]s of the Year Books were compiled and circulated by various editors, who sought to excerpt leading cases and categorise them by subject.  The first abridgment was made by [[Nicholas Statham]], [[Baron of the Exchequer]] under [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], in around 1470.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/218/1309.html The Cambridge History of English and American Literature], Volume VIII. The Age of Dryden, chap. XIII: Legal Literature&lt;/ref&gt;

The last year for which a yearbook was printed was 1535.  Thereafter printed law reports became more various.  The earliest such reports are called the [[nominate reports]]; their original publications were named after the court reporter who compiled and edited them.  Sir [[Edward Coke]] was one important early jurist who published a series of court reports during his tenure as [[chief justice]] of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/vlibrary/outlines/uk.html ''UK Case Law Guide''], [[University of Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt;
