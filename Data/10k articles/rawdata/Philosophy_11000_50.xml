'''16th-century philosophy''' is generally regarded as the later part of [[Renaissance philosophy]].

Early 16th-century philosophy is often called the '''High Renaissance''' and is considered to succeed the [[Renaissance philosophy]] era and precede the [[Age of Rationalism]].  Notable philosophers from the time period include [[Desiderius Erasmus]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and [[Michel de Montaigne]].&lt;ref&gt;''Early Modern Philosophy: Essential Readings with Commentary'', edited by [[Aloysius Martinich|A. P. Martinich]], Fritz Allhoff, Anand Jayprakash Vaidya, Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, "General Introduction."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Voyage to Arcturus''''' is a novel by the English writer [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]], first published in 1920. It combines [[fantasy]], philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of [[Value theory|good]] and [[evil]] and their relationship with [[existence]]. Described by critic and philosopher [[Colin Wilson]]  as the "greatest novel of the twentieth century",&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; it was a central influence on [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]'',&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; and through him on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], who said he read the book "with avidity".&lt;ref name=Tolkien/&gt; [[Clive Barker]] called it "a masterpiece" and "an extraordinary work ... quite magnificent."&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;

An interstellar voyage is the framework for a narrative of a journey through fantastic landscapes. The story is set at Tormance, an imaginary planet orbiting [[Arcturus]], which in the novel (but not in reality) is a double star system, consisting of stars Branchspell and Alppain. The lands through which the characters travel represent philosophical systems or states of mind, through which the main character, Maskull, passes on his search for the meaning of life.

The book sold poorly during Lindsay's lifetime, but was republished in 1946 and many times thereafter. It has been translated into at least ten languages. Critics such as the novelist [[Michael Moorcock]] have noted that the book is unusual, but has been highly influential with its qualities of "commitment to the Absolute" and "God-questioning genius".&lt;ref name=Moorcock/&gt;

==Context==

David Lindsay was born in 1876; his father was a Scottish [[Calvinist]] and his mother English. He was brought up in London and [[Jedburgh]] in the Scottish borders. He enjoyed reading novels by [[Walter Scott]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Rider Haggard]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. He learnt German to read the philosophies of [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]]. He served in the army in the [[First World War]], being called up at the age of 38. He married in 1916. After the war ended in 1918, he moved to [[Cornwall]] with his wife to write.&lt;ref name=Biography&gt;{{cite web |title=The Life and Works of David Lindsay |url=http://www.violetapple.org.uk/life/life.php |publisher=VioletApple |accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moorcock/&gt;

===Synopsis===
Maskull, a man longing for adventures, accepts an invitation from Krag, an acquaintance of his friend Nightspore, to travel to Tormance after a seance. The three set off in a crystal ship from an abandoned observatory in Scotland but Maskull awakens to find himself alone on Tormance. In every land he passes through he usually meets only one or two persons; these meetings often (though not always) end in the death of those he meets, either at his own hand or by that of another.  He learns of his own impending death, meets Krag again, and dies shortly after learning that he is in fact Nightspore himself. The book concludes with a final revelation from Krag (who claims to be known on [[Earth]] as "[[Pain]]") to Nightspore about the origin of the [[Universe]]. The author turns out to support a variation of the doctrine of the [[Demiurge]], somewhat similar to that propounded by some [[Gnostics]].

All of the characters and lands are [[Type (metaphysics)|types]] used to convey the author's [[critique]] of several philosophical systems. On Tormance, most such viewpoints or ways of life are accompanied by corresponding new bodily sense organs or modifications of the same, thus each distinct [[Weltanschauung]] landscape has its corresponding [[sensorium]].

===Chapters===

; 1 – The Seance
A [[seance]] is organised in [[Hampstead]] to which Maskull and Nightspore are invited; their late arrival is marked by a [[supernatural]] noise. The [[mediumship|medium]] causes a smiling man to materialise. Krag arrives uninvited, kills the [[Apparitional experience|apparition]] by breaking its neck, and summarily calls Maskull and Nightspore (with whom he was acquainted) out to the street.

; 2 – In the Street 
Krag invites Maskull and Nightspore to come to Tormance, a planet orbiting Arcturus, whence the apparition comes. Maskull initially treats the proposal as a joke, but accepts it when Krag shows him, with a small but strangely heavy and potent lens, that Arcturus consists of two suns. Upon questioning from Nightspore, Krag says that Surtur (unknown to Maskull) has gone ahead and that they must follow him.

; 3 – Starkness 
Maskull and Nightspore arrive on foot (after travelling by train) at the Scottish observatory of Starkness, where Krag was to meet them, only to find the observatory abandoned. Two bottles are found with "Solar back rays" and "Arcturian back rays". The first, when accidentally unfastened, flies back to the sun because of the light rays trapped within.

; 4 – The Voice 
Nightspore leads Maskull to a spot on the shore some miles off, where they listen to The Drum Taps of Sorgie, and tells him that if he hears it again he is to "try always to hear it more and more distinctly." Maskull attempts to climb the observatory tower but is unable to go beyond the first of the seven stories because of the heavy gravity. From the first magnifying window he sees Arcturus again. He hears a voice saying that he is but an instrument and that although he will go on the voyage, only Nightspore will return.

; 5 – The Night of Departure 
Nightspore says the gravity in the tower is Tormance's and that Maskull will find death on Tormance. Krag arrives, enables Maskull and Nightspore to resist Tormance's gravity by spitting on a cut in their arms, and the three climb the tower, whose windows no longer magnify. They depart naked in a 'torpedo of crystal' propelled by Arcturian back rays. During the 19-hour voyage, Maskull sleeps.

; 6 – Joiwind

Maskull awakes alone in a desert on Tormance and finds that he has new organs in his body, such as a [[tentacle]] (known as a magn) stemming from the heart and protuberances on his forehead and neck. A woman comes to him and exchanges blood with him (making it easier for him to live on Tormance, and harder for her), and says: that she is called Joiwind, her husband Panawe, and both live to the North in Poolingdred; that she understands his speech thanks to a forehead organ, the breve, that reads minds; that Surtur is called Shaping, or Crystalman, and created everything (she also implicitly says that he is God); that they do not eat, out of respect for living things, but drink gnawl water; and that the chest tentacle is used to increase love for other creatures. While journeying home they worship Shaping in a shrine, and meet Panawe upon arrival.

; 7 – Panawe
Panawe suggests that Maskull may be "a man [...] who stole something from the Maker of the universe, in order to ennoble his fellow creatures," a reference to the myth of [[Prometheus]]. He says that life on Tormance has many different forms because the planet is still new, that human beings resemble earthlings because "all creatures that resemble Shaping must of necessity resemble one another," and that Alppain is visible only to the North. Panawe tells his story to Maskull; he travelled in the Wombflash forest (from where he saw Swaylone's island), Ifdawn Marest, and Poolingdred.

; 8 – The Lusion Plain
Maskull sets out to further explore Tormance and gets to the Lusion Plain, where he meets a man, named Surtur.

Surtur asserts the beauty of his world, claims Maskull is there to serve him, and disappears. Maskull continues his journey and meets a woman, Oceaxe, from Ifdawn, who instead of a tentacle has a third arm. Although she is peremptory and rude, she shows interest in having him as lover, and gives him a red-glowing stone to convert his magn into a third arm.

; 9 – Oceaxe

When Maskull wakes up he finds his chest tentacle or magn has been transformed into the third arm, which causes lust for what is touched and his breve changed to an eyelike sorb which allows dominance of will over others. He travels through the volatile and [[Nietzschean]] landscape of Ifdawn with Oceaxe, who wants him to kill one of her husbands, Crimtyphon, and take his place. Maskull is revolted at the idea, but does kill Crimtyphon when he sees him using his will to force a man into becoming a tree.

; 10 – Tydomin 
Tydomin, another wife of Crimtyphon's, shows up and uses her will to force Oceaxe to commit suicide by walking off a cliff and persuades Maskull to follow her to her home in Disscourn, where she will take possession of his body. On the way they find Joiwind's brother Digrung who says he will tell her everything; to prevent this, and encouraged by Tydomin, Maskull absorbs Digrung, leaving his empty body behind. At Tydomin's cave, he goes out of his body to, anachronistically, become the apparition of the seance where he met Krag, but when he is killed he goes back to his body before Tydomin can possess it, whereupon he awakens free of her mental power.

; 11 – On Disscourn
Maskull takes Tydomin to Sant, to kill her. In Sant no women are allowed, but only men, who go there to follow Hator's doctrine. On the way Maskull and Tydomin meet Spadevil, who proposes to reform Sant by amending Hator's teaching with the notion of duty. He turns Maskull and Tydomin into his disciples by modifying their sorbs into twin membranes called probes.

; 12 – Spadevil 
Catice, the guardian of Hator's doctrine in Sant, who has only one probe, damages one of Maskull's to test Spadevil's arguments. Maskull accepts Hator's ideas and kills Spadevil and Tydomin. Catice says he will leave Sant to meditate on Spadevil's arguments, claims that Shaping is not Surtur, and sends Maskull away to the Wombflash Forest, in search of Muspel, their home.

; 13 – The Wombflash Forest
Maskull awakes in the dense Wombflash Forest with a third eye as his only foreign organ, hears the drumbeat, follows it, and meets Dreamsinter, who tells him that it was Nightspore whom Surtur brought to Tormance and that he, Maskull, is wanted to steal Muspel-light. Maskull then sees a vision in which Krag kills him while Nightspore follows a light, and faints.

; 14 – Polecrab 
Maskull reawakes and proceeds to the shore of the Sinking Sea, from which Swaylone's Island can be seen. There he meets Polecrab, a simple fisherman, who is married to Gleameil.

; 15 – Swaylone's Island
Maskull goes to Swaylone's Island, where Earthrid plays a musical instrument called Irontick (actually a lake) by night, and from where no one who heard it ever returned. Maskull is accompanied by Gleameil, who has left her family because of the attraction of the music. Earthrid warns Gleameil that the music he plays will kill her, but she stays and promptly dies. Maskull, after entering a trance, forcibly plays the lake, whereupon Earthrid dies, violently dismembered, and Irontick is destroyed.

; 16 – Leehallfae
Maskull crosses the sea by maneuvering a many-eyed, [[heliotropism|heliotropic]] tree and reaches Matterplay, where much to his amazement a plethora of life-forms alongside a magical creek materialize and vanish before his eyes. He goes upstream and meets Leehallfae, an immensely old being ("phaen") who is neither man nor woman, but of a [[Third gender|third sex]], who has been seeking the underground country of Threal for eons, where ae [sic] believes a god called Faceny (which may be another name for Shaping) is to be found.

; 17 – Corpang
They reach Threal by entering a cave. Leehallfae promptly falls ill and dies. Corpang appears and says this is because Threal is not Faceny's world, but Thire's. Faceny, Amfuse, and Thire are the creators of three worlds of existence, relation, and feeling. Corpang has come to Threal to follow Thire, and leads Maskull to three statues of these divinities. There Maskull has a vision of their power, and hears a voice saying he is to die in a few hours, after which the statues are seen with faces like a corpse's, showing that they are merely disguises for Shaping/Crystalman. Realising that he has been worshipping false gods, Corpang follows Maskull to Lichstorm, where they hear the drumbeats.

; 18 – Haunte
Maskull and Corpang meet Haunte, a hunter who travels in a boat that flies thanks to masculine stones which repel earth's femininity. After Maskull destroys the masculine rocks which protected Haunte from Sullenbode's femininity, all three journey to her cave. Sullenbode, a faceless woman, kills Haunte as they kiss.

; 19 – Sullenbode 
Maskull desires Sullenbode and she desires him, thereby becoming alive (without killing him) as long as he loves her. Maskull, Sullenbode and Corpang proceed in the direction someone looking for Muspel once went. As they near their destination, Corpang goes eagerly ahead but Maskull stops, caught in a vision of Muspel-light. His momentary loss of interest and her inability to recall him from his trance causes Sullenbode to die. As the vision fades Maskull discovers Sullenbode and, leaving Corpangs path, proceeds down the mountain to bury Sullenbode.

; 20 – Barey
Maskull, upon waking, discovers Krag again, and then Gangnet, who defends Shaping and his creation. Since Gangnet is unable to send the abusive Krag away, they travel together to the ocean and then take to the sea on a raft. When the sun Alppain rises, Maskull sees in a vision Krag causing the drum beat by beating his heart, and Gangnet, who is Shaping, dying in torment enveloped by Muspel-fire. Back on the raft, Krag tells Maskull that he (Maskull) is Nightspore; then Maskull dies.

; 21 – Muspel
Krag and Nightspore arrive at Muspel, where there is a tower similar to that in Starkness (the observatory in Scotland). From the windows of its several stories Nightspore sees that Shaping (the Gnostic [[demiurge]]) uses what comes from Muspel to create the world in order that he may feel joy, fragmenting the Muspel matter in the process and producing suffering for all living things. Krag acknowledges that he is Surtur and is known on Earth as pain. Nightspore goes back with him to reincarnate and spread knowledge about Surtur, Shaping, and Muspel.

==Setting==

===Geography===

The story is set on Tormance, an imaginary planet orbiting the star [[Arcturus]], which, in the novel (but not in reality) is a double star system, consisting of Branchspell, a large yellow sunlike star, and Alppain, a smaller blue star. It is said in the novel to be 100 light-years distant from Earth.

There is no systematic description of the geography of Tormance; Maskull simply travels from South to North (with a somewhat eastward excursion to the Sant levels).  The direction is symbolic: the light of the second sun, Alppain, is seen to the north; the southern countries are illuminated only by Branchspell. Maskull travels always in the direction that puts behind him earthly sights and things, seeking the other world illuminated by Alppain.

===Names===
[[File:The giant with the flaming sword by Dollman.jpg|thumb|upright|The names "Surtur" and "Muspel" used in the book are from [[Surtr]], the lord of [[Múspellsheimr]],&lt;ref name=deValencia/&gt; here in a 1909 painting by [[John Charles Dollman]].]]

The historian Shimon de Valencia states that the names "Surtur" and "Muspel" are taken from [[Surtr]], the lord of [[Múspellsheimr]] (the world of fire) in Norse mythology.&lt;ref name=deValencia&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Valencia |first1=Shimon |title=A Voyage to Arcturus  A fresh look at the first and possibly greatest work of Scottish author, David Lindsay |url=https://www.omnitopianthoughts.com/2017/04/18/a-voyage-to-arcturus/|publisher=Omnitopian Thoughts |date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsay's choice of title (and therefore the setting in [[Arcturus]]) may have been influenced by the nonfictional ''A Voyage to the Arctic in the Whaler Aurora'' (1911), published by his namesake, David Moore Lindsay.&lt;ref name=Beauclerk&gt;{{cite book |last=Beauclerk |first=Charles |title=Piano Man: Life of John Ogdon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvoPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA334 |year=2014 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-85720-011- 2|pages=333–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventions===

The novel is recognised for its strangeness.&lt;ref name=Moorcock/&gt; Among the many features of the world of Tormance are its alien sea, with water so dense that it can be walked on, while gnawl water is sufficient food to sustain life on its own. The local spectrum includes two primary colours, ''ulfire'' and ''jale'', unknown on Earth, as well as a third colour, ''dolm'', said to be compounded of ulfire and blue. (Lindsay writes: '[t]he sense impressions caused in Maskull by these two additional primary colors can only be vaguely hinted at by analogy. Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1329?msg=welcome_stranger|title=A Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Tormance people are able to speak to people from Earth, as their ability to read thoughts enables them to understand both meaning and words. The planet itself is entirely un-Earthlike with unique life-forms, such as three-legged animals that spin, and a ten-finned flying animal.&lt;ref name=TVT/&gt;

The sexuality of the Tormance species is ambiguous; Lindsay coined a new [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral third-person pronouns|gender-specific pronoun series]], ''ae'', ''aer'', and ''aerself'' for the phaen who are humanoid but formed of air. The character Panawe who briefly guides Maskull was born male and female, but becomes male when his female component relinquishes life to allow him to live as a male. Maskull himself acquires Tormance organs which give him additional senses including telepathy; these include a tentacle on his chest and a fleshy organ on his forehead that changes into a third eye.&lt;ref name=TVT&gt;{{cite web |title=Literature / A Voyage to Arcturus |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AVoyageToArcturus |website=TVTropes |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect==

===Influence===

The novel was a central influence on [[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1938–1945 ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite news |author=Lindskoog, Kathryn | url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=882 |title=''A Voyage to Arcturus'', C. S. Lewis, and ''The Dark Tower'' |work=Discovery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis also mentioned the "sorbing" (aggressive absorption of another's personality into one's own, fatal to the other person) as an influence on his 1942 book ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewis, C. S. |title=The Screwtape Letters |authorlink=C. S. Lewis |isbn=0-02-086860-X |origyear=1942 |year=1961 |page=xiii, "Preface to the Paperback Edition"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis in turn recommended the book to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], who said he read it "with avidity".&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite news|editor1-last=Carpenter |editor1-first=Humphrey |work=The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien |date=1981 |publisher=George Allen and Unwin |location=London |isbn=0-618-05699-8 |title=Letter to Stanley Unwin, 4 March 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moorcock/&gt;

The composer [[John Ogdon]] wrote an [[oratorio]] for soprano, mezzosoprano, tenor and baritone accompanied by choir and piano, ''A Voyage to Arcturus'', in 1984, based on Lindsay's novel and "biblical quotations". Ogdon's biographer, Charles Beauclerk, notes that Lindsay was also a composer, and that the novel discusses the "nature and meaning" of music. In Beauclerk's view, Ogdon saw Linday's novel as a religious work, where for instance the wild 3-eyed, 3-armed woman Oceaxe becomes Oceania, described in the Bible's [[Book of Revelation]] 12 as "a woman cloth'd with the sun, and the moon under her feet".&lt;ref name=Beauclerk/&gt;

===Reception===

The critic and philosopher [[Colin Wilson]] described ''A Voyage to Arcturus'' as the "greatest novel of the twentieth century".&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm |title=Book Review: ''A Voyage to Arcturus'' by David Lindsay |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215222935/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm |archivedate=2014-12-15 |author=Kieniewicz, Paul M. |date= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clive Barker]] stated that "''A Voyage to Arcturus'' is a masterpiece" and called it "an extraordinary work . . . quite magnificent."&lt;ref name=Barker&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/arcturus.html |title=A Voyage to Arcturus |publisher=[[Michael Butterworth (author)|Savoy Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Pullman]] named it for ''[[The Guardian]]'' as the book he thought was most underrated.&lt;ref name=Pullman&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pullman |first1=Philip |authorlink=Philip Pullman |title=Philip Pullman: 'The book I wish I'd written? My next one' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/29/philip-pullman-books-that-made-me |work=The Guardian |date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book in 2002, the novelist [[Michael Moorcock]] asserted that "Few English novels have been as eccentric or, ultimately, as influential". He noted that Alan Moore, introducing the 2002 edition, had compared the book to [[John Bunyan]] (''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', 1678) and [[Arthur Machen]] (''[[The Great God Pan]]'', 1890), but that it nevertheless stood "as one of the great originals". In Moorcock's view, although Maskull seems to be commanded to do whatever is needed to save his soul, in a kind of "[[Nietzsche]]an ''Pilgrim's Progress''", Lindsay does not fall into [[fascism]]. Like [[Hitler]], Moorcock argued, Lindsay was traumatised by the trench fighting of the [[First World War]], but the "astonishing and dramatic ambiguity of the novel's resolution" makes the novel the antithesis of Hitler's "visionary brutalism". Moorcock noted that while the book had influenced C. S. Lewis's science fiction trilogy, Lewis had "refused Lindsay's commitment to the Absolute and lacked his God-questioning genius, the very qualities which give this strange book its compelling, almost mesmerising influence."&lt;ref name=Moorcock&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moorcock |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael Moorcock |title=A Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview20 |work=The Guardian |date=31 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2002, Steven H. Silver, criticising ''A Voyage to Arcturus'' on SF Site, observes that for a novel it has little plot or characterisation, and furthermore that it gives no motives for the actions taken by its characters. In his view, the book's strength lies in its "philosophical musings" on humanity after the First World War. Silver compares the book not with later [[science fiction]] but with that of [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Jules Verne]], "although with neither author's prose skills." He suggests that Lindsay was combining philosophy with an adventure tale in the manner of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silver |first1=Steven H. |title=A Voyage to Arcturus David Lindsay|url=https://www.sfsite.com/09b/va136.htm |publisher=SF Site |accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication history===

Methuen agreed to publish the novel, but only if Lindsay agreed to cut 15,000 words, which he did. These passages are assumed lost forever. Methuen also insisted on a change of title, from Lindsay's original (''Nightspore in Tormance''), as it was considered too obscure.&lt;ref&gt;Sellin, Bernard, The Life &amp; Works of David Lindsay (Cambridge University Press, 1981), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; But out of an original press run of 1430 copies, no more than 596 were sold in total.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.no/books?id=2fNx3hJY760C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=david+lindsay+a+voyage+to+arcturus+some+15,000+words+had+to+be+cut&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HfcXQ8alrf&amp;sig=ApqHKDCXtx5TAvXwhEmxazaA3WU&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI87Cgg6iKxwIVzA0sCh1vggIL#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20lindsay%20a%20voyage%20to%20arcturus%20some%2015%2C000%20words%20had%20to%20be%20cut&amp;f=false David Lindsay, by Gary K.

[[File:Jonathan Richardson the Elder - Alexander Pope - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Pope]] published ''An Essay on Man'' in 1734.]]
'''''An Essay on Man''''' is  a poem published by [[Alexander Pope]] in [[1733 in poetry|1733–1734]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pope |first= Alexander|year=1733 |title= An Essay on Man; In Epistles to a Friend (Epistle II)|publisher= Printed for J.

It is concerned with the natural order God has decreed for man. Because man cannot know God's purposes, he cannot complain about his position in the [[Great Chain of Being]] (ll.33-34) and must accept that "Whatever IS, is RIGHT" (l.292), a theme that was satirized by [[Voltaire]] in ''[[Candide]]'' (1759).&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300106556 Candide, or Optimism]. Review of the Burton Raffel translation by the [[Yale]] UP.&lt;/ref&gt; More than any other work, it popularized [[optimistic philosophy]] throughout England and the rest of Europe.

Pope's ''Essay on Man'' and ''Moral Epistles'' were designed to be the parts of a system of ethics which he wanted to express in poetry. ''Moral Epistles'' has been known under various other names including ''Ethic Epistles'' and ''[[Moral Essays]]''.

On its publication, ''An Essay on Man'' received great admiration throughout Europe. Voltaire called it "the most beautiful, the most useful, the most sublime didactic poem ever written in any language".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, ''Lettres Philosophiques'', amended 1756 edition, cited in the Appendix (p.147) of ''Philosophical Letters (Letters Concerning the English Nation)'', Courier Dover Publications 2003, {{ISBN|0486426734}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iMZCfejJg9EC&amp;lpg=PA147 accessed on Google Books 2014-02-12]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1756 [[Rousseau]] wrote to Voltaire admiring the poem and saying that it "softens my ills and brings me patience". Kant was fond of the poem and would recite long passages from it to his students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=klqFEFXnk0wC Harry M Solomon: ''The rape of the text: reading and misreading Pope's Essay on man''] on Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Later however, Voltaire renounced his admiration for Pope's and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s optimism and even wrote a novel, ''Candide'', as a satire on their philosophy of ethics. Rousseau also critiqued the work, questioning "Pope's uncritical assumption that there must be an unbroken chain of being all the way from inanimate matter up to God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Restless Genius|author=Leo Damrosch|publisher=HOughton Mifflin Company|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay, written in [[heroic couplets]], comprises four epistles. Pope began work on it in 1729, and had finished the first three by 1731. They appeared in early 1733, with the fourth epistle published the following year. The poem was originally published anonymously; Pope did not admit authorship until [[1735 in poetry|1735]].

Pope reveals in his introductory statement, "The Design," that ''An Essay on Man'' was originally conceived as part of a longer philosophical poem which would have been expanded on through four separate books. According to his friend and editor, [[William Warburton]], Pope intended to structure the work as follows: 

The four epistles which had already been published would have comprised the first book. The second book was to contain another set of epistles, which in contrast to the first book would focus on subjects such as human reason, the practical and impractical aspects of varied arts and sciences, human talent, the use of learning, the science of the world, and wit, together with "a satire against the misapplication" of those same disciplines. The third book would discuss politics and religion, while the fourth book was concerned with "private ethics" or "practical morality." The following passage, taken from the first two paragraphs of the opening verse of the second epistle, is often quoted by those familiar with Pope's work, as it neatly summarizes some of the religious and humanistic tenets of the poem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Know then thyself, presume not God to scan&lt;br&gt;
The proper study of Mankind is Man.&lt;ref&gt;In the first edition, this line reads "The only Science of Mankind is ''Man''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,&lt;br&gt;
A Being darkly wise, and rudely great:&lt;br&gt;
With too much knowledge for the Sceptic side,&lt;br&gt;
With too much weakness for the Stoic's pride,&lt;br&gt;
He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest;&lt;br&gt;
In doubt to deem himself a God, or Beast;&lt;br&gt;
In doubt his mind or body to prefer;&lt;br&gt;
Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err;&lt;br&gt;
Alike in ignorance, his reason such,&lt;br&gt;
Whether he thinks too little, or too much;&lt;br&gt;
Chaos of Thought and Passion, all confus'd;&lt;br&gt;
Still by himself, abus'd or disabus'd;&lt;br&gt;
Created half to rise and half to fall;&lt;br&gt;
Great Lord of all things, yet a prey to all,&lt;br&gt;
Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd;&lt;br&gt;
The glory, jest and riddle of the world.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Go, wondrous creature! mount where science guides,&lt;br&gt;
Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; &lt;br&gt;
Instruct the planets in what orbs to run, &lt;br&gt;
Correct old time, and regulate the sun; &lt;br&gt;
Go, soar with Plato to th’ empyreal sphere, &lt;br&gt;
To the first good, first perfect, and first fair; &lt;br&gt;
Or tread the mazy round his followers trod, &lt;br&gt;
And quitting sense call imitating God; &lt;br&gt;
As Eastern priests in giddy circles run, &lt;br&gt;
And turn their heads to imitate the sun. &lt;br&gt;
Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule— &lt;br&gt;
Then drop into thyself, and be a fool! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the above example, Pope's thesis is that man has learnt about nature and God's creation through science; consequently, science has given man power, but having become intoxicated by this power, man has begun to think that he is "imitating God". In response, Pope declares the species of man to be a "fool", absent of knowledge and plagued by "ignorance" in spite of all the progress achieved through science. Pope argues that humanity should make a study of itself, and not debase the spiritual essence of the world with earthly science, since the two are diametrically opposed to one another: man should "presume not God to scan".

'''''Argumentum ad lapidem''''' ([[Latin]]: "appeal to the stone") is a [[informal fallacy|logical fallacy]] that consists in dismissing a statement as absurd without giving proof of its absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dianahsieh.com/misc/fallacies.html "Definitions of Fallacies"], Dianah Mertz Hsieh, 20 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pirie"&gt;{{cite book |title=How to win every argument: the use and abuse of logic |author=Pirie, Madsen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh5UjNNc0v4C&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=%22ad%20lapidem%22%20argument&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ad%20lapidem%22%20argument&amp;f=false |pages=101–103 |isbn=978-0-8264-9006-3 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite book |title=Collected works of Samuel Alexander |volume=4 |author=Alexander, Samuel |editor=Slater, John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5UzwJEnm3J4C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=johnson+%22ad+lapidem%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3s5YxwPKL3&amp;sig=CEPVlYTIkYsngteWQpADGJt-3Us&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fO_ETL-NGI3WtQOs15ztDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=johnson%20%22ad%20lapidem%22&amp;f=false |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2000 |chapter=Dr. Johnson as a Philosopher |page=119 |isbn=978-1-85506-853-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ad lapidem'' statements are fallacious because they fail to address the merits of the claim in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://effectiviology.com/appeal-to-the-stone-fallacy/ | title = The ‘Appeal to the Stone’ Fallacy: On Being Completely Dismissive in Arguments | last = Shatz | first = Itamar | website = Effectiviology |date= 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies to [[proof by assertion]], where an unproved or disproved claim is asserted as true on no ground other than that of its truth having been asserted. 

The name of this fallacy is derived from a famous incident in which Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]] claimed to disprove [[Bishop Berkeley]]'s [[immaterialism|immaterialist]] philosophy (that there are no material objects, only minds and ideas in those minds) by kicking a large stone and asserting, "I refute it ''thus''."&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;  This action, which is said to fail to prove the existence of the stone outside the ideas formed by perception, is said to fail to contradict Berkeley's argument, and has been seen as merely dismissing it.&lt;ref name="Pirie"/&gt;

== Example ==
* Speaker A: [[Germ theory of disease|Infectious diseases are caused by microbes.]]
* Speaker B: [[Germ theory denialism|What a ridiculous idea!]]
* Speaker A: How so?
* Speaker B: It's obviously ridiculous.

Speaker B gives no evidence or reasoning, and when pressed, claims that Speaker A's statement is inherently absurd, thus applying the fallacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8841">'''M. Basil Pennington''' [[Trappists|O.C.S.O.]] (1931–2005) was an American Roman Catholic [[Trappists|Trappist]] monk and priest. He was a leading spiritual writer, speaker, teacher, and director. 

Pennington was an [[List of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|alumnus]] of the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)|Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas ''Angelicum'']] where he obtained a licentiate in Theology in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/27717764  Accessed 30 August, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He also earned a licentiate in Canon Law at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. Pennington became known internationally as one of the major proponents of the [[Centering Prayer]] movement begun at [[St. Joseph's Abbey]] in [[Spencer, Massachusetts]], during the 1970s.

Pennington's book ''Centering Prayer'' was first published in 1980, and had sold more than a million copies by 2002.&lt;ref name=garrett02&gt;{{cite journal

==Life==

Pennington entered the [[Trappists|Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance]] at St. Joseph's Abbey in June 1951. At St. Joseph's Abbey, he was appointed professor of theology in 1959, professor of canon law and professor of spirituality in 1963, and vocation director in 1978. In 2000, he was appointed superior at [[Assumption Abbey, Missouri|Assumption Abbey]] in [[Ava, Missouri]], and later that same year, he was elected abbot of the [[Monastery of the Holy Spirit]] in [[Conyers, Georgia]]. He returned to St. Joseph's Abbey after retiring in 2002. He died on June 3, 2005, the [[Feast of the Sacred Heart|Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]], from injuries sustained from a car accident.

[[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]] wrote that Pennington "not only wrote effectively about centering prayer, but he also traveled across the United States and the world spreading the practice through lectures and workshops. The renewal of contemplative prayer in the last decades of the twentieth century owes much to these efforts."&lt;ref name=mcginn06&gt;{{cite journal

{{Certainty sidebar}}
'''Belief''' is the state of [[mind]] in which a person thinks something to be the case with or without there being [[empirical evidence]] to prove that something is the case with factual certainty. Another way of defining belief sees it as a [[mental representation]] of an [[Intentionality|attitude positively oriented]] towards the [[likelihood]] of something being [[truth|true]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Primmer |first= Justin |editor-last= Primmer |editor-first= Justin |contribution= Belief |title= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab |location= Stanford, CA |year= 2018|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/ |accessdate= 2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek thought]], two related concepts were identified with regards to the concept of belief: ''[[Pistis#Pistis in rhetoric|pistis]]'' and ''[[doxa]]''. Simplified, we may say that ''pistis'' refers to "trust" and "confidence", while ''doxa'' refers to "opinion" and "acceptance".  The English word "[[orthodoxy]]" derives from ''doxa''.  Jonathan Leicester suggests that belief has the purpose of guiding action rather than indicating [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Primmer|first1= Justin|title= The nature and purpose of belief|journal= Journal of Mind and Behavior|date= 2018|volume= 29|issue= 3|pages= 219–239|url= http://philpapers.org/rec/LEITNA|accessdate= 3 June 2018 | quote = The purpose of belief is to guide action, not to indicate truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[epistemology]], philosophers use the term "belief" to refer to personal attitudes
associated with [[truth value|true or false]] ideas and concepts. However, "belief" does not require active [[introspection]] and circumspection. For example, we never ponder whether or not the sun will rise. We simply assume the sun will rise. Since "belief" is an important aspect of mundane life, according to Eric Schwitzgebel in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', a related question asks: "how a physical organism can have beliefs?"&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/] – "The 'mind-body problem', for example, so central to philosophy of mind, is in part the question of whether and how a purely physical organism can have beliefs." Retrieved 01 July 2016.

==Knowledge and epistemology==
[[Epistemology]] is concerned with delineating the boundary between justified belief and [[opinion]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries – [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/epistemology definition] published by [[OUP]] [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt; and involved generally with a theoretical [[philosophical]] study of [[knowledge]]. The primary problem in epistemology is to understand exactly what is needed in order for us to have knowledge. In a notion derived from [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where the epistemology of Socrates (Platon) most clearly departs from that of the [[sophist]]s, who at the time of Plato seem to have defined knowledge as what is here expressed as "[[justified true belief]]". The tendency to translate from belief (here: doxa – common opinion) to knowledge (here: episteme), which Plato (e.g. [[Socrates]] of the dialogue) utterly dismisses, results from failing to distinguish a [[dispositive]] belief (gr. 'doxa', not 'pistis') from knowledge (episteme) when the opinion is regarded ''true'' (here: orthé), in terms of right, and juristically so (according to the premises of the dialogue), which was the task of the [[rhetor]]s to prove. Plato dismisses this possibility of an affirmative relation between belief (i.e. opinion) and [[knowledge]] even when the one who opines grounds his belief on the rule, and is able to add ''justification'' (gr. [[logos]]: reasonable and necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friesian.com/knowledg.htm – Copyright (c) 2007, 2008 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato has been credited for the "''justified true belief''" theory of knowledge, even though Plato in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)]] elegantly dismisses it, and even posits this argument of Socrates as a cause for his death penalty. Among American epistemologists, [[Edmund Gettier|Gettier]] (1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gettier |first=E. L. |year=1963 |title=Is justified true belief knowledge? |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=121–123 |doi= 10.1093/analys/23.6.121|jstor=3326922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Goldman|Goldman]] (1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=A. I. |year=1967 |title=A causal theory of knowing |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=357–372 |doi= 10.2307/2024268|jstor=2024268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned the "justified true belief" definition, and challenged the "sophists" of their time.

==As a psychological phenomenon==
Mainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to be more abstract in their analysis, and much of the work examining the viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.

The concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of belief (the proposition). So, like other [[propositional attitude]]s, belief implies the existence of [[mental state]]s and [[intentionality]], both of which are hotly debated topics in the [[philosophy of mind]], whose foundations and relation to brain states are still controversial.

Beliefs are sometimes divided into [[core beliefs]] (that are actively thought about) and ''[[dispositional belief]]s'' (that may be ascribed to someone who has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked "do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?" a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=V. |last2=Halligan |first2=P. W. |last3=Ellis |first3=H. D. |year=2006 |chapter=A Cognitive Neuroscience of Belief |editor1-first=Peter W. |editor1-last=Halligan |editor2-first=Mansel |editor2-last=Aylward |title=The Power of Belief: Psychological Influence on Illness, Disability, and Medicine |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-853010-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has important implications for understanding the [[neuropsychology]] and [[neuroscience]] of belief. If the concept of belief is incoherent, then any attempt to find the underlying neural processes that support it will fail.

Philosopher [[Lynne Rudder Baker]] has outlined four main contemporary approaches to belief in her controversial book ''Saving Belief'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lynne Rudder |last=Baker |title=Saving Belief: A Critique of Physicalism |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1989 |location= |isbn=0-691-07320-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is correct - Sometimes called the "mental sentence theory," in this conception, beliefs exist as coherent entities, and the way we talk about them in everyday life is a valid basis for scientific endeavour. [[Jerry Fodor]] is one of the principal defenders of this point of view.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief may not be entirely correct, but it is close enough to make some useful predictions – This view argues that we will eventually reject the idea of belief as we know it now, but that there may be a correlation between what we take to be a belief when someone says "I believe that snow is white" and how a future theory of psychology will explain this behaviour. Most notably, philosopher [[Stephen Stich]] has argued for this particular understanding of belief.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong and will be completely superseded by a radically different theory that will have no use for the concept of belief as we know it – Known as [[eliminativism]], this view (most notably proposed by [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]) argues that the concept of belief is like obsolete theories of times past such as [[the four humours]] theory of medicine, or the [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion. In these cases science hasn't provided us with a more detailed account of these theories, but completely rejected them as valid scientific concepts to be replaced by entirely different accounts. The Churchlands argue that our common-sense concept of belief is similar in that as we discover more about neuroscience and the brain, the inevitable conclusion will be to reject the belief hypothesis in its entirety.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong; however, treating people, animals, and even computers as if they had beliefs is often a successful strategy – The major proponents of this view, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Lynne Rudder Baker]], are both [[eliminativism|eliminativists]] in that they hold that beliefs are not a scientifically valid concept, but they don't go as far as rejecting the concept of belief as a predictive device. Dennett gives the example of playing a computer at chess. While few people would agree that the computer held beliefs, treating the computer as if it did (e.g. that the computer believes that taking the opposition's queen will give it a considerable advantage) is likely to be a successful and predictive strategy. In this understanding of belief, named by Dennett ''the [[intentional stance]]'', belief-based explanations of mind and behaviour are at a different level of explanation and are not reducible to those based on fundamental neuroscience, although both may be explanatory at their own level.
Strategic approaches make a distinction between rules, norms and beliefs as follows:
(1) Rules. Explicit regulative processes such as policies, laws, inspection routines, or incentives. Rules function as a coercive regulator of behavior and are dependent upon the imposing entity's ability to enforce them.
(2) Norms. Regulative mechanisms accepted by the social collective. Norms are enforced by normative mechanisms within the organization and are not strictly dependent upon law or regulation.
(3) Beliefs. The collective perception of fundamental truths governing behavior. The adherence to accepted and shared beliefs by members of a social system will likely persist and be difficult to change over time. Strong beliefs about determinant factors (i.e., security, survival, or honor) are likely to cause a social entity or group to accept rules and norms.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012).

==Epistemological belief compared to religious belief==
Historically ''belief-in'' belonged in the realm of religious thought, ''belief-that'' instead belonged to epistemological considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = H. H. | year = 1965 | title = Belief 'In' and Belief 'That' | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2400996 | journal = Religious Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 01| pages = 5–27 | doi = 10.1017/S0034412500002304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief-in===
To "believe in" someone or something is a distinct concept from "believing-that." There are at least these types of belief-in:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacIntosh |first=J. J. |year=1994 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-15948893/belief-revisited-reply-williams.html |title=Belief-in Revisited: A Reply to Williams |journal=Religious Studies |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=487–503 |doi=10.1017/S0034412500023131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Commendatory''' / '''[[Faith]]''' - we may make an expression of 'faith' in respect of some performance by an agent X, when without prejudice to the truth value of the factual outcome or even confidence in X otherwise, we expect that specific performance. In particular [[self-confidence]] or faith in one's self is this kind of belief.
* '''Existential claim''' – to claim belief in the existence of an entity or phenomenon in a general way with the implied need to justify its claim to existence. It is often used when the entity is not real, or its existence is in doubt. "He believes in witches and ghosts" or "many children believe in Santa Claus" or "I believe in a deity" are typical examples.&lt;ref name="belief-in"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macintosh |first=Jack |chapter=Belief-in |title=[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] |page=86 |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The linguistic form is distinct from the assertion of the truth of a proposition since verification is either considered impossible/irrelevant or a [[counterfactual]] situation is assumed.

===Belief-that===
====Economical belief====
Economic beliefs are beliefs which are reasonably and necessarily contrary to the tenet of rational choice or instrumental rationality.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Taylor-Gooby – [https://www.issa.int/html/pdf/jeru98/theme3/3-1a.pdf ECONOMIC BELIEFS AND SOCIAL POLICY BEHAVIOUR] [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (Economic Beliefs and behaviour research programme) [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the Austrian tradition of the economic thought, in the context of analysis of the influence and subsequent degree of change resulting from  existing economic knowledge and belief, has contributed the most to the subsequent holistic collective analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Arena"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWtuUnc1u4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBGoVChMI1N-8qfSbxwIVzLUUCh0tuwX3&amp;q=economic%20beliefs|author=R. Arena &amp; A. Festré|title=Knowledge, Beliefs and Economics|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing 1 Jan 2006, 288 pages, |ISBN=1847201539|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Delusion====
Insofar as the truth of belief is expressed in sentential  and propositional form we are using the sense of ''belief-that'' rather than ''belief-in''. [[Delusion]] arises when the truth value of the form is clearly nil.&lt;ref name="L. Bortolotti"&gt;{{cite book |author=L. Bortolotti|title=Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs|publisher=OUP Oxford 2010, 299 pages, ''International Perspectives in Philosophy &amp; Psychiatry'' |ISBN=0199206163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski-truth/ ''Tarski's Truth Definitions''], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/ ''LOTH''] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences" Alfred Tarski Dover 1995/41, Ch. I, &amp;sect; 2 ''Expressions containing variables—sentential and designatory functions'' and Ch. II ''On the Sentential Calculus'' in its entirety&lt;/ref&gt;

Delusions are defined as beliefs in [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria&lt;ref&gt;[http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2013/06/delusions-in-dsm-5.html ''Delusions in the DSM 5''] A blog by Lisa Bortolotti &amp; Ema Sullivan-Bissett&lt;/ref&gt; (for example in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''). Psychiatrist and historian [[G.E. Berrios]] has challenged the view that delusions are genuine beliefs and instead labels them as "empty speech acts," where affected persons are motivated to express false or bizarre belief statements due to an underlying psychological disturbance. However, the majority of mental health professionals and researchers treat delusions as if they were genuine beliefs.

In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] says, "Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." This is often quoted in mockery of the common ability of people to [[Credo quia absurdum|entertain beliefs contrary to fact]].

==Formation==
[[File:Ripples of influence.jpg|thumb|We are influenced by many factors that ripple through our minds as our beliefs form, evolve, and may eventually change]]

Psychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and actions. Three models of belief formation and change have been proposed:

===The conditional inference process===
When people are asked to estimate the likelihood that a statement is true, they search their memory for information that has implications for the validity of this statement. Once this information has been identified, they estimate a) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were true, and b) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were false. If their estimates for these two probabilities differ, people average them, weighting each by the likelihood that the information is true and false (respectively). Thus, information bears directly on beliefs of another, related statement.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"&gt;Wyer, R. S., &amp; Albarracin, D. (2005). Belief formation, organization, and change: Cognitive and motivational influences. In D. Albarracin, B. T. Johnson, &amp; M. P. Zanna, The Handbook of Attitudes (273–322). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear models of belief formation===
Unlike the previous model, this one takes into consideration the possibility of multiple factors influencing belief formation. Using regression procedures, this model predicts belief formation on the basis of several different pieces of information, with weights assigned to each piece on the basis of their relative importance.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"/&gt;

===Information processing models of belief formation and change===
These models address the fact that the responses people have to belief-relevant information is unlikely to be predicted from the objective basis of the information that they can recall at the time their beliefs are reported. Instead, these responses reflect the number and meaning of the thoughts that people have about the message at the time that they encounter it.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"/&gt;

Some influences on people's belief formation include:
* Internalization of beliefs during childhood, which can form and shape our beliefs in different domains. [[Albert Einstein]] is often quoted as having said that "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen." Political beliefs depend most strongly on the political beliefs most common in the community where we live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Andrew Gelman |first=Andrew |last=Gelman |first2=David |last2=Park |first3=Boris |last3=Shor |first4=Joseph |last4=Bafumi |first5=Jeronimo |last5=Cortina |title=Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-13927-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals believe the [[religion]] they were taught in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Argyle |title=The Psychology of Religious Behaviour, Belief and Experience |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=0-415-12330-5 |page=25 |quote=Religion, in most cultures, is ascribed, not chosen. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charismatic leaders can form and/or modify beliefs (even if those beliefs fly in the face of all previous beliefs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Hoffer |title=The True Believer |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |year=2002 |isbn=0-06-050591-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is belief voluntary? Rational individuals need to reconcile their direct reality with any said belief; therefore, if belief is not present or possible, it reflects the fact that contradictions were necessarily overcome using [[cognitive dissonance]].
* [[Advertising]] can form or change beliefs through repetition, shock, and association with images of sex, love, beauty, and other strong positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Kilbourne |first2=Mary |last2=Pipher |title=Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel |location= |publisher=Free Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-684-86600-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to intuition, a delay, known as the [[sleeper effect]], instead of immediate succession may increase an advertisement's ability to persuade viewer's beliefs if a discounting cue is present.&lt;ref&gt;see Kumkale &amp; Albarracin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical trauma, especially to the head, can radically alter a person's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Babette |last=Rothschild |title=The Body Remembers: The Psychophysiology of Trauma and Trauma Treatment |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-393-70327-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even educated people, well aware of the process by which beliefs form, still strongly cling to their beliefs, and act on those beliefs even against their own self-interest. In Anna Rowley's book, Leadership Therapy, she states "You want your beliefs to change. It's proof that you are keeping your eyes open, living fully, and welcoming everything that the world and people around you can teach you." This means that peoples' beliefs should evolve as they gain new experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowley |first=Anna |title=Leadership Therapy: Inside the Mind of Microsoft |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=69 |isbn=1-4039-8403-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justified true belief&lt;!--'Justified true belief' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Justified true belief'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a definition of [[knowledge]] that gained approval during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], 'justified' standing in contrast to 'revealed'. There have been attempts to trace it back to [[Plato]] and his dialogues.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;The received view holds it that Plato's theory presents knowledge as remembering eternal truths and justification reawakens memory, see {{cite book |last=Fine |first=G. |chapter=Introduction |title=Plato on Knowledge and Forms: Selected Essays |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-924558-4 |pages=5–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of justified true belief states that in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but also have justification for doing so. In more formal terms, an agent &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows that a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true [[if and only if]]:
# &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; believes that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, and
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is justified in believing that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true

This theory of knowledge suffered a significant setback with the discovery of [[Gettier problem]]s, situations in which the above conditions were seemingly met but that many philosophers disagree that anything is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chisholm | first = Roderick | title = The Foundations of Knowing | chapter=Knowledge as Justified True Belief |publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8166-1103-3 |authorlink=Roderick Chisholm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Nozick]] suggested{{Year needed|date=April 2017}} a [[Gettier problems#Fred Dretske's conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick's truth-tracking|clarification]] of "justification" which he believed eliminates the problem: the justification has to be such that were the justification false, the knowledge would be false. Bernecker and Dretske (2000) argue that "no epistemologist since Gettier has seriously and successfully defended the traditional view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernecker |first=Sven|last2= Dretske|first2= Fred|date= 2000|title= Knowledge. Readings in contemporary epistemology|location= Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|isbn= 978-0198752615}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  On the other hand, Paul Boghossian argues that the Justified True Belief account is the "standard, widely accepted" definition of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Boghossian on Justification"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Clarendon Press |publication-place = Oxford, UK |author = Paul Boghossian |url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fear-of-knowledge-9780199230419?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |title = Fear of Knowledge: Against relativism and constructivism |publication-date = 2007 }}, Chapter2, p 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modification==
{{see also|Belief revision}}
An extensive amount of scientific research and philosophical discussion exists around the modification of beliefs, which is commonly referred to as belief revision.
Generally speaking, the process of belief revision entails the believer weighing the set of truths and/or evidence, and the dominance of a set of truths or evidence on an alternative to a held belief can lead to revision.  One process of belief revision is [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian updating]] and is often referenced for its mathematical basis and conceptual simplicity.  However, such a process may not be representative for individuals whose beliefs are not easily characterized as probabilistic.

There are several techniques for individuals or groups to change the beliefs of others; these methods generally fall under the umbrella of [[persuasion]].   Persuasion can take on more specific forms such as  [[consciousness raising]] when considered in an activist or political context.
Belief modification may also occur as a result of the experience of outcomes.  Because [[goal]]s are based, in part on beliefs, the success or failure at a particular goal may contribute to modification of beliefs that supported the original goal.

Whether or not belief modification actually occurs is dependent not only on the extent of truths or evidence for the alternative belief, but also characteristics outside the specific truths or evidence.  This includes, but is not limited to: the source characteristics of the message, such as [[Source credibility|credibility]]; [[Peer pressure|social pressures]]; the anticipated consequences of a modification; or the ability of the individual or group to act on the modification.  Therefore, individuals seeking to achieve belief modification in themselves or others need to consider all possible forms of resistance to belief revision.

==Partial==
Without qualification, "belief" normally implies a lack of [[doubt]], especially insofar as it is a designation of a [[life stance]]. In practical everyday use however, belief is normally partial and retractable with varying degrees of certainty.

A copious literature exists in multiple disciplines to accommodate this reality. In mathematics [[probability]], [[fuzzy logic]], [[fuzzy set theory]], and other topics are largely directed to this.

==Prediction==
Different psychological models have tried to predict people's beliefs and some of them try to estimate the exact probabilities of beliefs. For example, [[Robert S. Wyer|Robert Wyer]] developed a model of subjective probabilities.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |year=1970 |title=Quantitative prediction of belief and opinion change: A further test of a subjective probability model |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=559–570 |doi=10.1037/h0030064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |last2=Goldberg |first2=L. |year=1970 |title=A probabilistic analysis of the relationships among beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychological Review |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=100–120 |doi=10.1037/h0028769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When people rate the likelihood of a certain statement (e.g., "It will rain tomorrow"), this rating can be seen as a subjective probability value. The subjective probability model posits that these subjective probabilities follow the same rules as objective probabilities. For example, the [[law of total probability]] might be applied to predict a subjective probability value. Wyer found that this model produces relatively accurate predictions for probabilities of single events and for changes in these probabilities, but that the probabilities of several beliefs linked by "and" or "or" do not follow the model as well.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg" /&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Religion collage updated.jpg|thumb]]
Religious belief refers to attitudes towards [[mythological]], [[supernatural]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] aspects of a [[religion]].{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Religious belief is distinct from [[religious ritual|religious practice]] and from [[religious behaviour]]s – with some believers not practicing [[religion]] and some practitioners not believing religion. Religious beliefs, deriving from ideas that are exclusive to religion,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} often relate to the existence, characteristics and worship of a [[deity]] or deities, to the idea of [[Miracle|divine intervention]] in the [[universe]] and in [[human life (disambiguation)|human life]], or to the [[deontological]]  explanations for the values and practices centered on the teachings of a [[spiritual leader]] or of a [[spiritual group]]. In contrast to other [[belief system]]s, religious beliefs are usually [[Codification (law)|codified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief | publisher = University of California Press | author = Wittgenstein, Ludwig | year = 2007 | pages = 53 | isbn = 0520251814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of religious belief===
A popular view holds that different religions each have identifiable and exclusive sets of beliefs or [[creed]]s, but surveys of religious belief have often found that the official doctrine and descriptions of the beliefs offered by [[religious authority|religious authorities]] do not always agree with the privately held beliefs of those who identify as members of a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An empiricist's view of the nature of religious belief | publisher = Norwood Editions  (Norwood, Pa.) | author = Braithwaite, R. B. | year = 1975 | isbn = 088305955X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a broad classification of the kinds of religious belief, see below.

====Fundamentalism====
{{Main|Religious fundamentalism}}
First self-applied as a term to the conservative doctrine outlined by anti-modernist [[Protestants]] in the United States of America,&lt;ref name="A.C. Dixon"&gt;{{cite web |date= 2012-11-27 |url = http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |title = 'The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth' |accessdate = 2012-11-28 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203144842/http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |archivedate = 3 December 2012 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "fundamentalism" in religious terms denotes strict adherence to an interpretation of scriptures that are generally associated with theologically conservative positions or traditional understandings of the text and are distrustful of innovative readings, new revelation, or alternative interpretations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Religious fundamentalism has been identified{{by whom|date=November 2017}} in the media as being associated with [[fanaticism|fanatical]] or [[zealotry|zealous]] political movements around the world that have used a strict adherence to a particular religious doctrine as a means to establish political identity and to enforce societal norms.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

====Orthodoxy====
{{Main|Orthodoxy (disambiguation)}}
First used in the context of [[Early Christianity]], the term "orthodoxy" relates to religious belief that closely follows the edicts, [[apologetics|apologies]], and [[hermeneutics]] of a prevailing religious authority. In the case of Early Christianity, this authority was the communion of bishops, and is often referred to by the term "[[Magisterium]]". The term ''orthodox'' was applied{{when|date= November 2017}} almost as an epithet to a group of Jewish believers who held to pre-Enlightenment understanding of Judaism – now known as [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of Christianity and the [[Catholic Church]] each consider themselves to be the true heir to Early Christian belief and practice. The antonym of "orthodox" is "[[heterodox]]", and those adhering to orthodoxy often accuse the heterodox of [[apostasy]], [[schism (religion)|schism]], or [[heresy]].

====Modernism/reform====
The [[Renaissance]] and later the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe exhibited varying degrees of [[religious tolerance]] and intolerance towards new and old religious ideas. The ''[[philosophe]]s'' took particular exception to many of the more fantastical claims of religions and directly challenged religious authority and the prevailing beliefs associated with the established churches. In response to the liberalizing political and social movements, some religious groups attempted to integrate Enlightenment ideals of rationality, equality, and individual liberty into their belief systems, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Liberal Christianity]] offer two examples of such religious associations.

====Superstition====
{{Main|Superstition}}
A term signifying derogation that is used by the religious and non-religious alike, "superstition" refers to a  deprecated belief in supernatural causation. Those who deny the existence of the supernatural generally attribute all beliefs associated with it to be superstitious, while a typical religious critique of superstition holds that it either encompasses beliefs in non-existent supernatural activity or that the supernatural activity is inappropriately feared or held in improper regard (see [[idolatry]]). Christian Churches strongly condemned [[occultism]], [[animism]], [[paganism]], and other [[folk religion]]s as mean forms of superstition, though such condemnation did not necessarily eliminate the beliefs among the common people, and many such religious beliefs persist {{as of | 2018 | lc = on | alt = today}}.

====Systemization====
In Buddhism, practice and progress along the [[spiritual path]] happens when one follows the system of [[Buddhist practice]]. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system includes bad aspects too.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a "bad" religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha:
{{quote|"O Gotama, there are [[Shramana|Samana]]s (wandering monks) and [[Brahmin|Brahmanas]] (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and [[Mahavira|Nigantha Nataputta]]. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"}}

The Buddha replied:
{{quote|"Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], neither in it is there found a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|first stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Once-returner|second stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Non-returner|third stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Arahant|fourth stage]]."}}

As a religious tradition, [[Hindu]]ism has experienced many attempts at systemization. In medieval times, [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] advocated for the [[Advaita]] system of philosophy. In recent times, [[Tamala Krishna Gosvami]] has researched the systemization of [[Krishna]] theology as expounded by [[Srila Prabhupada]]. (See [[Krishnology]])

====Universalism====
Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern [[Western culture|Western]] cultures do.

Some [[anthropologist]]s{{Who|date=July 2010}} report cultures in which gods are involved in every aspect of [[human condition|life]] – if a cow goes dry, a god has caused this, and must be propitiated; when the sun rises in the morning, a god has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]''.

People with such a [[worldview]] often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} regard the influence of [[Western culture]] as inimical. Others with this worldview resist the influence of [[science]], and believe that science (or "so-called science") should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief, written into the constitutions of many{{which|date=November 2017}} [[Islam]]ic nations,  is shared by some [[fundamentalist Christians]].

In addition, beliefs about the [[supernatural]] or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as [[nature]] and non-nature, nor between science and what most educated people believe. In the view of some historians{{Who|date =September 2013}}, the pre-[[Socrates|Socratic]] [[Athenian]]s saw [[science]], political [[tradition]], [[culture]] and religion as not easily distinguishable, but as all part of the same body of [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] available to a [[community]].

===Approaches to the beliefs of others===
Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions or by other [[religious denomination]]s in a variety of ways.  All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

====Exclusivism====
{{See also|Exclusivism}}
People with exclusivist beliefs typically explain other beliefs either as in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the [[one true faith|true faith]]. This approach is a fairly consistent feature among smaller [[new religious movement]]s that often rely on doctrine that claims a unique [[revelation]] by the [[Founders of religious traditions|founder]]s or [[leader]]s, and considers it a matter of faith that the "correct" religion has a monopoly on truth. All three major [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheistic religions]] have passages in their holy scriptures that attest to the primacy of the scriptural testimony, and indeed [[monotheism]] itself is often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} vouched{{by whom|date= November 2017}} as an innovation characterized specifically by its explicit rejection of earlier polytheistic faiths.

Some exclusivist faiths incorporate a specific element of [[proselytization]]. This is a strongly-held belief in the Christian tradition which follows the doctrine of the [[Great Commission]], and is less emphasized by the Islamic faith where the [[Quran]]ic edict "There shall be no compulsion in religion" (2:256) is often quoted as a justification for toleration of alternative beliefs. The [[Conversion to Judaism|Jewish tradition]] does not actively seek out converts.

Exclusivism correlates with conservative, fundamentalist, and orthodox approaches of many religions, while pluralistic and syncretist approaches either explicitly downplay or reject the exclusivist tendencies within a religion.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Inclusivism====
People with [[inclusivism|inclusivist]] beliefs recognize some truth in all faith [[system]]s, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences. This attitude is sometimes associated{{by whom|date= November 2017}} with [[Interfaith dialog]]ue or with the Christian [[Ecumenical]] movement, though in principle such attempts at pluralism are not necessarily inclusivist and many actors in such interactions (for example, the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) still hold to exclusivist dogma while participating in inter-religious organizations.

Explicitly inclusivist religions include many that are associated with the [[New Age]] movement, as well as modern reinterpretations of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers it doctrine that there is truth in all faith-systems.

====Pluralism====
{{Main|Religious pluralism}}
People with [[religious pluralism|pluralist]] beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture.  Examples include:

* Extracts from the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji (Sikh Holy Scriptures), "There is only the One Supreme Lord God; there is no other at all" (Pannaa 45). "By His Power the [[Vedas]] and the [[Purana]]s exist, and the Holy Scriptures of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic religions. By His Power all deliberations exist." (Pannaa 464). "Some call Him, '[[Lord Rama|Ram]], Ram', and some call Him, 'Khudaa-i'. Some serve Him as 'Gusain', others as 'Allaah'. ||1|| He is the Cause of causes, the Generous Lord. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us amen." (Pannaa 885).

====Syncretism====
{{Main|Syncretism}}
People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular [[experience]]s and contexts (''see'' [[eclecticism]]). [[Unitarian Universalism]] exemplifies a syncretistic faith.

===Adherence===
{{See also|Existence of God}}
Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:

* Some see belief in a deity as necessary for [[Morality|moral behavior]].&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Compare: {{cite web | date= 2005-03-07 | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/110/13.0.html | title = Roy Moore: 'We Have No Morality Without an Acknowledgment of God' | publisher = [[Christianity Today]] | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many{{quantify|date= November 2017}} people regard religious practices as serene, beautiful, and conducive to religious experiences, which in turn support religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Miller | first = David Ian | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2005/02/15/findrelig.DTL | title = Finding My Religion: Steve Georgiou on his faith and mentor, minimalist poet Robert Lax | publisher =  SFGate | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organized religions promote a sense of [[Community (disambiguation)|community]] among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people with similar [[values]].&lt;ref name="repa"&gt;{{cite web | last = Repa | first = J. Theodore | date = 1998-10-18 | url = http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | title = Building Community: The Marriage of Religion and Education | accessdate = 2006-05-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907172411/http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | archive-date = 7 September 2006 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, while religious beliefs and practices are usually connected, some individuals with substantially secular beliefs still participate in religious practices for cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Note for example the concept of a [[cultural Christian]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each religion asserts that it is a means by which its adherents may come into closer contact with the Divine, with Truth, and with [[spiritual power]]. They all promise to free adherents from spiritual bondage, and to bring them into spiritual freedom.  It naturally follows that a religion which can free its adherents from deception, sin, and spiritual death will have significant mental-health benefits. [[Abraham Maslow]]'s research after [[World War II]] showed that [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs (not necessarily temple attendance, etc.), suggesting that belief helped people cope in extreme circumstances. [[Humanistic psychology]] went on to investigate how religious or spiritual identity may have correlations with longer lifespan and better health. The study found that humans may particularly need religious ideas to serve various emotional needs such as the need to feel loved, the need to belong to homogeneous groups, the need for understandable explanations and the need for a guarantee of ultimate justice.  Other factors may involve sense of [[purpose]], sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], or a sense of contact with the divine. See also ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', by [[Viktor Frankl]], detailing his experience with the importance of religion in surviving the Holocaust. Critics assert that the very fact that religion was the primary selector for research subjects may have introduced a bias, and that the fact that all subjects were Holocaust survivors may also have had an effect. According to Larson et al. (2000), "[m]ore longitudinal research with better multidimensional measures will help further clarify the roles of these [religious] factors and whether they are beneficial or harmful."&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Larson | first = David B. |author2 = Susan S. Larson |author3 = Harold G. Koenig  |date = October 2000 | title = Research Findings on Religious Commitment and Mental Health | journal = Psychiatric Times | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p001078.html | accessdate= 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] also summarizes a number of apparent benefits which reinforce religious belief. These include prayer appearing to account for successful resolution of problems, "a bulwark against existential anxiety and fear of annihilation," an increased sense of control, companionship with one's deity, a source of self-significance, and group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alcock |first1=James |authorlink1=James Alcock |title=The God Engine |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=32–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostasy===
{{Main|Apostasy}}
{{See also|Existence of God#Arguments against belief in God}}
Typical reasons for rejection of religion include:
* Some people regard certain fundamental doctrines of some religions as illogical, contrary to experience, or unsupported by sufficient [[evidence]]; such people may reject one or more religions for those reasons.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;For example: {{cite web |last= Russell |first = Bertrand |authorlink = Bertrand Russell |date = 1927-03-06 |url = http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |title = Why I am Not a Christian |accessdate = 2006-05-19 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061119081311/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |archivedate = 2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some believers may have difficulty accepting particular religious assertions or doctrines. Some people believe the body of evidence available to humans to be insufficient to justify certain religious beliefs. They may thus disagree with religious interpretations of ethics and human purpose, or with various [[creation myth]]s. This reason has perhaps{{original research inline|date= November 2017}} been aggravated by the protestations and empases of some [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]].
* Some religions include beliefs that certain groups of people are inferior or sinful and deserve contempt, persecution, or even death, and that non-believers will be punished for their unbelief in an [[after-life]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, some [[Muslim]]s believe that women are inferior to men. Some [[Christian]]s share this belief. At the time of the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865, many Southerners used passages from the [[Bible]] to justify race-based [[slavery]]. Certain campaigners have used the Christian religion as a reason to persecute and to deny the rights of homosexuals, on the basis that the Christian biblical God disapproves of homosexuality, and by implication of homosexuals. Compare http://www.godhatesfags.com&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to a religion may feel antipathy to unbelievers. Numerous examples exist of people of one religion or sect using religion as an excuse to murder people with different religious beliefs. To mention just a few
** the slaughter of the [[Huguenot]]s by French [[Catholics]] in the sixteenth century
** [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s killing each other when [[Pakistan]] separated from India in 1947
** the persecution and killing of [[Shiite]] Muslims by [[Sunni]] Muslims in Iraq
** the murder of [[Protestant]]s by [[Catholics]] and vice versa in [[Ireland]] (both of these examples in the late twentieth century)
** the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] that continues {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}. - According to some critics of religion, such beliefs can encourage completely unnecessary conflicts and in some cases even wars. Many [[atheist]]s believe that, because of this, religion is incompatible with world peace, freedom, civil rights, equality, and good government. On the other hand, most religions perceive atheism as a threat and will vigorously and even violently{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} defend themselves against religious sterilization, making the attempt to remove public religious practices a source of strife.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp, Philip (pseudonym of Jeremy Bentham) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=qiRQAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Natural+Religion+on+the+Temporal+Happiness+of+Mankind&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sGJSbzT4Ts&amp;sig=pzV-WU5Jx0cpsVXX08ZU17mL-BE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 ''Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind''], 1822, R.

* Some people may be unable to accept the values that a specific religion promotes and will therefore not join that religion. They may also be unable to accept the proposition that those who do not believe will go to hell or be damned, especially if said nonbelievers are close to the person.
* The maintenance of [[Human life (disambiguation)|life]] and the achievement of [[self-esteem]] require of a person the fullest exercise of reason{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}—but morality (people are taught{{by whom|date=November 2017}}) rests on and requires faith.&lt;ref&gt;Faith is the commitment of one's consciousness to beliefs for which one has no sensory evidence or rational proof. When a person rejects reason as their standard of judgment, only one alternative standard allegedly remains to them: feelings. A mystic is a person who treats feelings as tools of cognition. Faith is the equation of feeling with knowledge. To practice the "virtue" of faith, one must (we are told) be willing to suspend one's sight and one's judgment; one must be willing to live with the unintelligible, with that which cannot be conceptualized or integrated into the rest of one's knowledge, and to induce a trance like illusion of understanding. One must allegedly be willing to repress one's critical faculty and hold it as one's guilt; one must be willing to drown any questions that rise in protest—to strangle any trust of [[reason]] convulsively seeking to assert its proper function as the protector of one's life and cognitive integrity. The presumed human need for self-esteem entails the need for a sense of control over reality—but no control is possible in a universe which, by one's own concession, contains the supernatural, the miraculous and the causeless, a universe in which one is at the mercy of ghosts and demons, in which one must deal, not with the unknown, but with the unknowable; no control is possible if a person proposes, but a ghost disposes; no control is possible if the universe is a haunted house. A person's life and self-esteem require that the object and concern of his or her consciousness be reality and this earth—but morality, people are taught, consists of scorning this earth and the world available to sensory perception, and of contemplating, instead, a "different" and "higher" reality, a realm inaccessible to reason and incommunicable in language, but attainable by revelation, by special dialectical processes, by that superior state of intellectual lucidity known to Zen-Buddhists as "No-Mind," or by death. A person's life and self-esteem require that this person take pride in their power to think, pride in their power to live—but morality, people are taught, holds pride, and specifically intellectual pride, as the gravest of sins. Virtue begins, people are taught, with humility: with the recognition of the helplessness, the smallness, the impotence of one's mind. A person's life and self-esteem purportedly require the person to be loyal to their values, loyal to their mind and its judgments, loyal to their life—but the essence of morality, people are taught, consists of self-sacrifice: the sacrifice of one's mind to some higher authority, and the sacrifice of one's values to whoever may claim to require it. A sacrifice, it is necessary to remember, means the surrender of a higher value in favor of a lower value or of a nonvalue. If one gives up that which one does not value in order to obtain that which one does value—or if one gives up a lesser value in order to  obtain a greater one—this is not a sacrifice, but a gain. Remember further that all of a person's values allegedly exist in a hierarchy; people value some things more than others; and, to the extent that a person is rational, the hierarchical order of the person's values is rational: that is, the person values things in proportion to their importance in serving this person's life and well-being. That which is inimical to their life and well-being, that which is inimical to their nature and needs as a living being, the person disvalues. Conversely, one of the characteristics of mental illness is a distorted value structure; the neurotic does not value things according to their objective merit, in relation to the person's nature and needs; they frequently value the very things that will lead them to self-destruction. Judged by objective standards, they are engaged in a chronic process of self-sacrifice. But if sacrifice is a virtue, it is not the neurotic but the rational person who must be “cured”. They must learn to do violence to their own rational judgment—to reverse the order of their value hierarchy—to surrender that which their mind has chosen as the good—to turn against and invalidate their own consciousness.{{cite book

==Systems==
A '''belief system''' is a set of mutually supportive beliefs. The beliefs of any such system can be classified as [[Religious belief|religious]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[politics|political]], [[Ideology|ideological]], or a combination of these. Philosopher [[Jonathan Glover]] says that beliefs are always part of a belief system, and that tenanted belief systems are difficult for the tenants to completely revise or reject.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth A. Minton, Lynn R. Khale|title=Belief Systems, Religion, and Behavioral Economics|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=Business Expert Press LLC|isbn=978-1-60649-704-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilbert, sociological perspectives===
A collective belief is referred to when people speak of what 'we' believe when this is not simply elliptical for what 'we all' believe.

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote of collective beliefs and proposed that they, like all '[[social fact]]s', 'inhered in' social [[Group (sociology)|groups]] as opposed to individual persons. Durkheim's discussion of collective belief, though suggestive, is relatively obscure.

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Margaret Gilbert]] has offered a related account in terms of the joint commitment of a number of persons to accept a certain belief as a body. According to this account, individuals who together collectively believe something need not personally believe it themselves.  Gilbert's work on the topic has stimulated a developing literature among philosophers. One question that has arisen is whether and how philosophical accounts of belief in general need to be sensitive to the possibility of collective belief.

===Glover===
Jonathan Glover believes that he and other philosophers ought to play some role in starting dialogues between people with deeply held, opposing beliefs, especially if there is risk of violence. Glover also believes that philosophy can offer insights about beliefs that would be relevant to such dialogue.

[[File:Snipa.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Philosopher Jonathan Glover warns that belief systems are like whole boats in the water; it is extremely difficult to alter them all at once (e.g., it may be too stressful, or people may maintain their biases without realizing it).&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;]]
Glover suggests that beliefs have to be considered holistically, and that no belief exists in isolation in the mind of the believer. It always implicates and relates to other beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; Glover provides the example of a patient with an illness who returns to a doctor, but the doctor says that the prescribed medicine is not working. At that point, the patient has a great deal of flexibility in choosing what beliefs to keep or reject: the patient could believe that the doctor is incompetent, that the doctor's assistants made a mistake, that the patient's own body is unique in some unexpected way, that Western medicine is ineffective, or even that Western science is entirely unable to discover truths about ailments.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover maintains that any person can continue to hold any belief if they would really like to&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; (e.g., with help from [[ad hoc hypotheses]]). One belief can be held fixed, and other beliefs will be altered around it. Glover warns that some beliefs may not be entirely [[Explicit memory|explicitly]] believed (e.g., some people may not realize they have racist belief systems adopted from their environment as a child). Glover believes that people tend to first realize that beliefs can change, and may be contingent on their upbringing, around age 12 or 15.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover emphasizes that beliefs are difficult to change. He says that one may try to rebuild one's beliefs on more secure foundations ([[axioms]]), like building a new house, but warns that this may not be possible. Glover offers the example of [[René Descartes]], saying about Descartes that "[h]e starts off with the characteristic beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman; he then junks the lot, he rebuilds the system, and somehow it looks a lot like the beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman." To Glover, belief systems are not like houses but are instead like boats. As Glover puts it: "Maybe the whole thing needs rebuilding, but inevitably at any point you have to keep enough of it intact to keep floating."&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover's final message is that if people talk about their beliefs, they may find more deep, relevant, philosophical ways in which they disagree (e.g., less obvious beliefs, or more deeply held beliefs). Glover thinks that people often manage to find agreements and consensus through philosophy. He says that at the very least, if people do not convert each other, they will hold their own beliefs more openmindedly and will be less likely to go to war over conflicting beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/10/jonathan-glover-on-systems-of-belief.html "Jonathan Glover on systems of belief", Philosophy Bites Podcast, Oct 9 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GloverBeliefs&gt;[http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts '' 'Philosophy, Beliefs, and Conflict' '', JonathanGlover.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
The British philosopher [[Stephen Law]] has described some belief systems (including belief in [[homeopathy]], [[psychic powers]], and [[alien abduction]]) as "[[wiktionary:claptrap|claptrap]]" and said that they "draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves to victory... if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again".&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Scientist]]'' (magazine), 11 June 2011 [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028160.200-a-field-guide-to-bullshit.html A field guide to bullshit | New Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christine Buci-Glucksmann''' is a French [[philosopher]] and Professor Emeritus from [[University of Paris VIII]] specializing in the [[aesthetics]] of the [[Baroque]], [[Japan]] and [[computer art]]. Her best-known work in English is ''Baroque Reason: The Aesthetics of Modernity''.

==Background==

Christine Buci-Glucksmann began her work as a philosopher in the 1970s with [[political]] studies of [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]]. She followed this with research into [[aesthetics]], based primarily around a study of the work of [[Walter Benjamin]]. This achievement was followed by her study into the aesthetics of the [[perception]] of the [[Baroque]], which was published as "La Raison baroque" in 1984 and then again with ''La folie du voir'' in 1986. In this, her major accomplishment, she cites [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] as being most salient to her concerns.

She followed this interval with an investigation into the aesthetics of the [[Virtuality|virtual]] with two books: ''La folie du voir: Une esthétique du virtuel'' and ''Esthetique De L'ephemere''. She has written numerous books and articles about [[digital art]] (for example ''L'art à l'époque virtuel'' (Art in the Age of Virtuality)) and [[new media art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Gere]], ''Art, Time and Technology: Histories of the Disappearing Body'' (2005) Berg, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; She has also written extensively on artists from [[China]], for in example in ''Les modernités chinoises''.

'''Consequentialism''' is the class of [[normative ethics|normative ethical theories]] holding that the [[wikt:consequence|consequences]] of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission from acting) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. 

Consequentialism is primarily non-prescriptive, meaning the moral worth of an action is determined by its potential consequence, not by whether it follows a set of written edicts or laws. One example would entail lying under the threat of government punishment to save an innocent person's life, even though it is illegal to lie under oath.

Consequentialism is usually contrasted with [[deontological ethics]] (or ''deontology''), in that deontology, in which rules and moral duty are central, derives the rightness or wrongness of one's conduct from the character of the behaviour itself rather than the outcomes of the conduct. It is also contrasted with [[virtue ethics]], which focuses on the character of the agent rather than on the nature or consequences of the act (or omission) itself, and [[pragmatic ethics]] which treats morality like science: advancing socially over the course of many lifetimes, such that any moral criterion is subject to revision. Consequentialist theories differ in how they define [[Value theory|moral goods]].

Some argue that consequentialist and deontological theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, [[T. M. Scanlon]] advances the idea that [[human rights]], which are commonly considered a "deontological" concept, can only be justified with reference to the consequences of having those rights.&lt;ref name="Scheffler"/&gt; Similarly, [[Robert Nozick]] argues for a theory that is mostly consequentialist, but incorporates inviolable "side-constraints" which restrict the sort of actions agents are permitted to do.&lt;ref name="Scheffler"/&gt;

Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike utilitarianism, which views utility as the sole moral good, "the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are... order, material wealth, and increase in population".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{Cite book| title = [[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]] | year = 1999 | last =Loewe | first = Michael | last2= Shaughnessy | first2= Edward L. |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-47030-8|page=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Mozi]]'s era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The "material wealth" of Mohist consequentialism refers to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|basic needs]] like shelter and clothing, and the "order" of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy | year = 2011 | last = Van Norden | first = Bryan W. | publisher = [[Hackett Publishing]] | isbn = 978-1-60384-468-0 | page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[sinologist]] [[David S.

The Mohists believed that morality is based on "promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven".

===Utilitarianism===
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]], best known for his advocacy of [[utilitarianism]]]]

{{quote|Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think...| Jeremy Bentham, ''The Principles of Morals and Legislation'' (1789) Ch I, p 1
}}

In summary, [[Jeremy Bentham]] states that people are driven by their interests and their fears, but their interests take precedence over their fears, and their interests are carried out in accordance with how people view the consequences that might be involved with their interests. "Happiness" on this account is defined as the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of pain.
Historically, hedonistic utilitarianism is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. This form of utilitarianism holds that what matters is the aggregate happiness; the happiness of everyone and not the happiness of any particular person. [[John Stuart Mill]], in his exposition of hedonistic utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Utilitarianism | year = 1998 | last = Mill | first = John Stuart | authorlink = John Stuart Mill | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2 | url = http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some contemporary utilitarians, such as [[Peter Singer]], are concerned with maximizing the satisfaction of preferences, hence "[[preference utilitarianism]]". Other contemporary forms of utilitarianism mirror the forms of consequentialism outlined below.

===Ethical egoism===
{{Main|Ethical egoism}}

[[Ethical egoism]] can be understood as a consequentialist theory according to which the consequences for the individual agent are taken to matter more than any other result. Thus, egoism will prescribe actions that may be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to the welfare of others.  Some, like [[Henry Sidgwick]], argue that a certain degree of egoism ''promotes'' the general welfare of society for two reasons: because individuals know how to please themselves best, and because if everyone were an austere altruist then general welfare would inevitably decrease.&lt;ref name="Sidgwick"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Method of Ethics |year=1907 |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Sidgwick |publisher=Dover (1981) |location=NY |isbn=0-915145-28-6 |url=http://www.la.utexas.edu/methsidg/me/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209092717/http://www.la.utexas.edu/methsidg/me/ |archivedate=December 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical altruism===
{{Main|Altruism (ethics)}}
[[Altruism (ethics)|Ethical altruism]] can be seen as a consequentialist ethic which prescribes that an individual take actions that have the best consequences for everyone except for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethics |first=James |last=Fisher |first2=Bradley |last2=Dowdwen |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was advocated by [[Auguste Comte]], who coined the term "altruism," and whose ethics can be summed up in the phrase "Live for others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moran |first=Gabriel |title=Christian Religion and National Interests |date=2006 |url=https://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/APRRE04.pdf }}{{reliable source|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule consequentialism===
{{See also|Rule utilitarianism}}
In general, consequentialist theories focus on actions. However, this need not be the case. Rule consequentialism is a theory that is sometimes seen as an attempt to reconcile [[deontology]] and consequentialism—and in some cases, this is stated as a criticism of rule consequentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Williams, "Utilitarianism" in his ''Morality'', Cambridge University Press 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  Like deontology, rule consequentialism holds that moral behavior involves following certain rules. However, rule consequentialism chooses rules based on the consequences that the selection of those rules has. Rule consequentialism exists in the forms of [[rule utilitarianism]] and [[rule egoism]].

Various theorists are split as to whether the rules are the only determinant of moral behavior or not. For example, [[Robert Nozick]] holds that a certain set of minimal rules, which he calls "side-constraints", are necessary to ensure appropriate actions.&lt;ref name="Scheffler"/&gt; There are also differences as to how absolute these moral rules are. Thus, while Nozick's side-constraints are absolute restrictions on behavior, [[Amartya Sen]] proposes a theory that recognizes the importance of certain rules, but these rules are not absolute.&lt;ref name="Scheffler"/&gt; That is, they may be violated if strict adherence to the rule would lead to much more undesirable consequences.

One of the most common objections to rule-consequentialism is that it is incoherent, because it is based on the consequentialist principle that what we should be concerned with is maximizing the good, but then it tells us not to act to maximize the good, but to follow rules (even in cases where we know that breaking the rule could produce better results).

[[Brad Hooker]] avoided this objection by not basing his form of rule-consequentialism on the ideal of maximizing the good. He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;…the best argument for rule-consequentialism is not that it derives from an overarching commitment to maximise the good. The best argument for rule-consequentialism is that it does a better job than its rivals of matching and tying together our moral convictions, as well as offering us help with our moral disagreements and uncertainties.&lt;ref&gt;Brad Hooker, ''Ideal Code, Real World'' Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Derek Parfit]] described Brad Hooker's book on rule-consequentialism ''Ideal Code, Real World'' as the "best statement and defence, so far, of one of the most important moral theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brad |last=Hooker |title=Ideal Code, Real World |publisher= Oxford University Press, new edition 2002, back cover |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/reader/0199256578/278-8451642-5085302?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sib_rdr_bc&amp;j=0&amp;page=234#reader-page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rule-consequentialism may offer a means to reconcile pure consequentialism with [[deontology|deontological]], or rules-based ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |first=Jeevan |last=D'Souza |title=On Measuring the Moral Value of Action |publisher= Philos, China |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeevan_Dsouza2/publication/301688068_On_Measuring_the_Moral_Value_of_Action/links/59d8ee11a6fdcc2aad0d86cf/On-Measuring-the-Moral-Value-of-Action.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-level consequentialism===
The two-level approach involves engaging in critical reasoning and considering all the possible ramifications of one's actions before making an ethical decision, but reverting to generally reliable moral rules when one is not in a position to stand back and examine the dilemma as a whole. In practice, this equates to adhering to rule consequentialism when one can only reason on an intuitive level, and to act consequentialism when in a position to stand back and reason on a more critical level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/consequentialism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Sinnott-Armstrong|first=Walter|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

This position can be described as a reconciliation between act consequentialism – in which the morality of an action is determined by that action's effects – and rule consequentialism – in which moral behavior is derived from following rules that lead to positive outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The two-level approach to consequentialism is most often associated with [[R. M. Hare]] and [[Peter Singer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Motive consequentialism===
Another consequentialist version is motive consequentialism which looks at whether the state of affairs that results from the motive to choose an action is better or at least as good as each of the alternative state of affairs that would have resulted from alternative actions. This version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. An act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. A possible inference is, that one can not be blamed for mistaken judgments if the motivation was to do good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adams |first=R. M. |year=1976 |title=Motive Utilitarianism |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=73 |issue=14 |pages=467–81 |doi=10.2307/2025783 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative consequentialism===
Most consequentialist theories focus on ''promoting'' some sort of good consequences. However, [[negative utilitarianism]] lays out a consequentialist theory that focuses solely on minimizing bad consequences.

One major difference between these two approaches is the agent's responsibility. Positive consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism requires that we avoid bad ones. Stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. In weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. An example of this is the [[Slippery slope|Slippery Slope]] Argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act on the grounds that it may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haigh|first=Matthew|last2=Wood|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Stewart|first3=Andrew J.|date=2016-07-01|title=Slippery slope arguments imply opposition to change|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-016-0596-9|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=819–836|doi=10.3758/s13421-016-0596-9|issn=0090-502X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often "negative" consequentialist theories assert that reducing suffering is more important than increasing pleasure. [[Karl Popper]], for example, claimed "…from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure...". (While Popper is not a consequentialist per se, this is taken as a classic statement of negative utilitarianism.) When considering a theory of justice, negative consequentialists may use a statewide or global-reaching principle: the reduction of suffering (for the disadvantaged) is more valuable than increased pleasure (for the affluent or luxurious).

===Teleological ethics===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}

Teleological ethics (Greek telos, "end"; logos, "science") is an ethical theory that holds that the ends or consequences of an act determine whether an act is good or evil. Teleological theories are often discussed in opposition to [[deontological]] ethical theories, which hold that acts themselves are ''inherently'' good or evil, regardless of the consequences of acts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The [[saying]], "the [[End (philosophy)|end]] justifies the [[wikt:the end justifies the means|means]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=104|last=Mizzoni|first=John|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|title=Ethics: The Basics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AsGbVvQA23oC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22justify+the+means%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that if a goal is morally important enough, any method of achieving it is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/the-end-justifies-the-means Cambridge Dictionary: the end justifies the means]&lt;/ref&gt;

Teleological theories differ on the nature of the end that actions ought to promote. [[Eudaemonist]] theories (Greek eudaimonia, "happiness") hold that the goal of ethics consists in some function or activity appropriate to man as a human being, and thus tend to emphasize the cultivation of virtue or excellence in the agent as the end of all action. These could be the classical virtues—[[courage]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[Justice (virtue)|justice]], and [[wisdom]]—that promoted the Greek ideal of man as the "rational animal", or the theological virtues—[[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[hope]], and [[love]]—that distinguished the Christian ideal of man as a being created in the image of God.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[File:JohnStuartMill.jpg|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]], an influential liberal thinker of the 19th century and a teacher of [[utilitarianism]]]]
Utilitarian-type theories hold that the end consists in an experience or feeling produced by the action. [[Hedonism]], for example, teaches that this feeling is pleasure—either one's own, as in egoism (the 17th-century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]), or everyone's, as in universalistic hedonism, or [[utilitarianism]] (the 19th-century English philosophers [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Henry Sidgwick]]), with its formula of the "greatest pleasure of the greatest number".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Other utilitarian-type views include the claims that the end of action is survival and growth, as in [[evolutionary ethics]] (the 19th-century English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]); the experience of power, as in [[despotism]]; satisfaction and adjustment, as in [[pragmatism]] (20th-century American philosophers [[Ralph Barton Perry]] and [[John Dewey]]); and freedom, as in [[existentialism]] (the 20th-century French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The chief problem for [[eudaemonist]] theories is to show that leading a life of virtue will also be attended by happiness—by the winning of the goods regarded as the chief end of action. That [[Job (Bible)|Job]] should suffer and [[Socrates]] and [[Jesus]] die while the wicked prosper, then seems unjust. Eudaemonists generally reply that the universe is moral and that, in Socrates' words, "No evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death," or, in Jesus' words, "But he who endures to the end will be saved." (Matt 10:22).

Utilitarian theories, on the other hand, must answer the charge that ends do not justify the means. The problem arises in these theories because they tend to separate the achieved ends from the action by which these ends were produced. One implication of utilitarianism is that one's intention in performing an act may include all of its foreseen consequences. The goodness of the intention then reflects the balance of the good and evil of these consequences, with no limits imposed upon it by the nature of the act itself—even if it be, say, the breaking of a promise or the execution of an innocent man. Utilitarianism, in answering this charge, must show either that what is apparently immoral is not really so or that, if it really is so, then closer examination of the consequences will bring this fact to light. Ideal utilitarianism ([[G.E. Moore]] and [[Hastings Rashdall]]) tries to meet the difficulty by advocating a plurality of ends and including among them the attainment of virtue itself, which, as [[John Stuart Mill]] affirmed, "may be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great intensity as any other good".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Acts and omissions, and the "act and omissions doctrine"===
Since pure consequentialism holds that an action is to be judged solely by its result, most consequentialist theories hold that a deliberate action is no different from a deliberate decision not to act. This contrasts with the "acts and omissions doctrine", which is upheld by some medical ethicists and some religions: it asserts there is a significant moral distinction between acts and deliberate non-actions which lead to the same outcome. This contrast is brought out in issues such as [[voluntary euthanasia]].

==Issues==

===Action guidance===
One important characteristic of many [[Normative ethics|normative]] moral theories such as consequentialism is the ability to produce practical moral judgements. At the very least, any moral theory needs to define the standpoint from which the goodness of the consequences are to be determined. What is primarily at stake here is the ''[[moral responsibility|responsibility]]'' of the agent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

====The ideal observer====
One common tactic among consequentialists, particularly those committed to an [[Altruism|altruistic]] (selfless) account of consequentialism, is to employ an ideal, neutral observer from which moral judgements can be made. [[John Rawls]], a critic of utilitarianism, argues that utilitarianism, in common with other forms of consequentialism, relies on the perspective of such an ideal observer.&lt;ref name="Scheffler"/&gt; The particular characteristics of this ideal observer can vary from an omniscient observer, who would grasp all the consequences of any action, to an ideally informed observer, who knows as much as could reasonably be expected, but not necessarily all the circumstances or all the possible consequences. Consequentialist theories that adopt this paradigm hold that right action is the action that will bring about the best consequences from this ideal observer's perspective.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

====The real observer====
In practice, it is very difficult, and at times arguably impossible, to adopt the point of view of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know everything about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation.&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mackie |first=J. L. |authorlink=J. L. Mackie |origyear=1977 |title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-013558-8 |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Consequences for whom===
[[File:Surveyed Consequences of Whistleblowing.png|thumb|Surveyed consequences of [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]]]]

Moral action always has consequences for certain people or things. Varieties of consequentialism can be differentiated by the beneficiary of the good consequences. That is, one might ask "Consequences for whom?"

====Agent-focused or agent-neutral====
A fundamental distinction can be drawn between theories which require that agents act for ends perhaps disconnected from their own interests and drives, and theories which permit that agents act for ends in which they have some personal interest or [[motivation]].  These are called "agent-neutral" and "agent-focused" theories respectively.

Agent-neutral consequentialism ignores the specific value a state of affairs has for any particular agent. Thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor's personal goals do not count any more than anyone else's goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. Thus, in an agent-focused account, such as one that [[Peter Railton]] outlines, the agent might be concerned with the general welfare, but the agent is ''more'' concerned with the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.&lt;ref name="Scheffler"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Consequentialism and Its Critics | year = 1988 | last = Scheffler | first = Samuel (Ed.) | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-875073-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two approaches could be reconciled by acknowledging the tension between an agent's interests as an individual and as a member of various groups, and seeking to somehow optimize among all of these interests.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} For example, it may be meaningful to speak of an action as being good for someone as an individual, but bad for them as a citizen of their town.

====Human-centered?====
Many consequentialist theories may seem primarily concerned with human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue that we should not limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. [[Jeremy Bentham]], who is regarded as the founder of [[utilitarianism]], argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern.&lt;ref name="Bentham"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Principles of Moral Legislation |year=1996 |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Bentham |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-820516-6 |url=http://www.la.utexas.edu/research/poltheory/bentham/ipml/ipml.toc.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105091421/http://www.la.utexas.edu/research/poltheory/bentham/ipml/ipml.toc.html |archivedate=January 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Peter Singer]] has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Unsanctifying Human Life | last = Singer | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Singer | editor = Helga Kuhse, ed. | year = 2002 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-631-22507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.

===Value of consequences===
One way to divide various consequentialisms is by the types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase in [[pleasure]], and the best action is one that results in the most pleasure for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral "pleasure". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.

===Virtue ethics===
Consequentialism can also be contrasted with [[arete (moral virtue)|aretaic]] moral theories such as [[virtue ethics]]. Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be the primary focus of our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, [[Philippa Foot]] argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence.&lt;ref name="Scheffler"/&gt;

However, consequentialism and virtue ethics need not be entirely antagonistic. [[Iain King]] has developed an approach that reconciles the two schools.&lt;ref&gt;King, Ian (2008). ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]],'' London: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}}{{better source|date=August 2018}} Other consequentialists consider effects on the character of people involved in an action when assessing consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}{{Clarify|What issue in consequentialism is being discussed here?|date=February 2012}}
[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|Max Weber]]

===Ultimate end===
The ''ultimate end'' is a concept in the moral philosophy of [[Max Weber]], in which individuals act in a faithful, rather than rational, manner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

{{quote|We must be clear about the fact that all ethically oriented conduct may be guided by one of two fundamentally differing and irreconcilably opposed maxims: conduct can be oriented to an "ethic of ultimate ends" or to an "ethic of responsibility." This is not to say that an ethic of ultimate ends is identical with irresponsibility, or that an ethic of responsibility is identical with unprincipled opportunism. Naturally, nobody says that. However, there is an abysmal contrast between conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of ultimate ends—that, is in religious terms, "the Christian does rightly and leaves the results with the Lord"—and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of responsibility, in which case one has to give an account of the foreseeable results of one's action.|Max Weber, ''Politics as a Vocation'',  1918}}

==Etymology==
The term "consequentialism" was {{cns|text=coined by|reason=is this the first use of the term "consequentialism"?|date=March 2016}} [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].&lt;ref name="Anscombe"&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=G. E. M. Anscombe |title=Modern Moral Philosophy |journal=Philosophy |volume=33 |pages=1–19 |url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html |doi=10.1017/S0031819100037943 |year=1958 |author=Anscombe, G. E. M. |publisher=1958|issue=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase and concept of "The end justifies the means" are at least as old as the first century BC. [[Ovid]] wrote in his [[Heroides]] that ''Exitus acta probat'' "The result justifies the deed".

==Criticisms==
[[G. E. M. Anscombe]] objects to consequentialism on the grounds that it does not provide ethical guidance in what one ought to do because there is no distinction between [[Principle of double effect#Intentional harm versus side effects|consequences that are foreseen and those that are intended]].&lt;ref name="Anscombe"/&gt;{{full citation needed|Absence of distinction between foreseen and intended consequences|date=November 2012}}

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:BernardWilliams.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernard Williams]]]] --&gt;
[[Bernard Williams]] has argued that consequentialism is alienating because it requires moral agents to put too much distance between themselves and their own projects and commitments. Williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly impersonal view of all actions, since it is only the consequences, and not who produces them, that are said to matter. Williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents—since (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects and commitments in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. He argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it can matter whether or not someone is personally the author of a particular consequence. For example, that participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent's participation.&lt;!-- This really needs a quick discussion of William's firing-squad example. Maybe I'll add this later; but I wouldn't mind if someone beat me to it, either. --&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams1973&gt;Smart, J.J.C. and Williams, Bernard. ''Utilitarianism: For and Against''. Cambridge University Press, 1973, pp. 98 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consequentialists—most notably [[Peter Railton]]—have attempted to develop a form of consequentialism that acknowledges and avoids the objections raised by Williams. Railton argues that Williams's criticisms can be avoided by adopting a form of consequentialism in which moral decisions are to be determined by the sort of life that they express. On his account, the agent should choose the sort of life that will, on the whole, produce the best overall effects.&lt;ref name="Scheffler"/&gt;

'''Daniel Bensaïd''' (25 March 1946 – 12 January 2010&lt;ref&gt;Laure Equy, "[http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/0101613356-le-theoricien-de-la-lcr-daniel-bensaid-est-mort Le théoricien de la LCR, Daniel Bensaïd, est mort]", ''[[Libération]]'', 12 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[philosopher]] and a leader of the [[Trotskyist]] movement in [[France]]. He became a leading figure in the student revolt of 1968, while studying at the [[University of Paris X: Nanterre]].

== Life and career ==
Bensaïd was born in [[Toulouse]], France, to a father who was a [[Sephardic Jew]] from [[Algeria]], and who had moved from [[Oran]], where he met Bensaïd's mother, to [[Vichy France|Vichy]] Toulouse.&lt;ref name=guardianobit/&gt; In response to the [[Torture during the Algerian War#The 8 February 1962 Charonne massacre|8 February 1962 Charonne massacre]] of Algerians in [[Paris]], Bensaïd joined the [[Union of Communist Students]]. Irritated by the party orthodoxy he swiftly became part of a left opposition within the union, and was among the dissidents expelled from the party in 1966.&lt;ref name=guardianobit/&gt;

In 1966 Bensaïd began studying at the [[École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud]], where he helped found the ''Jeunesse Communiste Révolutionnaire'', which became the [[Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire]] (LCR).&lt;ref name=guardianobit/&gt; With [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] he helped to found the [[Movement of 22 March|Mouvement du 22 Mars]] (Movement of 22 March), which was involved in the protests of [[May 1968 in France]].&lt;ref name=guardianobit&gt;Tariq Ali, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/14/daniel-bensaid-obituary "Daniel Bensaïd obituary"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bensaïd became a leading theorist of the LCR and the [[United Secretariat of the Fourth International]], and a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Paris-VIII]]. He was also a Fellow at the [[International Institute for Research and Education]]. Upon his death, [[Tariq Ali]] described him as "France's leading Marxist public intellectual, much in demand on talkshows and writing essays and reviews in ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[Libération]]''."&lt;ref name=guardianobit/&gt; Bensaïd was known for his studies of [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Karl Marx]], and a recent analysis of French [[postmodernism]].

He died of [[cancer]] arising from the side effects of drugs used to treat [[AIDS]], which he had had for the previous 16 years.&lt;ref name=guardianobit/&gt;

== Criticism and debate ==
Bensaïd and the current of Trotskyism represented by the Unified Secretariat of the Fourth International have come under attack from more orthodox Trotskyists for the strategy they have advanced of entering the "new social movements"; in particular, for seeing reform and revolution as a [[false dichotomy]], and proposing the formation of "broad parties," rather than forming parties of the traditional Leninist type. In one such critique, Luke Cooper criticised Bensaïd for arguing that—in certain specific circumstances—it maybe permissible to enter a capitalist government, and seek to use the existing state as an instrument of revolutionary transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifthinternational.org/content/daniel-bensa%C3%AFd-and-%E2%80%9Creturn-strategy%E2%80%9D Daniel Bensaïd and the “Return of Strategy”]&lt;/ref&gt; Bensaïd also debated revolutionary strategy with other Fourth International members, and the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]'s International Secretary  [[Alex Callinicos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1349 "Hegemony and the United Front"]; [http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=287&amp;issue=113 "The Return of Strategy".]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David George Ritchie''' (1853–1903) was a Scottish philosopher who had a distinguished university career at [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and after being [[fellow]] of [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]] and a tutor at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] was elected professor of logic and metaphysics at [[university of St Andrews|St Andrews]]. He was also the third president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] in 1898.

==Life==
[[File:The grave of Prof David George Ritchie, Eastern Cemetery, St Andrews.jpg|thumb|The grave of Prof David George Ritchie, Eastern Cemetery, St Andrews]]
Ritchie was born at [[Jedburgh]] on 26 October 1853.  He was the only son of the three children of George Ritchie, D.D., minister of the parish and a man of scholarship and culture, who was elected to the office of moderator of the general assembly of the [[Church of Scotland]] in 1870. His mother was Elizabeth Bradfute Dudgeon. The family was connected with the [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyles]], and early in 1889 Ritchie edited a volume of ''Early Letters of [[Jane Welsh Carlyle]].''{{sfn|Haldane|1912}}

Ritchie received his early schooling at Jedburgh Academy. Not allowed to make friends with other boys of his own age, he never learned to play games, and lived a solitary life, concentrating his mind on purely intellectual subjects. He matriculated in 1869 at [[Edinburgh University]], where he made a special study of classics under Professors [[William Young Sellar]] and [[John Stuart Blackie|J. S. Blackie]], while he began to study philosophy under Professor Campbell Fraser, in whose class and in that of Professor [[Henry Calderwood]] (on moral philosophy) he gained the highest prizes. After graduating M.A. at Edinburgh in 1875 with first-class honours in classics, Ritchie gained a classical exhibition at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and won a first-class both in classical moderations (Michaelmas 1875) and in the final classical school (Trinity term, 1878). In 1878 he became a fellow of [[Jesus College, Oxford]] and in 1881 a tutor. From 1882 to 1886 he was also a tutor at Balliol College. At Oxford Ritchie came under the influence of [[Thomas Hill Green]] and [[Arnold Toynbee]], and it was there that the foundations were laid both for his interest in idealistic
philosophy associated with the name of [[G. W. F. Hegel]] (see [[British idealism]]), and also of his strong bent toward practical politics; his political philosophy was dominated by the belief that practical action must be derived from principles.{{sfn|Haldane|1912}}

Ritchie married twice. His first marriage was in 1881 to Flora Lindsay, daughter of Col. A. A. Macdonell of Lochgarry, and sister of Professor A. A. Macdonell of Oxford. Flora died in 1888. He was married a second time in 1889 to Ellen Haycraft, sister of [[John Berry Haycraft|Professor John Berry Haycraft]]. He had a daughter by the first marriage and a son, [[Arthur David Ritchie]], by the second.{{sfn|Haldane|1912}}

In 1894 Ritchie left Oxford on being appointed professor of logic and metaphysics at the [[University of St. Andrews]]. At this time the university was in the midst of a turmoil of conflicting interests which involved litigation and much partisan feeling. In this conflict Ritchie supported the side of progress, which ultimately prevailed. 

D. G. Ritchie was a founding member, and the third President (1898–1899), of the [[Aristotelian Society]], an influential academic organisation that is still very much in active existence.

He remained at St. Andrews until his death on 3 February 1903.{{sfn|Haldane|1912}} He is buried in the north-east corner of the Eastern Cemetery in [[St Andrews]] beneath a large black granite cross.

==Philosophy==
Both at Oxford and at St. Andrews, Ritchie wrote mostly on ethics and political philosophy. One of his earliest writings was an essay on ''The Rationality of History,'' contributed to [https://archive.org/details/essaysinphilosop00sethrich ''Essays in Philosophical Criticism,''] written in 1883 by a number of young men influenced by Hegel and his interpreters. He was very much one of the generation of thinkers who were sometimes referred to as the '''Young Hegelians'''.

Of a simple and unaffected nature, Ritchie pursued the truth he set himself to seek with an entire devotion. Despite his retiring manner, he had many friends. He held strongly that questions of ethics and politics must be regarded from a metaphysical point of view. For him the foundation of ethics necessarily rested on the ideal end of social well-being, and keeping this end in view, he proceeded to trace its history at different times, the manner in which it shapes itself in the mind of each individual, and the way in which it can be developed and realised. Ritchie was an advanced liberal with socialist leanings. He considered that the ultimate value of religion depended on the ideal it set before mankind when it represented its highest form.{{sfn|Haldane|1912}}

'''''Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays''''' is a 1974 book by economist [[Murray Rothbard]]. The book represents the author's theorizing on topics impacting human liberty. Rothbard looks beyond conventional left-right thinking and hence contributes to the groundwork for the current intellectual challenge against centralized social and economic management.

The book's title comes from the lead essay, which argues that [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian theory]] always results in a politics of [[Statism|statist]] control because it is founded on revolt against the ontological structure of reality itself. According to Rothbard in this lead essay, statist intellectuals attempt to replace what exists with a Romantic image of an idealized primitive state of nature, an ideal which cannot and should not be achieved, according to Rothbard. The implications of this point are worked out on topics such as market economics, child rights, environmentalism, feminism, foreign policy, redistribution and others.

[[Roy Childs]] writes in the Foreword:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For until Rothbard's work is carefully studied by every advocate of liberty, the value of his contributions to the libertarian system cannot be fully appreciated and, moreover, the unity and true historical context of libertarianism will not even be fully grasped.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4347">'''General intellect''', according to [[Karl Marx]] in his ''[[Grundrisse]]'', became a crucial  [[productive forces|force of production]]. It is a combination of [[technological]] [[expertise]] and [[social]] [[intellect]], or general [[social knowledge]] (increasing importance of [[machine]]ry in [[social organization]]). The "general intellect" passage in the Fragment section of ''Grundrisse'', shows that, while the development of machinery led to the oppression of workers under [[capitalism]], it also offers a prospect for future liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading Marx in the Information Age: A Media and Communication Studies Perspective on Capital, Volume 1|last=Fuchs|first=Christian|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138948556|location=New York|pages=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; I

==Overview==
{{Quote|text="Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature. They are organs of the human brain, created by the human hand; the power of knowledge, objectified. The development of [[fixed capital]] indicates to what degree general [[social knowledge]] has become a direct [[productive forces|force of production]], and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of [[Social relation|social life]] itself have come under the control of the ''general intellect'' and been transformed in accordance with it; to what degree the powers of [[social production]] have been produced, not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of social practice, of the real life process."|sign=[[Karl Marx]]|source=''The Grundrisse'', 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch14.htm The Grundrisse.'' Notebook VII. Fixed capital and [[circulating capital]] as two particular kinds of capital. Fixed capital and continuity of the [[production process]]. – Machinery and living labour. (Business of inventing)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Marx, the development of the general intellect manifests in a [[capitalist society]], in the control of the social life process. In other words, with the idea of the general intellect, Marx designates a radical change of the subsumption of [[Labor force|labour]] to [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and indicates a third stage of the [[division of labour]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Vercellone. [http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/26/36/61/PDF/historicalpubliepdf.pdf From Formal Subsumption to General Intellect: Elements for a Marxist Reading of the Thesis of Cognitive Capitalism]. ''Historical Materialism'' 15 (2007) 13–36&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has several interpretations. For instance, [[Paolo Virno]] maintained that "general intellect" does not only thrive in communism, as Marx originally thought, since it also characterized other economic systems such as the [[Post-Fordism|post-Fordist capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Marx's Laboratory: Critical Interpretations of the Grundrisse|last=Bellofiore|first=Riccardo|last2=Starosta|first2=Guido|last3=Thomas|first3=Peter|publisher=BRILL|year=2013|isbn=9789004236769|location=Leiden|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, it is suggested that Marx underestimated the extent to which the general intellect would develop within capitalism, particularly in the modern period where the concept is said to have been realised but with no revolutionary or even conflictual repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marx's 'Grundrisse': A Reader's Guide|last=Choat|first=Simon|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2016|isbn=9781472531902|location=London|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5781">'''Georgy Petrovich Shchedrovitsky''' ({{lang-ru|Георгий Петрович Щедровицкий}}) (23 Feb 1929 - 3 Feb 1994) was a [[Russian people|Russian]] Educationalist.&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fondgp.org/gp/biography | title=Georgy Shchedrovitsky | publisher=The Schedrovitsky Institute for Development | accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
He was born to Pyotr Georgievich Shchedrovitsky, a prominent Russian engineer, and Kapitolina Nikolayevna Bayukova, a physician and micro-biologist. His father was the Director of [[Orgaviaprom]], the Research Institute for the Organisation of the Aviation Industry. Thus Georgy grew up interacting with members of the [[nomenklatura]].&lt;ref name="ER"/&gt; In 1946, he started studying [[theoretical physics]] at the [[MSU Faculty of Physics|Physics Department]] of [[Moscow State University]], where he developed an interest in the [[structure of scientific theories]] which in 1949 led to a transfer to the Philosophy Department where he soon focused on logic and [[methodology of science]].

==Interdisciplinary methodologies==
From the 1950s Shchedrovitsky developed a series of seminars which attracted mathematicians, psychologists, historians, architects, sociologists and physicians who focused their discussions of logical and epistemological issues.&lt;ref name="Liborakina"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A bridge between past and future | author=Liborakina, Marina | journal=The Simulation and Gaming Yearbook | year=1994 | volume=4 | pages=41–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became involved in the [[Moscow Methodological Circle]] set up by [[Alexander Zinoviev]]. In 1954, Shchedrovitsky took over leadership of the circle and played a prominent role in developing [[activity theory]]. Here the world was not seen as composed of human subjects and objects as in [[naturalistic theory]]. Rather objects are secondary constructs whose nature depends on the activity applied to them. Shchedrovitsky argued that activity was not so much an attribute of any individual but rather a system within which an individual is "captured" and which determines how they behave. Further he reflected on the task of the scientist, bearing in mind that a particular complex "object" might be viewed from a number of different scientific perspectives: thus the work of the scientist involves not just examining the object within a specific scientific framework, but must also involve the choice of methodology by which the subject is marked as a distinct subject of scientific enquiry.&lt;ref name=Grigorenko&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grigorenko|first1=Elena|editor1-last=Sternberg|editor1-first=Robert J.|title=International Handbook of Intelligence|article=Studying Intelligence: A Soviet/Russian Example|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=200|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 he joined [[Vasily Davydov]] in founding the Commission for The Study of The Psychology of Thought and Logic.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt;

In 1962 he joined [[Vadim Sadovsky]] and [[Erik Yudin]], in creating the ''Interdisciplinary Seminar on Structural and Systemic Methods of Analysis in Science and Technology'' at the ''Commission on Cybernetics'' of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR#The Academy of Sciences of the USSR|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] which was headed by [[Aksel Berg]]. Shchedrovitsky headed the Seminar until 1976.&lt;ref name="foundation"/&gt;

He was a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] from 1956 to 1968 when he was excluded for supporting [[Alexander Ginzburg]] and [[Yuri Galanskov]].&lt;ref name="foundation"/&gt;

==Organizational-activity games==
Shchedrovitsky presented an application of Vygotsky's [[activity theory]] with his development of [[organizational-activity game]]s.&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr|first=Stephen|title=Why Vygotsky?|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/stkerr/whylsv.html|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games were based on an application of Vygotsky's [[content-genetic logic]] to develop method of collective problem solving.&lt;ref name="Schumann"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schumann|first1=Andrew|title=Preface: Logic in Belarusian Thinking|journal=[[Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric]]|date=2008|volume=26|issue=13|pages=7-25|url=http://logika.uwb.edu.pl/studies_old/stud26/as.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2017|publisher=Polish Society for Logic and Philosophy of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He died in the village of [[Bolshevo]] in 1994. The Schedrovitsky Institute for Development was founded in 2005. His son, [[Petr Shchedrovitsky]], continues to use Georgy's techniques to train [[CEO]]s.&lt;ref name="ER"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rindzeviciute|first1=Egle|title=The Future as an Intellectual Technology in the Soviet Union: From Centralised Planning to Reflexive Management|journal=Cahiers du monde Russe|date=2015|volume=56|issue=1|pages=111-134|url=https://www.academia.edu/12175485/The_Future_as_an_Intellectual_Technology_in_the_Soviet_Union_From_Centralised_Planning_to_Reflexive_Management|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glossolalia''' or '''speaking in tongues''' is a phenomenon in which people appear to speak in languages unknown to them. One definition used by linguists is the fluid vocalizing of speech-like syllables that lack any readily comprehended meaning, in some cases as part of religious practice in which it is believed to be a [[divine language]] unknown to the speaker.&lt;ref name=DictPsych&gt;"Glossolalia n." ''A Dictionary of Psychology''. Edited by Andrew M. Colman. Oxford University Press 2009. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/pub/views/home.html Oxford Reference Online]. Retrieved 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Glossolalia is practiced in [[Pentecostal]] and [[charismatic Christianity]] as well as in other religions.&lt;ref name="LumHarvey2018"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lum|first1=Kathryn Gin|last2=Harvey|first2=Paul|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Race in American History|date=1 March 2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780190856892|page=801|quote= ... would prove influential on the development of black Pentecostalism in the early twentieth century, as glossolalia, or speaking in tongues, would be understood as a third work of grace following Holiness and receipt of the Holy Spirit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FahlbuschBromiley1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity|year=1999|publisher=Wm.

Seymour took from Parham the teaching that the baptism of the Holy Spirit was not the blessing of sanctification but rather a third work of grace that was accompanied by the experience of tongues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from {{lang|el|glōssais lalein}}, a Greek phrase used in the [[New Testament]] meaning "to speak in or with tongues [i.e., other languages]" ({{bibleref2|Acts|2:4|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|14:18|NKJV}}).

Sometimes a distinction is made between "glossolalia" and "xenolalia" or "[[xenoglossy]]", which specifically designates when the language being spoken is a [[natural language]] previously unknown to the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Bridges Johns and Frank Macchia, "Glossolalia," The Encyclopedia of Christianity (Grand Rapids, MI; Leiden, Netherlands: Wm. B. Eerdmans; Brill, 1999–2003), 413.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this distinction is not universally made, and the New Testament uses the phrase ''glōssais lalein'' in at least one passage to refer to speaking in languages known to others but not to the speakers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Etymology==
''Glossolalia'' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word γλωσσολαλία, itself a compound of the words γλῶσσα (''glossa''), meaning "tongue" or "language"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dglw%3Dssa γλῶσσα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and λαλέω (''laleō''), "to speak, talk, chat, prattle, or to make a sound".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlale%2Fw λαλέω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek expression (in various forms) appears in the [[New Testament]] in the books of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] and [[First Corinthians]]. In Acts 2, the followers of Christ receive the [[Holy Spirit]] and speak in the languages of at least fifteen countries or ethnic groups.

The exact phrase ''speaking in tongues'' has been used at least since the translation of the New Testament into [[Middle English]] in the [[Wycliffe Bible]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Mark|16:17|53}} in [[Wycliffe's Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Farrar]] first used the word ''glossolalia'' in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistics==
In 1972, William J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto, published a thorough assessment of Pentecostal glossolalia that became a classic work on its linguistic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=William J. |last=Samarin |title=Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1972 |oclc=308527}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assessment was based on a large sample of glossolalia recorded in public and private Christian meetings in Italy, the Netherlands, Jamaica, Canada, and the United States over the course of five years; his wide range of subjects included the Puerto Ricans of the Bronx, the [[Snake handling|snake handlers]] of the Appalachians and the [[Spiritual Christians]] from Russia in Los Angeles (''Pryguny, Dukh-i-zhizniki'').

Samarin found that glossolalic speech does resemble human language in some respects. The speaker uses accent, rhythm, intonation and pauses to break up the speech into distinct units. Each unit is itself made up of syllables, the syllables being formed from consonants and vowels taken from a language known to the speaker:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is verbal behaviour that consists of using a certain number of consonants and vowels...in a limited number of syllables that in turn are organized into larger units that are taken apart and rearranged pseudogrammatically...with variations in pitch, volume, speed and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=William J. |last=Samarin |title=Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1972 |page=120 |oclc=308527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Glossolalia] consists of strings of syllables, made up of sounds taken from all those that the speaker knows, put together more or less haphazardly but emerging nevertheless as word-like and sentence-like units because of realistic, language-like rhythm and melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samarin |first=William J. |title=Sociolinguistic vs. Neurophysiological Explanations for Glossolalia: Comment on Goodman's Paper |jstor=1384556 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=1972 |pages=293–96 |doi=10.2307/1384556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That the sounds are taken from the set of sounds already known to the speaker is confirmed by others. [[Felicitas Goodman]], a psychological anthropologist and linguist, also found that the speech of glossolalists reflected the patterns of speech of the speaker's native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman |first=Felicitas D. |title=Phonetic Analysis of Glossolalia in Four Cultural Settings |jstor=1384336 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=1969 |pages=227–35 |doi=10.2307/1384336}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings were confirmed by Kavan (2004).&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Linguistic Society: Heather Kavan [[Massey University]]: [http://www.nzlingsoc.org/documents/Kavan.pdf Heather Kavan “We don't know what we're saying, but it's profound”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Samarin found that the resemblance to human language was merely on the surface and so concluded that glossolalia is "only a facade of language".&lt;ref name=Samarin128&gt;{{Cite book|first=William J. |last=Samarin |title=Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1972 |page=128 |oclc=308527}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached this conclusion because the syllable string did not form words, the stream of speech was not internally organized, and – most importantly of all – there was no systematic relationship between units of speech and concepts. Humans use language to communicate but glossolalia does not. Therefore, he concluded that glossolalia is not "a specimen of human language because it is neither internally organized nor systematically related to the world man perceives".&lt;ref name="Samarin128"/&gt; On the basis of his linguistic analysis, Samarin defined Pentecostal glossolalia as "meaningless but phonologically structured human [[utterance]], believed by the speaker to be a real language but bearing no systematic resemblance to any natural language, living or dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=William J. |last=Samarin |title=Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1972 |page=2 |oclc=308527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of glossolalia may disagree with linguistic researchers and claim that they are speaking human languages ([[xenoglossia]]). Felicitas Goodman studied a number of Pentecostal communities in the United States, the Caribbean, and Mexico; these included English-, Spanish- and Mayan-speaking groups. She compared what she found with recordings of non-Christian rituals from Africa, Borneo, Indonesia and Japan. She took into account both the segmental structure (such as sounds, syllables, phrases) and the supra-segmental elements (rhythm, accent, intonation) and concluded that there was no distinction between what was practised by the Pentecostal Protestants and the followers of other religions.&lt;ref name="Goodman 1972"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Felicitas D. |last=Goodman |authorlink=Felicitas Goodman |title=Speaking in Tongues: A Cross-Cultural Study in Glossolalia |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1972 |pages= |isbn=978-0-226-30324-6 |oclc=393056}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Classical antiquity===
It was a commonplace idea within the [[Greco-Roman]] world that divine beings spoke languages different from human languages, and historians of religion have identified references to [[esoteric]] speech in Greco-Roman literature that resemble glossolalia, sometimes explained as angelic or [[divine language]]. An example is the account in the [[Testament of Job]], a non-canonical elaboration of the [[Book of Job]], where the daughters of [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] are described as being given sashes enabling them to speak and sing in angelic languages.{{Sfn | Martin | 1995 | pp = 88–89}}

According to Dale B. Martin, glossolalia accorded high status in the ancient world due to its association with the divine. [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]] may have exhibited glossolalia during his episodes of prophetic ecstasy.{{Sfn | Martin | 1995 | p = 90}} [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Iamblichus]] linked glossolalia to [[prophecy]], writing that prophecy was divine [[spirit possession]] that "emits words which are not understood by those that utter them; for they pronounce them, as it is said, with an insane mouth (''mainomenό stomati'') and are wholly subservient, and entirely yield themselves to the energy of the predominating God."{{Sfn | Martin | 1995 | p = 91}}

As part of his attack on [[early Christianity]], the Greek philosopher [[Celsus]] includes an account of Christian glossolalia. Celsus describes prophecies made by several Christians in Palestine and Phoenicia of which he writes, "Having brandished these threats they then go on to add incomprehensible, incoherent, and utterly obscure utterances, the meaning of which no intelligent person could discover: for they are meaningless and nonsensical, and give a chance for any fool or sorcerer to take the words in whatever sense he likes."{{Sfn | Martin | 1995 | p = 90}}

References to speaking in tongues by the [[Church fathers]] are rare. Except for Irenaeus' 2nd-century reference to many in the church speaking all kinds of languages "through the Spirit", and Tertullian's reference in 207 AD to the spiritual gift of interpretation of tongues being encountered in his day, there are no other known first-hand accounts of glossolalia, and very few second-hand accounts among their writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Benjamin B. |last=Warfield |authorlink=Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield |year=1918 |title=Counterfeit Miracles |location=New York |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |oclc=3977281 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DWgrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 10] |quote=The writings of the so-called Apostolic Fathers contain no clear and certain allusions to miracle working or to the exercise of the charismatic gifts, contemporaneously with themselves.|isbn=978-0-85151-166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===400 to 1900===
*5th century [[St. Patrick]] of Ireland ({{circa|387–493}}), in ''The Confession of St. Patrick'', records hearing a strange language being prayed by the Holy Spirit in a dream. St. Patrick says in his book:

{{quote|And another night – God knows, I do not, whether within me or beside me – most words which I heard and could not understand, except at the end of the speech it was represented thus: 'He who gave his life for you, he it is who speaks within you.' And thus I awoke, joyful.&lt;ref name=patrick-confessio24-25&gt;Saint Patrick. ''Confessio'', sections 24 and 25&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

{{quote|And on a second occasion I saw Him praying within me, and I was as it were, inside my own body, and I heard Him above me – that is, above my inner self. He was praying powerfully with sighs. And in the course of this I was astonished and wondering, and I pondered who it could be who was praying within me. But at the end of the prayer it was revealed to me that it was the Spirit. And so I awoke and remembered the Apostle's words: "Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we know not how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for utterance [Romans 8:26]." And again: "The Lord our advocate intercedes for us [Romans 8:27]."&lt;ref name=patrick-confessio24-25/&gt;}}

*12th century – [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], commenting on Mark 16:17 ("they will speak in new tongues"), asked: "For who is there that seems to have these signs of the faith, without which no one, according to this Scripture, shall be saved?"&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, Sermones de ascensione I.2&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that these signs were no longer present because there were greater miracles – the transformed lives of believers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abbaye-saint-benoit.ch/saints/bernard/tome03/homtemps/paques/paques007.htm "PREMIER SERMON POUR LE JOUR DE L'ASCENSION.

Et je ne crois pas qu'il soit difficile de savoir en quel sens on doit entendre les miracles dont il est parlé en cet endroit, pour qu'ils soient des signes certains de foi, et par conséquent de salut. En effet, la première oeuvre de la foi, opérant par la charité, c'est la componction de l'âme, car elle chasse évidemment les démons, en déracinant les péchés de notre coeur. Quant aux langues nouvelles que doivent parler les hommes, qui croient en Jésus-Christ, cela a lieu, lorsque le langage du vieil homme cesse de se trouver sur nos lèvres, et que nous ne parlons plus la langue antique de nos premiers parents, qui cherchaient dans des paroles pleines de malice à s'excuser de leurs péchés"&lt;/ref&gt;
* 12th century – [[Hildegard of Bingen]] is reputed to have spoken and sung in tongues. Her spiritual songs were referred to by contemporaries as "concerts in the Spirit."{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
* 1265 – [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote about the gift of tongues in the New Testament, which he understood to be an ability to speak every language, given for the purposes of missionary work. He explained that Christ did not have this gift because his mission was to the Jews, "nor does each one of the faithful now speak save in one tongue"; for "no one speaks in the tongues of all nations, because the Church herself already speaks the languages of all nations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Question 176.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 15th century – The [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] are referred to by detractors as having spoken in tongues. John Roche, a contemporary critic, claimed that the Moravians "commonly broke into some disconnected Jargon, which they often passed upon the vulgar, 'as the exuberant and resistless Evacuations of the Spirit'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Stanley M. |last=Burgess |chapter=Medieval and Modern Western Churches |editors=Gary B.

Speaking in tongues was recorded in contemporary sources, both hostile and sympathetic to Mormonism, by at least 1830.&lt;ref name="Copeland"&gt;Copeland, Lee. "Speaking in Tongues in the Restoration Churches", ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', Vol 24, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was soon widespread amongst Mormons, with many rank and file church members believing they were speaking the [[Adamic language|language of Adam]]; some of the hostility towards Mormons stemmed from those of other faiths regarding speaking in tongues unfavorably, especially when practiced by children.&lt;ref name="Copeland"/&gt; At the 1836 dedication of the [[Kirtland Temple]] the dedicatory prayer asked that God grant them the gift of tongues and at the end of the service [[Brigham Young]] spoke in tongues, another elder interpreted it and then gave his own exhortation in tongues. Many other worship experiences in the Kirtland Temple prior to and after the dedication included references to people speaking and interpreting tongues. In describing the beliefs of the church in the [[Wentworth letter]] (1842), Joseph Smith identified a belief of the "gift of tongues" and "interpretation of tongues". The practice of glossolalia by the Latter-day Saints was widespread but after an initial burst of enthusiastic growth circa 1830–34, seems to have been somewhat more restrained than in many other contemporary religious movements.&lt;ref name="Copeland"/&gt; Young, Smith, and numerous other early leaders frequently cautioned against the public exercise of glossolalia unless there was someone who could exercise the corresponding spiritual gift of interpretation of tongues, so that listeners could be edified by what had been said. Although the [[Latter-day Saint]]s believe that speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues are alive and well in the Church, modern Mormons are much more likely to point to the way in which LDS missionaries are trained and learn foreign languages quickly, and are able to communicate rapidly on their missions, as evidence of the manifestation of this gift. This interpretation stems from a 1900 General Conference sermon by [[Joseph F. Smith]] which discouraged glossolalia; subsequent leaders echoed this recommendation for about a decade afterwards and subsequently the practice had largely died out amongst Mormons by the 1930s and '40s.&lt;ref name="Copeland"/&gt; The visitor to 21st Century LDS church services will never hear spontaneous, incomprehensible glossolalia as one might overhear at a Pentecostal service.

===20th century===
{{Main|Azusa Street Revival}}
[[File:026 la times.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Headline about the "Weird babel of tongues" and other behavior at Azusa Street, from a 1906 [[Los Angeles Times]] newspaper.]]
During the 20th century, glossolalia primarily became associated with Pentecostalism and the later [[charismatic movement]]. The [[Holiness Movement|holiness]] preachers [[Charles Parham]] and [[William J. Seymour|William Seymour]] are credited as co-founders of the movement. Parham and Seymour taught that "baptism of the Holy Spirit was not the blessing of sanctification but rather a [[third work of grace]] that was accompanied by the experience of tongues."&lt;ref name="FahlbuschBromiley1999"/&gt; It was Parham who formulated the doctrine of "initial evidence". After studying the Bible, Parham came to the conclusion that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence that one had received the [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]].

In 1900, Parham opened [[Bethel Bible College]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]], America, where he taught initial evidence. During a service on 1 January 1901, a student named [[Agnes Ozman]] asked for prayer and the [[laying on of hands]] to specifically ask God to fill her with the [[Holy Spirit]]. She became the first of many students to experience glossolalia, coincidentally in [[Millennium#Counting years|the first hours of the 20th century]]. Parham followed within the next few days. Parham called his new movement the [[Charles Fox Parham|Apostolic Faith]]. In 1905, he moved to Houston and opened a [[Bible school]] there. One of his students was William Seymour, an African-American preacher. In 1906, Seymour traveled to [[Los Angeles]] where his preaching ignited the [[Azusa Street Revival]]. This revival is considered the birth of the global Pentecostal movement. Witnesses at the Azusa Street Revival wrote of seeing fire resting on the heads of participants, miraculous healings in the meetings, and incidents of speaking in tongues being understood by native speakers of the language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} According to the first issue of William Seymour's newsletter, "The Apostolic Faith", from 1906:

{{quote|A Mohammedan, a Soudanese by birth, a [m]an who is an interpreter and speaks six[t]een languages, came into the meetings at Azusa Street and the Lord gave him messages which none but himself could understand. He identified, interpreted and wrote [a] number of the languages.&lt;ref&gt;Square brackets indicate faded parts that are no longer readable.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Parham and his early followers believed that speaking in tongues was xenoglossia, and some followers traveled to foreign countries and tried to use the gift to share the Gospel with non-English-speaking people. From the time of the Azusa Street revival and among early participants in the Pentecostal movement, there were many accounts of individuals hearing their own languages spoken 'in tongues'. It is likely that the majority of Pentecostals and Charismatics still consider speaking in tongues to primarily be human languages.&lt;ref&gt;D. Swincer, 'Tongues: Genuine Biblical Languages: A Careful Construct of the Nature, Purpose, and Operation of the Gift of Tongues for the Church'(2016) pp 88-90&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following the Azusa Street revival Pentecostals who went to the mission field found that they were unable to speak in the language of the local inhabitants at will when they spoke in tongues in strange lands.&lt;ref&gt;Faupel, D. William.

Harris, 'Spoken By the Spirit : Documented Accounts of "Other Tongues" From Arabic to Zulu' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

The revival at Azusa Street lasted until around 1915. From it grew many new Pentecostal churches as people visited the services in Los Angeles and took their newfound beliefs to communities around the United States and abroad. During the 20th century, glossolalia became an important part of the identity of these religious groups. During the 1960s, the [[charismatic movement]] within the [[Mainline Protestantism|mainline Protestant]] churches and among [[Catholic Charismatic Movement|charismatic Roman Catholics]] adopted some Pentecostal beliefs, and the practice of glossolalia spread to other Christian denominations. The discussion regarding tongues has permeated many branches of the Protestantism, particularly since the widespread Charismatic Movement in the 1960s. Many books have been published either defending&lt;ref&gt;Example: Christenson, Laurence, ''Speaking in tongues : and its significance for the church'', Minneapolis, MN : Dimension Books, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; or attacking&lt;ref&gt;Example: Gromacki, Robert Glenn, ''The modern tongues movement'', Nutley, N.J. : Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co., 1973, {{ISBN|0-87552-304-8}} (Originally published 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; the practice.

==Christianity==

===Theological explanations===
In [[Christianity]], a supernatural explanation for glossolalia is advocated by some and rejected by others.
* '''Glossolalists''' could, apart from those practicing glossolalia, also mean all those Christians who believe that the Pentecostal/charismatic glossolalia practiced today is the "speaking in tongues" described in the New Testament. They believe that it is a miraculous [[charism]] or [[spiritual gift]]. Glossolalists claim that these tongues can be both real, unlearned languages (i.e., [[xenoglossia]])&lt;ref name=grudem1994p1070&gt;{{Cite book|first=Wayne A. |last=Grudem |authorlink=Wayne Grudem |title=Systematic theology: an introduction to biblical doctrine |publisher=[[Inter-Varsity Press]] |location=[[Leicester]] |year=1994 |page=1070 |isbn=978-0-85110-652-6 |oclc=29952151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ag-baptism2000&gt;{{cite web|author=General Presbytery of the Assemblies of God |date=11 August 2000 |title=The Baptism in the Holy Spirit: The Initial Experience and Continuing Evidences of the Spirit-Filled Life |url=http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Position_Papers/pp_downloads/pp_4185_spirit-filled_life.pdf |publisher=[[General Council of the Assemblies of God of the United States]] |accessdate=9 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217141421/http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Position_Papers/pp_downloads/pp_4185_spirit-filled_life.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a "language of the spirit", a "heavenly language", or perhaps the [[Angelic tongues|language of angels]].&lt;ref name=grudem1994p1072&gt;{{Cite book|first=Wayne A. |last=Grudem |authorlink=Wayne Grudem |title=Systematic theology: an introduction to biblical doctrine |publisher=[[Inter-Varsity Press]] |location=[[Leicester]] |year=1994 |page=1072 |isbn=978-0-85110-652-6 |oclc=29952151}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[cessationism|Cessationists]]''' believe that all the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit ceased to occur early in Christian history, and therefore that the speaking in tongues practised today is simply the utterance of meaningless syllables. It is neither xenoglossia nor miraculous, but rather learned behavior, possibly self-induced. These believe that what the New Testament described as "speaking in tongues" was xenoglossia, a miraculous spiritual gift through which the speaker could communicate in natural languages not previously studied.
*A third position conceivably exists, which believes the practice of "glossolalia" to be a folk practice and different from the legitimate New Testament spiritual gift of speaking/interpreting real languages. It is therefore not out of a belief that "miracles have ceased" (i.e. Cessationism) that causes this group to discredit the supernatural origins of particular modern expressions of "glossolalia", but it is rather out of a belief that Glossolalists have misunderstood Scripture and wrongly attributed something that appears to be explained naturalistically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/07/health/07brain.html|title=A Neuroscientific Look at Speaking in Tongues|first=Benedict|last=Carey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Holy Spirit.

Proponents of each viewpoint use the biblical writings and historical arguments to support their positions.

===Biblical practice===
There are five places in the [[New Testament]] where speaking in tongues is referred to ''explicitly'':
* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Mark#Chapter 16|Mark 16:17]], which records the instructions of [[Jesus christ|Christ]] to the [[apostles]], including his description that "they will speak with new tongues" as a sign that would follow "them that believe" in him.
* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 2|Acts 2]], which describes an occurrence of speaking in tongues in [[Jerusalem]] at [[Pentecost]], though with various interpretations. Specifically, "every man ''heard them'' speak in his own language" and wondered "how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?"
* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 10|Acts 10:46]], when the household of [[Cornelius the Centurion|Cornelius]] in [[Caesarea]] spoke in tongues, and those present compared it to the speaking in tongues that occurred at [[Pentecost]].
* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 19|Acts 19:6]], when a group of approximately a dozen men spoke in tongues in [[Ephesus]] as they received the Holy Spirit while the apostle Paul laid his hands upon them.
* [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 12|1 Cor 12]], [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 13|13]], [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|14]], where [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] discusses speaking in "various kinds of tongues" as part of his wider discussion of the [[gifts of the Spirit]]; his remarks shed some light on his own speaking in tongues as well as how the gift of speaking in tongues was to be used in the [[Ecclesia (church)|church]].

Other verses by inference may be considered to refer to "speaking in tongues", such as [[s:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 28|Isaiah 28:11]], [[s:Bible (King James)/Romans#Chapter 8|Romans 8:26]] and [[s:Bible (King James)/Jude|Jude 20]].

The biblical account of [[Pentecost]] in the second chapter of the book of Acts describes the sound of a mighty rushing wind and "divided tongues like fire" coming to rest on the [[apostles]]. The text further describes that "they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages". It goes on to say in verses 5-11 that when the Apostles spoke, each person in attendance "heard their own language being spoken". Therefore, the gift of speaking in tongues refers to the Apostles' speaking languages that the people listening heard as "them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God". Glossolalists and cessationists both recognize this as [[xenoglossia]], a miraculous ability that marked their [[Baptism of the Holy Spirit|baptism in the Holy Spirit]]. Something similar (although perhaps not xenoglossia) took place on at least two subsequent occasions, in Caesarea and Ephesus.

Glossolalists and cessationists generally agree that the primary purpose of the gift of speaking in tongues was to mark the [[Holy Spirit]] being poured out. At [[Pentecost]] the [[Apostle Peter]] declared that this gift, which was making some in the audience ridicule the disciples as drunks, was the fulfilment of the prophecy of [[Joel (prophet)|Joel]] which described that God would pour out his Spirit on all flesh ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 2|Acts 2:17]]).&lt;ref name=ag-baptism2000/&gt;

Despite these commonalities, there are significant variations in interpretation.
* '''Universal'''. The traditional [[Pentecostal]] view is that every Christian should expect to be [[Baptism in the holy spirit|baptized in the Holy Spirit]], the distinctive mark of which is glossolalia.&lt;ref name=ag-truths&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement of Fundamental Truths |url=http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Statement_of_Fundamental_Truths/sft.pdf |author=[[Assemblies of God]] |publisher=[[General Council of the Assemblies of God of the United States]] |year=1961 |accessdate=9 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619112828/http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Statement_of_Fundamental_Truths/sft.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most Protestants agree that baptism in the Holy Spirit is integral to being a Christian, others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christians.eu/holy-spirit-baptism/|title=Baptism with the Holy Spirit|work=christians.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that it is not separable from [[Religious conversion|conversion]] and no longer marked by glossolalia. Pentecostals appeal to the declaration of the [[Apostle Peter]] at Pentecost, that "the gift of the Holy Spirit" was "for you and for your children and for all who are far off" ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 2|Acts 2:38–39]]). Cessationists reply that the gift of speaking in tongues was never for all ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 12|1 Cor 12:30]]). In response to those who say that the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is not a separate experience from conversion, Pentecostals appeal to the question asked by the [[Apostle Paul]] to the Ephesian believers "Have ye received the Holy Ghost ''since'' ye believed?" ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 19|Acts 19:2]]).
* '''One gift'''. Different aspects of speaking in tongues appear in Acts and 1 Corinthians, such that the [[Assemblies of God]] declare that the gift in Acts "is the same in essence as the gift of tongues" in 1 Corinthians "but different in purpose and use".&lt;ref name=ag-truths/&gt; They distinguish between (private) speech in tongues when receiving the gift of the Spirit, and (public) speech in tongues for the benefit of the church. Others assert that the gift in Acts was "not a different phenomenon" but the same gift being displayed under varying circumstances.&lt;ref name=grudem1994p1073&gt;{{Cite book|first=Wayne A. |last=Grudem |authorlink=Wayne Grudem |title=Systematic theology: an introduction to biblical doctrine |publisher=[[Inter-Varsity Press]] |location=[[Leicester]] |year=1994 |page=1073 |isbn=978-0-85110-652-6 |oclc=29952151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same description – "speaking in tongues" – is used in both Acts and 1 Corinthians, and in both cases the speech is in an unlearned language.
* '''Direction'''. The New Testament describes tongues largely as speech addressed to God, but also as something that can potentially be interpreted into human language, thereby "edifying the hearers" ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|1 Cor 14:5,13]]). At Pentecost and Caesarea the speakers were praising God ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 2|Acts 2:11]]; [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 10|10:46]]). Paul referred to praying, singing praise, and giving thanks in tongues ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|1 Cor 14:14–17]]), as well as to the [[interpretation of tongues]] ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|1 Cor 14:5]]), and instructed those speaking in tongues to pray for the ability to interpret their tongues so others could understand them ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|1 Cor 14:13]]). While some limit speaking in tongues to speech addressed to God – "prayer or praise",&lt;ref name=grudem1994p1070/&gt; others claim that speech in tongues is revelation from God to the church, and when interpreted into human language by those embued with the gift of interpretation of tongues for the benefit of others present, may be considered equivalent to prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Peter |last=Masters |author2=[[John C.

* '''Music'''. Musical interludes of glossolalia are sometimes described as [[singing in the Spirit]]. Some hold that singing in the Spirit is identified with singing in tongues in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|14:13–19|KJV}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Donald A. |last=Johns |chapter= |editors=Stanley M.

* '''Sign for unbelievers''' ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 14|1 Cor 14:22]]). Some assume that tongues are "a sign for unbelievers that they might believe",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Questions about Tongues |url=http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/baptmhs_faq_tongues.cfm |publisher=[[General Council of the Assemblies of God of the United States]] |year=2009 |accessdate=10 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613065932/http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/baptmhs_faq_tongues.cfm |archivedate=13 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so advocate it as a means of evangelism. Others point out that Paul quotes Isaiah to show that "when God speaks to people in language they cannot understand, it is quite evidently a sign of God's judgment"; so if unbelievers are baffled by a church service they cannot understand because tongues are spoken without being interpreted, that is a "sign of God's attitude", "a sign of judgment".&lt;ref name=grudem1994p1075&gt;{{Cite book|first=Wayne A. |last=Grudem |authorlink=Wayne Grudem |title=Systematic theology: an introduction to biblical doctrine |publisher=[[Inter-Varsity Press]] |location=[[Leicester]] |year=1994 |page=1075 |isbn=978-0-85110-652-6 |oclc=29952151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some identify the tongues in Acts 2 as the primary example of tongues as signs for unbelievers
* '''Comprehension'''. Some say that speech in tongues was "not understood by the speaker".&lt;ref name=grudem1994p1070/&gt; Others assert that "the tongues-speaker normally understood his own foreign-language message".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Peter |last=Masters |author2=[[John C. Whitcomb]]  |title=The Charismatic Phenomenon |publisher=Wakeman Trust |location=London |year=1988 |page=106 |isbn=978-1-870855-01-3 |oclc=20720229}}&lt;/ref&gt; This last comment seems to have been made by someone confusing the "gift of tongues" with the "gift of the interpretation of tongues, which is specified as a different gift in the New Testament, but one that can be given to a person who also has the gift of tongues. In that case, a person understands a message in tongues that he has previously spoken in an unknown language."{{Cite quote|date=July 2009}}

===Pentecostal and charismatic practice===
{{Pentecostalism |key beliefs}}
Influenced by the [[Holiness movement]], [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]] was regarded by the first Pentecostals as being the third work of grace, following the [[born again|new birth]] (first work of grace) and [[entire sanctification]] (second work of grace).&lt;ref name="TWTHS2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=The West Tennessee Historical Society Papers - Issue 56 |year=2002|publisher=West Tennessee Historical Society.|language=English|page=41|quote=Seymour's holiness background suggests that Pentecostalism had roots in the holiness movement of the late nineteenth century. The holiness movement embraced the Wesleyan doctrine of "sanctification" or the second work of grace, subsequent to conversion. Pentecostalism added a third work of grace, called the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is often accompanied by glossolalia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FahlbuschBromiley1999"/&gt; This third work of grace was accompanied with glossolalia.&lt;ref name="TWTHS2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FahlbuschBromiley1999"/&gt;

Because Pentecostal and charismatic beliefs are not monolithic, there is not complete theological agreement on speaking in tongues. Generally, however, it is agreed that speaking in tongues is a [[spiritual gift]] that can be manifested as either a human language or a heavenly supernatural language in three ways{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}:
# The "sign of tongues" refers to [[xenoglossia]], wherein one speaks an actual language he has never learnt.
# The "gift of tongues" refers to a glossolalic utterance spoken by an individual and addressed to a congregation of, typically, other believers.
# Lastly, "praying in the spirit" is typically used to refer to glossolalia as part of personal prayer.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
Many Pentecostals and charismatics adhere to Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 14 which established guidelines on the public use of glossolalia in the church at Corinth.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The gift of tongues is often referred to as a "message in tongues".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} This use of glossolalia requires an interpretation so that the gathered congregation can understand the message. This is accomplished by the [[interpretation of tongues]], another spiritual gift. There are two schools of thought concerning the nature of a message in tongues:
# One school of thought believes it is always directed ''to'' God as prayer, praise, or thanksgiving but is spoken in for the hearing and edification of the congregation.
# The other school of thought believes that a message in tongues can be a prophetic utterance inspired by the Holy Spirit.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In this case, the speaker delivers a message to the congregation on behalf of God.

In addition to praying in the Spirit, many Pentecostal and charismatic churches practice what is known as [[singing in the Spirit]]. The Apostle "Paul's definition of spiritual songs – is singing in the Spirit which is singing in tongues (1 Corinthians 14:15). Paul made it clear that praying in the Spirit was praying in tongues because it was in direct contrast to praying with the understanding or the language that could not be understood in the context of human languages (1 Corinthians 14:14, 16–18)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abidingplace.org/the-word/tongues-the-language-of-the-holy-spirit.html |title=Tongues – The Language of the Holy Spirit |website=Abidingplace.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Christian practice==
Other religious groups have been observed to practice some form of [[Biblical inspiration|theopneustic]] glossolalia. It is perhaps most commonly in [[Paganism]], [[Shamanism]], and other [[mediumistic]] religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Seraphim Rose: Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future, St Herman Press&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the [[Shinji Takahashi (religious leader)#God Light Association|God Light Association]] believed that glossolalia could cause adherents to recall past lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nr.ucpress.edu/content/1/3/54|title=Shifting Paradigms and Mediating Media: Redefining a New Religion as "Rational" in Contemporary Society|journal=[[Nova Religio]]|volume=10|issue=3|page=54|doi=10.1525/nr.2007.10.3.54|year=2007|last1=Whelan|first1=Christal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glossolalia has been postulated as an explanation for the [[Voynich manuscript]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gerry Kennedy, Rob Churchill|title=The Voynich Manuscript|location=London|publisher=Orion|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7528-5996-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Spiritism]] was developed by the work of [[Allan Kardec]], and the phenomenon was seen as one of the self-evident manifestations of spirits. Spiritists argued that some cases were actually cases of [[xenoglossia]].

==Medical research==
[[Neuroimaging]] of brain activity during glossolalia does not show activity in the language areas of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging Nov 2006. International Society for Neuroimaging in Psychiatry. Andrew Newberg, Nancy Wintering, Donna Morgan, and Mark Waldman, "The Measurement of Regional Cerebral Blood Flow During Glossolalia: a Preliminary SPECT Study."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Language Center of the Brain Is Not Under the Control of Subjects Who 'Speak in Tongues'," University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine 2006 Oct&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by the American Journal of Human biology found that speaking in tongues was associated with both a reduction in circulatory cortisol, and enhancements in alpha-amylase enzyme activity—two common biomarkers of '''stress reduction''' that can be measured in saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LYNN|first=CHRISTOPHER DANA|last2=PARIS|first2=JASON|last3=FRYE|first3=CHERYL ANNE|last4=SCHELL|first4=LAWRENCE M.|date=2010|title=Salivary Alpha-Amylase and Cortisol Among Pentecostals on a Worship and Nonworship Day|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=22|issue=6|pages=819–822|doi=10.1002/ajhb.21088|issn=1042-0533|pmc=3609410|pmid=20878966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==

'''Heart Rhythm Meditation''' (HRM) is a method of [[meditation]] that has been expanded and developed by [[Puran bair|Puran Bair]] and [[Susanna Bair]] of the [[Institute for Applied Meditation]].  The method was described in the 1998 book ''Living from the Heart'', by Puran Bair (2nd Edition Published in 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bair|first=Puran and Susanna|title=Living from the Heart|year=2009|edition=2nd|publisher=Living Heart Media|location=Tucson, Arizona|isbn=978-0-9795269-6-1|pages=376|url=http://livingfromtheheart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2007 book ''Energize Your Heart in 4 Dimensions'', by Puran and Susanna Bair.

==Technique==
All meditation methods are effective in reducing [[stress (biology)|stress]], but they do so in different ways. 
The method of HRM involves [[conscious breathing]], use of the full lung capacity, a concentration on the heart (both the physical heart and the emotional or poetic heart) and an intervention in the breath to make it rhythmic, through the coordination of the breath and heartbeat.  Several different rhythmic patterns are used, including making the length of the inhale even with the length of the exhale, for example, 8 beats in, 8 beats out; this is called “The Swinging Breath”.  Another pattern involves a longer holding of the breath, so that the holding period equals the breathing period, for example, 8 beats in, 16 beats hold, 8 beats out; this is called “The Square Breath”.  This square breath has a great stabilizing quality and is very helpful for anxiety or feelings of panic. The method of HRM never involves  holding the breath after an exhalation, only after an inhalation.

==Variations of the Square Breath==
Because of its ancient history, other interpretations abound, but these other variations may not center on the heart or the heartbeat. For example, call-in radio personality Dr. [[Joy Browne]] describes a practice she calls 'square breathing' in a chapter of her recent book ''Getting Unstuck''. Dr. Browne does not use the heartbeat, but counts seconds. With this method, for each breathing element (in, out, hold), one can use any count. Dr. Browne's square breathing is defined as N seconds in, N seconds hold, N seconds out, ending with N seconds hold.  This practice is never done within HRM, for it is incompatible with the full breath.  The average [[Respiratory rate|breath rate]] is 16 times a minute, which approximates a rhythm of 2 seconds in and 2 seconds out. The example of 8 seconds per element results in 2 breaths per minute. While possible for veteran practitioners, most beginners would have great difficulty achieving this. Beginners can start with an easy 2 seconds per element, resulting in 8 breaths per minute. The number of seconds per element can then be increased gradually with practice.

Waldron is regarded as one of the world's leading legal and political philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.law.nyu.edu/magazine/2006/jeremy-waldron/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/04/12/universityprofessors.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenation.com/article/dignitys-due/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Waldron attended [[Southland Boys' High School]], and then went on to study at the [[University of Otago]], New Zealand, where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1974 and an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] in 1978. He later studied for a D.Phil. at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]] under legal philosopher [[Ronald Dworkin]] and political theorist [[Alan Ryan]]; Waldron graduated in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/profile.cfm?section=bio&amp;personID=26993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He also taught legal and political philosophy at [[University of Otago|Otago]] (1975–78), [[Lincoln College, Oxford]] (1980–82), the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1983–87), the Jurisprudence and Social Policy Program at [[Boalt Hall School of Law]] at [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]] (1986–96), [[Princeton University]] (1996–97), and [[Columbia Law School]] (1997–2006). He has also been a visiting professor at [[Cornell University|Cornell]] (1989–90), [[University of Otago|Otago]] (1991–92) and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] (1995) Universities. Currently at NYU he teaches [[Rule of Law]], [[Jurisprudence]], seminars on [[Property]] and [[Human Dignity]] and regularly hosts the Colloquium on Legal, Social and Political Philosophy, founded by Ronald Dworkin and Thomas Nagel in 1987, and currently convened by Liam Murphy, [[Samuel Scheffler]], and Waldron.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/lawphilosophy/colloquium&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldron gave the second series of Seeley Lectures at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1996, the 1999 Carlyle Lectures at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], the spring 2000 University Lecture at [[Columbia University|Columbia Law School]], the Wesson Lectures at [[Stanford University]] in 2004, the Storrs Lectures at [[Yale Law School]] in 2007, and the [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 2015. He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1998.

In 2005, Waldron received an honorary doctorate from the University of Otago, his [[alma mater]].

==Legal and philosophical views==
Waldron is a [[liberalism|liberal]] and a [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[legal positivism|legal positivist]]. He has written extensively on the analysis and justification of private property and on the political and legal philosophy of [[John Locke]]. He is an outspoken opponent of [[judicial review]] and of [[torture]], both of which he believes to be in tension with democratic principles. He believes that [[hate speech]] should not be protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130612010951/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20120802 ''Voices on Antisemitism'' Interview with Jeremy Waldron] from the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; His later work is devoted to providing a non-religious and non-Kantian concept of [[human dignity]], based on a thought experiment of leveling up all human beings to the high rank of nobility or aristocracy, thus constituting a single rank or caste. He has been working on this topic since he gave the Tanner Lectures on the subject in 2009, published in 2012 as ''Dignity, Rank and Rights''.&lt;ref&gt;https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/41668-dignity-rank-and-rights/&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldron has also criticized analytic [[legal philosophy]] for its failure to engage with the questions addressed by [[political theory]].

===Criticism of judicial review===
Sandrine Baume has identified Jeremy Waldron and [[Bruce Ackerman]] as leading critics of the "compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Baume, Sandrine (2011). ''Hans Kelsen and the Case for Democracy'', ECPR Press, pp53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Baume identified [[John Hart Ely]] alongside Dworkin as the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years, while the opposition to this principle of "compatibility" were identified as Bruce Ackerman&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Bruce (1991). ''We the People''.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeremy Waldron.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Jeremy (2006). "The Core of the case against judicial review," ''The Yale Law Review'', 2006, Vol. 115, pp 1346-1406.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Waldron and Ackerman, Dworkin was a long-time advocate of a moral reading of the [[United States Constitution]], whose lines of support he sees as strongly associated with enhanced versions of judicial review in the federal government.

A staunch defender of the principle of democratic legislation, in an article titled "The Core of the Case against Judicial Review", Waldron has argued for a limited role for judicial review in a robust democratic government.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, "The Core of the Case against Judicial Review," 115 Yale Law Review 1346 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Waldron asserts that there is no inherent advantage to a judiciary's protection of rights than to a legislature's if (1) there is a broadly democratic political system with appropriate suffrage and process,&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 3161&lt;/ref&gt;(2) there is a system of courts somewhat insulated from popular pressure and engaged in judicial review,&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1363&lt;/ref&gt; there is a general commitment to rights,&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1366.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is disagreement as to the content and extent of rights.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1367.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Waldron does not argue against the existence of judicial review, which may be appropriate when there is institutional dysfunction.  In this case, the defense of judicial review compatible with democracy is limited to remedies for that dysfunction and are neither unlimited nor universal.  Thus Waldron places his view of judicial review in the tradition of Justice Harlan Fiske Stone.&lt;ref&gt;Id at 1403, citing United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 153 n.4 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affinity with judicial minimalism===
In a review of a 2015 book by [[Cass Sunstein]], Waldron has stated that between the polarity represented by judges who can be "heroic" in the interpretation of their judgments and those who abstain, that his preference would be sympathetic to a position which could be described as "judicial minimalism". Waldron states his examples of such judges as including Sandra O'Connor, Ruth Ginsburg, and Felix Frankfurter.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron. Review of Cass Sunstein.

'''John Formosa''' (1869–1941) was a Maltese [[theologian]], [[canonist]], minor [[philosopher]], and [[poet]]. In philosophy he mostly specialised in [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Formosa was born in [[Cospicua]], [[Malta]], on March 22, 1869. He studied at the [[University of Malta]] and at other universities abroad. These studies made him Doctor of [[Theology]] and Doctor of [[Canon Law]]. He was ordained a priest in 1893. He was also a Canon of the [[bishop]]’s Cathedral Chapter at [[Mdina]]. He died on March 29, 1941, at 72 years of age.

==Works==
Though the writings and publications of Formosa are numerous, most of them are of no interest to philosophy since they are of a theological, devotional or religious nature. Some speculative writings, however, have philosophical value, namely the following:

* 1913 – '''''La Rivelazione e l’Uomo''''' (Revelation and Man).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. II, pp. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; A 20-page booklet in Italian published in Malta (Tipografia del ‘Malta Herald’) which reproduces a speech which Formosa delivered in the church of the [[University of Malta]] in [[Valletta]] at the commencement of the academic year 1913/14. The work discusses man’s nature from the point of views of his intellectual, ecstatic and moral faculties. Formosa maintains that the objective of every school is the development and perfection of these faculties.
* 1917 – '''''Trattato dei Fondamenti della Religione''''' (A Study on the Foundations of Religion).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. I, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; An 876-page volume in Italian published in Malta (Tipografia Giovanni Muscat) in which Formosa maintains, on the one hand, that [[revelation]] is the foundation for the universality of the [[Catholic]] religion, and, on the other, that the [[Catholic Church]], as a divine and human institution, encompasses all wisdom and every kind of art and science. This quantitively impressive publication, is basically an [[apologetic]] composition. Formosa proffers many philosophical arguments to sustain his positions.
* 1921 – '''''Formazione del Carattere della Gioventù Studiosa''''' (The Character Formation of Young Students).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; A 27-page book in Italian published in Malta (Tipografia ‘Empire Press’, [[Floriana]]) which reproduces a speech delivered by Formosa on January 21, 1921, at the ''aula magna'' of the [[University of Malta]]. It is dedicated to [[Pope Benedict XV]]. The nature of the work can be surmised from the book’s opening words: ‘In the sad times through which we pass, when [[socialist]] concepts – doctrines so dangerous and subversive – snake everywhere and create confusion in the intellectual and moral worlds as well as disorder amongst human societies ...’ Continuing in this style, Formosa basically upholds two major concepts: that [[God]] is the sufficient reason for the existence of all [[science]], and that [[metaphysics]] is the first and ultimate science of man. Formosa provides philosophical arguments to sustain his theories.
* 1923 – '''''San Tommaso d’Aquino: Sole di Verità e Oracolo della Theologia''''' (Saint Thomas Aquinas: The Sun of Truth and the Excellence of Theology).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. II, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; A 14-page booklet in Italian published in Malta (Tipografia di Giovanni Muscat, [[Valletta]]) which reproduces a talk given by Formosa on November 16, 1923, at the ''aula magna'' of the [[University of Malta]]. The work is dedicated to theology students, and is laudatory composition for [[Thomas Aquinas]].

'''Julius Ebbinghaus''' (9 November 1885, [[Berlin]] – 16 June 1981, [[Marburg an der Lahn]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]], one of the closest followers of [[Immanuel Kant]] active in the twentieth century. He was influenced by the [[Heidelberg]] school of [[neo-Kantianism]] of [[Wilhelm Windelband]], and wrote on [[philosophy of law]] and the [[categorical imperative]]. Professor at [[Marburg University]] (Philipps-Universität Marburg) since 1940; 1954 professor emeritus, continuing lectures until 1966. In October 1945, he became installed as Rector Magnificus by order of the American occupation forces. He was the son of famous psychologist [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44309">'''Knowledge extraction''' is the creation of [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge]] from structured ([[relational databases]], [[XML]]) and unstructured ([[text (literary theory)|text]], documents, [[image]]s) sources. The resulting knowledge needs to be in a machine-readable and machine-interpretable format and must [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|represent knowledge]] in a manner that facilitates inferencing. Although it is methodically similar to [[information extraction]] ([[Natural language processing|NLP]]) and [[extract, transform, load|ETL]] (data warehouse), the main criteria is that the extraction result goes beyond the creation of structured information or the transformation into a [[Database schema|relational schema]]. It requires either the reuse of existing [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|formal knowledge]] (reusing identifiers or [[ontologies]]) or the generation of a schema based on the source data.

The RDB2RDF W3C group &lt;ref name="RDB2RDF" /&gt; is currently standardizing a language for extraction of [[Resource Description Framework|resource description frameworks]] (RDF) from [[relational databases]]. Another popular example for knowledge extraction is the transformation of Wikipedia into [[structured data]] and also the mapping to existing [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge]] (see [[DBpedia]] and [[Freebase (database)|Freebase]]).

==Overview==
After the standardization of knowledge representation languages such as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]], much research has been conducted in the area, especially regarding transforming relational databases into RDF, [[identity resolution]], [[knowledge discovery]] and ontology learning. The general process uses traditional methods from [[information extraction]] and [[extract, transform, load|extract, transform, and load]] (ETL), which transform the data from the sources into structured formats.

The following criteria can be used to categorize approaches in this topic (some of them only account for extraction from relational databases):&lt;ref name="lod2_eu" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Source 
| Which data sources are covered: Text, Relational Databases, XML, CSV
|- 
! Exposition 
| How is the extracted knowledge made explicit (ontology file, semantic database)? How can you query it?
|-
! Synchronization 
| Is the knowledge extraction process executed once to produce a dump or is the result synchronized with the source? Static or dynamic. Are changes to the result written back (bi-directional)
|-
! Reuse of vocabularies 
| The tool is able to reuse existing vocabularies in the extraction. For example, the table column 'firstName' can be mapped to foaf:firstName. Some automatic approaches are not capable of mapping vocab.  
|-
! Automatization 
| The degree to which the extraction is assisted/automated. Manual, GUI, semi-automatic, automatic.  
|-
! Requires a domain ontology 
| A pre-existing ontology is needed to map to it. So either a mapping is created or a schema is learned from the source ([[ontology learning]]).

&lt;blockquote&gt;[http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barack_Obama President Obama] called Wednesday on [http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Congress Congress] to extend a tax break for students included in last year's economic stimulus package, arguing that the policy provides more generous assistance. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

:As President Obama is linked to a DBpedia [[LinkedData]] resource, further information can be retrieved automatically and a [[Semantic Reasoner]] can for example infer that the mentioned entity is of the type [http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person Person] (using [[FOAF (software)]]) and of type [http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PresidentsOfTheUnitedStates Presidents of the United States] (using [[YAGO (Ontology)|YAGO]]). Counter examples: Methods that only recognize entities or link to Wikipedia articles and other targets that do not provide further retrieval of structured data and formal knowledge.

===Relational databases to RDF===
# [[Triplify]], D2R Server, [https://capsenta.com/#section-ultrawrap Ultrawrap], and [[Virtuoso Universal Server|Virtuoso]] RDF Views are tools that transform relational databases to RDF. During this process they allow reusing existing vocabularies and [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] during the conversion process. When transforming a typical relational table named ''users'', one column (e.g.''name'') or an aggregation of columns (e.g.''first_name'' and ''last_name'') has to provide the URI of the created entity. Normally the primary key is used. Every other column can be extracted as a relation with this entity.&lt;ref name="timbl_reldb4semweb"/&gt; Then properties with formally defined semantics are used (and reused) to interpret the information. For example, a column in a user table called ''marriedTo'' can be defined as symmetrical relation and a column ''homepage'' can be converted to a property from the [[FOAF (software)|FOAF Vocabulary]] called [http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_homepage foaf:homepage], thus qualifying it as an [[Web Ontology Language#Properties|inverse functional property]]. Then each entry of the ''user'' table can be made an instance of the class [http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Person foaf:Person] (Ontology Population). Additionally [[domain knowledge]] (in form of an ontology) could be created from the ''status_id'', either by manually created rules (if ''status_id'' is 2, the entry belongs to class Teacher ) or by (semi)-automated methods ([[ontology learning]]). Here is an example transformation:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! marriedTo !! homepage !! status_id
|-
| Peter || Mary || http://example.org/Peters_page || 1
|-
| Claus || Eva || http://example.org/Claus_page || 2
|}
&lt;source lang="turtle"&gt;
 :Peter :marriedTo :Mary .  
 :marriedTo a owl:SymmetricProperty .  
 :Peter foaf:homepage  &lt;http://example.org/Peters_page&gt; .  
 :Peter a foaf:Person .   
 :Peter a :Student .  
 :Claus a :Teacher . 
&lt;/source&gt;

== Extraction from structured sources to RDF ==

=== 1:1 Mapping from RDB Tables/Views to RDF Entities/Attributes/Values ===

When building a RDB representation of a problem domain, the starting point is frequently an entity-relationship diagram (ERD). Typically, each entity is represented as a database table, each attribute of the entity becomes a column in that table, and relationships between entities are indicated by foreign keys. Each table typically defines a particular class of entity, each column one of its attributes. Each row in the table describes an entity
instance, uniquely identified by a primary key. The table rows collectively describe an entity set. In an equivalent RDF representation of the same entity set:
* Each column in the table is an attribute (i.e., predicate)
* Each column value is an attribute value (i.e., object)
* Each row key represents an entity ID (i.e., subject)
* Each row represents an entity instance
* Each row (entity instance) is represented in RDF by a collection of triples with a common subject (entity ID).

So, to render an equivalent view based on RDF semantics, the basic mapping algorithm would be as follows:
# create an RDFS class for each table
# convert all primary keys and foreign keys into IRIs
# assign a predicate IRI to each column
# assign an rdf:type predicate for each row, linking it to an RDFS class IRI corresponding to the table
# for each column that is neither part of a primary or foreign key, construct a triple containing the primary key IRI as the subject, the column IRI as the predicate and the column's value as the object.

Early mentioning of this basic or direct mapping can be found in [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s comparison of the [[Entity-relationship model|ER model]] to the RDF model.&lt;ref name="timbl_reldb4semweb"/&gt;

=== Complex mappings of relational databases to RDF ===

The 1:1 mapping mentioned above exposes the legacy data as RDF in a straightforward way, additional refinements can be employed to improve the usefulness of RDF output respective the given Use Cases. Normally, information is lost during the transformation of an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to relational tables (Details can be found in [[object-relational impedance mismatch]]) and has to be [[Reverse Engineering|reverse engineered]]. From a conceptual view, approaches for extraction can come from two directions. The first direction tries to extract or learn an OWL schema from the given database schema. Early approaches used a fixed amount of manually created mapping rules to refine the 1:1 mapping.&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghawi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; More elaborate methods are employing heuristics or learning algorithms to induce schematic information (methods overlap with [[ontology learning]]). While some approaches try to extract the information from the structure inherent in the SQL schema&lt;ref name="Tirmizi" /&gt; (analysing e.g. foreign keys), others analyse the content and the values in the tables to create conceptual hierarchies&lt;ref name="Cerbah"/&gt; (e.g. a columns with few values are candidates for becoming categories). The second direction tries to map the schema and its contents to a pre-existing domain ontology (see also: [[ontology alignment]]). Often, however, a suitable domain ontology does not exist and has to be created first.

=== XML ===

As XML is structured as a tree, any data can be easily represented in RDF, which is structured as a graph. [http://rhizomik.net/html/redefer/xml2rdf/ XML2RDF] is one example of an approach that uses RDF blank nodes and transforms XML elements and attributes to RDF properties. The topic however is more complex as in the case of relational databases. In a relational table the primary key is an ideal candidate for becoming the subject of the extracted triples. An XML element, however, can be transformed - depending on the context- as a subject, a predicate or object of a triple. [[XSLT]] can be used a standard transformation language to manually convert XML to RDF.

==Extraction from natural language sources==
The largest portion of information contained in business documents (about 80%&lt;ref name="Wimalasuriya" /&gt;) is encoded in natural language and therefore unstructured. Because [[unstructured data]] is rather a challenge for knowledge extraction, more sophisticated methods are required, which generally tend to supply worse results compared to structured data. The potential for a massive acquisition of extracted knowledge, however, should compensate the increased complexity and decreased quality of extraction. In the following, natural language sources are understood as sources of information, where the data is given in an unstructured fashion as plain text.  If the given text is additionally embedded in a markup document (e. g. HTML document), the mentioned systems normally remove the markup elements automatically.

===Traditional information extraction (IE)===
Traditional [[information extraction]] &lt;ref name="Cunningham" /&gt; is a technology of natural language processing, which extracts information from typically natural language texts and structures these in a suitable manner. The kinds of information to be identified must be specified in a model before beginning the process, which is why the whole process of traditional Information Extraction is domain dependent. The IE is split in the following five subtasks.

* [[Named-entity recognition|Named entity recognition]] (NER)
* [[Coreference|Coreference resolution]] (CO)
* Template element construction (TE)
* Template relation construction (TR)
* Template scenario production (ST)

The task of named entity recognition is to recognize and to categorize all named entities contained in a text (assignment of a named entity to a predefined category). This works by application of grammar based methods or statistical models.

Coreference resolution identifies equivalent entities, which were recognized by NER, within a text. There are two relevant kinds of equivalence relationship. The first one relates to the relationship between two different represented entities (e.g. IBM Europe and IBM) and the second one to the relationship between an entity and their [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric references]] (e.g. it and IBM). Both kinds can be recognized by coreference resolution.

During template element construction the IE system identifies descriptive properties of entities, recognized by NER and CO. These properties correspond to ordinary qualities like red or big.

Template relation construction identifies relations, which exist between the template elements. These relations can be of several kinds, such as works-for or located-in, with the restriction, that both domain and range correspond to entities.

In the template scenario production events, which are described in the text, will be identified and structured with respect to the entities, recognized by NER and CO and relations, identified by TR.

=== Ontology-based information extraction (OBIE) ===
Ontology-based information extraction &lt;ref name="Wimalasuriya" /&gt; is a subfield of information extraction, with which at least one [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] is used to guide the process of information extraction from natural language text. The OBIE system uses methods of traditional information extraction to identify [[concept]]s, instances and relations of the used ontologies in the text, which will be structured to an ontology after the process. Thus, the input ontologies constitute the model of information to be extracted.

===Ontology learning (OL)===
{{Main article|Ontology learning}}

Ontology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting the corresponding domain's terms from natural language text. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor-intensive and time consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process.

===Semantic annotation (SA)===
During semantic annotation,&lt;ref name="Erdmann" /&gt; natural language text is augmented with metadata (often represented in [[RDFa]]), which should make the semantics of contained terms machine-understandable. At this process, which is generally semi-automatic, knowledge is extracted in the sense, that a link between lexical terms and for example concepts from ontologies is established. Thus, knowledge is gained, which meaning of a term in the processed context was intended and therefore the meaning of the text is grounded in [[machine-readable data]] with the ability to draw inferences. Semantic annotation is typically split into the following two subtasks.

# Terminology extraction
# Entity linking

At the terminology extraction level, lexical terms from the text are extracted. For this purpose a tokenizer determines at first the word boundaries and solves abbreviations. Afterwards terms from the text, which correspond to a concept, are extracted with the help of a domain-specific lexicon to link these at entity linking.

In entity linking &lt;ref name="Rao" /&gt; a link between the extracted lexical terms from the source text and the concepts from an ontology or knowledge base such as [[DBpedia]]  is established. For this, candidate-concepts are detected appropriately to the several meanings of a term with the help of a lexicon. Finally, the context of the terms is analyzed to determine the most appropriate disambiguation and to assign the term to the correct concept.

===Tools===
The following criteria can be used to categorize tools, which extract knowledge from natural language text.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Source || Which input formats can be processed by the tool (e.g. plain text, HTML or PDF)?
|-
| Access Paradigm || Can the tool query the data source or requires a whole dump for the extraction process?
|-
| Data Synchronization || Is the result of the extraction process synchronized with the source?
|-
| Uses Output Ontology || Does the tool link the result with an ontology?
|-
| Mapping Automation || How automated is the extraction process (manual, semi-automatic or automatic)?
|-
| Requires Ontology || Does the tool need an ontology for the extraction?
|-
| Uses GUI || Does the tool offer a graphical user interface?
|-
| Approach || Which approach (IE, OBIE, OL or SA) is used by the tool?
|-
| Extracted Entities || Which types of entities (e.g. named entities, concepts or relationships) can be extracted by the tool?
|-
| Applied Techniques || Which techniques are applied (e.g. NLP, statistical methods, clustering or [[machine learning]])?
|-
| Output Model || Which model is used to represent the result of the tool (e. g. RDF or OWL)?
|-
| Supported Domains || Which domains are supported (e.g. economy or biology)?
|-
| Supported Languages || Which languages can be processed (e.g. English or German)?
|}

==Knowledge discovery==
[[Knowledge discovery]] describes the process of automatically searching large volumes of [[data]] for patterns that can be considered [[knowledge]] ''about'' the data.&lt;ref name="Williams1992"/&gt;  It is often described as ''deriving'' [[knowledge]] from the input [[data]].  Knowledge discovery developed out of the [[data mining]] domain, and is closely related to it both in terms of methodology and terminology.&lt;ref name="Fayyad1996"/&gt;

The most well-known branch of [[data mining]] is knowledge discovery, also known as [[knowledge discovery in databases]] (KDD). Just as many other forms of knowledge discovery it creates [[abstraction]]s of the input data. The ''knowledge'' obtained through the process may become additional ''data'' that can be used for further usage and discovery. Often the outcomes from knowledge discovery are not actionable, [[actionable knowledge discovery]], also known as [[domain driven data mining]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=L.|date=|year=2010|title=Domain driven data mining: challenges and prospects|url=|journal=IEEE Trans. on Knowledge and Data Engineering|volume=22|issue=6|pages=755–769|doi=10.1109/tkde.2010.32|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to discover and deliver actionable knowledge and insights.

Another promising application of knowledge discovery is in the area of [[software modernization]], weakness discovery and compliance which involves understanding existing software artifacts. This process is related to a concept of [[reverse engineering]]. Usually the knowledge obtained from existing software is presented in the form of models to which specific queries can be made when necessary. An [[entity relationship]] is a frequent format of representing knowledge obtained from existing software. [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) developed specification [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]] (KDM) which defines an ontology for the software assets and their relationships for the purpose of performing knowledge discovery of existing code. Knowledge discovery from existing software systems, also known as [[software mining]] is closely related to [[data mining]], since existing software artifacts contain enormous value for risk management and [[Business Value|business value]], key for the evaluation and evolution of software systems. Instead of mining individual [[data set]]s, [[software mining]] focuses on [[metadata]], such as process flows (e.g. data flows, control flows, &amp; call maps), architecture, database schemas, and business rules/terms/process.

'''''Lectio brevior''''' ([[Latin]] for "shorter reading") is one of the key principles in [[textual criticism]], especially biblical textual criticism. The principle is based on the widely accepted view that scribes showed more tendency to embellish and harmonise by additions and inclusions than by deletions. Hence, when comparing two or more manuscripts of the same text, the shorter readings are considered more likely to be closer to the original.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">This is a '''list of aesthetic principles of music'''.  It enumerates the various qualities by which music is judged aesthetically.

*''[[Blues]]'', an [[African American]] musical genre and quality of music that reflects an emotionally genuine soul and expresses melancholy, loneliness and tragedy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mariza lifts fado to higher level|work=Chicago Tribune|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-0608030290aug04,1,5455261.story?coll=chi-entertainment-utl|accessdate=October 13, 2006|author=Reich, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Conyach'', a musical quality that provokes the venting of emotions in listeners, associated with the music of Scottish Travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Dor'', a "pleasant feeling of melancholy" especially evoked by the [[doina]] music &lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Simon, "Taraf Traditions" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 237 - 247&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[duende (art)|Duende]]'', a complex emotional quality of Spanish music, especially [[flamenco]] &lt;ref&gt;Fairley, Jan, "A Wild, Savage Feeling in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 279 - 291&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Spice mix#Masala|Masala]]'', a term borrowed from Indian cookery to intend a Mumbai spicy musical mixture and the local production of movies and music (see also [[Masala film]])
*''[[Sakit Hati]]'' (lit. Indonesian for ''sick liver''), an Indonesian term, associated with the [[degung]] genre denoting a sense of wistful long and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Colin, "No Risk - No Fun!", in the ''Rough Guides to World Music'', pg. 131 - 142&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Mehna]]'', a term associated with Algeria [[raï]] music and is said to be similar to ''duende'' &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Andy, "Music Under Fire" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pg. 413–424&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Salsa music|Salsa]]'', closely associated with the salsa genre, the term ''salsa'' denoting a "wild" and "frenzied" musical experience, being used as a vocal interjection to acknowledge the musical excitement of a performance.  This usage can also express a sense of pan-Latin cultural identity, based around the "hotness" and "spiciness" of Latin culture.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, pg. 46; Morales, pp 56 - 59&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Saudade]]'', a Portuguese term, referring to an important element of [[fado]]; ''saudade'' is a mood, described as "a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably can not exist, for something other than the present, a turning towards the future; not an active discontent or poignant sadness, but an indolent dreaming wistfulness", with roots in "Islamic [[fatalism]], sailors' loneliness, and the unrequited love which was the perennial theme of [[troubadour]] poetry" &lt;ref&gt;Manuel, ''Popular Musics'', pg. 119: Manuel is the source of the "Islamic fatalism... troubadour poetry", and he sources "a vague and constant... indolent dreaming wistfulness" to Aubrey Bell, in Gallop, ''Portugal'', 262&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[soul music|Soul]]'', is a music genre, and also a quality of music or of performance which evokes an emotional state and is reflective of African American performance techniques &lt;ref name="Friedman pg. 46"&gt;Singer and Friedman, cited in Manuel, pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Swing (genre)|Swing]]'', [[Swing (dance)|swing dance]] and swing jazz, a genre of popular dance music, and a quality of emotionally and culturally genuine music in the African American community &lt;ref name="Friedman pg. 46"/&gt;
*''[[Tezeta]]'', an [[music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian musical]] term, evocative of melancholy, nostalgia and bittersweet longing, being originally a traditional song, then a genre, a [[musical mode]] and a marker of cultural identity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/music/planet/stories/s604793.htm|title=Ethiopian Blues &amp; Ballads|work=The Planet|accessdate=September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{selfref|For information on the web site for the coordination of all the Wikimedia Foundation projects, see [[Wikipedia:Meta]].}}

'''Meta''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]&lt;!--[[preposition]] and [[prefix]]--&gt; ''[[wikt:meta-|meta-]]'' μετά- meaning "after" or "beyond") is a prefix used in [[English language|English]] to indicate a concept which is an [[abstraction]] behind another concept, used to complete or add to the latter.

==Original Greek meaning==
In [[Greek (language)|Greek]], the prefix ''meta-'' is generally less esoteric than in [[English (language)|English]]; Greek ''meta-'' is equivalent to the [[Latin language|Latin]] words ''post-'' or ''ad-''. The use of the prefix in this sense occurs occasionally in [[English language|scientific English]] terms derived from [[Greek (language)|Greek]]. For example: the term ''[[Metatheria]]'' (the name for the [[clade]] of [[marsupial]] [[mammals]]) uses the prefix ''meta-'' in the sense the ''[[Metatheria]]'' occur on the tree of life adjacent to the ''[[Theria]]'' (the [[placental mammals]]).

==Epistemology==
{{anchor|About}}
In [[epistemology]], and often in common use, the prefix ''meta-'' is used to mean ''about (its own category)''. For example, [[metadata]] are data about data (who has produced them, when, what format the data are in and so on). In a database, [[metadata]] are also data about data stored in a data dictionary and describe information (data) about database tables such as the table name, table owner, details about columns, – essentially describing the table.   Also, [[metamemory]] in psychology means an individual's [[knowledge]] about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it. The modern sense of "an X about X" has given rise to concepts like "[[meta-cognition]]" (i.e. cognition about cognition), "[[meta-emotion]]" (i.e. emotion about emotion), "[[meta-discussion]]" (i.e. discussion about discussion), "[[meta-joke]]" (i.e. joke about jokes), and "[[metaprogramming]]" (i.e. writing programs that manipulate programs).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In a [[rule-based system]], a [[wiktionary:metarule|metarule]] is a rule governing the application of other rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/158976.158989 |title=The Use of Meta-rules in Rule Based Legal Computer Systems|first1=Uri J.|last1=Schild |first2=Shai|last2=Herzog |work=Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law |series=ICAIL '93|date=1993|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages=100–109|doi=10.1145/158976.158989|publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On higher level of abstraction==
Any subject can be said to have a ''[[metatheory]]'', a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its [[wikt:foundation|foundation]]s, [[wikt:method|method]]s, [[wikt:form|form]] and [[utility]], on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a [[metalanguage]], language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).

==Etymology==
The prefix comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[preposition]] and [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] ''meta-'' (μετά-), from μετά,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmeta%2F μητά], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; which meant "after", "beside", "with", "among" (with respect to the preposition, some of these meanings were distinguished by [[case marking]]). Other meanings include "beyond", "adjacent" and "self", and it is also used in the form μητα- as a prefix in Greek, with variants μετ- before vowels and μεθ- "meth-" before [[aspirated vowel]]s.

The earliest form of the word "meta" is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''me-ta'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=417|work=Palaeolexicon.com|title=The Linear B word me-ta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek preposition is [[cognate]] with the Old English preposition [[wikt:mid#Etymology 1|''mid'']] "with", still found as a prefix in ''midwife''. Its use in English is the result of [[back-formation]] from the word "metaphysics". In origin ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' was just the title of one of the principal works of [[Aristotle]]; it was so named (by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]]) because in the customary ordering of the works of Aristotle it was the book following ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''; it thus meant nothing more than "[the book that comes] after [the book entitled] ''Physics''". However, even Latin writers misinterpreted this as entailing metaphysics constituted "the science of what is beyond the physical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metaphysics|title=Metaphysics|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'' enunciates considerations of natures above physical realities, which one can examine through this particular part of philosophy, e.g., the existence of God. The use of the prefix was later extended to other contexts based on the understanding of metaphysics to mean "the science of what is beyond the physical".

==Quine and Hofstadter==

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites uses of the meta- prefix as "beyond, about" (such as meta-economics and meta-philosophy) going back to 1917. However, these formations are parallel to the original "metaphysics" and "metaphysical", that is, as a prefix to general nouns (fields of study) or adjectives. Going by the ''OED'' citations, it began being used with specific nouns in connection with mathematical logic sometime before 1929. (In 1920 [[David Hilbert]] proposed a research project in what was called "[[metamathematics]].")

A notable early citation is [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s 1937 use of the word "metatheorem",&lt;ref&gt;Willard Van Orman Quine, "Logic Based on Inclusion and Abstraction", The ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 2, No. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;145–152, December 1937&lt;/ref&gt; where meta- has the modern meaning of "an X about X". (Note earlier uses of "meta-economics" and even "metaphysics" do not have this doubled conceptual structure – they are about or beyond X but they do not themselves constitute an X).

[[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his 1979 book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (and in the sequel, ''[[Metamagical Themas]]''), popularized this meaning of the term. The book, which deals with  [[self-reference]] and [[strange loop]]s, and touches on Quine and his work, was influential in many computer-related subcultures and may be responsible for the popularity of the prefix, for its use as a solo term, and for the many recent coinages which use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Meta-Musings|last=Cohen|first=Noam|date=Sep 5, 1988|work=The New Republic|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hofstadter uses meta as a stand-alone word, as an adjective and as a directional preposition ("going meta," a term he coins for the old rhetorical trick of taking a debate or analysis to another level of abstraction, as when somebody says "This debate isn't going anywhere"). This book may also be responsible for the association of "meta" with strange loops, as opposed to just abstraction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The sentence "This sentence contains thirty-six letters," and the sentence which embeds it, are examples of "metasentences" referencing themselves in this way.

'''Milan Kangrga''' (1 May 1923 – 25 April 2008) was a [[Croatia]]n and [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] [[philosopher]] who was one of the leading thinkers in the [[Praxis school]] of thought which originated in the 1960s in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

Kangrga was born in [[Zagreb]], where he attended elementary and grammar school. In 1950, he graduated from the [[Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb]], where he commenced his work as a teaching assistant working in the fields of [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Between 1962 and 1964, he studied in [[Heidelberg]], Germany. He became a tenured professor in 1972 and he held this position until his retirement in 1993.

Kangrga started his confrontation with the Yugoslav communist leadership during his undergraduate studies in February 1948, before the clash of [[Joseph Broz Tito]] with [[Joseph Stalin]]. Then, he published his first philosophical article entitled ''On Ethics'' in ''[[Studentski list]]'' (Zagreb), which the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] bureaucrats found provoking. In 1953, Kangrga became a member of the LCY but in 1954 he was expelled from the party because he announced that he was inspired to become a communist by the works of [[Miroslav Krleža]], who still wasn't wholly rehabilitated by the regime.

In 1964, Kangrga was one of the founders of the journal ''Praxis''. Together with [[Rudi Supek]], he has established the [[Praxis School#Korčula Summer School|Korčula Summer School]], which was a unique meeting place for philosophers from the East and the West between 1964 and 1974. It is around these two institutions that the Praxis school took shape. The defining features of the school were: 1) emphasis on the writings of [[young Marx]]; and 2) call for freedom of speech in both East and West based upon Marx's insistence on ruthless critique of everything existent. Milan Kangrga emphasized creativity as well, but also the understanding of human beings as producers humanizing nature.

While he was critical of the Communist party in Yugoslavia, mainly for not implementing [[self-management socialism]], he rejected non-Socialist reactions against SFR Yugoslavia, the most notable one being the [[Croatian Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/k/a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan Kangrga has lectured in [[Bonn]], [[Münich]], [[Prague]], [[Budapest]], [[Moscow]], and [[Kiev]] among other cities. His articles have been published in Germany, Italy, the United States, France, Spain, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Mexico.

==Major works==

Kangrga has published 15 books. The most important are:
*''The Ethical Problem in Karl Marx's Works'' (1963)
*''Ethics and Liberty'' (1966)
*''The Meaning of the Historical'' (1970)
*''The Man and the World (1975)''
*''Ethics or Revolution'' (1983)
*''Praxis-Time-World'' (1984)
*''Hegel-Marx: some basic problems of Marxism'' (1988)
*''The Meaning and the Reality'' (1989)
*''Smugglers of Own Life'' (2001)
*''Nationalism or Democracy'' (2002)
*''Ethics: the basic problems and tendencies'' (2004)
*''Classical German Idealism'' (2008)

In recent years several [[philosopher]]s have broached the idea that mind should not be considered to be something which is just in the head but in various ways can be spread out onto the world.

This is a [[materialist]] rather than [[spiritualist]] notion, the mind being thought of as extending over the brain, external language and media such as charts, diaries and indeed any material substrate that can become intimately involved in our mindful actions.

== Select Quote ==
One of the proponents of this view is [[Andy Clark]]. He illustrates the concept with an example that deals with a specific group of [[Alzheimer's]] patients in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] (from p.&amp;nbsp;140 of the book ''Natural-Born Cyborgs''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;These patients were a puzzle because although they still lived alone, successfully, in the city, they really should not have been able to do so. On standard psychological tests they performed rather dismally. They should have been unable to cope with the demands of daily life. What was going on?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A sequence of visits to their home environments provided the answer. These home environments, it transpired, were wonderfully calibrated to support and scaffold these biological brains. The homes were stuffed full of cognitive props, tools, and aids. Examples included message centers where they stored notes about what to do and when; photos of family and friends complete with indications of names and relationships; labels and pictures on doors; "memory books" to record new events, meetings, and plans; and "open-storage" strategies in which crucial items (pots, pans, checkbooks) are always kept in plain view, not locked away in drawers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before you allow this image of intensive scaffolding to simply confirm your opinion of these patients as hopelessly cognitively compromised, try to imagine a world in which normal human brains are somewhat Alzheimic. Imagine that in this world we had gradually evolved a society in which the kinds of scaffolding found in the St. Louis home environments were the norm. And then reflect that, in a certain sense, this is exactly what we have done. Our own pens, paper, notebooks, diaries, and alarm clocks complement our brute biological profiles in much the same kind of way. Yet we never say of the artist, or poet, or scientist, "Oh, poor soul -- she is not really responsible for that painting/theory/poem; for don't you see how she had to rely on pen, paper, and sketches to offset the inadequacies of her own brain?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''National College Entrance Examination''' ('''NCEE'''), commonly known as '''''Gaokao''''' (高考, "Higher Education Exam", Pinyin ''gāo kǎo'', lit. "High exam"), is an academic examination held annually in the [[People's Republic of China]] (except [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], which have their own education systems). This examination is a prerequisite for entrance into almost all higher education institutions at the [[undergraduate]] level. It is usually taken by students in their last year of [[senior high school]], although there has been no age restriction since 2001.

The exams last about nine hours over a period of two days, depending on the province. Chinese and mathematics are included in all tests. An English test was formerly required of all students, but now Japanese, Russian or French may be taken instead. In addition, students must choose between two concentrations in most regions, either the social-science-oriented area (文科倾向) or the natural-science-oriented area (理科倾向). Students who choose social sciences receive further testing in &lt;u&gt;history, politics and geography&lt;/u&gt; (文科综合), while those who choose natural sciences are tested in &lt;u&gt;physics, chemistry and biology&lt;/u&gt; (理科综合). 

In 2006, a record high of 9.5 million people applied for tertiary education entry in China. Of these, 8.8 million (93%) took the national entrance exam and 27,600 (0.28%) were exempted (保送) due to exceptional or special talent. Everyone else (700,000 students) took other standardized entrance exams, such as those designed for [[adult education]] students.

The overall mark received by the student is generally a weighted sum of their subject marks. The maximum possible mark varies widely from year to year and also varies from province to province.

The modern College Entrance Examination takes place from 7 to 9 June every year.&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chi|first1=ma|title=Scenes from the most important test in China|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-06/08/content_29673286_3.htm|accessdate=9 June 2017|publisher=China Daily|date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:VM 4690 Wuhan Huazhong Keji Daxue campus.jpg|thumb|A banner on the [[Huazhong University of Science and Technology|HUST]] campus in [[Wuhan]] congratulates top exam score achievers from the university-affiliated high school]]
The National Higher Education Entrance Examination, commonly known as the gaokao (高考) was created in 1952.

The unified national tertiary entrance examination in 1952 marked the start of reform of National Matriculation Tests Policies (NMTP) in the newly established [[PRC]]. With the implementation of the first [[Five-Year Plans of the People's Republic of China|Five Year Plan]] in 1953, the NMTP was further enhanced. After repeated discussions and experiments, the NMTP was eventually set as a fundamental policy system in 1959. From 1958, the tertiary entrance [[examination system]] was affected by the [[Great Leap Forward]] Movement. Soon, unified recruitment was replaced by separate recruitment by individual or allied tertiary education institutions. Meanwhile, political censorship on candidate students was enhanced. Since 1962, criticism of the NMTP system had become even harsher, because it hurt benefits of the working class. On July 1966, the NMTP was officially canceled and substituted by a new admission policy of recommending workers, farmers and soldiers to college.&lt;ref&gt;Guodong Wei, “On the Reform of China’s NCEE since 1977” (PhD diss., Hebei University, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; During the next ten years, the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]], initiated by [[Mao Zedong]], forced both senior and junior secondary school graduates, the so-called "intellectual youths", to go to the country and work as farmers in the villages. Against the backdrop of world revolution, millions of such young people, some full of religious-like fervor, joined the ranks of farmers, working and living alongside them. However, they were soon disillusioned by the reality of hard conditions in the countryside. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In the early 1970s, Mao Zedong realized that internal political struggle had taken too big a toll on him as well as the nation and decided to resume the operation of universities. However, the students were selected based on political and family backgrounds rather than academic achievements. This practice continued until the death of Mao in September 1976. In late 1977, [[Deng Xiaoping]], then under [[Hua Guofeng]], the [[heir apparent]] of Mao, officially resumed the traditional examination based on academics, the National Higher Education Entrance Examination, which has continued to the present day.

The first such examination after the [[Cultural Revolution]] took place in late 1977 and was a history-making event. There was no limit on the age or official educational background of examinees. Consequently, most of the hopefuls who had accumulated during the ten years of the Cultural Revolution and many others who simply wanted to try their luck emerged from society for the examination. The youngest were in their early teens and the oldest were in their late thirties. The questions in the examinations were designed by the individual [[provinces]]. The total number of candidate students for the national college entrance exam in 1977 was as many as 5.7 million. Although the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] eventually expanded enrollment, adding 63,000 more to the admission quota, the admission ratio of 4.8% was the lowest in the history of the [[PRC]], with only 272,971 students being admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Wei, “On the Reform of China’s NCEE since 1977.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from 1978, the examination was uniformly designed by the Ministry of Education and all the students across the country took exactly the same examination.

However, reforms on the content and form of the exam have never stopped, among which the permission for individual provinces to customize their own exams has been the most salient. The Ministry of Education allowed the College Enrollment Office of [[Shanghai]] to employ an independent exam in 1985, which was the beginning of provincial proposition. In the same year, [[Guangdong]] was also permitted to adopt independent proposition. Starting from 2003, [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Jiangsu]], and [[Zhejiang]] were allowed to adopt independent propositions. Till now, there have been 16 provinces and municipalities adopting customized exams.

Although today's admission rate is much higher than in 1977, 1978 and before the 1990s, it is still fairly low compared to the availability of higher education in the [[Western world]]. Consequently, the examination is highly competitive, and the prospective examinees and their parents experience enormous pressure. For the majority, it is a watershed that divides two dramatically different lives.

In 1970, less than 1% of Chinese people had attended higher education; however, university admissions places are less than 1/1000 of the whole population of China. In the 1970s, 70% of students who were recommended to go to university had political backgrounds reflecting the political nature of university selection at the time. At the same time, the undergraduate course system narrowed down the time from 4 years to 3 years. According to incomplete statistics, from 1966 to 1977, institutions of higher learning recruited 940,000 people who belonged to the worker-peasant-soldier group.

For most provinces, the National Higher Education Entrance Examination is held once a year (in recent years some of the provinces in China hold examinations twice a year and the extra one is called the Spring Entrance Examination). The previous schedule (before 2003) of the National Higher Education Entrance Examination was in July every year. It now takes place in June every year. Partial Provincial administrative units determine the schedule of the exams on the 7th and 8 June.

=== 2017 Gaokao ===
9.40 million students attended Gaokao in 2017, 7 million of whom were admitted by colleges and/or universities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eol.cn/html/g/gkrs/index.shtml|title=中国教育网|last=|first=|date=2018-06-06|website=中国教育在线(Chinese simplified)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of first-class admission (Yi Ben, deemed as good universities in China) varied from 9.48% to 30.5%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sohu.com/a/156585521_559502|title=全国31省市一本录取率排名，哪个省份高考最难？|last=|first=|date=2017-07-12|website=Sohu (Chinese simplified)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;,with the lowest admission rates in [[Henan|Henan province]] and [[Shanxi|Shanxi province]], at less than 10%.

==Procedure==
The National Higher Education Entrance Examination is not uniform across the country, but administered uniformly within each [[province of China]] or each [[direct-controlled municipality]]. The National Higher Education Entrance Examination is graded variously across the country. It is arranged at the end of the spring semester and secondary school graduates across the country take the examination simultaneously over a three-day period. Prior to 2003, the examination was held in July, but has since been moved to the month of June. This move was made in consideration of the adverse effects of hot weather on students living in southern China and possible flooding during the rainy season in July.

In different places and across different time in history, students were required to apply for their intended university or college ''prior'' to the exam, ''after'' the exam, or more recently, ''after'' they learned of their scores, by filling a list of ordered preferences. The application list is classified into several tiers (including at least early admissions, key universities, regular universities, vocational colleges), each of which can contain around 4-6 intended choices in institution and program, though typically an institution or program would only admit students who apply to it as their first choice in each tier. In some places, students are allowed to apply for different tiers at different times. For example, in [[Shanghai]], students apply for early admission, key universities and regular universities prior to the exam, but can apply for other colleges after they learned of their scores.

The exam is administered for two or three days. Three subjects are mandatory everywhere: [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Mathematics]], and a foreign language—usually [[English language|English]], but this may also be substituted by [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The other six standard subjects are three sciences: [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Biology]], and three humanities: [[History]], [[Geography]], and Political Education.&lt;ref&gt;This subject is partly a [[civics]] or introductory [[legal studies]] class, and partly [[ideology]] from the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;/ref&gt; Applicants to science/engineering or art/humanities programs typically take one to three from the respective category. Since the 2000s, an integrated test, science integrated test, humanities integrated test or wider integrated test has been introduced in some places. This integrated test may or may not be considered during admission. In addition, some special regional subjects are required or optional in some places. Currently, the actual requirement varies from province to province.

However, the general requirements are as follows:
# Abide by the Constitution and laws of the People's Republic of China.
# Have a high school diploma or equivalent.
# Be in good health.
# Have read carefully and are willing to abide by the rules of the Register and other regulations and policies of the Institutions of Higher Learning and the Office of Admissions Committee about the enrollment management.
# If foreign immigrants who settle down in China conform to the enlists condition of the National Higher Education Entrance Examination, they can then apply for the National Higher Education Entrance Examination with the foreign immigrants’ resident certificate, which are sent by the Provincial Public Security Department at the location that is assigned.
# If willing to apply for the Military Academy: students who are going to graduate this year and have studied in high school for the first time can not be older than 20 years of age and unmarried; willing to apply for the Police Academy, and students who are going to graduate this year and have studied in high school for the first time can not be older than 22 years of age and unmarried; willing to apply for the foreign language major in Police Academy, and students who are going to graduate this year and have studied in high school for the first time can not be older than 20 years of age and unmarried.
# If students from Juvenile Classes want to take the National Higher Education Entrance Examination, their schools need to pre-select, send certification of approval, inform the exact required courses, and clarify the offices of Admissions Committee where they will take the National Higher Education Entrance Examination. After doing so, the students can then give the application. After the Office of Admissions Committee reviews and approves, the students can apply for and attend the National Higher Education Entrance Examination at the right location. Students who apply for Shao Nian Ban must be part of the small percentage of the population. They must have very high IQ, their grades must be excellent, and they must study at a secondary or high school under the age of 15 (not including those who are going to graduate this year and has studied in high school for the first time).

The following groups are prohibited from taking the exam:
# Students who are currently studying higher education.
# Students at high school who are not supposed to graduate from high school at the present year, but pretend to be graduates in order to attend the National Higher Education Entrance Examination.
# Students whose [[Hukou system|files]] are incomplete, such as no school status. In practice, this prohibition serves to exclude millions of children whose parents violated the [[one-child policy]]. 
# One who is serving a prison sentence or is being prosecuted for violating Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China.

Applicants to some specialist programs are also screened by additional criteria: some art departments (e.g. audition), military and police schools (political screening and physical exam), and some sports programs (tryout).

Scores obtained in the examinations can be used in applying universities outside mainland China. Among all the places, the counterpart Hong Kong is on their top list. In 2007, 7 students with overall highest score in their provinces entered Hong Kong's universities rather than the two major universities in mainland China. In 2010, over 1,200 students entered the 12 local institutions which provide tertiary education courses through this examination. In addition, [[City University of Hong Kong]] and [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] directly participate in the application procedure like other mainland universities.&lt;!--In 2008, there are at least 967 students entered the [[Joint University Programmes Admissions System|8 major local institutions]], or [[Hong Kong Shue Yan University|Shue Yan University]]'s undergraduate degrees in Hong Kong, this number did not include the late admissions of particular students affected by the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;www.mingpaonews.com/20080710/gfb1.htm 14-years-old student admitted by HKU, Mingpao news Hong Kong, July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The examination is essentially the only criterion for tertiary education admissions. A poor performance on the test almost always means giving up on that goal. Students hoping to attend university will spend most of their waking moments studying prior to the exam. If they fail in their first attempt, some of them repeat the last year of high school life and make another attempt the following year.

==Subjects==
The subjects tested in the National Higher Education Entrance Examination have changed over time. Traditionally, students would undertake either a set of "arts" subjects or a set of "science" subjects, with some shared compulsory subjects. The subjects taken in the Examination affected the degree or career paths open to the student. In recent years, different provinces have included different subjects in the Examination, or implemented flexible systems for selecting the subjects to be tested, resulting in a number of different systems.

==="3+X" system (Ready to disable)===
As a pilot examination system used in order to promote education system reform, this examination system has been implemented in most parts of the country, including [[Beijing|Beijing City]], [[Tianjin City]], [[Hebei Province]], [[Liaoning Province]], [[Jilin Province]], [[Heilongjiang Province]], [[Anhui Province]], [[Fujian Province]], [[Guangdong Province]], [[Jiangxi Province]], [[Henan Province]], [[Shandong Province]], [[Hubei Province]], [[Shaanxi Province]], [[Sichuan Province]], [[Guizhou Province]], [[Yunnan Province]], [[Shanxi Province]], [[Chongqing City]], [[Gansu Province]], [[Qinghai Province]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Guangxi]], [[Ningxia]], [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]. In the context of the reform of the National College Entrance Examination, this program will be suspended in Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong and Hainan provinces from 2020, and will be suspended in most provinces and cities in China from 2021. It will cease across Mainland China by 2022.

*"3" refers to compulsory subjects, including "Chinese, Mathematics and a foreign language (mostly English, and Japanese, Korean or Russian are also accepted; choices differ in different regions)", each of which accounts for 150/750 in total score.
*"X" means that students can choose, according to their own interests, one subject from either Social Sciences (including Political Sciences, History and Geography), or Natural Sciences (including Physics, Chemistry and Biology), which accounts for 300/750 in total score.
*If a student chooses Natural Sciences, then he or she will take a relatively harder mathematics test as well, including [[probability theory]], [[conic section]]s and [[calculus]].
*For candidates of minor ethnic groups in Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Jilin, their Literature score consists of an easier Chinese Literature test and an optional subject on Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur and Korean Literature, each counting for 75 points.

==="3+2" system===
*"3" refers to three compulsory subjects, including "Chinese, Mathematics and a foreign language". "2" refers to selecting two subjects either from Politics, History or Geography for arts students, or from Biology, Chemistry or Physics for science students.
*This system used to be employed in [[Jiangsu Province]], but has been replaced by another system in 2020.

==="4+X" system===
This system was used after the New Curriculum Reform being employed in [[Guangdong]] province, and now it has been abandoned.
*"X" means that according to their own interests, candidates can choose one or two subjects either from arts subjects, including Politics, History and Geography (Politics and Geography cannot be chosen simultaneously), or from science subjects, including Biology, Physics and Chemistry (Physics and Biology cannot be chosen simultaneously).
*Chinese and a foreign language are compulsory. Two separate Mathematics tests are designed respectively for arts students and science students.
*In addition to three compulsory subjects and X subject, arts students have to take comprehensive tests of arts, and science students have to take comprehensive tests of science.

==="3+1+X" system===
This system has been implemented in [[Shanghai]] since the employment of comprehensive courses, now abandoned.
*"3" refers to three compulsory subjects "Chinese, Mathematics and a foreign language", with 150 scores for each subject.
*"1" refers to one subject that candidates choose according to their own interests and specialty from "Politics, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry and Biology". This subject accounts 150 scores when admitted by universities and colleges at undergraduate level. The score is not included in the total score when admitted by vocational and technical colleges. Therefore, candidates can give up this subject when applying for colleges at vocational and technical level.
*"X" refers to comprehensive ability test, which is categorized into arts tests and science tests. Arts students can either choose one subject from Politics, History and Geography, or take an arts comprehensive test when giving up "1' subject. Science students can either choose one subject from Physics, Chemistry and Biology, or take a science comprehensive test when giving up "1" subject. Regardless of arts and science categories, all the comprehensive ability tests cover knowledge of six subjects,including Politics, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. In the first volume of the arts test, number of questions related to arts subjects exceeds science questions, and vice versa; the second volume of the two tests are the same.

==="3+2+X" system (Ready to disable)===
This is a pilot college entrance examination system implemented by the [[Jiangsu]] Province in 2003 after examining other testing systems, but it was replaced by "3+2" system in 2008. Subject tests will take turns into the embrace of National Standard. A new policy is expected to substitute the old one in 2021. 

*"3" refers to three compulsory subjects "Chinese, mathematics and a foreign language", which are recorded in the total score.
*"2" refers to choosing two subjects from the following six areas "politics, history, geography, physics, chemistry, biology", which are not recorded in total score but a class like A+, A, etc. will be recorded.
*"X" refers to a comprehensive science or liberal arts exam, which is not recorded in the total score, only for university admission reference.

==="3+X+1" system===
This is part of the curriculum reform in China.
*"3" refers to Chinese, Mathematics and a foreign language, which are compulsory testing subjects for each candidate.
*"X" means choosing one of the two comprehensive tests in either sciences or liberal arts, according to the student's interest.
*"1" refers to a basic proficiency test on skills that high school graduates needs and should have in order to adapt to social life. This college entrance examination system was implemented for the first time in [[Shandong]] in 2007. 
* The examination system in Shandong Province reverted to the "3+X" system as of the most recent testing in June 2014.{{Citation needed|date = June 2014}}

Summary of information about this program,see ''&lt;u&gt;the Education of Sina&lt;/u&gt;.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edu.sina.cn/zt_d/xgkp|title=新高考{{!}}高考改革_新浪专题|last=sina_mobile|first=|date=|website=edu.sina.cn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* This system has been implemented in Shanghai and Zhejiang since the employment of comprehensive courses since September 2014.
* All students participating in the National College Entrance Examination must take Chinese, mathematics, and a foreign language (a choice of one from English, Japanese, Russian, German, French, Spanish). They also take three subjects of their choice from physics, chemistry, biology, geography, politics and history.
* Since 2017, Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Hainan have begun to use this program. Since 2018, about 7 Chinese provinces and Chongqing City have started to use this program. Since 2020, China has started to use this program.
**Provinces and cities that were originally scheduled to start The Reform of the National College Entrance Examination in 2018: '''Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hubei, Chongqing, Hunan, Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Guizhou, Anhui, Tibet.''' 
**'''Henan, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Jilin, Guizhou, Anhui, Tibet''' were evaluated by the Ministry of Education of PRC, and their conditions did not meet the start-up requirements and were required to be postponed. Among them, Anhui started in 2019. '''Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hubei, Chongqing, Hunan, Hebei, Liaoning''' reached the start condition and were approved to start in 2018.
* Why are the ten provinces failing to meet the start-up requirements? The most critical reason is that there will be problems with the class shift. After the reform, there will be 20 combinations in the six elective subjects. It is prone to teacher tides, and puts higher demands on the reserve of teachers in a province. The above-mentioned provinces that postpone the reforms are due to inadequate preparations, fail to meet such requirements, and are required to postpone them.
*Originally, the original intention of the reform was to let the students develop their strengths and avoid weaknesses, but the students were rushing to the high-scoring subjects. This has resulted in very few people in certain subjects, such as '''&lt;big&gt;Physics! Because physics is the hardest subject in 6 subjects!&lt;/big&gt;''' 
*In the calculation of the scores of the other,  70 scores (in Shanghai) or 100 scores (in Zhejiang) each, according to the class like A+, A, B+, ..., D, E, etc(Divided into 21 grades in Zhejiang, 11 in Shanghai; 3 points between every two grades). According to the published news, Beijing and Tianjin indicated that their plan is similar to the Zhejiang plan, and Anhui's request for comment is similar to Zhejiang, too&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edu.365jia.cn/news/2015-07-08/163DAA3A156DEEEE_2.html|title=安徽省普通高中学业水平考试实施办法(征求意见稿)__万家热线-安徽门户网站|website=edu.365jia.cn|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Shandong is divided into eight grades of A, B+, B, C+, C, D+, D, and E. According to the original scores and equal conversion rules of the candidates, they are converted to 91-100, 81-90, 71-80, 61-70, 51-60, 41-50, 31-40, 21-30 eight score intervals, get the grades of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdzk.gov.cn/gkgg/message/327/3271f9ff22d6710447bf.shtm|title=山东省教育招生考试院|website=www.sdzk.gov.cn|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdjys.org/mobile.php/News/view/id/26498.html|title=​山东高考综合改革的等级计分规则_山东教育社|website=www.sdjys.org|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''The Classification Scheme of Zhejiang and Shanghai, 3 points per grades, this is an unreasonable place for the distribution system: the score span is too large, causing more people to have a speculative mentality when they choose a subject. They do not want to learn subjects that are not easy to get high scores, because they are afraid that their scores are low. In this case, physical cold occurs.'''
* Another point to be concerned is that candidates who want to take the college entrance examination must first take the Qualifying Exam of the Academic Proficiency Examination for Senior High School Students(普通高中学业水平考试). The results are shown as “qualified” and “unqualified”. Can take part in the National College Entrance Examination after passing the Qualificating Examination.
*There are still many problems with the Reform of the   National College Entrance Examination. I will not list them here. This reform is also the largest reform since the establishment of the National College Entrance Examination. The task is arduous. This time, because of the division of the social-science and natural-sciences system that has been implemented since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it can be said that there is no one before. I hope that the problems that have arisen in the reform can be effectively solved, so that the social-science and natural-sciences will not be promoted across the country.

==Criticisms==

===Independent proposition===
Regional imbalance of social and economic development has resulted in disparity in education levels across China, which gives rise to provincial proposition. However, provincial governments have to increase budget on education in order to offset the declining credibility of the exam caused by lack of experienced proposition experts and management personnel, which will, more or less, cause a repetitive investment in Human Resources, finance or material. For example,exam in Jiangsu is totally a different from others.It only counts the scores of the three major subjects,which means the total cents are decreased largely.To compete in a narrow range of score,students must focus on the study of The Three.The other two subjects are not recorded in total score but a class will be recorded,and universities has a requirement of a exact class.Different from the folk,the assessment is according to the percentage of students' examination results.Moreover,independent proposition covers regional discrimination generated by huge disparity of cut off scores between different provinces.

=== Academic segregation ===
Chinese students are required to choose either Social Sciences (political science, geography, and history) or Natural Sciences (physics, chemistry, and biology).  This happens particularly at the end of the first year of high school, when students are mostly 15-16 years old. Once they make their decisions, they start preparing for the subject tests, and no longer take classes for the other three subjects. This decision will determine which college entrance test they will take at the age of 18, as well as influence their college majors and future career path.

===Regional discrimination===
A university usually sets a fixed admission quota for each province, with a higher number of students coming from its home province. As the advanced educational resources (number and quality of universities) are distributed unevenly across China, it is argued that people are being discriminated against during the admission process based on their geographic region. For example, compared to [[Beijing]], [[Jiangxi]] province has fewer universities per capita. Therefore, Jiangxi usually receives fewer admission quotas compared with Beijing, which makes a significantly higher position among applicants necessary for a Jiangxi candidate to be admitted by the same university than his Beijing counterpart. The unequal admission schemes for different provinces and regions might intensify competition among examinees from provinces with fewer advanced education resources. For example, Beijing University planned to admit 1800 science students from Beijing (with 80,000 candidates in total), but only 38 from Shandong (with 660,000 candidates in total). This is not similar to the practice of regional universities in other countries which receive subsidies from regional governments in addition to or in place of those received from central governments, as universities in China largely depend on state budget rather than local budget. However, this regionally preferential policy does provide subsidies to minority students from under-developed regions that enjoy limited educational resources, such as [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]].

The regional discrimination can be proved by the disparities between ratios of a province's enrollment of students to the total number of candidate students of the province. In 2010, acceptance rate for students from [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Shandong]] and [[Henan]] who applied for universities of the first-ranking category were 20.1%, 18%, 7.1% and 3.5% respectively. High acceptance rates are likely to appear in the most and least developed cities and provinces, such as [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]] or [[Qinghai]]. In contrast, acceptance rates remain relatively equal among provinces of the average developmental level.

In recent years, varied admission standards have led some families to relocate for the sole purpose of advancing their children's chances of entering university.&lt;ref name="migrant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsgd.com/culture/universities/200508040017.htm|title=Migrating college candidates could be left out in cold, News Guangdong, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, regional discrimination is not only restricted to the ratio for admission. This is best illustrated with an example of the [[Hubei]] Province, where students' exam scores have been higher than other provinces for a long time. A score for a Hubei student to just reach the admission cut-off line for a key university may be enough for a student from another province to be admitted by a much better university, and even enough for a Beijing student to be admitted by top universities like Tsinghua University and Peking University.

Some local students in [[Hong Kong]] complained that it was unfair that the increasing intake of Mainland students who have performed at a high level in this examination increases the admission grades of universities, making it harder for local students to get admission. In 2010, more than 5,000 out of the 17,000 students who achieved the minimum university entry requirement were not offered places in any degree courses in the UGC-funded universities.

===Special concessions===
There are special concessions for members of [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]], foreign nationals, persons with family origin in [[Taiwan]], and children of military casualties. Students can also receive bonus marks by achieving high results in [[Olympiad#Other uses|academic Olympiads]], other science and technology competitions, sporting competitions, as well as "political or moral" distinction. In 2018 NPC, the government admitted to cancel all bonus scores from competitions.

===Psychological pressure===
{{see also|Mental health in China}}
Because Gaokao is one of the most influential examinations in China and the fact that students can only take the test once a year, both teachers and students undergo tremendous pressure in preparing for and taking the exam. For teachers, because the society focuses on the rate of admission into universities, teachers have to pay more attention to each student's ability to take the exam. Because of this, teachers would like to give students more and more practice for exams. This teaching methodology, colloquially referred to as "cramming", involves students memorizing large volumes of information fed to them by teachers and undertaking many practice exercises in order to optimize exam writing ability. One of the disadvantages of this method is the lack of focus on teaching critical thinking and ignoring students' emotions, values and personalities. Many examinees suffer from severe nervousness during the test. In some cases, examinees may faint in the examination room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Xu|first=Xiuhua|title=基础教育弊端日益显现 中国课程改革势在必行|url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/jiaoyu/1055/3051927.html|publisher=People Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further and deeper stemming criticisms have been leveled that the testing system is the "most pressure packed examination in the world."&lt;ref name="Stressful Times"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors surrounding the testing period have been extreme under some reports, with doctors in [[Tianjin]] purportedly prescribing [[birth control pill]]s to female students whose parents wanted to ensure the girls were not menstruating at the time of examination.&lt;ref name="Stressful Times" /&gt;  Testing pressure, for some critics, has been linked to faintings, increased drop out rates, and even increasing rates of teenage [[clinical depression]] and [[suicide in China]].

==Impact==
The Gaokao tends to rule the lives of most Chinese teenagers and their parents. In [[Zhengzhou]] (Henan), the local bus company parked a 985 number bus outside a Gaokao center for parents to wait in, the number reflecting a popular enrollment program number for university entrances.&lt;ref name="daily" /&gt;

{{Criminal defenses}}

In the [[criminal law]] of many nations, '''necessity''' may be either a possible [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] or an exculpation for breaking the [[law]]. [[Defendant]]s seeking to rely on this [[defense (legal)|defense]] argue that they should not be held [[liable]] for their [[action (philosophy)|actions]] as a [[crime]] because their conduct was ''necessary'' to prevent some greater harm and when that conduct is not excused under some other more specific provision of law such as [[self defense]]. Except for a few statutory exemptions and in some medical cases&lt;ref&gt;See Re A (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) [2001] Fam 147&lt;/ref&gt; there is no corresponding defense in [[Necessity in English law#History|English law]] for murder.&lt;ref&gt;See [[R v Dudley and Stephens]] [1884] 14 QBD 273 and R v Howe [1987] 1 AC 417&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a drunk driver might contend that he drove his car to get away from a [[kidnap]] (cf. ''[[North by Northwest#Plot|North by Northwest]]'').  Most [[common law]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s recognize this defense, but only under limited circumstances. Generally, the defendant must affirmatively show (i.e., introduce some evidence) that (a) the harm he sought to avoid outweighs the danger of the prohibited conduct he is charged with; (b) he had no reasonable alternative; (c) he ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed; and (d) he did not himself create the danger he sought to avoid.  Thus, with the "drunk driver" example cited above, the necessity defense will not be recognized if the defendant drove further than was reasonably necessary to get away from the kidnapper, or if some other reasonable alternative was available to him.

==General discussion==
As a matter of political expediency, states usually allow some classes of person to be excused from liability when they are engaged in socially useful functions but intentionally cause injury, loss or damage. For example, the [[fire service]]s and other [[civil defence]] [[organization]]s have a general duty to keep the [[community]] safe from harm. If a fire or flood is threatening to spread out of control, it may be reasonably necessary to destroy other property to form a [[fire break]], or to trespass on land to throw up mounds of earth to prevent the water from spreading. These examples have the common feature of individuals intentionally breaking the law because they believe it to be urgently necessary to protect others from harm, but some states distinguish between a response to a crisis arising from an entirely natural cause (an inanimate force of nature), e.g. a fire from a lightning strike or rain from a storm, and a response to an entirely human crisis. Thus, [[parent]]s who lack the financial means to feed their [[child]]ren cannot use necessity as a defense if they steal food. The existence of welfare benefits and strategies other than self-help defeat the claim of an urgent necessity that cannot be avoided in any way other than by breaking the law. Further, some states apply a test of proportionality. So the defense would only be allowed where the degree of harm actually caused was a reasonably proportionate response to the degree of harm threatened. This is a legal form of [[cost–benefit analysis]].

==Specific jurisdictions==
*[[Necessity in English law|England]]
*[[Necessity in Canadian law|Canada]]
*[[Necessity in International law|International]]

===Denmark and Norway===
Emergency law/right (''nødret'', ''nødrett'') is the equivalent of necessity in Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=113401 Straffeloven] på [[Retsinformation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-20050520-028.html#17 Straffeloven av 2005 § 17]&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered related to but separate from self-defence. Common legal examples of necessity includes: breaking windows and other objects in order to escape a fire, commandeering a vehicle to serve as an emergency ambulance, ignoring traffic rules while rushing a dying patient to a hospital, and even killing a person who poses an immediate threat to several other people not including yourself. In the last case self-defense laws are not enough, but the case is covered by ''nødret''. ''Nødret'' can only be invoked though when no other option is available.

===International law===

====Customary international law====
Under international law, an obligation of [[customary international law]] or an obligation granted under a bilateral investment treaty may be suspended under the doctrine of necessity. It is "an exception from illegality and in certain cases even as an exception from responsibility." ''See Continental Casualty Company v Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No ARB/03/09.'' 
In order to invoke the doctrine of necessity:
(1) The invoking State must not have contributed to the state of necessity,
(2) Actions taken were the only way to safeguard an essential interest from grave and impending danger.
''Id. at page 72, paragraph 165.''

===Taiwan, Republic of China===
Necessity is a possible defense per the Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=C0000001&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=24 Article 24 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of China].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Administrative Penalty Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=A0030210&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=13 Article 13 of Administrative Penalty Act].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Necessity as a defense to criminal acts conducted to meet political ends was rejected in the case of ''United States v. Schoon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The demise of the political necessity defense: indirect civil  disobedience and United States v. Schoon|year=1993|author=Cavallaro, James L., Jr.|publisher=University of California Press|issn=0008-1221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, 30 people, including appellants, gained admittance to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] office  in Tucson, where they chanted "keep America's tax dollars out of El  Salvador," splashed simulated blood on the counters, walls, and  carpeting, and generally obstructed the office's operation. The court ruled that the elements of necessity did not exist in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=U.S. v. Schoon|reporter=F2d|vol=939|opinion=826|date=July 29, 1991|url=http://openjurist.org/939/f2d/826/united-states-v-d-schoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In specific states====
* [[Necessity defense (Kansas)|Kansas]]
* [[Necessity defense (New York)|New York]]

===Singapore===
Necessity is a defence per the Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=85fe891c-9489-47a0-a0c2-15a8a9fb92c9;page=0;query=DocId%3A%22025e7646-947b-462c-b557-60aa55dc7b42%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0#pr81-he-. Section 81 of the Penal Code of Singapore.]&lt;/ref&gt;.
This requires lack of criminal intent, good faith (due care and attention&lt;ref&gt;[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=4933180d-0e2b-4808-bcb8-1e276b9522b4;page=0;query=DocId%3A%22025e7646-947b-462c-b557-60aa55dc7b42%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0#pr52-he-. Section 52 of the Penal Code of Singapore.]&lt;/ref&gt;), and the goal of preventing harm. The harm must be sufficiently serious and imminent to justify or excuse the act.

==Canada==

In Canada, Necessity is recognized as a defence for crimes committed in urgent situations of clear and imminent peril in which the accused has no safe or legal way out of the situation. 

Three Requirements for defence of necessity:
(1) Urgent situation of imminent peril or danger 
(2) No reasonable legal alternative
(3) Proportionality between harm inflicted and harm avoided

It should also be noted that the first and second element are evaluated on the modified objective standard. The third element is evaluated on a purely objective standard. [[R v Latimer]], 2001 SCC 1

== In religious law ==
In Judaism, the principle of ''[[pikuach nefesh]]'' allows any law to be broken to save a life, except laws against murder, adultery/incest and idolatry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5242">'''Nicholas of Autrecourt''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Nicholas d'Autrécourt''; [[Latin]]: ''Nicolaus de Autricuria'' or ''Nicolaus de Ultricuria''; c. 1299, [[Autrécourt-sur-Aire|Autrecourt]] – 16 or 17 July 1369, [[Metz]]) was a [[France|French]] [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosopher]] and [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[theologian]].

==Life and thought==
Born in [[Autrécourt-sur-Aire|Autrecourt]], near [[Verdun]], he was educated at Paris and earned bachelor's degrees in theology and law and a master's degree in arts.&lt;ref name="Zupkoarticle" /&gt; Nicholas is known principally for developing [[skepticism]] to extreme [[logic]]al conclusions. He is sometimes considered the sole genuinely skeptic philosopher of medieval times. Nicholas founded his skeptical position on arguments that knowledge claims were not "reducible to the first principle," that is, that it was not contradictory to deny them.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 210-216.&lt;/ref&gt; His views have been compared to those of [[David Hume]], but it has been suggested that the similarities are superficial, and there is no evidence Nicholas influenced Hume, or other modern philosophers such as [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name="Zupkoarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Zupko, Jack A. |editor=Robert Audi |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |page=612 |isbn=0-521-63722-8 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Nicholas was committed to skepticism is unclear, but on 19 May 1346 his views were condemned by [[Pope Clement VI]] as [[heresy|heretical]]. Nicholas was sentenced to burn his books publicly and recant, which he did in Paris in 1347.&lt;ref name="Zupkoarticle" /&gt;

In the 14th century, Nicholas of Autrecourt considered that matter, space, and time were all made up of indivisible atoms, points, and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms. The similarities of his ideas with those of [[al-Ghazali]] suggest that Nicholas was familiar with the work of al-Ghazali, who was known as "Algazel" in Europe, either directly or indirectly through [[Averroes]].

Much of the extant knowledge of Nicholas of Autrecourt's epistemology derives from one letter written by magister Egidius (master Giles) to Nicholas and an excerpt from his letter in reply to Egidius and from nine letters written by Nicholas to the Franciscan theologian Bernardus Aretinus (Bernard of [[Arezzo]]); however, only two of the nine letters survive. Some fragments of the lost letters are quoted in the records of the condemnatory proceedings against Nicholas. Almost nothing is known about these two correspondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=De Rijk, Lambertus Marie (Bertus)|title=Nicholas of Autrecourt: His Correspondence with Master Giles and Bernard of Arezzo|location=Leiden|publisher=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Perspectivism''' ({{lang-de|Perspektivismus}}) is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view (touched upon as far back as [[Plato]]'s rendition of [[Protagoras]]) that all ideations take place from particular [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s, and that there are many possible [[conceptual scheme]]s, or perspectives in which judgment of [[truth]] or value can be made. This is often taken to imply that no way of seeing the world can be taken as definitively "true", but does ''not'' necessarily [[logical consequence|entail]] that all perspectives are equally valid. The term was coined by nineteenth-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

==View==
Perspectivism rejects [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] metaphysics, claiming that no evaluation of objectivity can transcend cultural formations or subjective designations. Therefore, there are no objective facts, nor any knowledge of [[Noumenon|a thing-in-itself]]. Truth is separated from any particular vantage point, and so there are no [[ethics|ethical]] or [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[wikt:absolute|absolutes]].&lt;ref&gt;Mautner, Thomas, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'', 2005, page 418&lt;/ref&gt; Rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) are constantly reassessed according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1993, page 61.&lt;/ref&gt; "Truth" is thus created by integrating different vantage points together.

People always adopt perspectives by default &amp;ndash; whether they are aware of it or not &amp;ndash; and the concepts of one's existence are defined by the circumstances surrounding that individual. Truth is made by and for individuals and peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Kakures, Dion, ''History of Philosophy'', 1993, page 346&lt;/ref&gt; This view differs from many types of [[relativism]] which consider the truth of a particular [[proposition]] as something that altogether cannot be [[Validity (logic)|evaluated]] with respect to an "absolute truth", without taking into consideration [[culture]] and context.&lt;ref name="Appearance and the thing-in-itself"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|title=Human, All Too Human|date=1878|chapter=Section 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view is outlined in an aphorism from Nietzsche's posthumously-assembled collection ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]''&lt;!--quotations from Nietzsche's Nachlass/The Will to Power must be cited to confirm this in Description--&gt;:

{{Quotation|In so far as the word "knowledge" has any meaning, the world is knowable; but it is ''interpretable'' [emphasis in original] otherwise, it has no meaning behind it, but countless meanings.—"Perspectivism."

''It is our needs that interpret the world; our drives and their For and Against.'' [emphasis added] Every drive is a kind of lust to rule; each one has its perspective that it would like to compel all the other drives to accept as a norm.|Friedrich Nietzsche; trans. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]|''The Will to Power'', §481 (1883–1888)&lt;ref&gt;Original German: ''Soweit überhaupt das Wort »Erkenntniß« Sinn hat, ist die Welt erkennbar: aber sie ist anders ''deutbar'', sie hat keinen Sinn hinter sich, sondern unzählige Sinne. – »Perspektivismus«. ¶ Unsere Bedürfnisse sind es, die die Welt auslegen; unsere Triebe und deren Für und Wider. Jeder Trieb ist eine Art Herrschsucht, jeder hat seine Perspektive, welche er als Norm allen übrigen Trieben aufzwingen möchte.'' (''Wille zur Macht'', [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/6029/24 Nr. 481].)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Interpretation===
[[Richard Schacht]], in his interpretation of Nietzsche's thought, argues that this can be expanded into a revised form of "[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]]" in relation to "[[subjectivity]]" as an aggregate of singular viewpoints that illuminate, for example, a particular idea in seemingly self-contradictory ways but upon closer inspection would reveal a difference of contextuality and of rule by which such an idea (e.g., that is fundamentally perspectival) can be validated. Therefore, it can be said each perspective is subsumed into and, taking account of its individuated context, adds to the overall objective measure of a proposition under examination. Nevertheless, perspectivism does not implicate any method of inquiry nor a [[structuralism|structural]] theory of knowledge in general.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1993.{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary philosophy==
In [[contemporary philosophy]], perspectivism was revived by [[José Ortega y Gasset]].&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;Holmes, Oliver, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gasset/ "José Ortega y Gasset"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (Summer 2011 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophical Consultancy''' is a relatively new movement in [[philosophy]] which applies philosophical thinking and debating to the resolution of a person's problem. [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] and Ad Hoogendijk are two, German and Dutch philosophers who established themselves as consultant philosophers in the 1980s (Achenbach 1984, 2002; Hoogendijk 1988) and led the way to a number of other developments all over the world. They proposed an alternative to psychotherapeutic culture by working exclusively within the field of existential investigation with clients or patients, whom they called 'visitors.'

Achenbach argues that it is life that calls to thinking, rather than thinking that informs life. The act of philosophising can, therefore, give direction in its own right, as living precedes thinking and practice precedes theory.

The movement is sometimes referred to as [[philosophical counselling]] and it is also connected with and related to [[Existential Therapy]], which has thrived in the United Kingdom since the establishment of the Society for Existential Analysis (SEA) in London in 1988. This was based on the work of [[Emmy van Deurzen]], also a philosopher who has applied philosophical thinking to the practice of psychotherapy. Philosophical consultancy is often applied to business consultancy as well as to individuals, as it frequently involves a rethinking of values and beliefs and is also a method for rational [[conflict resolution]].

[[Philosophical practice]] has continued to expand and is attractive as an alternative to [[counselling]] and [[psychotherapy]] for those who prefer to avoid a [[medicalization]] of life-problems. Numerous philosophical consultants have emerged and there is a strong international interest and a bi-annual international conference. There are a number of important publications in the field (Lahav and Tillmans 1995, Curnow 2001, Herrestad et al. 2002, Marinoff 1999, Rochelle 2008, 2011).

'''Pierre Kaan''' (&lt;small&gt;French: [[Help:IPA for French|[pjεʀ kɑ̃]]]&lt;/small&gt; 10 January 1903 – 18 May 1945) was a professor of philosophy, Marxist essayist, and prominent member of the [[French Resistance]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/24/world/micheline-glover-76-a-bold-figure-in-the-french-resistance.html] William Honan, 'Micheline Glover, 76, A Bold Figure in the French Resistance', ''The New York Times'', 24/04/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activist, writer, teacher (1919–1939)==
[[File:Critique Sociale No.8 Front Cover, Apr 1933.jpg|150px|thumb|left|upright|Front cover of the Critique Sociale's 8th edition featuring articles by Pierre Kaan, George Bataille and Boris Souvarine.]]
Pierre Kaan was born on 10 January 1903 in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris]]. After a primary education often interrupted by health problems, Pierre Kaan entered in 1919 into [[khâgne]], the preparatory classes for the entrance exams of [[École Normale Supérieure]] at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. While at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand Kaan founded a literary review called ''la Gerbe du Quartier Latin'', alongside fellow students [[Daniel Guérin]], [[Georges Altman]], and Paul Verdier. Pierre Kaan's attendance in the preparatory classes were interrupted when his parents sent him to Brittany to recover from recurring asthma attacks. Nevertheless, Pierre Kaan was awarded a diploma in philosophy by ''l'Academie de Paris'' in 1923, with a dissertation titled 'The sociological basis of Nietzsche's thought during his intellectualist period 1876–1882'.

Following a growing notoriety in French academic and [[Marxism|Marxist]] circles in the early 1920s, Pierre Kaan was spotted by [[Boris Souvarine]] who placed him on the editing board of ''[[l'Humanité]]'' and shortly thereafter requested Kaan contribute as a writer and editor for the [[Democratic Communist Circle|Bulletin Communiste]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKUP5zrkLuMC&amp;pg=PA89] Stuart Kendall, ''Georges Bataille'' (London, 2007), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s Pierre Kaan contributed to a number of Jewish literary reviews. In 1925 Kaan began an editorial collaboration with [[Albert Cohen]] at the ''Revue Juive'', a literary magazine founded by Cohen to review Jewish literature. And between 1927–1928, Pierre Kaan joined another literary review called ''Palestine'', a Zionist literary review presided by [[Justin Godart]], as its secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Kaan family archives, Box IV (Judaïsme) correspondence between Albert Cohen and Pierre Kaan 1925–1926&lt;/ref&gt;

Having passed the agrégation in philosophy in 1928, Pierre Kaan was named associate professor of literature and philosophy at a secondary school in [[Montargis]]. However, Kaan resigned from his position in September 1929 in order to fulfill his military obligations, which he completes in November and is thereby named professor in another secondary school, this time in [[Nogent-le-Rotrou]].

At odds over the party's close relationship with the [[Soviet Union]], Pierre Kaan quit the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in 1929 and joined Souvarine's new group, the ''Cercle Communiste Démocratique'', whose members included [[Simone Weil]], [[Georges Bataille]], and [[Raymond Queneau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jolpress.com/article/lhumanite-quotidien-engage-23816.html] www.jolpress.com, ''l'Humanité quotidien engagé'', retrieved 17 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectif-smolny.org/article.php3?id_article=531] www.collectif-smolny.org, ''La Critique Sociale'' in SMOLNY: Collectif d'édition des introuvables du mouvement ouvrier, retrieved 17 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Pierre Kaan began his involvement with Boris Souvarine's ''La Critique Sociale'' joining Bataille, Weil, Queneau, [[Lucien Laurat]] and other writers, philosophers and economists to revue letters and ideas for what would become a widely read publication during the 1930s.

==''Résistant'' (1939–1944)==
Shortly after the speech made by Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] on 17 June, Pierre Kaan unsuccessfully attempted to join the resistance group France Libre. Kaan thereby tasked himself of uniting and regrouping all those who shared the will to continue fighting against the Nazis. Alongside former comrades and old friends ([[Jean Cavaillès]] and Leo Hamon in Toulouse), Kaan participated in the founding of the group [[Libération-Sud]]. In February 1942, Pierre Kaan enlisted in the Forces Françaises Combattantes, handing his engagement personally to [[Jean Moulin]] and Leo Morandat when they arrived to visit him at his home in Montluçon. Kaan undertook a number of resistance operations with Libération-Sud around the [[Montluçon]] area alongside members of the entourage of Montluçon's Mayor, Marx Dormoy. Pierre Kaan's resistance activities in Montluçon ranged from painting anti-Nazi inscriptions on walls, coordinating the distribution of political tracts, compiling reports destined for headquarters of the [[Free French Forces]] in London, and during 1942, Kaan reconnoitered the surrounding territory to find appropriate landing zones for parachute operations and clandestine landings. On 6 January 1942, Kaan plays an important part in 
organising a large demonstration against the departure of workers following a speech made by  [[Pierre Laval]] - the Nazi collaborating Prime Minister of the Vichy Régime.&lt;ref name='Serré'&gt;Boutot, F., George, F. 1987. 'Pierre Kaan ou la lucidité active' in ''La Liberté de l'Ésprit: Visages de la Résistance''. Lyon, France: La Manufacture, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of his operations in Montluçon, Pierre Kaan is named [[Jean Moulin]]'s deputy responsible for safeguarding transport and communication links between [[Lyon]] and the [[Zone occupée|occupied half of France]].&lt;ref name='Serré'/&gt;

==Arrest, deportation, imprisonment, liberation (1944–1945)==
Denounced by a close collaborator in the winter of 1943, Pierre Kaan was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] on 29 December on the steps of [[Gare de Port-Royal|Port-Royal]] métro station in [[Paris]], tortured and then deported to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. From Buchenwald, Pierre Kaan was deported to Gleina, liberated by Czech anti-fascist fighters, and died a few days later, exhausted and stricken by [[Typhus]] and [[Tuberculosis]] in [[Ceské Budejovice]] hospital on 18 May 1945.

Boris Souvarine on Pierre Kaan:

{{quote|I owe a special mention to Pierre Kaan, who had been my close collaborator at [[l'Humanité]] after the [[Tours Congress]] as well as in other publications I was responsible for. After the disaster of 1940, I discovered in him the first serious ''résistant'', effective and authentic. At that time I did not share his conviction... since I thought the french disaster irreversible. 
Having returned to France after six years spent living in America, I experienced the pain of learning that Pierre Kaan and [[Amédée Dunois]], deported to Germany, would never come back, victims of their devotion to a certain vision of France.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Souvarine, Preface of La Critique Sociale 1931–1934, reimpression by Editions de la Difference (Paris, 1983), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Honours and decorations==

In recognition of the operations Pierre Kaan led and undertook during the war, Kaan received three French and one British decoration. On 12 May 1948, the official journal of the French Government announced that Kaan had been posthumously decorated with Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]], [[Resistance Medal|Medal of the Resistance with Rosette]], [[Croix de guerre|War Cross]] with silver palm. In the same year, the British Government also decorated Kaan posthumously with the [[Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct|King's Military Commendation for Brave Conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/user.php Journal Officiel de la République Françaises, 12 May 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pinchas Lapide'''{{pronunciation needed}} (November 28, 1922 &amp;ndash; October 23, 1997) was a [[Jewish]] [[theologian]] and Israeli historian.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=01mCQQZ8YeEC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=Pius+XII++was+instrumental+in+saving+at+least+700,000,+but+probably+as+many+as+860,000#PPA182,M1&lt;/ref&gt; He was an [[Israel]]i diplomat from 1951 to 1969, among other position acting as Israeli [[consul (representative)|Consul]] to [[Milan]], and was instrumental in gaining recognition for the young state of [[Israel]]. He wrote more than 35 books during his lifetime. Pinchas Lapide was married to [[Ruth Lapide]] with whom he shared his interests and endeavors.

==Three Popes and the Jews==
In 1967 Pinchas Lapide published his book "Three Popes and the Jews" which set out to answer the charges raised in [[Rolf Hochhuth]]'s play [[The Deputy]] which contained criticisms of World War II [[Pope Pius XII]] and his response to the unfolding Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;"Three Popes and the Jews", Pinchas Lapide, Hawthorn, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Lapide credits Pope Pius XII for heading the effort to save hundreds of thousands of Jewish lives:
:...the Catholic Church, under the pontificate of Pius XII was instrumental in saving at least 700,000, but probably as many as 860,000, Jews from certain death at Nazi hands.... These figures, small as they are in comparison with our six million martyrs whose fate is beyond consolation, exceed by far those saved by all other churches, religious institutions and rescue organizations combined.&lt;ref&gt;"Three Popes and the Jews", Pinchas Lapide, Hawthorn, 1967, pps. 214-15&lt;/ref&gt;

After analyzing the available information he concludes:
:Were I a Catholic, perhaps I should have expected the Pope, as the avowed representative of Christ on earth, to speak out for justice and against murder - irrespective of the consequences. But as a Jew, I view the Church and the Papacy as human institutions, as frail and fallible as all the rest of us. Frail and fallible, Pius had choices thrust upon him time and time again, which would have made a lesser man falter. The 261st Pope was, after all, merely the First Catholic, heir to many prejudices of his predecessors and shortcomings of his 500 million fellow believers. The primary guilt for the slaughter of a third of my people is that of the Nazis who perpetrated the holocaust. But the secondary guilt lies in the universal failure of Christendom to try and avert or, at least, mitigate the disaster; to live up to its own ethical and moral principles, when conscience cried out: Save!, whilst expediency counselled aloofness. Accomplices are all those countless millions who knew my brothers were dying, but yet chose not to see, refused to help and kept their peace. Only against the background of such monumental egotism, within the context of millennial Christian anti-Judaism, can one begin to appraise the Pope's wartime record. When armed force ruled well-nigh omnipotent, and morality was at its lowest ebb, Pius XII commanded none of the former and could only appeal to the latter, in confronting, with bare hands, the full might of evil. A sounding protest, which might turn out to be self-thwarting - or quiet, piecemeal rescue? Loud words - or prudent deeds? The dilemma must have been sheer agony, for which ever course he chose, horrible consequences were inevitable. Unable to cure the sickness of an entire civilization, and unwilling to bear the brunt of Hitler's fury, the Pope, unlike many far mightier than he, alleviated, relieved, retrieved, appealed, petitioned - and saved as best he could by his own lights. Who, but a prophet or a martyr could have done much more?.&lt;ref&gt;"Three Popes and the Jews", Pinchas Lapide, p. 266-267, Hawthorn, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Lapide quoted approvingly [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] observation that  ''"He who begins by loving Christianity better than truth will proceed by loving his own sect or church better than Christianity, and end by loving himself better than all''."&lt;ref&gt;Three Popes and the Jews, Hawthorn, 1967, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jesus and Lapide==
In his dialogue with German reformed theologian [[Jürgen Moltmann]], Lapide says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On page 139 of his book ''The Church in the Power of the Spirit'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1977) it says: Through his crucifixion Christ has become the Saviour of the Gentiles. But in his parousia he will also manifest himself as Israel's Messiah.

I find this sentence an acceptable formula of reconciliation."&lt;ref&gt;Pinchas Lapide, Jewish Monotheism and Christian Trinitarian Doctrine, p. 79, 1979 WIPF and STOCK Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moltmann's compelling response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Christendom can gain salvation only together with Israel. The Christians will one day be asked, Where are your Jewish brothers and sisters? The church will one day be asked, Where have you left Israel? For the sake of the Jew Jesus there is no ultimate separation between church and Israel. For the sake of the gospel there is provisionally, before the eschatological future, also no fusion. But there is the communal way of the hoping ones."&lt;ref&gt;Pinchas Lapide, Jewish Monotheism and Christian Trinitarian Doctrine, p. 90, 1979 WIPF and STOCK Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their common declaration, Lapide and Moltmann acknowledge that the diverging paths of Christianity and Judaism may only be as consequential as the man-made barriers that hinder rapprochement. Both agree that Christianity and Judaism are pilgrim's paths to the same God.&lt;ref&gt;Pinchas Lapide, Jewish Monotheism and Christian Trinitarian Doctrine, pp. 91-93, 1979 WIPF and STOCK Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

In another debate on the messianic connotations of Isaiah 53 with [[Walter C. Kaiser Jr.]], Lapide posits that the people of Israel collectively are the expiatory lamb of mankind; God visits the sin of Israel with the full impact in order to let guilty mankind survive, a position that Kaiser thought could be interpreted as being close to the traditional evangelical Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53. The interpretation of Israel as a guilt offering is less clear in the mind of Kaiser, when comparing Isaiah 29:13 with Isaiah 53:9:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was assigned a grave with the wicked,&lt;br&gt;
    and with the rich in his death,&lt;br&gt;
though he had done no violence,&lt;br&gt;
    nor was any deceit in his mouth&lt;br&gt;
    (Isaiah 53:9 NIV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“These people come near to me with their mouth&lt;br&gt;
    and honor me with their lips,&lt;br&gt;
    but their hearts are far from me.&lt;br&gt;
    (Isaiah 29:13 NIV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In responding, Lapide sees the selfless sacrifice of the Jewish prophets as synonymous with Israel becoming acceptable through the imputed righteousness of God. Likewise, he understands Jesus' suffering in the context of Isaiah 53 as a microcosm of the suffering of Israel as a people.&lt;ref&gt;Do The Messianic Prophecies of the Old Testament Point to Jesus or to Someone Else? - Part 5 by Dr John Ankerberg, Dr. Walter Kaiser, Dr. Pinchas Lapide, link: http://www.jashow.org/Articles/editors-choice/EC0105W3A.htm accessed 09/04/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

To conclude, Lapide accepts Jesus as the Messiah of the Gentiles, a position he substantiates more clearly in his book ''[[The Resurrection of Jesus: A Jewish Perspective]]''. Furthermore, he suggests that the return of Jesus in the parousia will show him to be Israel's Messiah. Just as his interfaith agenda prescribed his presentation of Jesus, the same can be said of his unfamiliar and relatively non-threatening portrayal of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potlatches are also a common feature of the peoples of the Interior and of the Subarctic adjoining the Northwest Coast, though mostly without the elaborate ritual and gift-giving economy of the coastal peoples (see [[Athabaskan potlatch]]).

Potlatches went through a history of [[Potlatch ban|rigorous ban]] by the Canadian federal government, continuing underground despite the risk of criminal punishment, and have been studied by many [[anthropologists]].  Since the practice was de-criminalized in the post-war years, the potlatch has re-emerged in some communities.

The word comes from the [[Chinook Jargon]], meaning "to give away" or "a gift"; originally from the [[Nuu-chah-nulth language|Nuu-chah-nulth]] word ''paɬaˑč'', to make a ceremonial gift in a potlatch.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Speaker Figure, 19th century, 05.588.7418.jpg|thumbnail|Speaker Figure, 19th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]], the figure represents a speaker at a potlatch. An orator standing behind the figure would have spoken through its mouth, announcing the names of arriving guests.]]
:''[[Nota bene|N.B.]] This overview concerns the Kwakwaka'wakw potlatch. Potlatch traditions and formalities and kinship systems in other cultures of the region differ, often substantially.''
A potlatch was held on the occasion of births, deaths, adoptions, weddings, and other major events.  Typically the potlatch was practiced more in the winter seasons as historically the warmer months were for procuring wealth for the family, clan, or village, then coming home and sharing that with neighbors and friends. The event was hosted by a ''numaym'',  or '[[House society|House]]', in [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] culture. A ''numaym'' was a complex [[cognatic]] kin group usually headed by aristocrats, but including commoners and occasional slaves. It had about one hundred members and several would be grouped together into a tribe. The House drew its identity from its ancestral founder, usually a mythical animal who descended to earth and removed his animal mask, thus becoming human. The mask became a family heirloom passed from father to son along with the name of the ancestor himself. This made him the leader of the ''numaym'', considered the living incarnation of the founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only rich people could host a potlatch. Tribal slaves were not allowed to attend a potlatch as a host or a guest. In some instances, it was possible to have multiple hosts at one potlatch ceremony (although when this occurred the hosts generally tended to be from the same family). If a member of a tribe had suffered an injury or indignity, hosting a potlatch could help to heal their tarnished reputation (or “cover his shame”, as anthropologist H.  G. Barnett worded it.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnett|first=H. G.|date=1938 |title=The Nature of the Potlatch |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/doi/10.1525/aa.1938.40.3.02a00010/epdf |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=40|pages=349–358|via= |doi=10.1525/aa.1938.40.3.02a00010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The potlatch was the occasion on which titles associated with masks and other objects were "fastened on" to a new office holder. Two kinds of titles were transferred on these occasions. Firstly, each ''numaym'' had a number of named positions of ranked "seats" (which gave them a seat at potlatches) transferred within itself. These ranked titles granted rights to hunting, fishing and berrying territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there were a number of titles that would be passed between numayma, usually to in-laws, which included feast names that gave one a role in the Winter Ceremonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristocrats felt safe giving these titles to their out-marrying daughter's children because this daughter and her children would later be rejoined with her natal numaym and the titles returned with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any one individual might have several "seats" which allowed them to sit, in rank order, according to their title, as the host displayed and distributed wealth and made speeches. Besides the transfer of titles at a potlatch, the event was given "weight" by the distribution of other less important objects such as [[Chilkat weaving|Chilkat blankets]], animal skins (later Hudson Bay blankets) and ornamental "coppers". It is the distribution of large numbers of [[Hudson's Bay point blanket|Hudson Bay blankets]], and the destruction of valued coppers that first drew government attention (and censure) to the potlatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David |title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams |year=2001 |publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, preserved food was also given as a gift during a potlatch ceremony. Gifts known as ''sta-bigs'' consisted of preserved food that was wrapped in a mat or contained in a storage basket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Sally|date=April 1975|title=Quest for the Sacred in Northern Puget Sound: An Interpretation of Potlatch|url=https://www.jstor.org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/stable/3773086?sid=primo&amp;origin=crossref&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Ethnology|volume=14|pages=149–161|doi=10.2307/3773086}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Johansen describes the dynamic: "In the ''potlatch'', the host in effect challenged a guest chieftain to exceed him in his 'power' to give away or to destroy goods.  If the guest did not return 100 percent on the gifts received and destroy even more wealth in a bigger and better bonfire, he and his people lost face and so his 'power' was diminished."&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy O. Johansen, ''Empire of the Columbia: A History of the Pacific Northwest'', 2nd ed., (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchical relations within and between clans, villages, and nations, were observed and reinforced through the distribution or sometimes destruction of wealth, dance performances, and other ceremonies. The status of any given family is raised not by who has the most resources, but by who distributes the most resources. The hosts demonstrate their wealth and prominence through giving away goods.

Potlatch ceremonies were also used as coming-of-age rituals. When children were born, they would be given their first name at the time of their birth (which was usually associated with the location of their birthplace.) About a year later, the child's family would hold a potlatch and give gifts to the guests in attendance on behalf of the child. During this potlatch, the family would give the child their second name. Once the child reached about 12 years of age, they were expected to hold a potlatch of their own by giving out small gifts that they had collected to their family and tribe, at which point they would be able to receive their third name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indians of the North Pacific Coast|last=McFeat|first=Tom|publisher=McGill-Queen’s University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=72–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some cultures, such as [[Kwakwaka'wakw]], elaborate and theatrical dances are performed reflecting the hosts' genealogy and cultural wealth. Many of these dances are also sacred ceremonies of secret societies like the [[hamatsa]], or display of family origin from [[supernatural]] creatures such as the [[dzunukwa]].

Chief O'wax̱a̱laga̱lis of the [[Kwagu'ł]] describes the potlatch in his famous speech to anthropologist [[Franz Boas]],
{{quote|We will dance when our laws command us to dance, we will feast when our hearts desire to feast. Do we ask the white man, 'Do as the Indian does'? No, we do not. Why, then, will you ask us, 'Do as the white man does'? It is a strict law that bids us to dance. It is a strict law that bids us to distribute our property among our friends and neighbors. It is a good law. Let the white man observe his law; we shall observe ours. And now, if you are come to forbid us to dance, begone; if not, you will be welcome to us.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas, "The Indians of British Columbia," [https://books.google.com/books?id=pc4WAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA631 ''The Popular Science Monthly''], March 1888 (vol. 32), p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is important to note the differences and uniqueness among the different cultural groups and nations along the coast. Each nation, tribe, and sometimes clan has its own way of practicing the potlatch with diverse presentation and meaning. The Tlingit and Kwakiutl tribes of the Pacific Northwest, for example, held potlatch ceremonies for different occasions. The Tlingit potlatches occurred for succession (the granting of tribal titles or land) and funerals. The Kwakiutl potlatches, on the other hand, occurred for marriages and incorporating new people into the tribe (i.e. the birth of a new member of the tribe.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosman|first=Abraham|date=1972|title=The Potlatch: A Structural Analysis 1|url=|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=74|pages=658–671|via=|doi=10.1525/aa.1972.74.3.02a00280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potlatch, as an overarching term, is quite general, since some cultures have many words in their language for various specific types of gatherings. It is important to keep this variation in mind as most of our detailed knowledge of the potlatch was acquired from the Kwakwaka'wakw around Fort Rupert on Vancouver Island in the period 1849 to 1925, a period of great social transition in which many features became exaggerated in reaction to [[British colonialism]].&lt;ref name="Graeber 2001 188–208"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Klallam people at Port Townsend.jpg|thumb|right|Watercolor by [[James G. Swan]] depicting the [[Klallam]] people of chief [[Chetzemoka]] at [[Port Townsend]], with one of Chetzemoka's wives distributing potlatch]]
Before the arrival of the Europeans, gifts included storable food ([[oolichan]], or candlefish, oil or dried food), [[canoe]]s, [[Slavery among the indigenous people of the Americas|slaves]], and ornamental "coppers" among aristocrats, but not resource-generating assets such as hunting, fishing and berrying territories. Coppers were sheets of beaten copper, shield-like in appearance; they were about two feet long, wider on top, cruciform frame and schematic face on the top half. None of the copper used was ever of indigenous metal. A copper was considered the equivalent of a slave. They were only ever owned by individual aristocrats, and never by numaym, hence could circulate between groups. Coppers began to be produced in large numbers after the colonization of Vancouver Island in 1849 when war and slavery were ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aboriginal copper.jpg|thumb|right|Example of an ornamental copper used at a potlatch]]

The arrival of Europeans resulted in the introduction of numerous diseases against which indigenous peoples had no immunity, resulting in a massive population decline. Competition for the fixed number of potlatch titles grew as commoners began to seek titles from which they had previously been excluded by making their own remote or dubious claims validated by a potlatch. Aristocrats increased the size of their gifts in order to retain their titles and maintain social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;(1) Boyd (2) Cole &amp; Chaikin&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in massive inflation in gifting made possible by the introduction of mass-produced trade goods in the late 18th and earlier 19th centuries.

===Potlatch ban===
{{Main|Potlatch Ban}}
Potlatching was made illegal in Canada in 1884 in an amendment to the [[Indian Act]],&lt;ref&gt;An Act further to amend "The Indian Act, 1880,"  S.C. 1884 (47 Vict.), c. 27, s. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; largely at the urging of missionaries and government agents who considered it "a worse than useless custom" that was seen as wasteful, unproductive, and contrary to 'civilized values' of accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Sproat, quoted in Douglas Cole and Ira Chaikin, ''An Iron Hand upon the People: The Law against the Potlatch on the Northwest Coast'' (Vancouver and Toronto 1990), 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The potlatch was seen as a key target in assimilation policies and agendas. Missionary [[William Duncan (missionary)|William Duncan]] wrote in 1875 that the potlatch was "by far the most formidable of all obstacles in the way of Indians becoming Christians, or even civilized".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Fisher, ''Contact and Conflict: Indian-European Relations in British Columbia, 1774–1890'', Vancouver, University of British Columbia Press, 1977, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in 1884, the [[Indian Act]] was revised to include clauses [[The Potlatch Ban (Canada)|banning the Potlatch]] and making it illegal to practice. Section&amp;nbsp;3 of the Act read,
{{quote|Every Indian or other person who engages in or assists in celebrating the Indian festival known as the "Potlatch" or the Indian dance known as the "Tamanawas" is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not more than six nor less than two months in any gaol or other place of confinement; and, any Indian or other person who encourages, either directly or indirectly, an Indian or Indians to get up such a festival or dance, or to celebrate the same, or who shall assist in the celebration of same is guilty of a like offence, and shall be liable to the same punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act further to amend "The Indian Act, 1880,"'' S.C. 1884 (47 Vict.), c. 27, s. 3. Reproduced in n.41, {{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|chapter=Recovering from Colonization: Perspectives of Community Members on Protection and Repatriation of Kwakwaka'wakw Cultural Heritage|title=First Nations Cultural Heritage and Law: Case Studies, Voices, and Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|location=Vancouver|isbn=0-7748-1462-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avKUsA40Q0QC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89|editor=Bell, Catherine |editor2=Val Napoleon|accessdate=6 February 2011|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1888, the anthropologist [[Franz Boas]] described the potlatch ban as a failure:
{{quote|The second reason for the discontent among the Indians is a law that was passed, some time ago, forbidding the celebrations of festivals. The so-called ''potlatch'' of all these tribes hinders the single families from accumulating wealth. It is the great desire of every chief and even of every man to collect a large amount of property, and then to give a great ''potlatch'', a feast in which all is distributed among his friends, and, if possible, among the neighboring tribes. These feasts are so closely connected with the religious ideas of the natives, and regulate their mode of life to such an extent, that the Christian tribes near Victoria have not given them up. Every present received at a ''potlatch'' has to be returned at another ''potlatch'', and a man who would not give his feast in due time would be considered as not paying his debts. Therefore the law is not a good one, and can not be enforced without causing general discontent. Besides, the Government is unable to enforce it. The settlements are so numerous, and the Indian agencies so large, that there is nobody to prevent the Indians doing whatsoever they like.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Boas]], "The Indians of British Columbia," [https://books.google.com/books?id=pc4WAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA636 ''The Popular Science Monthly''], March 1888 (vol. 32), p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eventually the potlatch law, as it became known, was amended to be more inclusive and address technicalities that had led to dismissals of prosecutions by the court. Legislation included guests who participated in the ceremony. The indigenous people were too large to police and the law too difficult to enforce. [[Duncan Campbell Scott]] convinced Parliament to change the offence from criminal to summary, which meant "the agents, as justice of the peace, could try a case, convict, and sentence".&lt;ref&gt;Aldona Jonaitis, ''Chiefly Feasts: the Enduring Kwakiutl Potlatch'', Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1991, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, except in a few small areas, the law was generally perceived as harsh and untenable. Even the Indian agents employed to enforce the legislation considered it unnecessary to prosecute, convinced instead that the potlatch would diminish as younger, educated, and more "advanced" Indians took over from the older Indians, who clung tenaciously to the custom.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Cole and Ira Chaikin, ''An Iron Hand upon the People: The Law against the Potlatch on the Northwest Coast'' (Vancouver and Toronto 1990), Conclusion&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistence===
The potlatch ban was repealed in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gadacz |first=René R. |title=Potlatch |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=27 November 2013 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/potlatch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustaining the customs and culture of their ancestors, indigenous people now openly hold potlatches to commit to the restoring of their ancestors' ways. Potlatches now occur frequently and increasingly more over the years as families reclaim their birthright. Anthropologist Sergei Kan was invited by the Tlingit tribe to attend several potlatch ceremonies between 1980 and 1987 and observed several similarities and differences between traditional and contemporary potlatch ceremonies. Kan notes that there was a language gap during the ceremonies between the older members of the tribe and the younger members of the tribe (age fifty and younger) due to the fact that most of the younger members of the tribe do not speak the Tlingit language. Kan also notes that unlike traditional potlatches, contemporary Tlingit potlatches are no longer obligatory, resulting in only about 30% of the adult tribal members opting to participate in the ceremonies that Kan attended between 1980 and 1987. Despite these differences, Kan stated that he believed that many of the essential elements and spirit of the traditional potlatch were still present in the contemporary Tlingit ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kan|first=Sergei|date=1989|title=Cohorts, Generations, and their Culture: The Tlingit Potlatch in the 1980’s|url=|journal=Anthropos: International Review of Anthropology and Linguistics|volume=84|pages=405–422|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropological theory==
In his book ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'', the French ethnologist, [[Marcel Mauss]] used the term potlatch to refer to a whole set of exchange practices in tribal societies characterized by "total prestations", i.e., a system of gift giving with political, religious, kinship and economic implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1996|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=147–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These societies' economies are marked by the competitive exchange of gifts, in which gift-givers seek to out-give their competitors so as to capture important political, kinship and religious roles. Other examples of this "potlatch type" of [[gift economy]] include the [[Kula ring]] found in the [[Trobriand Islands]].&lt;ref name="Graeber 2001 188–208"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=188–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">'''Pratyahara''' ([[Devanagari|Devanāgarī]] प्रत्याहार, Tibetan སོ་སོར་སྡུད་པ་, Wylie ''so sor sdud pa'') or the 'withdrawal of the senses' is the fifth element among the Eight stages of [[Patanjali]]'s [[Rāja yoga|Ashtanga Yoga]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/474079/pratyahara Pratyahara] ''[[Britannica.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as mentioned in his classical work, ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' composed in  the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-25455.htm ''Yoga Sutras'' 2.54-2.55: - Pratyahara or Sense Withdrawal] ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'', 2.54-2.55.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first stage of the six-branch yoga (''ṣaḍaṅgayoga'') of the Buddhist [[Kālacakra]] tantra, where it refers to the withdrawal of the five senses from external objects to be replaced by the mentally created senses of an enlightened deity. This phase is roughly analogous to the physical isolation (''kāyaviveka'', Tib. ''lus bden'') phase of [[Guhyasamāja tantra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Pratyahara: Withdrawing the senses and feeling feelings|url=http://spiritualityhealth.com/blog/jc-peters/pratyahara-withdrawing-senses-and-feeling-feelings|journal=Spirituality &amp; Health|date = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Patanjali, it is a bridge between the ''bahiranga'' (external) aspects of yoga namely, [[yamas|yama]], [[niyama]], [[asana]], [[pranayama]], and the ''antaranga'' (internal) yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Pratyahara|url=http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=893|journal=sivanandaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having actualized the ''pratyahara'' stage, a practitioner is able to effectively engage into the practice of [[Samyama]]. At the stage of ''pratyahara'', the consciousness of the individual is internalized in order that the sensations from the [[senses]] of taste, touch, sight, hearing and smell don't reach their respective centers in the brain and takes the ''[[sadhaka]]'' (practitioner) to next stages of [[Yoga]], namely [[Dharana]] (concentration) and [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]] (meditation), and [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|Samadhi]] (mystical absorption), being the aim of all [[Yogic]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayaninstitute.org/Yogaplus/Article.aspx?id=934 Moving Inward: The Journey from Asana to Pratyahara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719232925/http://www.himalayaninstitute.org/Yogaplus/Article.aspx?id=934 |date=2011-07-19 }} ''[[Himalayan Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Pratyahara is derived from two [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words: ''prati'' and ''ahara'', with ahara meaning food, or anything taken into ourselves, and prati, a preposition meaning away or against.  Together they mean "weaning away from ahara", or simply ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiatravelogue.com/sacr/refl/pratyahara.html Pratyahara:The Forgotten Limb of Yoga] ''[[David Frawley]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What is Pratyahara?|url=http://breathelosgatos.com/blog/?p=1204|journal=breathelosgatos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prati in Sanskrit can also mean "copy". So in effect Pratyahara means that your 5 external senses can be copied and replaced by 5 internal representations/copies of those same senses. 

==Types of Pratyahara==
[[File:Anandabodhi2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Monks meditating under the Anandabodhi tree in ''Jetavana Monastery'', [[Sravasti]]]]

===Withdrawal of Senses or Indriya Pratyahara===
This involves withdrawal of senses, or sensory inputs into our physical being, coming from our five senses, namely organs creating a sensory overload, and hence hinders collection of the mind, as in [[Dharana]], the next stage of Yoga &lt;ref name=dav&gt;Yoga and Ayurveda, by [[David Frawley]], Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, 2004. {{ISBN|81-208-1879-2}}. Chapter 16: Pratyahara: the Forgotten Limb of Yoga, page 261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Pratyahara: the forgotten Limb of Yoga|url=http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/H%20-%20World%20Religions%20and%20Poetry/World%20Religions/From%20the%20Indian%20Tradition/Teachers%20from%20the%20Indian%20Tradition/David%20Frawley/Pratyahara%20-%20the%20Forgotten%20Limb/Pratyahara%20the%20Forgotten%20Limb%20of%20Yoga.htm|journal=A Buddhist Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal of Prana or Prana Pratyahara===
Control of our senses requires mastery over the flow of prana, as that is what drives the senses. To stop the scattering of valuable vital energy of the body or [[prana]], we need to seek control over its flow, and harmonize it. This is done through various practices including bringing the entire focus to a single point in the body.&lt;ref name=dav/&gt;

These two lead to the subsequent two types of pratyahara, the Control of Action or '[[Karma]] pratyahara', which entails not just control of motor organs, but also right action or work, and [[Karma Yoga]], surrender of every action to the divine and performing it as an act of service. This leads to the final form of pratyahara - the Withdrawal of Mind or 'Mano pratyahara', which is practiced by consciously withdrawing attention from anything that is unwholesome, and distracting for the mind such as by withdrawing attention from the senses, and directing it inwards  &lt;ref&gt;[[Yoga Sutra]]s Book II.54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices in Pratyahara==
One of the most common practices for Pratyahara is Pranayama, wherein we automatically withdraw from the external and bring our focus inwards towards our breath, as connection with the external senses and stimuli are all severed gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yoga.iloveindia.com/limbs-of-yoga/pratyahara.html |title=Pratyahara |publisher=Yoga.iloveindia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Pranayama, another method that is used to aid in the development of Pratyahara is to concentrate on the point between the eyebrows. This location is known as [[Ajna]] [[Chakra]] or the third eye.

Another common technique for inducing Pratyahara is to first reduce physical stimuli, then concentrate on one sense, such as hearing. The mind has a natural tendency to roam between the sensory inputs. In this situation, as there are no longer any other significant sensory inputs, when the mind gets tired of hearing, it is forced to turn inward.

At the advanced levels, the currents which pulsate through the nerves and even the involuntary muscles are turned off by the practitioner.  This may also be accomplished through Pranayama or breath-control.

'''Rastko Močnik''' (born 27 August 1944) is a [[Slovenia]]n [[sociologist]], [[psychoanalyst]], [[literary theorist]], [[translator]] and [[political activist]]. Together with [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Mladen Dolar]], he is considered one of the co-founders of the [[Ljubljana school of psychoanalysis]].

He was born as Josip Rastko Močnik in a middle-class family in [[Ljubljana]]. He studied sociology and history of literature at the [[University of Ljubljana]], graduating in 1968 under the supervision of [[Dušan Pirjevec]]. During his student years, he was active in several avant-garde literary movements. In 1964, he became the last co-editor (together with the poet [[Tomaž Šalamun]]) of the alternative journal ''[[Perspektive]]'', before it was closed down by the Communist regime. Between 1968 and 1970 he worked as a journalist at the journal ''[[Delo]]''. He later studied at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] in [[Paris]], where he obtained a PhD in philosophy under the supervision of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]].

After returning to Ljubljana, he became the editor of the alternative journal ''[[Problemi]]''. During this period, he started a close collaboration with Marxist philosophers [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Mladen Dolar]]. Since 1984, Močnik is professor of sociology at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana. 

Močnik was among the first Slovene theorists who introduced [[structuralism]] and the theories of [[Marxist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] in Slovenian academia. He has written on several subjects including theory of [[ideology]], theoretical [[psychoanalysis]], [[semiotics]], linguistics and [[epistemology]] of [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. He has also translated works of [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]] into [[Slovene language|Slovene]].

Močnik has also been active in several civil and political movements in Slovenia. In the early 1980s, he was one of the most outspoken opponents of a high school education reform, carried out by the [[Communist Party of Slovenia|Communist Party]], in which the classical grammar schools (the so-called [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) were abolished as a supposed remainder of old bourgeois elitism. In 1982, he also wrote a petition against such reform, together with editor [[Braco Rotar]], social theorist [[Neda Pagon]] and jurist [[Matevž Krivic]]. The petition was signed by over 600 intellectuals, and was one of the first wide and openly critical [[civil society]] initiatives in [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Socialist Slovenia]]. Between 1988 and 1990, he served on the board of the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]], the main civil society organization in Slovenia during the process of democratization. In the early 1990s, he opposed the dissolution of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], was critical of the [[DEMOS coalition]] and Slovenian independence. 

In 1990, Močnik was elected president of a small extra-parliamentary party, called Social Democratic Union (''Socialdemokratska unija'', SDU), which was linked to [[Ante Marković]]'s [[Union of Reform Forces]]. The party failed to win any significant popular support, and remained outside of the Slovenian Parliament. After its dissolution in the early 1990s, Močnik left party politics, but continued to participate in the public debate. He was one of the few Slovenian public intellectuals who opposed the unilateral declaration of Slovenian independence. In the late 1990s, he opposed the Slovenian entry in [[NATO]]. He has also been highly critical of the [[Bologna process]].

Močnik also writes weekly columns in the Slovene leftist journal ''[[Mladina]]'' and is a member of the Advisory Board of the regional left-wing magazine ''[[Novi Plamen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noviplamen.org/index.php?page=onovomplamenu O Novom Plamenu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231055406/http://www.noviplamen.org/index.php?page=onovomplamenu |date=2008-12-31 }} (Retrieved on 2008-10-02).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Močnik's amibiguous positions in the years 1989-1991, when he was critical of Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia, was criticized by many at the time, and has remained one of the frequent political reproaches against him, including from the conservative Prime Minister [[Janez Janša]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.sds.si/news/21207{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, his article "Slovene historians on the Destruction of Yugoslav Federation" published in a special issue of the review  ''[[Borec]]'' under the name ''Oddogodenje zgodovine – primer Jugoslavije''' ("The Uneventment of History - The Case of Yugoslavia") together with contributions by the "new generation" of Slovenian historians and young foreign researchers such as  [[Ozren Pupovac]], [[Alberto Toscano]] and  [[Geoffroy Geraud-Legros]], became highly polemical as he criticized some trends on [[historical revisionism]] in contemporary [[List of Slovenian historians|Slovenian historiography]]. In the article, Močnik accused three of the most prominent contemporary Slovene historians, [[Peter Vodopivec]], [[Jože Pirjevec]] and [[Božo Repe]], all of whom are considered to be close to [[left wing]] or [[left liberal]] positions, of [[nationalism|nationalist]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;http://uneventment.blogspot.com/2007/08/rastko-monik-slovene-historians-on.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Recorde''' (c.1512–1558) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] physician and mathematician. He invented the [[equals sign]] (=) and also introduced the pre-existing [[plus and minus signs|plus sign]] (+) to English speakers in 1557.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Johnston|title=Recorde, Robert (c. 1512–1558)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23241|accessdate=26 January 2012|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/23241}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born around 1512, Robert Recorde was the second son of Thomas and Rose Recorde of [[Tenby]], [[Pembrokeshire]], in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Recorde entered the [[University of Oxford]] about 1525, and was elected a Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] there in 1531. Having adopted medicine as a profession, he went to the [[University of Cambridge]] to take the degree of M.D. in 1545. He afterwards returned to Oxford, where he publicly taught mathematics, as he had done prior to going to Cambridge. It appears that he afterwards went to London, and acted as physician to King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and to [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], to whom some of his books are dedicated. He was also controller of the [[Royal Mint]] and served as "Comptroller of Mines and Monies" in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James R.|year=1956|title=The World of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being sued for defamation by a political enemy, he was arrested for debt and died in the [[King's Bench Prison]], [[Southwark]], by the middle of June 1558.

Recorde published several works upon mathematical and medical subjects, chiefly in the form of dialogue between master and scholar, such as the following:
*''[[The Ground of Arts|The Grounde of Artes]], teachings the Worke and Practise, of Arithmeticke, both in whole numbers and fractions'' (1543),&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; the first English book on [[algebra]].

*''The Castle of Knowledge, containing the Explication of the Sphere both Celestiall and Materiall, etc.'' (London, 1556) A book explaining [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic astronomy]] while mentioning the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican heliocentric model]] in passing.
*''[[The Whetstone of Witte]], whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmeteke: containing the extraction of rootes; the cossike practise, with the rule of equation; and the workes of Surde Nombers'' (London, 1557). This was the book in which the [[equals sign]] was introduced. With the publication of this book Recorde is credited with introducing [[algebra]] into England with a systematic notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jourdain|first=Philip E. B.|year=1913|title=The Nature of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Recorde, ''The Whetstone of Witte'' (London, England: John Kyngstone, 1557), [https://archive.org/stream/TheWhetstoneOfWitte#page/n237/mode/2up p. 236] (although the pages of this book are not numbered). From the chapter titled "The rule of equation, commonly called Algebers Rule" (p. 236): "Howbeit, for easie alteration of ''equations''. I will propounde a fewe examples, bicause the extraction of their rootes, maie the more aptly bee wroughte. And to avoide the tediouse repetition of these woordes: is equalle to: I will sette as I doe often in worke use, a paire of paralleles, or Gemowe [twin, from ''gemew'', from the French ''gemeau'' (twin / twins), from the Latin ''gemellus'' (little twin)] lines of one lengthe, thus: = , bicause noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle." (However, for easy manipulation of ''equations'', I will present a few examples in order that the extraction of roots may be more readily done. And to avoid the tedious repetition of these words "is equal to", I will substitute, as I often do when working, a pair of parallels or twin lines of the same length, thus: = , because no two things can be more equal.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Scotism}}
{{Catholic philosophy}}
[[File:De Fantis - Opus Oxoniense - 4324737.tif|thumb|[[Antonio De Fantis]], ''Opus Oxoniense'']]

'''Scotism''' is the name given to the [[philosophical]] and [[theological]] system or school named after Blessed [[John Duns Scotus]]. The word comes from the name of its originator, whose Opus Oxoniense was one of the most important documents in [[medieval philosophy]] and [[Roman Catholic theology]], defining what would later be declared the [[Dogma]] of the [[Immaculate conception]] by  [[Pope Pius IX]] in his constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' on 8 December 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Ordinatio III, d.3, q.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/marye1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Scotism developed out of the [[List of Franciscan theologians|Old Franciscan School]], which dominated theology during the [[Middle Ages]]. This school of thought initially followed [[Augustinism]] which dominated theology at the time.

Scotus found the ground already cleared for the conflict with the followers of Aquinas. He made very free use of [[Aristotelianism]], but in its employment exercised sharp criticism, and in important points adhered to the teaching of the Older Franciscan School – especially with regard to the plurality of forms or of souls, the spiritual matter of the angels and of souls, etc., wherein he energetically combatted Aquinas. '''Scotism''', or what is known as the [[Franciscanism|Later Franciscan School]], is thus only a continuation or further development of the older school, with a much wider, although not exclusive acceptance of [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] ideas. The difference between Thomism and Scotism could be expressed by saying that, while both derive from [[Islamic philosophy|Arabic]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonized]] Aristotelianism, Thomism is closer to the orthodox Aristotelianism of [[Maimonides]], [[Averroes]] and [[Avicenna]], while Scotism reflects the Platonizing tendency going back through [[Solomon ibn Gabirol|Avicebron]], the [[Brethren of Purity]], the [[Liber de Causis]] and [[Proclus]] to [[Plotinus]].

Concerning the relation of these schools to each other, or the relation of Scotus to [[Alexander of Hales]] and [[St. Bonaventure]], consult the work of the Flemish Recollect, [[Mathias Hauzeur]].  It is notable that, while Thomism became the official philosophy of the Church, Scotist influence prevailed on a number of important points, not least the doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]].

== Scotism and doctrinal conflicts within the Catholic Church ==
[[Nominalism]] is older than Scotus, but its revival in [[Occamism]] may be traced to the one-sided exaggeration of some propositions of Scotus. Scotist Formalism is the direct opposite of Nominalism, and the Scotists were at one with the [[Thomism|Thomists]] in combatting the latter; Occam himself  was a bitter opponent of Scotus. The [[Council of Trent]] defined as dogma a series of doctrines especially emphasized by the Scotists (e.g. freedom of the will, free co-operation with grace, etc..). In other points the canons were intentionally so framed that they do not affect Scotism (e.g. that the first man was constitutus in holiness and justice). This was also done at the Vatican Council. In the [[Thomistic–Molinistic controversy]] concerning the foreknowledge of God, predestination, the relation of grace to [[free will]], the Scotists took little part. They either supported one of the parties, or took up a middle position, rejecting both the predetermination of the Thomists and the scientia media of the Molinists. God recognizes the free future acts in His essence, and provides a free decree of His will, which does not predetermine our free will, but only accompanies it.

== Scotism and the Jesuit tradition ==
[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] philosophers and theologians adopted a series of the Scotist propositions. Later authorities reject in part many of these propositions and another series of propositions was misunderstood even by Catholic theologians, and then in this false sense rightly rejected – e.g. the doctrine of the ''[[univocatio entis]]'', of the acceptation of the merits of Christ and man, etc.

Numerous other propositions have been accepted or at least favourably treated by a large number of Catholic scholars and amongst these are many propositions from psychology: e.g. that the powers of the soul are not merely accidents even natural and necessary of the soul, that they are not really distinct from the substance of the soul or from one another etc.

They also took from Scotism many propositions concerning the doctrine of the [[angel]]s.

== The influence of Scotism on philosophy and theology ==

Scotism exercised an influence on the development of philosophy and theology; its importance is not, as is often asserted, purely negative – i.e. it does not consist only in the fact that it exercised a criticism on [[Thomas Aquinas]] and the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] school.

A comparison of the Scotist teaching with that of Aquinas has been often attempted – for example, in the abovementioned work of [[Hauzeur]] at the end of the first volume; by Sarnano ([[Costanzo Torri]], ''Conciliatio omnium controversiarum etc.'' (1589– ). In many cases, the differences are mostly in the terminology and a reconciliation is possible if one emphasize certain parts of Scotus or Aquinas and passes over or tones down others. However, some contradictions remain on a number of points.

Generally speaking, Scotism found its supporters within the Franciscan Order; certainly, opposition to the Dominicans, i.e. to Aquinas, made many members of the order disciples of Scotus. However, this does not mean that the foundation and development of Scotism is to be regarded as a product of the rivalry between the two orders. Even Aquinas at first found a few opponents in his order – not all his fellow-Dominicans followed him in every particular (e.g. [[Durandus of St. Pourçain]]).

The Scotist doctrines were also supported by many [[Minorites]]. Furthermore, Scotism found not a few supporters among secular professors and in other religious orders (e.g. the [[Augustinians]], [[Servites]], etc.), especially in England, Ireland, and Spain. Of the Minorites who supported Scotist doctrine, the [[Conventuals]] seem to have adhered most faithfully to Scotus, particularly at the University of Padua, where many highly esteemed teachers lectured.

== Emergence of the Scotist School ==
It is only at the end of the 15th or the beginning of the sixteenth century that a special Scotist School can be spoken of. The works of the master were then collected, brought out in many editions and commentated, etc. And from 1501 we also find numerous regulations of general chapters recommending or directly prescribing Scotism as the teaching of the order.

Scotism appears to have attained its greatest popularity at the beginning of the seventeenth century; during the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries we even find special Scotist chairs, e.g. at Paris, Rome, Coimbra, Salamanca, Alcalá, Padua, and Pavia. In the eighteenth century it had still an important following, but in the 19th it suffered a great decline. One of the reasons for this was the repeated suppressions of the order in almost every country, while the recommendation of the teaching of St. Thomas by several popes could not be favourable to Scotism.

It has even been asserted that it was merely tolerated by the Catholic Church; but this statement is a priori improbable in regard to a school of which not a single proposition has been censured, and to which so many highly venerated men (bishops, cardinals, popes, and saints) have belonged; and it is still less probable in view of the approval of the various general statutes (repeated so often down to the present day), in which Scotism is at least recommended. In their Decrees [[Leo XIII]] and [[Pius X]] have recommended not alone St. Thomas, but also Scholasticism in general, and this includes also the Scotist School.

==Scotists==
Most Scotists are both philosophers and theologians. Notable Scotists of the fourteenth century included [[Antonius Andrea]] and [[Francis of Mayrone]](c. 1280-1328) author of a ''Tractatus de transcendentibus''.[[Francis Mayron]], who introduced the ''actus sorbonicus'' into the [[University of Paris]].

===15th and 16th centuries===
Scotists of the fifteenth century included two popes, [[Pietro di Candia|Alexander V]] and [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], Elector Frederick III of [[Saxony]] and  [[Angelus of Chivasso]]. The latter's work on Scotist theology was so notorious that it was [[book burning|publicly burned]] by [[Martin Luther]].

Notable Scotists of the sixteenth century included [[Paul Scriptoris]], noted professor at the [[University of Tübingen]], and the [[Archbishop of Athens]] Antonio Trombetta.

===17th and 18th centuries===

Of very many names we may mention:

*[[Angelo Vulpes]] (Volpe) (d. 1647) wrote ''Summa'' and ''Commen. theologiae Scoti'' in twelve folio volumes.
*[[Luke Wadding]] (d. 1657), a well-known annalist, edited with other Irishmen in the College of S. Isidore at Rome the complete works of Scotus (12 vols., Lyons, 1639).
*[[Lambertus Lambrecht]] (about 1696), named the Viennese Scotus.
*Cardinal [[Lorenzo Brancati di Lauria]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1681.htm#Brancati The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church – Biographical Dictionary – Consistory of September 1, 1681&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (d. 1693), held in high favour by several popes.
*[[Francisco Macedo]] (d. 1681), a Portuguese, professor at Padua is said to have composed over one hundred writings and was renowned for his public disputations.
*[[Claude Frassen]] (d. 1711) was for thirty years a celebrated professor at the Sorbonne and wrote "Scotus academicus seu universa theo Scoti".
*[[Bartholomaeus Durandus]] (Bartélemy Durand)&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.bart.nl/~roestb/franciscan/franautb.htm#BartholomaeusDurandus Bartholomaeus Durandus], Online bibliography of Franciscan Authors.&lt;/ref&gt; (d. 1720) wrote the great ''Clypeus Scotisticae Theologiae''.

===19th century===

In the nineteenth century, although Scotism was retained in the schools of the Franciscan Order in accordance with the statutes, there were few works in the Scotist tradition, in any case no celebrated ones.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Though the use of the term Scotism has become a bit antiquated, several contemporary theologians, especially from among the Franciscan Orders, like Kenan Osborne OFM and [[Daniel Horan]] OFM, can be seen as in the Scotist tradition. Several recent projects such as the Scotus Project of CUA, the International Scotistic Commission in Rome and the Commission of the Franciscan Intellectual Tradition of the English Speaking Conference of the OFM have sought to increase awareness of Duns Scotus and Scotism on contemporary theology. Scotism has also found a home amongst [[Anglo-Catholics]], including Richard Cross and Thomas Williams, as well as influencing [[Protestants]] like [[William Lane Craig]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig, W. L. (1987). John Duns Scotus on Gods Foreknowledge and Future Contingents. Franciscan Studies, 47(1), 98-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social analytics''' is a philosophical perspective developed since the early 1980s by the [[Danish people|Danish]] idea historian and philosopher [[Lars-Henrik Schmidt]]. The theoretical object of the perspective is ''socius'', a kind of "commonness" that is neither a universal account nor a communality shared by every member of a body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Lars-Henrik |last1=Schmidt |year=1996 |chapter=Commonness across Cultures |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=cmyYVIlKkUkC&amp;pg=PA119 |pages=119–32 |editor1-first=Anindita Niyogi |editor1-last=Balslev |title=Cross-cultural Conversation: Initiation |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-7885-0308-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Social Analytics differs from traditional philosophy as well as sociology. It might be said that the perspective attempts to articulate the contentions between philosophy and sociology. The practise of Social Analytics is to report on tendencies of the times. It does not aim to make a diagnosis of the times that can be agreed upon by everyone or anybody but a report that no one wants to protest about.

'''Steven Shaviro''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|v|ɪr|oʊ}}; born April 3, 1954) is an American academic, [[philosopher]] and [[cultural critic]] whose areas of interest include [[film theory]], [[time]], [[science fiction]], [[panpsychism]], [[capitalism]], [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[subjectivity]]. He earned a PhD from Yale in 1981. 

==Work==
His most widely read book is ''Doom Patrols'', a "theoretical fiction" that outlines the state of [[postmodernism]] during the early 1990s, using poetic language, personal anecdotes, and creative prose. He has also written extensively about [[music videos]] as an artform.

Additionally, Shaviro has written a book about film theory, ''The Cinematic Body'', which examines the dominance of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in contemporary academic film theory. According to Shaviro, the use of [[psychoanalysis]] has mirrored the actions of a [[cult]], with its own religious texts (essays by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and Lacan).

Shaviro's book ''Connected, Or, What It Means to Live in the Network Society'', appeared in 2003. A later book, ''Without Criteria: Kant, Whitehead, Deleuze, and Aesthetics'' was published in May 2009.

'''''The Ethics of Liberty''''' is a 1982 book by American [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[economics|economist]] [[Murray N. Rothbard]]; in it, Rothbard expounds a libertarian political position.

==Summary==
Rothbard provides an exposition of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] political position. He argues for the case of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] as a concept of [[natural rights]] and applies it to a variety of practical problems.

==Reception==

Reception of the book has been positive in libertarian circles. Many praise the book for its incisive analysis of [[natural law]] and its practical applications. Libertarian commentator Sheldon Richman says : "''The Ethics of Liberty'' is a great book that deserves the attention of anyone interested in the good society and human flourishing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/tgif-rothbards-the-ethics-of-liberty-still-worthy-after-all-these-years/|title=TGIF: Rothbard’s The Ethics of Liberty: Still Worthy after All These Years - The Future of Freedom Foundation|website=fff.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], who wrote the introduction to later editions of the book, described ''The Ethics of Liberty'' as Murray Rothbard's second [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], the other being ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mises.org/rothbard/ethics/hoppeintro.asp|title=The Ethics of Liberty {{!}} Murray N. Rothbard|last=kanopiadmin|date=2014-08-18|work=Mises Institute|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of San Diego]] [[philosophy]] [[professor]] Matt Zwolinski criticized the book, writing that Rothbard's [[Conversation|discussion]] of [[self-ownership]] in chapter six "rests on a fundamental confusion between descriptive and normative claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zwolinski|first=Matt|url=http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/10/reading-the-ethics-of-liberty-part-4-rothbards-second-argument-for-self-ownership/|title=rothbards-second-argument-for-self-ownership|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cathedral school at Chartres]] promoted scholarship before the first university was founded in France. Thierry was a major figure in twelfth-century philosophy and learning, and, like many twelfth-century scholars, is notable for his embrace of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and his application of philosophy to theological issues.&lt;ref&gt;Some nineteenth and twentieth-century scholars believed that Thierry was in the forefront of a hyper-Platonic school at Chartres (this is the position reflected in Turner's 1903 ''History of Philosophy'', but due to the efforts of [[Richard Southern]] and others, this view is no longer held by modern scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars believed Thierry to have been a brother of [[Bernard of Chartres]] who had founded the school of Chartres, but later research has shown that this is unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edward Dutton (ed.), ''The Glosae super Platonem of Bernard of Chartres'', Toronto 1991, p. 40-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thierry became chancellor of Chartres after his predecessor, [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], returned to his native city in 1141. [[John of Salisbury]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Theodoric (Thierry) of Chartes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman of Carinthia]], and [[Clarembald of Arras]] were among Thierry's students.&lt;ref name="D'Onofrio"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2o5V2GWlaFIC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=theodoric+of+chartres#v=onepage&amp;q=theodoric%20of%20chartres&amp;f=false|title=The History of Theology: Middle Ages|accessdate=October 30, 2009|publisher=Liturgical Press|year=1996|author=Giulio D'Onofrio|display-authors=etal|isbn=9780814659168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===''Hexaemeron''===

The ''Hexaemeron'' interprets the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] with reference to [[Plato]]'s "[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]". The text serves as a reasoned defense of God's existence, by relying on Platonic natural philosophy and Aristotelian logic to explain the creation of the world.&lt;ref name="D'Onofrio"/&gt; Thierry establishes that the moment of divine creation was the very beginning of time, and following that, creation evolved naturally through combinations of the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth).&lt;ref name="Lindberg"&gt;Lindberg, David C: "The Beginnings of Western Science", page 210. The University of Chicago Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thierry, God created the four elements in the first moment. Fire, which is constantly moving, rotated and lit up the air, causing the first night and day. On the second day, fire warmed the water, causing it to rise into the heavens and form clouds. Because of the reduction of water, land emerged on the third day. The continued heating of the waters above the firmament caused the water to create the heavenly bodies on the fourth day. The continued warming of land caused the plant, animal, and human life to arise on the fifth and sixth days.

Thierry's explanation of the creation of the world is based on a theological interpretation of [[Aristotle]]'s [[four causes]], which he identifies with the three persons of the [[Trinity]] plus matter (made up of the [[Classical element|four elements]]): the Father is the [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient cause]], the Son is the [[Four causes#Formal cause|formal cause]], the Holy Spirit is the [[Four causes#Final cause|final cause]] and the four elements are the [[Four causes#Material cause|material cause]].

According to Thierry, the act of divine creation is limited to the creation of the four elements, which then evolve by themselves, mix according to mathematical proportions and make up the physical world.

===''Heptateuch''===

The ''Heptateuch'' is a broad encyclopedia of information relating to the liberal arts, all within the context of academic and theologic unity. It particularly examines the ways in which different types of knowledge can be distinguished, while still supporting a single purpose: explaining order in reality. The trivium (logic, grammar, and rhetoric) address the veracity, consistency, and beauty of the language of expression. The quadrivium (geometry, astronomy, arithmetic, and music) provide the intellectual content in need of expression.

Thierry also wrote some commentaries on [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''De Trinitate''.

The '''Third Man factor''' or '''Third Man syndrome''' refers to the reported situations where an unseen presence such as a [[spirit]] provides comfort or support during traumatic experiences.

==History==
[[Sir Ernest Shackleton]] in his book ''South'', described his belief that an [[incorporeal]] being joined him and two others during the final leg of their journey. Shackleton wrote, "during that long and racking march of thirty-six hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], it seemed to me often that we were four, not three."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shackleton|first=Ernest Henry|others=Frank Hurley, Fergus Fleming|title=South: The Endurance Expedition|publisher=[[Penguin Classics]]|year=1914|page=204|isbn=0-14-243779-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8gdPfhon1oC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;vq=that+we+were+four,+not+three&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His admission resulted in other survivors of extreme hardship coming forward and sharing similar experiences.

In recent years well-known adventurers like climber [[Reinhold Messner]] and polar explorers [[Peter Hillary]] and [[Ann Bancroft]] have reported the experience. One study of cases involving adventurers reported that the largest group involved climbers, with solo sailors and shipwreck survivors being the second most common group, followed by polar explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Suedfeld, Peter and Geiger, John, (2008) “The sensed presence as a coping resource in extreme environments” In: Ellens, J. Harold (ed.), Miracles God, Science, and Psychology in the Paranormal (Vol.3) Praeger. {{ISBN|0-275-99722-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journalists have related this to the concept of a [[guardian angel]] or [[imaginary friend]]. Scientific explanations consider this a [[coping mechanism]] or an example of [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/living/article/579401|title=Third man theory of otherworldly encounters|last=White|first=Nancy J.|date=January 30, 2009|publisher=The Star|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was popularized by a book by [[John G. Geiger]] ''The Third Man Factor'', that documents scores of examples.

Modern psychologists have used the 'third man factor' to treat victims of trauma. The 'cultivated inner character' lends imagined support and comfort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/adventure/2012/09/an-adventurers-guardian-angel-the-third-man/ An adventurer's angel], [[Australian Geographic]], 15 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Lines 359 through 365 of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s modernist poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) were inspired by Shackleton's experience, as stated by the author in the notes included with the work.

In [[Geraldine McCaughrean]]'s young adult fiction novel, ''[[The White Darkness]]'' (2005), the teenage heroine, Sym, joins a doomed Antarctic expedition. Abandoned and lost, she is guided to safety by a "third man", her imaginary friend, [[Captain Lawrence Oates]].

In [[Larry McMurtry]]'s [[Western (genre)|Western]] novel ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'' (1985), Pea Eye, after surviving an Indian attack with Gus, makes a trek back to Call and has an experience of a "ghost" or "spirit" that guides him during his walk.

[[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Against the Day]]'' (2006) makes reference to the experience.

In [[Max Brooks]]'s novel ''[[World War Z]]'', Colonel Christina Eliopolis crash lands in the midst of zombie-infested territory but is able to survive and be picked up with the assistance of a Sky Watcher codenamed "Mets Fan", who is later revealed to be a figment of her imagination. She maintains the belief that Mets is a real person.

In the 2013 film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', biomedical engineer Ryan Stone watches astronaut Matt Kowalski float away into space to certain death. Later in the film, as an exhausted Stone is about to give up, we see Kowalski appear and enter her space capsule. He gives Stone the strength of will to continue, and shows her a means to survive.

'''Thomas Reid''' (Read, Rhaedus) (died 1624) was a Scottish humanist and philosopher who became Latin secretary to King [[James VI and I]].

==Life==
He was second son of James Reid, minister of [[Banchory Ternan]], Kincardineshire, a cadet of the Pitfoddels family. [[Alexander Reid (doctor)]] (1586?–1643) the surgeon, was a younger brother. Thomas was educated at the grammar school, [[Aberdeen]], and at [[Marischal College]] and University, where he appears to have graduated M.A. about 1600. In 1602 he was appointed to a mastership in the grammar school, which he resigned in the following year on being chosen one of the regents in Marischal College.

After conducting a university class through the four years of their curriculum, he went to the continent, where he continued his studies, at first in France, and afterwards at the universities of [[Rostock]]&lt;ref&gt;see [http://purl.uni-rostock.de/matrikel/100021350 entry of Thomas Reid] in [[Rostock Matrikelportal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leipzig]]. While at Rostock, where he was admitted a ''[[docent]]'' in December 1608,&lt;ref&gt;see [http://purl.uni-rostock.de/matrikel/400070115 reception of Thomas Reid] in Rostock Matrikelportal&lt;/ref&gt; he taught philosophy and humanities for several years; and carried out a disputation on metaphysical subjects with [[Henningus Arnisæus]], then professor of medicine in the [[Viadrina European University|University of Frankfurt]]. He matriculated at Leipzig in the summer of 1613.

Returning to England, he associated with [[Patrick Young]] in the translation into Latin of James I's English writings, and in 1618 was appointed Latin secretary to the king, an office which he retained until his death in 1624. In 1620 he was, with his brother Alexander, incorporated M.A. at Oxford.

==Works and legacy==
Several of his poems appear in the ''Delitiæ Poetarum Scotorum'' (Amsterdam, 1637). Reid's major works are: 
*''De Accidente Proprio Theoremata Philosophica,'' Rostock, 1609.
*''Pervigilium Lunæ de Objecto Metaphysicæ,'' Rostock, 1609.
*''De Ente,'' Rostock, 1610.
*''De Proprietatibus Entis,'' Rostock, 1610.
*''De Veritate et Bonitate Entis,'' Rostock, 1610.
*''De Diversitate Entis,'' Rostock, 1610.
*''De Objecto Metaphysicæ Dissertatio Elenctica,'' Rostock, 1610.
*''Pervigilia Metaphysica Desideratissima,'' Rostock, 1616.
*''Dissertatio quod regibus et licitum et decorum sit scribere'' in [[Thomas Smith (scholar)|Thomas Smith]]'s ''Vitae quorundam eruditissimorum et illustrium virorum,'' London, 1707.

He was also the founder of the first public reference library in Scotland. By his will he bequeathed to the town and new college of Aberdeen his collection of books, and six thousand [[merk (coin)|merk]]s to endow a librarian who would keep the library open four days a week. Reid's collection, which included editions of the classics and manuscripts, now forms a part of the library of the [[University of Aberdeen]];&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abdn.ac.uk/historic/pc_cld_all.php&lt;/ref&gt; but his endowment was diminished under the management of the town council. From 1733 to 1737 the librarianship was held by Reid's kinsman and namesake, [[Thomas Reid]] (1710–1796), the philosopher.

'''William Thetford''' (April 25, 1923 &amp;ndash; July 4, 1988) was an American psychologist, medical psychologist and professor. He is best known for his collaboration with [[Helen Schucman]] in typing the original manuscript and being on the editing team for ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' (''ACIM''), a self-study curriculum in religious psychology.&lt;ref name="scribes"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1988, aged 65, in [[Tiburon, California]], after having made his involvement with the ACIM material and its study the most central focus of his life.

== Early childhood ==
Thetford was born on April 25, 1923, in [[Chicago, Illinois]] to John and Mabel Thetford as the youngest of three children.  At the time of his birth and early childhood, his parents were both regular members of the [[Christian Science]] church.  At the age of seven, the untimely death of his older sister caused his parents to disavow their affiliation with the Church of Christian Science.  Afterwards, for the next few years, Thetford sampled various other Protestant denominations.

At the age of nine he contracted a severe case of [[scarlet fever]], which led to [[rheumatic fever]] and a debilitating heart condition.  These resulting health problems forced him to spend the next three years at home recuperating.  During his forced recuperation period he took advantage of the many free hours, using the time to satisfy his voracious appetite for reading.  Despite his absence from the classroom, he entered high school at the age of twelve.

== University education ==
Following graduation from high school, he was awarded a four-year scholarship to [[DePauw University]] in [[Indiana]] where he graduated with majors in psychology and pre-medicine in 1944.  During the course of his university studies, Thetford eventually settled on the idea of specializing in [[psychology]], and in 1949 he received his PhD in this field from the [[University of Chicago]].

After graduating from DePauw in January 1944 until the summer of 1945, Thetford had a job as an administrative officer at the University of Chicago working with the scientific team doing atomic research.  In his graduate studies he was fortunate to be one of the first students of the renowned psychologist, [[Carl Rogers]].

== Career and hiring of Helen Schucman ==
For the five years following his graduation in 1949, Thetford worked as a research psychologist in both Chicago, and later in [[Washington, D.C.]] He was a research psychologist in the Institute for Psychosomatic &amp; Psychiatric Research &amp; Training at the Reese Hospital in Chicago from 1949-1951 and a senior psychologist for the United States government in Washington, DC from 1951-1954. In 1953 he was a consultant in Beirut, Lebanon at the [[Foreign Service Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/william-newton-thetford/oclc/4779290410&amp;referer=brief_results "William Newton Thetford"] Marquis Who's Who at worldcat.org. retrieved 17 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 1954 and 1955 as the director of clinical psychology at [[The Institute of Living]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].  From 1955 to 1957 he was an assistant professor of psychology at [[Cornell University]].

In 1958 he accepted an assistant professorship, which later developed into a full professorship, at the [[Columbia University]] College of Physicians and Surgeons.  During a portion of this same period he also served as the Director of Clinical Psychology at the [[Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital]].  It was here that he would stay for the next 20 years, and it was here that he first met [[Helen Schucman]], hiring her as a research psychologist and assistant.

A c.v. listing his positions, affiliations, grants, publications and papers is given as Appendix 2 in a biography ''Never Forget to Laugh'' by Carol Howe.

== "Invitation" for ''A Course in Miracles'' ==
The working relationship between Thetford and Schucman was apparently often somewhat strained, yet throughout these difficulties they would always maintain a certain level of [[professional courtesy]] and respect for one another.  The story is often retold that it was into this environment of inter-relational strain between Thetford and Schucman that the ''ACIM'' material was in a sense first “invited” into this world.  This “invitation” came in the form of an exclamation by Thetford one day, in the midst of one of their periodic difficulties, in which Thetford exclaimed, “There must be another way!”  This exclamation was followed by a certain speech he made to Schucman describing how he believed that it was time for them to try to refocus their energies on constructive and helpful agendas, rather than being forever hyper critical and hyper competitive with one another.  Expecting a typically condescending response from Schucman, the studied silence that followed his speech was then followed by a most surprising concurrence from Schucman, fully supporting his new proposal.  This speech was given in June 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Wapnick, Kenneth (1991). ''Absence from Felicity'', pp. 93ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foundation for Inner Peace, [http://www.acim.org/about_acim_section/scribes.html The Scribing of ''A Course in Miracles''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805195105/http://acim.org/about_acim_section/scribes.html |date=2006-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next four months were filled with a number of unusually vivid [[dream sequence]]s and even some unusual waking experiences for Schucman.  Amongst her vivid dream sequences, she began to become familiar with a certain internal character who spoke to her as [[Jesus]] in her dreams.  Little did she know that the voice of this dream character would soon come to dominate the rest of her life.  Many of her unusual experiences during these four months are recorded in the biographical work, ''Absence from Felicity'', by [[Kenneth Wapnick]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Wapnick|Wapnick, Kenneth]] (1991). ''Absence from Felicity'', pp. 97–131&lt;/ref&gt;  Schucman appears to have confided her experiences with Thetford, who acted as a sort of a calming, encouraging and stabilizing influence for Schucman during this period.

== ''A Course in Miracles'' transcription ==
Finally in October of that year, the transcriptions of what is now known as ''[[A Course In Miracles]]'' first began.  According to both Thetford and Schucman, due to Schucman's intensely divided feelings about the work of the transcription, Schucman would at times require a great deal of reassurance from Thetford in order to complete the process that eventually resulted in the first typewritten copy of ''ACIM'', (which later became known as the [[wikt:urtext|Urtext]]).

According to Thetford, Schucman was sitting at home on the night of October 21, 1965, when she heard an internal "voice" say to her, "This is a course in miracles. Please take notes."

When she first heard this internal voice, she thought she recognized it as the same voice of the dream sequence character that in her recent dream sequences had represented the person of Jesus to her.  Schucman then wrote down about a page of notes before she realized that this request was going to be of much greater significance, and would require a far greater commitment in time than it had ever asked of her before.  In a panic, she phoned Thetford to ask for his advice.  Thetford encouraged Schucman to do what the voice asked, and to take the notes.  He offered to meet with her the next morning before work, to review her notes, to discuss them further with her, and then to determine what she should do with this "Voice".&lt;ref&gt;Wapnick, Kenneth (1991), p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following morning, after Thetford's review of the notes, he was so impressed with what she read to him that he encouraged Schucman to continue with the note taking. Schucman was initially taken aback by Thetford's reaction, but then apparently after giving herself enough time to recover from her initial jitters to honestly review the notes herself, she agreed.  Soon they recognized that the notes, which eventually became ''A Course in Miracles'' (referred to as ''The Course'' by ''ACIM'' students), was their answer, the "other way" that they had agreed to find together four months earlier.

Classifying this transcription process as one of Schucman's unusual waking experiences is an understatement at best.  During the process Schucman claimed to have the mental equivalent of a [[tape recorder]] in her thoughts, which she described as being able to turn on and off at will, at her convenience, so that she might be able to transcribe into shorthand notes, what she was internally hearing.  This voice identified itself as none other than the [[historical Jesus]].

During the beginning of this process, one of Thetford's gentle complaints was, “In the beginning I spent most of my time while typing these notes with one hand on the typewriter and the other on Helen’s shoulder”.  After some months of experiencing an initial struggle in this process, eventually they both began to experience less [[subconscious]] resistance to the process, and the initial transcription began to move along more smoothly.

From 1965 through 1972 Thetford directly assisted Schucman with the transcription of the first three sections of the work, which was in fact the great bulk of the material.  Then in 1972, somewhat to both of their reliefs (yet on some levels to their dismay) it appeared that the writing was complete, which for the most part it was.

In 1972 Thetford and Schucman were introduced to Kenneth Wapnick through their mutual friend Father Groeshel. Wapnick was intrigued by the manuscript although he soon realized it needed considerable editing to render it into a publishable format.  Wapnick urged Helen to go over the manuscript once again with his assistance, which they did, bringing the final editing to a completion in the Spring of 1975.   Thetford, Wapnick and Schucman, the three principle transcriber-editors of ACIM were to remain friends for the rest of their lives, throughout the arduous process of seeing this manuscript through to first successful publication, and beyond to witness the initial spreading of its teachings.

After the completion of the bulk of the initial scribing/ transcribing process, for brief periods during 1973, 1975, and 1977 the short transcriptions of Psychotherapy,&lt;ref name="supplements to acim"&gt;{{cite book|year=1996|title=Supplements to A Course in Miracles: 1. Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process and Practice 2. The Song of Prayer|publisher=Viking Adult|isbn=0-670-86994-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Clarification of Terms, and of the Song of Prayer,&lt;ref name="supplements to acim" /&gt; which are the remainder of the standard material of ''ACIM'', were transcribed in similar fashion.

From 1971 to 1978 Thetford, along with David Saunders, headed the CIA mind control [[Project MKULTRA]] Subproject 130: Personality Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miraclestudies.net/BillVita.html |title=Dr. Willian N, Thetford Professional Vita |accessdate=2006-11-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118092415/http://www.miraclestudies.net/BillVita.html |publisher=miraclestudies.net |archivedate=January 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Move to California ==
In 1978 Thetford resigned from his positions at both [[Columbia University]] and at [[Columbia Presbyterian Hospital]]. In 1980 he packed up his household, and at the apparent invitation of [[Judith Skutch Whitson]], moved to [[Tiburon, California]], where Whitson was by now employed full-time in the publication and distribution of ''ACIM''.

Now in Tiburon at age 57, Thetford transitioned into a sort of semi-[[retirement]], no longer accepting any demanding positions of heavy responsibility in either his professional life, or in his involvement with the ever growing readership of ''ACIM''.  In California Thetford took on two part-time professional positions; one as a psychology consultant at [[Travis Air Force Base]] and the other as one of the directors of the ''ACIM'' related [http://www.healingcenter.org Center for Attitudinal Healing] in Tiburon, as offered to him by his friend and fellow student of ACIM, Dr. [[Gerald Jampolsky]].

In California Thetford spent the final eight years of his life regularly attending meetings of fellow ''ACIM'' students where ''ACIM'' principles would be discussed, but only rarely engaging in these discussions in any kind of an authoritative manner.   Instead, during this final period of his life, he appears to have been primarily concerned with his own personal study of the ''ACIM'' material, and with enriching his own grasp of its message.

On July 4, 1988, at age 65 Thetford died of a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].

Hazony is an outspoken [[Nationalism|nationalist]], and wrote that nationalism uniquely provides, "the collective right of a free people to rule themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2018/10/01/in-defense-of-nations-book-review/|title=In Defense of Nations {{!}} National Review|date=2018-09-13|work=National Review|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

Hazony is a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox Jew]]. In 2014 he authored an article where he laid out his views on [[Open Orthodoxy]]. Hazony stated that he feared Open Orthodoxy was acting as an ideological echo chamber, where any non approved views were ridiculed and quashed without debate. Hazony described his concern that elements of Open Orthodoxy had seemingly decided to accept all conclusions of academic [[Bible]] critics as indisputable fact, without even going through the motions of investigating whether these conclusions were true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote = I’ve been in that room many times in my life. Too many times. And by now I know it quite well. It’s a room in which there is a single, politically correct point of view that everyone is expected to express. A room in which those who toe the party line are praised over and over for being enlightened, fearless, and committed to the search for truth, while anyone who raises a doubt is greeted with anger and ridicule. A room in which those who might have disagreed or asked a tough question make a quick calculation that it’s just not worth being publicly embarrassed over it and retreat into silence, or else adjust their views to fit in. A room that is said to be set upon by enemies from the outside, enemies who are invariably lacking in any capacity for intelligent thought, who have no good points of their own to make, who in fact possess no recognizable virtues at all. In other words, it is a room in which the persuaded are lavishly rewarded for being persuaded, the undecided are relentlessly pressed to choose the right side or face the consequences, and skeptics—unless they are in the mood for a serious bruising—are made to shut up.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
