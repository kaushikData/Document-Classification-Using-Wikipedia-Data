      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36513">'''Alexander Catsch''' (also '''Katsch'''; 1913&amp;ndash;1976) was a German-Russian medical doctor and radiation biologist. Up to the end of World War II, he worked in Nikolaj Vladimirovich Timefeev-Resovskij’s ''Abteilung für Experimentelle Genetik'' at the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung'' (KWIH, [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research]]). He was taken prisoner by the Russians at the close of World War II.  Initially, he worked in Nikolaus Riehl’s group at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal’, but at the end of 1947 was sent to work in Sungul' at a sharshka known under the cover name Ob’ekt 0211. At the Sungul' facility, he again worked in biological research department under the direction of Timofeev-Resovskij. When Catsch returned to Germany in the mid-1950s, he fled to the West. He worked at the ''Biophysikalische Abteilung des Heiligenberg-Instituts'' and then at the ''Institut für Strahlenbiologie am Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe''. While in [[Karlsruhe]], he was also appointed, in 1962, to the newly created ''Lehrstuhl für Strahlenbiologie'', at the ''Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe''. In West Germany, he developed methods to extract radionucleotides from various organs.

==Early life==

Catsch was half-German and half-Russian.&lt;ref name="Albrecht, Heinemann-Grüder 2001, p. 60"&gt;Albrecht, Heinemann-Grüder, and Wellmann, 2001, Reference #27 on p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Catsch was trained as a medical doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===In Germany===

As early as 1938, Catsch cited his affiliation with the ''I. Medizinischen Universitätsklinik der Charité''; ''Charité'' was a teaching and research hospital in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Catsch ''Korrelationspathologische Untersuchungen 1. Die Korrelationen von Erbleiden und Anlagestörungen des Auges'', ''Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology'' Volume 138, Number 6, 866-892 (1938). The author was identified as being at the ''I. Medizinischen Universitätsklinik der Charité'', Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; No later than 1942, he was at the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung'' (KWIH, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research)&lt;ref&gt;Today, the KWIH is known as the ''Max-Planck Institut für Hirnforschung'', [http://www.mpih-frankfurt.mpg.de/global/menue/profil.htm MPIH].  After [[World War II]], all of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes were named after the [[physicist]] [[Max Planck]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft|Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft]]'', in Berlin-Buch. At the KWIH, he was in [[Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky|Nikolaj Vladimirovich Timofeev-Resovskij’s]] ''Abteilung für Experimentelle Genetik'' (Department for Experimental Genetics),&lt;ref&gt;I. Sell-Beleites and A. Catsch ''Mutationsauslösung durch Ultraviolettes Licht bei Drosophila I. Dosisversuche mit filtriertem Ultraviolett'', ''Molecular and General Genetics'' Volume 80, Number 1, 551-557 (1942). The authors were identified as being at the ''Genetischen Abteilung des Kaiser Wilhelm-Instituts'', Berlin-Buch, Germany.  The article was received on 5 August 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; a world-renowned department with the status of an institute. There, Catsch conducted research on the effects of radiation on genetic mutations.

What happened to Catsch after the Russians entered [[Berlin]] at the close of [[World War II]] is best understood in the context of his colleagues [[Karl Zimmer]] and [[Hans-Joachim Born]] at the KWIH, who had a close professional relationship with [[Nikolaus Riehl]], the scientific director of the [[Auergesellschaft]], in Berlin.

At the close of World War II, Russia had special search teams operating in Austria and Germany, especially in Berlin, to identify and “requisition” equipment, materiel, intellectual property, and personnel useful to the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]].  The exploitation teams were under the [[Russian Alsos]], and they were headed by [[Lavrentiy Beria|Lavrenij Beria’s]] deputy, Colonel General A. P. Zavenyagin. These teams were composed of scientific staff members, in [[NKVD]] officer’s uniforms, from the bomb project’s only laboratory, Laboratory No. 2, in Moscow.  In mid-May 1945, the Russian nuclear physicists [[Georgy Flyorov|Georgy Flerov]] and [[Lev Artsimovich]], in NKVD colonel’s uniforms, compelled Zimmer to take them to the location of Riehl and his staff, who had evacuated their ''Auergesellschaft'' facilities and were west of Berlin, hoping to be in an area occupied by the American or British military forces.  Riehl was detained at the search team’s facility in Berlin-Friedrichshagen for a week. This sojourn in Berlin turned into 10 years in the Soviet Union!  Riehl and his staff, including their families, were flown to Moscow on 9 July 1945.  Riehl was to head up a uranium production group at Plant No. 12 in [[Elektrostal|Ehlektrostal’]] (Электросталь&lt;ref&gt;”Электросталь” is sometimes transliterated as “Elektrostal”.  A one-to-one transliteration scheme transliterates the Cyrillic letter “Э” as “Eh”, which distinguishes it from that for the Cyrillic letter “Е” given as “E”. Transliterations often also drop the soft sign “ь”.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oleynikov, 2000, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Russia===

From 1945 to 1950, Riehl was in charge of uranium production at Plant No. 12 in [[Elektrostal|Ehlektrostal']].  When Riehl learned that H. J. Born and Karl Zimmer were being held in [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogorsk]], in the main PoW camp for Germans with scientific degrees, Riehl arranged though Zavenyagin to have them sent to Ehlektrostal’. Catsch, who had been taken prisoner with Zimmer, was also sent to the Ehlektrostal’ Plant No. 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlc.lib.utk.edu/f/fa/fulltext/0839.html Karl G. Zimmer Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018031800/http://dlc.lib.utk.edu/f/fa/fulltext/0839.html |date=2007-10-18 }} – University of Tennessee.&lt;/ref&gt; At Ehlektrostal’, Riehl had a hard time incorporating Born, Catsch, and Zimmer into his tasking on uranium production, as Born was a radiochemist, Catsch was a physician and radiation biologist, and Zimmer was a physicist and radiation biologist.&lt;ref&gt;Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 2, 31, 71, 83, 89-104, 121-128, and 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maddrell, 2006, 179-180, 186, 189, and 210-221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oleynikov, 2000, 11, and 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the detonation of the Russian uranium bomb, uranium production was going smoothly and Riehl’s oversight was no longer necessary at Plant No. 12. Riehl then went, in 1950, to head an institute in Sungul', where he stayed until 1952. Essentially the remaining personnel in his group were assigned elsewhere, with the exception of H. E. Ortmann, A. Baroni (PoW), and Herbert Schmitz (PoW), who went with Riehl. However, Riehl had already sent Born, Catsch, and Zimmer to the institute in December 1947. The institute in Sungul’ was responsible for the handling, treatment, and use of radioactive products generated in reactors, as well as radiation biology, dosimetry, and radiochemistry. The institute was known as [[Laboratory B in Sungul’|Laboratory B]], and it was overseen by the 9th Chief Directorate of the [[NKVD]] ([[MVD]] after 1946), the same organization which oversaw the [[Russian Alsos]] operation. The scientific staff of Laboratory B – a [[Sharashka|ShARAShKA]] – was both Soviet and German, the former being mostly political prisoners or exiles, although some of the service staff were criminals.&lt;ref name="Seitz 1996"&gt;Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 121-128, and 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oleynikov, 2000, 15-17"&gt;Oleynikov, 2000, 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; (Laboratory V, in [[Obninsk]], headed by [[Heinz Pose]], was also a sharashka and working on the Soviet atomic bomb project. Other notable Germans at the facility were Werner Czulius, Hans Jürgen von Oertzen, [[Ernst Rexer]], and Carl Friedrich Weiss.&lt;ref&gt;Polunin, V. V. and V. A. Staroverov ''Personnel of Special Services in the Soviet Atomic Project 1945 &amp;ndash; 1953'' [In Russian] [http://www.fsb.ru/history/autors/polunin.html (FSB, 2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215035846/http://www.fsb.ru/history/autors/polunin.html |date=2007-12-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Laboratory B was known under another cover name&lt;ref&gt;The Russians used various types of cover names for facilities to obfuscate both the location and function of a facility; in fact, the same facility could have multiple and changing designations. The nuclear design bureau and assembly plant [[Arzamas-16]], for example, had more than one designation – see [[Yulii Borisovich Khariton|Yuli Khariton]] and Yuri Smirnov ''The Khariton Version'', ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 20-31 (May 1993). Some facilities were known by post office box numbers, ''почтовом ящике'' (pochtovom yashike), abbreviated as ''п/я''. See Maddrell, 2006, 182-183. Also see Demidov, A. A. ''On the tracks of one “Anniversary”'' [In Russian] [http://www.sarov.info/index.php?ch=ngn&amp;id=4871&amp;view=article&amp;prevview=arc&amp;year=2005&amp;month=8 11.08.2005], which relates the history changing post office box designations for Arzamas-16.&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Объект 0211'' (Ob’ekt 0211, Object 0211), as well as Object B.&lt;ref&gt;[[N.

Some of its personnel were transferred elsewhere, but most of them were assimilated into a new, second nuclear weapons institute, Scientific Research Institute-1011, NII-1011, today known as the Russian Federal Nuclear Center All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Technical Physics, RFYaTs–VNIITF. NII-1011 had the designation ''предприятие п/я 0215'', i.e., enterprise post office box 0215 and ''Объект 0215''; the latter designation has also been used in reference to Laboratory B after its closure and assimilation into NII-1011.&lt;ref&gt;Sulakshin, S.

Penzina is cited as head of the VNIITF Archive in Snezhinsk.&lt;/ref&gt;)

One of the political prisoners in Laboratory B was Riehls’ colleague from the KWIH, [[Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky|N. V. Timofeev-Resovskij]], who, as a Soviet citizen, was arrested by the Soviet forces in Berlin at the conclusion of the war, and he was sentenced to 10 years in the [[Gulag]]. In 1947, Timofeev-Resovskij was rescued out of a harsh Gulag prison camp, nursed back to health, and sent to Sungul' to complete his sentence, but still make a contribution to the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Laboratory B, Timofeev-Resovskij headed a biophysics research department, in which Born, Catsch, and Zimmer were able to conduct work similar to that which they had done in Germany, and all three became section heads in Timofeev-Resovskij’s department. In fact, in Sungul', Catsch began his work on developing methods to extract radionucleotides from various organs, which he would continue when he left Russia.&lt;ref name="Seitz 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oleynikov, 2000, 15-17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chelarhiv1"/&gt;

In preparation for release from the Soviet Union, it was standard practice to put personnel into quarantine for a few years if they worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project, as was the case for Catsch. Additionally, in 1954, the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, German Democratic Republic) and the Soviet Union prepared a list of scientists they wished to keep in the DDR, due to their having worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project; this list was known as the “A-list”. On this A-list were the names of 18 scientists. Nine, possibly 10, of the names were associated with the Riehl group which worked at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal'. Born, Catsch, Riehl, and Zimmer were on the list.&lt;ref&gt;The A-list prepared by East Germany and the Soviet Union in 1954 had 18 names on it. These Germans were to be encouraged to stay in East Germany, as they had done work on the Soviet atomic bomb project. At least nine members worked in Riehl’s group at Ehlektrostal’: 
*[[Hans-Joachim Born]], Alexander Catsch, Werner Kirst, Przybilla, [[Nikolaus Riehl]], Herbert Thieme, Tobein, [[Günter Wirths]], and [[Karl Zimmer]]. 
*Schmidt may be a tenth Riehl group member Herbert Schmitz, or the name may refer to Fritz Schmidt, another nuclear scientist who was returned to Germany. 
Others on the list were: 
*[[Heinz Barwich]], Justus Mühlenpfordt, and Karl-Franz Zühlke, who all worked at Institute G headed by [[Gustav Hertz]], 
*Ingrid Schilling and Alfred Schimohr, who both worked at Institute A headed by [[Manfred von Ardenne]], 
*Willi Lange, Gerhard Siewert, and Ludwig Ziehl.
See Maddrell, 2006, 179-180.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 137-139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maddrell, 2006, 179-180"&gt;Maddrell, 2006, 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, Catsch was given a [[patronymic]] and his last name was transliterated from German into Russian; transliterated into English his name became Aleksandr Sergeevich Katsch.&lt;ref name="Albrecht, Heinemann-Grüder 2001, p. 60" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oleynikov, 2000, Reference #154, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Germany again===

Catsch returned to the DDR in the mid-1950s and fled West. Riehl arrived in the DDR on 4 April 1955, and by early June he was in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). Other colleagues of Riehl who worked with him in Russia also went West; [[Günter Wirths]] fled to the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG) and [[Karl Zimmer]] went legally.&lt;ref name="Maddrell, 2006, 179-180" /&gt;

As early as 1956, Catsch was at the ''Biophysikalische Abteilung des Heiligenberg-Instituts'', in [[Heiligenberg]], [[Baden]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;A. Catsch ''Die Wirkung von Calcium- und Cer-diaminozyklohexantetraessigsaurem Natrium auf die Verteilung von Radiocer im Organismus der Ratte'', ''Naturwissenschaften'' Volume 43, Number 22, 520-521 (1956). The author was identified as being at the ''Biophysikalische Abteilung des Heiligenberg-Instituts'', Heiligenberg, Baden, Germany. The article was received on 21 September 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

No later than 1958, he was at the ''Institut für Strahlenbiologie'' of the ''Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe'' (KFK, Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center), which was founded in 1956 and today is known as the ''[[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe]]'' (FZK, Karlsruhe Research Centere). It was allied with the ''Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe''; today, it is known as the ''[[University of Karlsruhe (TH)|Universität Karlsruhe (TH)]]'', after its reorganization and renaming in the academic year 1967/1968.  In 1962, while still at the KFK, Catsch was appointed to the newly created ''Lehrstuhl für Strahlenbiologie'' at the ''Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Catsch ''A Simple Analytical Method for the Determination of the Ratio of the Mother and Daughter Substances in Radioactive Preparations'' [In Geman], ''Experientia'' (Switzerland) Volume 14, 345-346 (1958).

==Personal==

Catsch was married to a Jewish woman.&lt;ref name="Albrecht, Heinemann-Grüder 2001, p. 60" /&gt;

[[Karl Zimmer]] and Catsch were lifelong friends, as well as professional colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;A. Catsch ''60th anniversary of K.G. Zimmer'' [In German], ''Strahlentherapie'' Volume 142, Number 1, 124-5 (1971)

'''Amosan''' is an oral antiseptic rinse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amosan.ca&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Vintage Brands Limited began manufacturing and selling an oral antiseptic rinse containing 68.635% (w/w) Sodium Perborate under the Amosan brand name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vintagebrands.ca/products.html&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2010, Amosan was an oral wound cleanser manufactured in [[Belgium]] and sold under the [[Oral-B]] brand, belonging to [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] after its recent acquisition of [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] (2005). It is used to aid in the prevention of, as well as speed the recovery from [[canker sores]], [[denture irritation]], orthodontic irritation, and oral injuries or after dental procedures. It is distributed in a powdered form that requires reconstitution with warm water, after which it is used as a mouth rinse. It is customarily packaged in 1.7g envelopes.

A recent double-blind [[crossover study]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 379049 | volume=6 | issue=2 | title=Effect of hydrogen peroxide on developing plaque and gingivitis in man. | date=Apr 1979 | journal=J Clin Periodontol | pages=115–30 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-051x.1979.tb02190.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that [[hydrogen peroxide]], which is released during the use of this product, may prevent or retard colonization and multiplication of anaerobic bacteria, such as those that inhabit oral wounds.

A similar, if not identical product, also manufactured under the Oral-B brand name, called [[Bocasan]] was once distributed in the UK, but appears to have been discontinued some time after 2003.

Vintage Brands Limited began manufacturing and selling Amosan Oral Antiseptic Rinse in 2014 because many consumers were disappointed that it was no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AmosanOralProducts&lt;/ref&gt; Product review pages on Amazon&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Amosan-Oral-Wound-Cleanser-Powder/dp/B000GGHT52|title=Amazon.com - Amosan Oral Wound Cleanser Powder}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public comment forums elsewhere&lt;ref name="mouthulcers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mouthulcers.org/messages.php?thread=1463|title=Mouthulcers.org - Bocasan/Amosan}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate a high level of frustration with the discontinuation by users who could find no effective alternative treatment.

In April 2012, it was reported that [[Shoppers Drug Mart]] in Canada had produced a comparable product under their house brand: 'Life Brand Oral Wound Cleanser'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.shoppersdrugmart.ca/en/health-and-pharmacy/personal-care/oral-lip-care/details/057800802228&lt;/ref&gt; Also Rexall has their own house brand.

==Drug facts==
* '''Active ingredient''': [[Sodium perborate monohydrate]] 1.2 g
* '''Inactive ingredients''': L-[[Tartaric acid]], [[sodium saccharin]], flavors
* '''Purpose''': Oral wound cleanser
* '''Normal use''': Use up to 4 times daily, after meals and before bedtime or as directed by a dentist or physician

Archuleta  had been found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] of [[assault]] and subsequently ordered to be confined in a prison mental hospital by the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]]  after   his  successful [[insanity defense]], as he was   evaluated by a psychiatrist as dangerous. His appeal challenged this confinement and "forced treatment", requested a withdrawal of his original [[insanity defense]], and sought his unconditional release from custody.&lt;ref name="aapl"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellate court reversed the lower court's dismissal of the habeas corpus petition, saying that habeas corpus is a last resort remedy available to those without any other, and the case was remanded back to that court with the instructions to transfer the petition to another district court, the [[United States District Court for the District of Utah]].&lt;ref name="findacase"/&gt;

==Facts of case==
Benjamin Archuleta was charged with assaulting a federal official and found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] (NGRI)  in the United States District Court for the District of Utah on July 23, 1999. Based on a  psychiatric evaluation and the testimony of others, the court ruled that Archuleta's release posed a substantial risk of harm to others and ordered him committed to the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Although later Archuleta was conditionally released,  his release was revoked on July 8, 2002 and he was recommitted to FMC Springfield until the time he was determined to be eligible for a conditional release by the hospital; such  release would be under court supervision.&lt;ref&gt;

Archuleta filed a [[pro se]] petition (a petition to represent himself) for [[habeas corpus]] relief (seeking relief for unlawful detention) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Western District of Missouri in October, 2002 requesting an  unconditional discharge and  release from confinement in the prison hospital.  He argued that the statute  under which  he was committed is unconstitutional because only a judicial unit, not an administrative one, can determine the length and conditions of his sentence and also whether his confinement after his successful NGRI  defense could exceed the sentence he would have received if found guilty under the law.    He further argued  that his confinement in the prison facility far from the court was equal to "banishment and exile" and that "forced treatment" violated the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]].&lt;ref name="aapl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="findacase"&gt;

|title=FindACase – Archuleta v. Hedrick
|publisher=ne.findacase.com

&lt;/ref&gt; He also contested the finding that he had violated the terms of his conditional release, saying that he did not refuse the forced treatment "but for the exception of being late on taking his [anti-psychotic] medication... one day".&lt;ref name="findacase"/&gt; He also requested to withdraw his insanity defense.&lt;ref name="aapl"/&gt;

At the district court level, the counsel for both parties agreed to  court’s interpretation of the pro se petition to focus on the issue of the involuntary administration of psychiatric medication.&lt;ref name="mentalhealthcases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifersunion.org/MentalHealth-Cases/8th%20archeleta%20v%20hedrick%20042304.pdf|title=Benjamin Archuleta, Plaintiff - Appellant,  Appeal from the United States v.  Bill Hedrick, Warden;  Defendants - Appellees|work=PDF|publisher=www.lifersunion.org/MentalHealth-Cases|accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The appellate court ruled that although Archuleta's post-acquittal confinement was constitutional under statute 18 U.S.C. § 4243,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  it  decided to  consider the  unlawful detention question broadly  as "substantial public interests are involved", as habeas corpus is a remedy  available when no other is available. It ruled the lower court erred in overlooking the seriousness of the grievance, as  the statute under which Archuleta was committed for involuntary treatment  did not prevent him "from establishing by writ of habeas corpus the illegality of his detention".&lt;ref name="mentalhealthcases"/&gt; Some issues, such as whether an insanity defense can be withdrawn upon appeal, have not been settled.&lt;ref name="aapl"/&gt;

The court vacated the dismissal order and remanded the case back to the district court, instructing that court  to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a),&lt;ref&gt;

A total of 15,792 middle-aged (45–64 years) men and women were enrolled from four U.S. communities: 
* [[Forsyth County, North Carolina]]
* [[Jackson, Mississippi]] 
* Suburbs of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]
* [[Washington County, Maryland]]
Participating organizations include four field centers ([[Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center]], [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]], [[University of Minnesota]], [[Johns Hopkins University]]), data coordinating center ([[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]), and many collaborating centers and laboratories.

The initial study visit took place in 1987-1989, the second in 1990-1992, the third in 1993-1995, the fourth in 1996-1998, and the fifth in 2011-2013. During these extensive examinations, information is obtained on demographics, medical history, medication use, and health behaviors.

To date, the ARIC study has published over 1,000 peer-reviewed journal articles in diverse areas of clinical and population research. Data from the ARIC study have become an important resource for the study of heart disease, [[chronic kidney disease|kidney disease]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], and [[cognitive]] decline. These data have also contributed to clinical practice guidelines and policy statements.

The '''Australian Institute of Fitness''' is a privately owned, registered training organisation, and the largest fitness training organisation in Australia.&lt;ref name="myskillsgovau"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Institute of Fitness|url=https://www.myskills.gov.au/RegisteredTrainers/Details?rtocode=121508|website=MySkills Training provider Details|publisher=Department of Education and Training|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning operations as the Health Studio Attendants course in Perth in 1979, the Institute became Australia’s first national fitness training provider in 2000, with the merger of five state-based fitness training programs.&lt;ref name="AIF01"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Institute - Who we are|url=https://fitness.edu.au/the-institute/|website=Australian Institute of Fitness|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1979, sports educator and author Nigel Champion began running a Health Studio Attendants course in Perth, the first of its kind in Australia.  In 1981, Champion partnered with Australian academic Dr Garry Egger to establish the ACHPER Fitness Leader group of courses in Sydney; before joining, in 1986, with fitness entrepreneur Greg Hurst to establish the Australian Fitness Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigel Champion Profile|url=http://fitnessresearch.edu.au/people-view/jessica-hills-2|website=www.fitnessresearch.edu.au|publisher=Fitness Research|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Hurst &amp; Champion together with Russell Creagh, Monty Dortkamp, Dr Grant Pavia and Kerry McEvoy, merged five existing fitness training programs – ACHPER Fitness Leader; Australian Fitness Network; Institute for Fitness Professionals; National College of Fitness; and the Australian Institute of Fitness – to create the national Australian Institute of Fitness.&lt;ref name="AIF01" /&gt;

Russell Creagh served as the first CEO of the consolidated Institute, from 2001 to 2006, followed by Greg Hurst (2006 – 2011) and Dyanne Ward (2011 – 2016).  In December 2016, Steve Pettit, the Institute’s CEO Queensland, was appointed as its National Chief Executive on the retirement of Dyanne Ward.&lt;ref name="ALM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Institute of Fitness names new Chief Executive|url=https://www.ausleisure.com.au/news/australian-institute-of-fitness-names-new-chief-executive/|website=Australasian Leisure Management|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since inception, the founding entities provided a variety of fitness industry-specific certification and training courses.  Following the Federal Government’s 1996 training reform agenda, these courses were incorporated into the [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] (AQF). Since 1996, the Institute has delivered nationally recognised qualifications in fitness, massage and business, in compliance with the regulatory standards of the AQF.&lt;ref name="AIF02"&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry Accreditation|url=https://fitness.edu.au/the-institute/industry-accreditation/|website=Australian Institute of Fitness|publisher=AIF|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Belmeken''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Белмекен) dam is situated in the [[Rila|Rila Mountains]] in [[Bulgaria]] and is the highest reservoir on the Balkan peninsula.  There is a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage plant]] the [[Chaira Hydro Power Plant]] built between the lake and a lower basin. Part of the water stored in the lake is cycled back and forth through the pumped storage turbines, while the lakes outflow drains through tunnels to the [[Sestrimo Hydro Power Plant]].&lt;ref name=NEC&gt;[http://www.nek.bg/cgi?d=1432 Chaira PSP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721073049/http://www.nek.bg/cgi?d=1432 |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bili-Bili Dam''' is located in [[Gowa Regency]], [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]], on the [[Jeneberang River]], about 30 km from the city of [[Makassar]]. It serves several purposes to include [[flood control]], [[irrigation]] and [[hydroelectric]] power generation. The dam was constructed between 1991 and 1998.

==Background==
In 1981, Bili-Bili Dam was added to the Jeneberang River Comprehensive Development Project. Construction began in 1991 and the dam was completed in 1998. The [[weir]]s downstream of the dam and their accompanying irrigation canals were completed in December 2005. The dam's power station was commissioned in 2005 as well.&lt;ref name=JICA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jica.go.jp/english/our_work/evaluation/oda_loan/post/2008/pdf/e_project05_full.pdf | title=Bili-Bili Irrigation Project | publisher=Japanese International Cooperation Agency | date=2008 | accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was built with funding and cooperation from the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]]. It has several purposes to include [[municipal water]] supply for the city of [[Makassar]], about 30 km away, and to protect the city from historic flooding. It is designed prevent an estimated 50-year flood. Water from its reservoir also helps irrigate about {{Convert|23786|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of rice fields in Gowa and [[Takalar Regency|Takalar regencies]].&lt;ref name = "bookchapters"&gt;{{Cite book

}}
The '''Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport''', commonly referred to as the '''Health Secretary''', is a cabinet position in the [[Scottish Government]]. The Cabinet Secretary is responsible for the [[Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates]] and [[NHS Scotland]]. The Cabinet Secretary is assisted by the [[Minister for Public Health and Sport]] and the [[Minister for Mental Health]].

The current Cabinet Secretary is [[Jeane Freeman]], who was appointed in June 2018.

==History==
The position was created in 1999 as the '''Minister for Health and Community Care''', with the advent of devolution and the institution of the [[Scottish Parliament]], taking over some of the roles and functions of the former [[Scottish Office]] that existed prior to 1999. After the [[Scottish parliamentary election, 2007|2007 election]] the Ministerial position was renamed to the '''Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing'''. After the [[Scottish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 election]] the full Ministerial title was '''Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy''' with the portfolio being expanded to include Cities Strategy which was part of the SNP manifesto to have a dedicated "Minister for Cities"; at the same time the responsibility for housing was removed and transferred to the new [[Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment]]. Responsibilities for the cities strategy and the delivery of the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in Glasgow were later transferred to other members of the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/14944/Scottish-Cabinet |title=Cabinet and Ministers: biography and responsibilities |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=26 June 2014 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2016|2016 election]], the name of the post was changed to simply '''Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport'''.

The '''Camelford water pollution incident''' involved the accidental contamination of the drinking water supply to the town of [[Camelford]], [[Cornwall]], in July 1988. Twenty [[tonne]]s of [[aluminium sulphate]] was inadvertently added to the water supply, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level. As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of [[sulphuric acid]] which "stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people’s homes."&lt;ref name="cross"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Boiling water: Will a new inquiry on the Camelford poisoning get any nearer to the truth?|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=22 August 2001|first=Doug|last=Cross|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irwin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irwinmitchell.com/ClientStories/Pages/Camelford-Water-Pollution-Case.aspx|title=Camelford Water Pollution Case|work=IrwinMitchell LLP|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects,&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Still thirsting for justice|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/jun/09/guardiansocietysupplement14|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=9 June 1999|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear {{As of|2012|lc=on}}. There has been no rigorous examination or monitoring of the health of the victims since the incident, which is Britain's worst mass poisoning event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/real-possibility-Camelford-mass-water-poisoning/story-15517393-detail/story.html|title='Very real possibility' that Camelford mass water poisoning contributed to Somerset woman's death &amp;#124; This is Somerset|work=thisissomerset.co.uk|date=14 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times200406"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article707311.ece|title=Alzheimer's linked to aluminium pollution in tap water|last1=Hawkes|first1=Nigel|work=[[The Times]]|date=20 April 2006|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inquests on people who died many years later found very high levels of aluminium in the brain. [[Barbara Clayton|Dame Barbara Clayton]] led a [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] enquiry into the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Professor Dame Barbara Clayton Honorary Fellow|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-3010.2011.01903.x/abstract|journal = Nutrition Bulletin|date = 2011-06-01|issn = 1467-3010|pages = 283–283|volume = 36|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-3010.2011.01903.x|language = en|first = Alan|last = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the contamination the authorities said that the water was safe to drink, possibly with juice to cover the unpleasant taste. In an inquest in 2012 into the death of one of the victims, the [[coroner]] stated that [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] had been "gambling with as many as 20,000 lives" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable.&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"/&gt; In the aftermath of the contamination the public were reassured that there was no risk to health. There were allegations of a [[cover-up]] and West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose stated: "I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner attacks former water authority 'cover-up'|work=The West Briton|date=22 March 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30983330.html|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation by the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, [[Michael Meacher]], the former Environment Minister, claimed that "various associated bodies tried to bury the inquiry from the start." Meacher told one newspaper: "This has become a tug of war between the truth and an attempt to silence the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford: The truth will out|work=[[The Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=26 January 2007|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ministers accused of Camelford cover-up|first=Ben|last=Russell|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=17 August 2001|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2013 report by the Lowermoor subgroup of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment concluded that exposure to the chemicals was unlikely to cause "delayed or persistent harm" and was also unlikely to cause future ill health.&lt;ref name="bbc_2013"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-22200035&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cot_2013"&gt;http://cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/lwpiapp811.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 the government admitted that there had been a "manifest failure to give prompt appropriate advice and information to affected consumers" and offered an unreserved apology.&lt;ref name="BBC-24164253"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Camelford water poisoning: Unreserved government apology | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 19 September 2013 | accessdate = 8 May 2016 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-24164253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
On 6 July 1988, John Stephens, a relief tanker driver working for ISC Chemicals, a [[Bristol]]-based subsidiary of [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto Zinc]], arrived at [[Lowermoor Water Treatment Works]] on [[Bodmin Moor]] and found it unmanned.&lt;ref name="wells2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Driver relives day of water poisoning|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=2 November 2010|first=Jeff|last=Wells|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being unfamiliar with the location, he had been given a key by another driver and told simply that "once inside the gate, the aluminium sulphate tank is on the left". However, the key fitted almost every lock used by the [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] (SWWA). After twenty minutes looking for the correct tank he tried the key on a manhole cover and when it unlocked believed he had accessed the correct tank.&lt;ref name=wells2010/&gt; He poured the load of 20 tonnes of [[aluminium sulphate]], used to remove solid particles from raw water, into the tank, which actually held treated water prior to distribution to the consumers in Camelford. This immediately contaminated the water supply to 20,000 local people and up to 10,000 tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/127270.stm|title=Public inquiry calls mark Camelford anniversary|work=[[BBC News]]|date=6 July 1998|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indyscandal"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Lean|first1=Geoffrey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/poisoned-the-camelford-scandal-474373.html|title=Poisoned: The Camelford scandal|work=[[The Independent]]|date=16 April 2006|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum recorded aluminium concentration was 620 milligrams per litre compared with the maximum concentration admissible at the time by the European Community of 0.2 milligrams per litre.&lt;ref name="rowland"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rowland|first1=A|last2=Grainger|first2=R|last3=Smith|first3=RS|last4=Hicks|first4=N|last5=Hughes|first5=A|title=Water contamination in north Cornwall: a retrospective cohort study into the acute and short-term effects of the aluminium sulphate incident in July 1988|year=1990|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Health|issue=110|pages=166–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several days the water authority insisted the water was safe, and should be mixed with orange juice to disguise the taste of the as yet unknown contaminant. One customer who telephoned the authority the day after the contamination was told "there had been some acidity, but the water was perfectly safe to drink," and was no more harmful than lemon juice.&lt;ref name="boggan"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Day that left a bitter taste in the mouth|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|first=Steve|last=Boggan|pages=7|date=24 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1988 the authority sent a circular letter to all customers "asserting that the water from the treatment works was of the right [[alkalinity]] and was safe to use and drink."&lt;ref name="timeslaw"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Exemplary damages in public nuisance (AB v South West Water Services Ltd [1993] QB 507)|work=The Times|location=London|date=8 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two days, the authority suspected the source of the contamination was the erroneous delivery, which was confirmed on 12 July when the driver was asked to return to the treatment works. However, it was not until ten days later on 22 July that the authority's chairman Keith Court authorised a public notice, containing the first mention of the aluminium sulphate, to be published in the sports section of a local newspaper, the ''[[Western Morning News]]''.&lt;ref name="greenwood2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water bosses too slow to go public over poisoning|work=[[Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=9 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens stated that after the site meeting where he confirmed he had delivered the chemical to the wrong tank he was told by the authority "not to mention it to anyone else".&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Driver was told to "tell no one" about poisoning|work=[[Cornish Guardian]]|location=Truro|date=3 November 2010|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SWWA district manager, John Lewis, said they had realised within 48 hours that aluminium sulphate was the likely cause of the contamination, but Lewis said he had been instructed by Leslie Nicks, the head of operations, not to tell the public.&lt;ref name="telegraph2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Staff 'silenced' over poisoned water|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=3 November 2010|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="express"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water company's staff 'told to keep poisoning quiet'|work=[[Express and Echo]]|location=Exeter|date=3 November 2010|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Cross, a [[biologist|consultant biologist]] based in Camelford, tested the water and found that it contained "not only aluminium sulphate but other noxious substances, too. As the acidic liquid travelled from the plant into people's homes, it corroded the copper pipes and their soldered joints, made of zinc and lead."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt; Official advice to boil the water before drinking was, according to Cross, "dangerous advice because it concentrates the contaminants. They kept flushing the pipes out for months after the incident. This will have stirred up debris in the bends and only have lengthened the amount of time the water was coming through the taps with all sorts of metals in it."
60,000 [[salmon]] and [[trout]] were killed in the [[River Camel|Camel]] and [[River Allen, Cornwall|Allen]] rivers during the flushing out process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-21771-2|title=The Environment: Principles and Applications|first=Chris|last=Park|pages=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jury"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Claimants consider 11th-hour pollution compensation offer|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=6 May 1994|first=Louise|last=Jury}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contamination was compounded by the failure of the authority to carry out the required six-monthly cleaning of the tank, which had not been cleaned for three years leading to a build up of sludge.&lt;ref name="gerrard"&gt;{{Cite news|title=What's happened to the children?|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date =14 July 1996|first=Nicci|last=Gerrard|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the contamination, Michael Waring at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] (DH) wrote to every doctor in Cornwall saying that, "although he had no detailed information on what was exactly in the water or how much people might have drunk, he could assure them that no lasting ill effects would result."&lt;ref name="meacher"&gt;{{Cite news|title=A wash out: Lessons must be learned from the notorious Camelford water contamination incident|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=26 April 2006|first=Michael|last=Meacher|pages=8|authorlink=Michael Meacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; GK Matthews, a senior toxicologist at the DH, suggested a team of medical experts should be sent to the area immediately but a month later said he had been "overruled".&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt; The [[National Union of Public Employees]] said that the procedure by which the driver had access to the site was common through the region and that they believed this was connected with reduced staffing levels and [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|privatisation plans]]. They added that they were concerned about the three-week delay in reporting what had happened, and that SWWA district manager John Lewis had been "instructed at a very high level to say nothing". Lewis (not a member of the union) had been dismissed; the union said "To single him out is unfair".&lt;ref name=dennis /&gt;

==Reports and inquiries==
In August 1988 a highly critical report by Dr John Lawrence, a senior [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] scientist and non-executive member of the water authority, blamed lax procedures. He also criticised communication failures which kept information from the public.&lt;ref name="dennis" /&gt;

===Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report===
The Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group (LIHAG) was set up in January 1989 to provide expert advice to the [[District Health Authority#Authorities in South Western Region|Cornwall and Isles of Scilly District Health Authority]] on the health implications for the population of the Camelford area.&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1989/jul/20/lowermoor-incident-group|journal=[[Hansard]]|date=20 July 1989|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 20 July 1989 (cc298-9W)|volume=157|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the LIHAG reported that there was no convincing evidence of a harmful build-up of aluminium and that there was no increase in ill health from poisoned water. A further enquiry by the same group in 1991 acknowledged the affair had caused "real suffering" in the community.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skytimeline" /&gt; However, Dame Barbara Clayton concluded that this was because of sensational reporting of the incident. She stated that "In our judgment it is likely that these symptoms would have occurred in the normal course of events," and the symptoms were wrongly attributed to the contamination because of "inaccurate and exaggerated" claims of health damage by scientists and the news media.&lt;ref name="rumbelow"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford spill damaged brains, says doctor|work=The Times|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first=Helen|last=Rumbelow|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Clayton report was released in July 1989, it caused "outrage in Camelford and wide disbelief in the scientific community."&lt;ref name="vidal"&gt;{{Cite news|title=New inquiry into water poisoning: Minister promises to look again at Camelford|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=15 August 2001|first=John|last=Vidal|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One section was later amended to read "alarming statements by ''pseudo-''scientists" rather than "...by ''some'' scientists".&lt;ref name=vidal /&gt;

===COT Lowermoor Subgroup report===
In June 2000 [[Environment minister]] [[Michael Meacher]] announced that there would not be an independent public inquiry, and declared "All the facts are fully known and there is no reason to believe that a public inquiry could add to that."&lt;ref name="Guardian-refused"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford inquiry refused|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/13/geoffreygibbs?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=13 June 2000|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000 the [[Environmental Law Centre]] [http://www.elc.org.uk/pages/home.htm]&lt;!--external inline link can be deleted if &amp; when ELC article has been created--&gt; prepared a petition to the [[European Parliament]] calling for a Brussels-based inquiry.&lt;ref name= harris /&gt; On 14 August 2001 the government announced that an investigation – although not a full public inquiry – into the incident would take place.&lt;ref name="graves"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford health inquiry starts: Campaigners denied public hearing into contamination but minister backs 'quick' investigation|first=David|last=Graves|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=15 August 2001|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was to be undertaken by the newly formed Lowermoor Subgroup (LSG) consisting of scientific and health experts and local resident representatives, chaired by Frank Woods, a professor of medicine at the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref name=graves /&gt; Woods was also the head of the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), of which the Lowermoor team was a subgroup.&lt;ref name="woodcock"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Now Camelford waits for justice over 'poisoning'|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|location=Birmingham|date=15 August 2001|first=Andrew|last=Woodcock|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its remit was to advise on whether the incident had caused, or was expected to cause, long-term harm to human health and examine whether the existing programme of monitoring and research into the human health effects was sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/19298.php|title=Draft Report Published into Lowermoor Water Contamination Incident, UK|work=Medical News Today|date=26 January 2005|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005 draft report====

A draft report, published on 26 January 2005, was inconclusive, saying that the long-term health effects on the population were still unknown and that there was insufficient scientific information available to determine whether the health problems being experienced were caused by the contamination.&lt;ref name="brown2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford inquiry seeks new studies|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=27 January 2005|first=Paul|last=Brown|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods called for further studies and said: "We will be putting the strongest possible case to the minister. I believe carrying out that work is important, it is not something which should be dropped and pushed aside."&lt;ref name=brown2 /&gt;

The following year, Meacher made several criticisms of the group:
*the requirement to examine the DoH's handling of the incident was removed from the terms of reference
*no independent expert on aluminium toxicology was included in the working group
*an attempt was made to include Waring as medical adviser to the group, even though he was the author of the original letter stating that no lasting ill effects would result
*no objective testing of the exposed population was carried out
*too much reliance was placed on the water sample analysis from the South-West Water Authority, the compromised party
*the amount of sludge reported to have been in the contact tank at the time was ignored
*experts were drawn on who had potentially vested interests in the aluminium industry
*the DoH pre-released a highly misleading statement of the findings two days before the draft report was due to be made public
*the executive summary, prepared without the group's approval, and which effectively concluded that the illnesses reported bore no connection with the water poisoning, was "misleading and biased".&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt;

Two members of the LSG committee claimed in December 2007 that the DoH had known from the start that some people were at especially high risk from aluminium poisoning but deliberately suppressed this evidence to protect the government's plans for water privatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Sturcke|first1=James|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/dec/13/water.pollution1|title=Coroner orders police to reopen Camelford pollution case|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 December 2007|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yorkshire"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police to investigate claims of water poisoning cover-up|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/around-yorkshire/local-stories/police_to_investigate_claims_of_water_poisoning_cover_up_1_2484066|work=[[Yorkshire Post]]|location=Leeds|date=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013 final report====
The final report was published in April 2013, and concluded that it was unlikely that the exposure to chemicals could have caused long-term health problems. Key findings of the report include:

* there is no evidence that the combination of metals which occurred as a result of the incident could have caused delayed health effects
* there was an increase in childhood infections in the area, but this increase occurred before the pollution incident
* a study of cancer incidence and mortality showed that there was no increase in cancer incidence in the area after the pollution incident
* a dermatologist investigated skin and nail problems reported by individuals affected by the incident, and reported that the problems are similar to those experienced by the general population
* there is no evidence that the contaminants can cause joint or muscle pain and/or swelling, and these complaints are common in the general population
* a Camelford resident who died of severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy was found to have higher than normal aluminium concentrations in the brain during an autopsy. However samples from the brain of a patient with similar neuropathology but unknown aluminium exposure found similar higher than usual concentrations. Research commissioned by the coroner compared 60 postmortem brains and found no correlation between aluminium  or iron concentrations and the level of congophilic angiopathy or senile plaques&lt;ref name="bbc_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cot_2013"/&gt;

==Health effects==

===Short-term===
A diverse array of short term health effects was reported by members of the public who either drank the contaminated water or came into contact with it while bathing.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dennis"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Dennis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1988/oct/01/1|title=Official dismissed over contamination: Cornish manager made a scapegoat, says union|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 October 1988|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kent /&gt; These included:
*urinary complaints,
*[[desquamation|blistering and peeling]] of skin,
*hair turning blue or green,
*diarrhoea and vomiting, and
*[[arthralgia|joint pains]].

===Long-term===
A 1999 report in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' concluded that some victims had suffered "considerable damage" to their brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Altmann| first = Paul |author2=John Cunningham |author3=Usha Dhanesha |author4=Margaret Ballard |author5=James Thompson |author6=Frank Marsh | title = Disturbance of cerebral function in people exposed to drinking water contaminated with aluminium sulphate: retrospective study of the Camelford water incident|journal=BMJ|volume=319| issue = 7213|pages=807–811|date=25 September 1999|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7213/807| pmid = 10496822| pmc = 314205| doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7213.807}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted the [[#Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report|1991 LIHAG report]] telling residents that their symptoms were due to anxiety. The study was led by a consultant [[nephrology|nephrologist]] at [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], [[Oxford]], and was the first large-scale clinical study of the affected residents. The report stated that their symptoms were similar to those of [[Alzheimer's disease]], which has also been linked with large quantities of aluminium accumulating in the brain.&lt;ref name=rumbelow /&gt; Rejecting the findings of the LIG, the report called for further research to determine the longer term prognosis for the affected individuals and led to fresh calls for a public inquiry into the pollution incident.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Brain damage found in pollution victims|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh|date=24 September 1999|first=Chris|last=Court|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the study was carried out in 1991, its publication was delayed by the ongoing litigation between SWWA and the victims.&lt;ref name="laurance"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Contaminated water caused long-term brain damage in Camelford, say doctors study|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first1=Jeremy|last1=Laurance|first2=Cherry|last2=Norton|first3=Steve|last3=Boggan|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven months after the contamination, one victim underwent a bone biopsy which "found a ring of aluminium like the rings you see in trees" that could not have resulted from normal aluminium absorption.&lt;ref name=boggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt;

===Later deaths of victims===
The husband of [[#Carol Cross|Carol Cross]], who died of a rare form of dementia in 2004, said in 2006 that he believed that his wife and twenty other people had died as a result of the disaster, and that more cases were emerging.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt;

Victim Sarah Sillifant, who was in her twenties when she was exposed, hanged herself in 2005 after suffering dementia and other symptoms similar to those experienced by Carol Cross.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt; In June 2007, Irene Neal, who lived in Rock, near Camelford at the time of the incident, died aged 91. A post-mortem found an "unacceptable amount of aluminium in the brain".

====Carol Cross====
In 2006 a post-mortem [[inquest]] into the death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0–2 micrograms per gram. Her death was caused by a form of early-onset [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|beta amyloid angiopathy]], a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium in her brain.&lt;ref name="savill"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alzheimer's symptoms in toxic water woman's brain|work=Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=16 December 2005|first=Richard|last=Savill|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liverpool"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water link to Alzheimer's|work=[[Liverpool Daily Post|Daily Post]]|location=Liverpool)|date=16 December 2005|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, said of the findings: "Further research will be needed before the significance of the elevated brain aluminium concentration in this case can be clarified. A scientific report on the case has been submitted for publication."&lt;ref name=liverpool /&gt; Daniel Perl, of New York's [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] said: "If additional similar cases were to appear among the 20,000 exposed individuals then the implications of this incident would become extremely important. Only time will tell. At the very least, increased efforts towards surveillance of individuals exposed in Camelford is certainly warranted."&lt;ref name="hawkes"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alzheimer's linked to aluminium pollution in tap water|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 April 2006|first=Nigel|last=Hawkes|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose had adjourned the inquests for Cross and Neal pending further studies, but in 2008 said the Government had refused "to either finance or assist" research to test the hypothesis of a link between exposure to aluminium and [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|congophilic amyloid angiopathy]]. He said this research was necessary to determine the consequences of the deceased having such a high level of aluminium. He later sought support from [[Somerset County Council]] so that the work could go ahead and once more adjourned the inquest into the death of Carol Cross, although Neal's inquest went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Inquests: Camelford coroner attacks lack of state cash|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|first=Steven|last=Morris|pages=8|date=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 Rose announced that the inquest into Cross's death would resume in November 2010.&lt;ref name="greenwood"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner to quiz ex-water chief|work=Western Morning News|location=Plymouth|date=31 July 2009|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose said that "ongoing medical research would not be completed until late summer" 2010. He explained "This research is necessary to prove whether or not the high level of aluminium in Mrs Cross's brain causing her death through beta amyloid angiopathy (a form of cerebrovascular disease) on February 19, 2004, could be attributed to the aluminium sulphate placed in the public water supply at Lowermoor treatment works on July 6, 1988. This is the last adjournment I am able to agree and the inquest will commence on Monday November 1, 2010 at Taunton."&lt;ref name=greenwood /&gt;

When the inquest was reconvened Dr. Chris Exley, a reader in [[bioinorganic chemistry]] at [[Keele University]], said "The brain aluminium concentration was so high that it is highly likely that it contributed to her brain pathology, probably being responsible for the aggressive form and very early onset of the disease." [[Neuropathology|Neuropathologist]] Prof. Margaret Esiri, from the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], said "I have never seen a case such as this at this age. I have seen one case in a woman who died aged 81 but the literature shows only a handful of cases worldwide."&lt;ref name="greenwood4"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Experts: Highly likely that polluted water caused death|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of their evidence the inquest was again adjourned to allow South West Water Authority time to seek its own expert evidence.&lt;ref name="greenwood5"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison in water 'led to death'|work=[[Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Cross's inquest was finally completed in March 2012. The coroner returned a [[narrative verdict]] recording the circumstances without attributing the cause, in which he said the water supply company, [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] had been "gambling with as many as 20,000 lives" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable. An expert said at the inquest that the levels of aluminium in her brain were "beyond belief".&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-17367243 |title=BBC News – Camelford water poisoning: Authority 'gambled with lives'|work=bbc.co.uk |date=14 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose stated: "I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident," and that "[T]he failure of the authority to visit every house after the incident to advise them to thoroughly flush their systems [w]as a serious dereliction of duty. I can say that the incident may either have contributed to or possibly caused Mrs Cross's death, but I do not have sufficient evidence to say so conclusively."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner attacks former water authority 'cover-up'|work=[[The West Briton]]|date=22 March 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30983330.html|location=Truro|accessdate=24 September 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal actions against South West Water Authority==
In 1991 the South West Water Authority was fined £10,000 and ordered to pay £25,000 costs at [[Exeter]] Crown Court for supplying water likely to endanger public health. The authority paid at least £123,000 to settle almost 500 initial compensation claims and in 1997 a further 148 victims accepted out-of-court damages totalling almost £400,000, approved by a High Court judge sitting in [[Truro]]. The settlements ranged from £680 to £10,000.&lt;ref name=jury /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1908534.stm|title=Camelford poisoning hearings begin|work=BBC News|date=3 April 2002|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water claims settled|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4650262.html|date=11 May 1994|accessdate=24 September 2011}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some later claimed they were "railroaded" into accepting the out-of-court settlements after being told that their [[Legal aid#Legal aid in England and Wales|legal aid]] funding would be withdrawn if they continued with the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice" /&gt; The judge, Mr Justice Wright, said: "If the case had been contested, there would have been awesomely complex argument over how much [water] they consumed" and that they were "extraordinarily well advised to accept the offer."&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Residents accept pounds 400,000 from water company for pollution|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=11 May 1994|first=Paul|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross later said: "The official medical claim from the health authority was that there was no known pathway for aluminium to be absorbed into the body. I would argue that this was a misrepresentation of scientific facts, however it was accepted by the judge [and he] instructed the jury that medical damages could not be awarded. The victims therefore received negligible compensation. This alone is adequate reason for a judicial review, since it resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the victims."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt;

==Allegations of a cover-up==
On 13 December 2007 Michael Rose announced that, in light of "a possible attempt to initially suppress the seriousness of the incident, I am asking the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall to hand me evidence gathered at the time of the original investigation," and for the chief constable to appoint a senior detective "to look into the allegations of a possible cover-up."&lt;ref name="bruxelles"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner fears toxic water was covered up|work=The Times|location=London|date=14 December 2007|first=Simon|last=de Bruxelles|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the incident the [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|water industry was about to be privatised]] by the Conservative government of the day; a letter written from a water official to [[Michael Howard]], then Minister of State for Water and Planning, emerged which stated that a police investigation into the poisoning incident was viewed as "very distracting" and that any subsequent prosecution of South West Water would also "be totally unhelpful to privatisation... and render the whole of the water industry unattractive to the City".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A Lethal Cover-up|work=Daily Mail|location=London|date=15 December 2007|page=36|first=Sue|last=Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Western Morning News]]'', using a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] request, uncovered a briefing note to the then Environment Minister, [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], warning: "Those of the South West board with a commercial background are deeply concerned by the investigation."&lt;ref name=bnet /&gt;
There was speculation in the news media that commercial concerns were given priority over public health.

The former North Cornwall [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Member of Parliament (MP) [[Paul Tyler, Baron Tyler|Paul Tyler]] also uncovered documents contradicting the water authority's claim that it had advised consumers not to drink the water, and that this advice had been given in a radio broadcast at 6{{nbsp}}am on 7 July 1988 and subsequently. The documents, relating to the prosecution of South West Water, alleged that this "was not the advice given to the public on the 6th, 7th, 8th, or indeed on the 12th," and added that the prosecution would say that the authority "misled Mr Healey (the head of the drinking water division at the Department of Environment)... There is evidence that a deliberate decision was made to conceal the truth from the public."&lt;ref name="bnet"&gt;Western Morning News, Was there a Camelford cover-up?, 14 December 2007. [http://western-morning-news.vlex.co.uk/vid/was-there-camelford-cover-up-77051283 Available over the Internet] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130505152742/http://western-morning-news.vlex.co.uk/vid/was-there-camelford-cover-up-77051283 |date=5 May 2013 }} by subscription&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler said "I can't think of any comparable accident or mistake anywhere in Britain, particularly one involving what was a government agency, where there was no attempt to investigate what went wrong and why."&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice" /&gt;

In 2001 Environment Minister Michael Meacher claimed that the Government feared what an unrestricted inquiry might find, and that "There was then a great deal of shenanigans about the terms of reference and fighting at all levels in order to limit the ambit of the committee to get the result they wanted. This inquiry was always potentially hugely damaging and hugely worrying to the establishment in terms of the way they handled the incident and clearly there are elements that want to shut it down." No named individuals were ever prosecuted.
The national water industry was sold, under the Conservative government, for £3.59 billion, with the sale of South West Water Authority raising around £300 million.&lt;ref name=bnet /&gt;

'''Clinical Senates''' were established by the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].

There are 12 Clinical Senates across England. As of March 2014 it was reported that by the end of 2013 two had not met at all, three had met only once, and three met twice. Two clinical senates had met three times by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinical senates have only made three recommendations|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/commissioning/exclusive-clinical-senates-have-only-made-three-recommendations/5068726.article#.Uz8mhFen-U4|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Nicholson (civil servant)|Sir David Nicholson]], Chief Executive of [[NHS England]] in his retirement interview was most critical of clinical senates, which he rated just four out of 10. “I don’t quite see the benefits coming through at the moment,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicholson rates NHS England 'five out of 10'|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/briefings/joint-working/health/nicholson-rates-nhs-england-five-out-of-10/5069616.article?blocktitle=Latest-Local-Government-News&amp;contentID=2249|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Local Government Chronicle|date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6116">A '''clinical prediction rule''' is a type of medical research study in which researchers try to identify the best combination of [[medical sign]], [[symptoms]], and other findings in predicting the probability of a specific disease or outcome.&lt;ref name="pmid10872017"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGinn TG, Guyatt GH, Wyer PC, Naylor CD, Stiell IG, Richardson WS |title=Users' guides to the medical literature: XXII: how to use articles about clinical decision rules. Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group |journal=JAMA |volume=284 |issue=1 |pages=79–84 |year=2000 |pmid=10872017 |doi=10.1001/jama.284.1.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians have difficulty in estimated risks of diseases; frequently erring towards overestimation,&lt;ref name="pmid8554250"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedmann PD, Brett AS, Mayo-Smith MF |title=Differences in generalists' and cardiologists' perceptions of cardiovascular risk and the outcomes of preventive therapy in cardiovascular disease |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=124 |issue=4 |pages=414–21 |year=1996 |pmid=8554250 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-124-4-199602150-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps due to cognitive biases such as [[base rate fallacy]] in which the risk of an adverse outcome is exaggerated.

==Methods==
In a prediction rule study, investigators identify a consecutive group of patients who are suspected of having a specific disease or outcome. The investigators then compare the value of clinical findings available to the physician versus the results of more intensive testing or the results of delayed clinical follow up. It may involve, among other things, estimation of the [[clinical utility of diagnostic tests]].

A survey of methods concluded "the majority of prediction studies in high impact journals do not follow current methodological recommendations, limiting their reliability and applicability",&lt;ref name="pmid22629234"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Bouwmeester W, Zuithoff NP, Mallett S, Geerlings MI, Vergouwe Y, Steyerberg EW| title=Reporting and methods in clinical prediction research: a systematic review. | journal=PLoS Med | year= 2012 | volume= 9 | issue= 5 | pages= e1001221 | pmid=22629234 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001221 | pmc= 3358324|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirming earlier findings from the diabetic literature&lt;ref name="pmid21902820"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Collins GS, Mallett S, Omar O, Yu LM| title=Developing risk prediction models for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of methodology and reporting. | journal=BMC Med | year= 2011 | volume= 9 | pages= 103 | pmid=21902820 | doi=10.1186/1741-7015-9-103 | pmc= 3180398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on health outcomes==
Few prediction rules have had the consequences of their usage by physicians  quantified.&lt;ref name="pmid16461965"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reilly BM, Evans AT |title=Translating clinical research into clinical practice: impact of using prediction rules to make decisions |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=144 |issue=3 |pages=201–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16461965 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-144-3-200602070-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When studied, the impact of providing the information alone (for example, providing the calculated probability of disease) has been negative.&lt;ref name="pmid7856992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee TH, Pearson SD, Johnson PA |title=Failure of information as an intervention to modify clinical management. A time-series trial in patients with acute chest pain |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=434–7 |year=1995 |pmid=7856992 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-122-6-199503150-00006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7898300"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poses RM, Cebul RD, Wigton RS |title=You can lead a horse to water--improving physicians' knowledge of probabilities may not affect their decisions |journal=Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=65–75 |year=1995 |pmid=7898300 |doi=10.1177/0272989X9501500110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the prediction rule is implemented as part of a critical pathway, so that a hospital or clinic has procedures and policies established for how to manage patients identified as high or low risk of disease, the prediction rule has more impact on clinical outcomes.&lt;ref name="pmid10683053"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marrie TJ, Lau CY, Wheeler SL, Wong CJ, Vandervoort MK, Feagan BG |title=A controlled trial of a critical pathway for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.

The more intensively the prediction rule is implemented the more benefit will occur.&lt;ref name="pmid16365469"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yealy DM, Auble TE, Stone RA |title=Effect of increasing the intensity of implementing pneumonia guidelines: a randomized, controlled trial |journal=Ann.

In the '''[[United Kingdom]], [[counselling]]''' is not under statutory regulation, and is overseen and supported by several organisations, none of which are officially recognised by the government.

==National regulation==
In 2007 the [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC), which is independent of any professional body, released a [[white paper]], ''Trust Assurance and Safety – The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century'', which said that the Government intended to introduce statutory regulation for [[psychotherapist]]s and counsellors.

The HPC set up a working group of stakeholders, known as a Professional Liaison Group, to consider and make recommendations to the HPC about how psychotherapists and counsellors might be regulated, in light of the statements made in the white paper. The HPC held a public consultation on the PLG recommendations, which ran for three months in 2009. Following the consultation, the PLG was reconvened and had its last meeting on 2 February 2011.

In February 2011, the Government published a [[command paper]], ''Enabling Excellence'', which set out the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]]'s policy on professional regulation. The paper outlined a system of what it called "assured voluntary registration" and said that in the future statutory regulation will only be considered where there is a "compelling case", and where "voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage this risk".&lt;ref name=psyandcou&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/aspirantgroups/psychotherapistscounsellors/|title=Psychotherapists and Counsellors|publisher=[[Health and Care Professions Council]]|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, the HPC's Chief Executive Marc Seale wrote to [[Anne Milton]] MP, then [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for Public Health, seeking clarification of the coalition government's policy on the statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors.

At its meeting on 31 March 2011 the Council discussed the response received from Anne Milton MP. The letter said: "...it is not currently our intention to proceed with statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors".&lt;ref name=psyandcou/&gt;

==Counselling organisations==
{{Primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}

;The British Association For Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)
The largest UK counselling organisation is the [[British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy]] (BACP). It grew from the Standing Conference for the Advancement of Counselling, a grouping of organisations inaugurated in 1970 at the instigation of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Membership was extended to include individuals when in 1977, with the aid of a grant from the Home Office Voluntary Service Unit, the British Association for Counselling was founded. In 1978 the headquarters was moved from London to Rugby courtesy of the National Marriage Guidance Council which provided free accommodation to help the association establish itself.

In September 2000, the Association recognised that it no longer represented just counselling, but also psychotherapy. It changed its name to the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). BACP is now the largest and broadest body within the sector with approximately 26,000 individual members. BACP participates in the development of counselling and psychotherapy at an international level.

BACP is recognised by most health providers and claims a membership of several thousand.

;The Survivors Trust

According to the introduction on their main website [[The Survivors Trust]] is a national umbrella agency for over 125 specialist voluntary sector agencies throughout the UK and Ireland providing a range of counselling, therapeutic and support services working with women, men and children who are victims/survivors of [[rape]], [[sexual violence]] and [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesurvivorstrust.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation aims to offer a national collective voice to support and empower survivor groups, to educate and inform acknowledgment of and response to sexual abuse on a local and national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Home Office website: ''Guide to Partnerships on tackling sexual violence'' |url=http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/dv/dv13.pdf|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The National Counselling Society
The National Counselling Society (NCS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Counselling Society website|url=http://www.nationalcounsellingsociety.org|website=www.nationalcounsellingsociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a not-for-profit membership organisation, founded by a group of counsellors, [[psychotherapists]], [[psychologists]] and [[hypnotherapists]] in 1999. The aim of the NCS is to promote and support the practice of counselling, and does so by offering a range of services to members, including a comprehensive training programme. The NCS also benefits the patients of counsellors by ensuring that the counsellors in their organisation follow their stringent code of ethics; facing expulsion if they deviate or break any of their established codes of conduct and practice.

;COSCA (Counselling &amp; Psychotherapy in Scotland)

[[COSCA]] is a professional body for counselling and psychotherapy in [[Scotland]], which seeks to advance all forms of counselling and psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills.

According to the organisations website, COSCA’s aims are to increase accessibility to counselling and psychotherapy, develop ethically-based professional standards and quality assurance for counselling, psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills, increase access to training and information on counselling, psychotherapy and counselling skills, deliver a range of services that meet the needs of the counselling and psychotherapy field, provide opportunities for sharing knowledge, experience and resources for the advancement of counselling, psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosca.org.uk/about.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127201348/http://www.cosca.org.uk/about.php |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Counselling Society

[[The Counselling Society]] is one of a number of UK counselling professional organisations. According to the introduction on their website in 2007, the Counselling Society launched a campaign by contacting every UK MP, Peer and other national stakeholder via Blake’s Parliamentary Yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.counsellingsociety.com/guests/about_us/index.htm{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed a criminal offence of “abuse by a healthcare professional” which would include counsellors as a matter of public safety. This would give courts powers to ban abusive counsellors from practising.

;The Human Givens Institute

According to their main page, the [[Human Givens Institute]] (HGI) is a membership organisation and resource open to anyone wishing to support the new school of psychology known as the [[Human Givens]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hgi.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct application of DI requires thorough understanding of the yield response to water (crop sensitivity to drought stress) and of the economic impact of reductions in harvest.&lt;ref&gt;English, M., (1990). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(1990)116:3(399) Deficit Irrigation. I: Analytical Framework.] ''J. Irrig. Drain. E.-ASCE'' 116, 399-412.&lt;/ref&gt; In regions where [[water resources]] are restrictive it can be more profitable for a farmer to maximize [[#Crop water productivity|crop water productivity]] instead of maximizing the harvest per unit land.&lt;ref&gt;Fereres, E., Soriano, M.A., (2007).[http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/58/2/147 Deficit irrigation for reducing agricultural water use] ''J. Exp. Bot. 58, 147-158''&lt;/ref&gt; The saved water can be used for other purposes or to irrigate extra units of land.&lt;ref&gt;Kipkorir, E.C., Raes, D., Labadie, J., (2001). Optimal allocation of short-term irrigation supply. ''Irrig. Drain. Syst.'' 15, 247-267.&lt;/ref&gt;
DI is sometimes referred to as incomplete supplemental irrigation or regulated DI.

== Definition ==

Deficit irrigation (DI) has been reviewed and defined as follows:

&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Geerts, S., Raes, D., (2009). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.009 Deficit irrigation as an on-farm strategy to maximize crop water productivity in dry areas.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 96, 1275-1284&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Deficit irrigation is an [[Process optimization|optimization]] strategy in which irrigation is applied during drought-sensitive growth stages of a crop. Outside these periods, irrigation is limited or even unnecessary if rainfall provides a minimum supply of water. Water restriction is limited to drought-tolerant [[phenology|phenological]] stages, often the vegetative stages and the late ripening period. Total irrigation application is therefore not proportional to irrigation requirements throughout the crop cycle. While this inevitably results in plant [[drought]] stress and consequently in production loss, DI maximizes irrigation water productivity, which is the main limiting factor (English, 1990). In other words, DI aims at stabilizing yields and at obtaining maximum [[#Crop water productivity|crop water productivity]] rather than maximum yields (Zhang and Oweis, 1999)."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Crop water productivity==
Crop water productivity (WP) or water use efficiency (WUE)&lt;ref&gt;Kijne, J.W., Barker, R., Molden, D., (2003). Improving water productivity in agriculture: editor's overview. In: Kijne, J.W., Barker, R.M.D. (eds.), [http://www.cabi.org/bk_BookDisplay.asp?SubjectArea=&amp;Subject=&amp;PID=1626 ''Water productivity in agriculture: limits and opportunities for improvement.] '' International Water Management Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka, p. xi-xix.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in kg/m³ is an [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] term, expressing the amount of marketable product (e.g. kilograms of grain) in relation to the amount of input needed to produce that output (cubic meters of water). The water used for crop production is referred to as crop [[evapotranspiration]]. This is a combination of water lost by [[evaporation]] from the soil surface and [[transpiration]] by the plant, occurring simultaneously. Except by [[#Modeling|modeling]], distinguishing between the two processes is difficult. Representative values of WUE for cereals at field level, expressed with evapotranspiration in the denominator, can vary between 0.10 and 4&amp;nbsp;kg/m3.&lt;ref&gt;Zwart, S.J., Bastiaanssen, W.G.M., (2004). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2004.04.007 Review of measured crop water productivity values for irrigated wheat, rice, cotton and maize.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 69, 115-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiences with deficit irrigation==
For certain crops, experiments confirm that DI can increase water use efficiency without severe yield reductions. For example for winter wheat in Turkey, planned DI increased yields by 65% as compared to winter wheat under rainfed cultivation, and had double the water use efficiency as compared to rainfed and fully irrigated winter wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Ilbeyi, A., Ustun, H., Oweis, T., Pala, M., Benli, B., (2006). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2005.08.005 Wheat water productivity and yield in a cool highland environment: Effect of early sowing with supplemental irrigation.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 82, 399-410.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar positive results have been described for cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Raes, D., Geerts, S., Vandersypen, K., (2008). More Food, Less Water. In: Raymaekers, B. (ed.), ''Lectures for the XXIst century. '' Leuven University Press, Leuven, Belgium, p. 81-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments in Turkey and India indicated that the irrigation water use for cotton could be reduced to up to 60 percent of the total crop water requirement with limited yield losses. In this way, high water productivity and a better nutrient-water balance was obtained.

Certain [[Underutilized crops|Underutilized]] and [[horticultural]] crops also respond favorably to DI, such as tested at experimental and farmer level for the crop [[quinoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Geerts, S., Raes, D., Garcia, M., Vacher, J., Mamani, R., Mendoza, J., Huanca, R., Morales, B., Miranda, R., Cusicanqui, J., Taboada, C., (2008). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2007.11.008 Introducing deficit irrigation to stabilize yields of quinoa (''Chenopodium quinoa'' Willd. ').] ''Eur. J. Agron. '' 28, 427-436.&lt;/ref&gt; Yields could be stabilized at around 1.6 tons per hectare by supplementing irrigation water if rainwater was lacking during the plant establishment and reproductive stages. Applying irrigation water throughout the whole season (full irrigation) reduced the water productivity. Also in [[viticulture]] and fruit tree cultivation, DI is practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Spreer, W., Ongprasert, S., Hegele, M., Wünnsche, J. N., Müller, J. (2009). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2008.09.020  Yield and fruit development in mango (''Mangifera indica'' L. cv. Chok Anan) under different irrigation regimes.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 96, 574-584.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists affiliated with the [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS) of the [[USDA]] found that conserving water by forcing drought (or deficit irrigation) on peanut plants early in the growing season has shown to cause early maturation of the plant yet still maintain sufficient yield of the crop. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100114.htm]  Inducing drought through deficit irrigation earlier in the season caused the peanut plants to physiologically "learn" how to adapt to a stressful drought environment, making the plants better able to cope with drought that commonly occurs later in the growing season.  Deficit irrigation is beneficial for the farmers because it reduces the cost of water and prevents a loss of crop yield (for certain crops) later on in the growing season due to drought.  In addition to these findings, ARS scientists suggest that deficit irrigation accompanied with [[conservation tillage]] would greatly reduce the peanut crop water requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For other crops, the application of deficit irrigation will result in a lower water use efficiency and yield. This is the case when crops are sensitive to drought stress throughout the complete season, such as [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;Pandey, R.K., Maranville, J.W., Admou, A., (2000). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(00)00073-1  Deficit irrigation and nitrogen effects on maize in a Sahelian environment. I. Grain yield and yield components.] ''Agric. Water Manage.'' 46, 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from university research groups and farmers associations, international organizations such as [[FAO]], [[ICARDA]], [[IWMI]] and the [[CGIAR]] Challenge Program on Water and Food are studying DI.

==Reasons for increased water productivity under deficit irrigation==
If crops have certain phenological phases in which they are tolerant to water stress, DI can increase the ratio of yield over crop water consumption ([[evapotranspiration]])&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; by either reducing the water loss by unproductive [[evaporation]], and/or by
increasing the proportion of marketable yield to the totally produced biomass (harvest index), and/or by increasing the proportion of total [[biomass]] production to [[transpiration]] due to hardening of the crop - although this effect is very limited due to the conservative relation between biomass production and crop transpiration,&lt;ref&gt;Steduto, P., Hsiao, T. C., Fereres, E., (2007) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-007-0064-1 On the conservative behavior of biomass water productivity.] ''Irrig. Sci. '' 25, 189-207.&lt;/ref&gt; - and/or due to adequate [[fertilizer]] application&lt;ref&gt;Steduto, P., Albrizio, R., (2005). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2005.04.003 Resource use efficiency of field-grown sunflower, sorghum, wheat and chickpea. II. Water use efficiency and comparison with radiation use efficiency.] ''Agric. Forest Meteorol. '' 130, 269-281.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or by avoiding bad agronomic conditions during crop growth, such as water logging in the root zone, [[pest (organism)|pests]] and [[diseases]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, L.S., Oweis, T., Zairi, A., (2002). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(02)00075-6 Irrigation management under water scarcity.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 57, 175-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The correct application of DI for a certain crop:
* maximizes the productivity of water, generally with adequate harvest quality;
* allows economic planning and stable income due to a stabilization of the harvest in comparison with rainfed cultivation;
* decreases the risk of certain diseases linked to high humidity (e.g. [[fungi]]) in comparison with full irrigation;
* reduces nutrient loss by [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of the root zone, which results in better [[groundwater]] quality&lt;ref&gt;Ünlü, M., Kanber, R., Senyigit, U., Onaran, H., Diker, K., (2006). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2005.02.004 Trickle and sprinkler irrigation of potato (''Solanum tuberosum'' L.) in the middle Anatolian region in Turkey.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 79, 43-71.&lt;/ref&gt; and lower [[fertilizer]] needs as for cultivation under full irrigation;&lt;ref&gt;Pandey, R.K., Maranville, J.W., Chetima, M.M., (2000). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(00)00074-3 Deficit irrigation and nitrogen effects on maize in a Sahelian environment.] II. Shoot growth, nitrogen uptake and water extraction. ''Agric. Water Manage'' 46, 15-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* improves control over the sowing date and length of the growing period&lt;ref&gt;Geerts, S., Raes, D., Garcia, M., Mendoza, J., Huanca, R., (2008). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2008.04.008 Indicators to quantify the flexible phenology of quinoa (''Chenopodium quinoa Willd. '') in response to drought stress.] ''Field Crop. Res.'' 108, 150-156.&lt;/ref&gt; independent from the onset of the rainy season and therefore improves agricultural planning.

==Constraints==
A number of constraints apply to deficit irrigation:
* Exact knowledge of the crop response to water stress is imperative.&lt;ref&gt;Hsiao, T.C., (1973). Plant Responses to Water Stress. ''Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. '' 24, 519-570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirda, C., (2002). Deficit irrigation scheduling based on plant growth stages showing water stress tolerance. In: Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (ed.), [http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y3655E/y3655e00.htm ''Deficit irrigation practices'']. Rome, Italy, p. 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There should be sufficient flexibility in access to water during periods of high demand (drought sensitive stages of a crop).&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H., (2003). Improving water productivity through deficit irrigation: examples from Syria, the North China Plain and Oregon, USA. In: Kijne, J.W., Barker, R., Molden, D. (eds.), [http://www.cabi.org/bk_BookDisplay.asp?SubjectArea=&amp;Subject=&amp;PID=1626 ''Water productivity in agriculture: limits and opportunities for improvement.''] International Water Management Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka, p. 301-309.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A minimum quantity of water should be guaranteed for the crop, below which DI has no significant beneficial effect.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, H., Oweis, T., (1999). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(98)00069-9 Water-yield relations and optimal irrigation scheduling of wheat in the Mediterranean region.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 38, 195-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kang, S., Zhang, L., Liang, Y., Hu, X., Cai, H., Gu, B., (2002). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(01)00180-9 Effects of limited irrigation on yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in the Loess Plateau of China.] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 55, 203-216.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An individual farmer should consider the benefit for the total water users community (extra land can be irrigated with the saved water), when he faces a below-maximum yield;
* Because irrigation is applied more efficiently, the risk for [[soil salinization]] is higher under DI as compared to full irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;Geerts, S., Raes, D., Garcia, M., Condori, O., Mamani, J., Miranda, R., Cusicanqui, J., Taboada, C., Vacher, J., (2008). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2008.02.012 Could deficit irrigation be a sustainable practice for quinoa (''Chenopodium quinoa'' Willd.) in the Southern Bolivian Altiplano?] ''Agric. Water Manage'' 95, 909-917.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling==
Field experimentation is necessary for correct application of DI for a particular crop in a particular region. In addition, simulation of the soil [[water balance]] and related crop growth (crop water productivity modeling) can be a valuable [[decision support]] tool.&lt;ref&gt;Raes, D., Steduto, P., Hsiao, T. C., Fereres, E. (2009) [https://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2008.0140s AquaCrop--The FAO Crop Model to Simulate Yield Response to Water: II. Main Algorithms and Software Description.] ''Agron. J. '' 101, 438-447.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steduto, P, Hsiao, T. C., Raes, D., Fereres, E. (2009). [https://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2008.0139s AquaCrop--The FAO Crop Model to Simulate Yield Response to Water: I. Concepts and Underlying Principles.] ''Agron. J. '' 101, 426-437.&lt;/ref&gt; By conjunctively simulating the effects of different influencing factors ([[climate]], [[soil]], management, crop characteristics) on crop production, models allow to (1) better understand the mechanism behind improved water use efficiency, to (2) schedule the necessary irrigation applications during the [[drought]] sensitive crop growth stages, considering the possible variability in climate, to (3) test DI strategies of specific crops in new regions, and to (4) investigate the effects of future climate scenarios or scenarios of altered management practices on crop production.

The [[Tasmania]]n '''Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment''' (DPIPWE) is the [[government department]] of the [[Government of Tasmania|Tasmanian Government]] responsible for supporting primary industry development, the protection of Tasmania's natural environment, effective land and water management and the protection of Tasmania's relative disease and pest free status. DPIPWE's responsibilities also include maintaining the security of land tenure, administration of much of the [[states and territories of Australia|state]]'s Crown lands and delivery of government services through Service Tasmania. 

The department is led by its [[departmental secretary]], John Whittington, who reports both the [[Minister for Primary Industries and Water]], currently [[Jeremy Rockliff]], and the [[Minister for Environment, Parks and Heritage]], currently [[Matthew Groom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/about-the-department/structure-of-dpipwe|title=Structure of DPIPWE|work=Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment|publisher=[[Government of Tasmania]]|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and structure==
The department was known as the Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment from 1998 until April 2002, when its planning responsibilities were transferred to the [[Department of Justice (Tasmania)|Department of Justice]] and its environment responsibilities handed to a newly constituted [[Department of Tourism, Arts and the Environment]].

Between April 2002 and 30 June 2009 it was known as the Department of Primary Industries and Water.  On 1 July 2009 it was amalgamated with the Environment, Parks and Heritage divisions of the [[Department of Environment, Parks, Heritage and the Arts]] to form the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment.  This returned the DPIPWE to a similar size and structure as to what it was between 1998 and 2002. In 1996 the department entered into a joint venture agreement with the University of Tasmania to form the [[Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research]] (TIAR). Between 2005 and 2009 all DPIPWE's agricultural research, development and extension staff and facilities were transferred to TIAR.

The '''Disi Water Conveyance Project''' is a [[water supply]] project in [[Jordan]]. It is designed to pump {{convert|100,000,000|m3|impgal|lk=on}} of [[water]] per year from the Disi [[aquifer]],&lt;ref name="ieee "/&gt; which lies beneath the desert in southern [[Jordan]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]].

==Background==
[[File:Aqaba3.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Disi aquifer currently supplies [[Aqaba]] with 15 million cubic meters of water per year.]]
The water in the Disi aquifer gathered 30,000 years ago during the [[Pleistocene era]].  It is {{convert|320|km|mi}} long and located {{convert|500|m|ft}} below ground inside of porous [[sandstone]].&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ce.utexas.edu/prof/mckinney/ce397/Topics/Groundwater/Groundwater_Disi(2010).pdf |title=Disi Aquifer: Jordan and Saudi Arabia |last=Allen |first=John |journal=Transboundary Water Resource |date=May 2010 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aquifer is classified as a [[fossil water|fossil aquifer]], meaning that the water is not [[Groundwater recharge|replenished]] if it is removed. In fact, the aquifer has a recharge rate of {{convert|50,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} of water per year. This recharge is dwarfed, however, by the current extraction rate of {{convert|90,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} for agricultural and domestic needs, including {{convert|15,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} of water that is supplied to [[Aqaba, Jordan]].&lt;ref name=boell&gt;Page 68: {{cite journal |last=Wardam |first=Batir |title=More politics then water: Water rights in Jordan |journal=Global Issue Papers |date=September 2004 |issue=11 |url=http://www.boell.de/downloads/internationalepolitik/GIP11_Jordan_Batir_Wardam.pdf |accessdate=22 February 2011 |publisher=Heinrich&amp;nbsp;Böll Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718191500/http://www.boell.de/downloads/internationalepolitik/GIP11_Jordan_Batir_Wardam.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current extraction rate of {{convert|90,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}}, coupled with the future extraction rate of {{convert|100,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} for the project,&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; is expected to produce a total extraction rate of {{convert|190,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}}.  At that rate, the water in the aquifer will last a minimum of 50 years, according to the Disi Water Company.&lt;ref name="zawya"&gt;{{cite news|last=Namrouqa |first=Hana |title=After Disi setbacks, GAMA playing 'catch up' |url=http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidZAWYA20110214044445/After%20Disi%20setbacks,%20GAMA%20playing%20'catch%20up |accessdate=23 February 2011 |newspaper=[[The Jordan Times]] |date=14 Feb 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411011225/http://www.zawya.com/story/ZAWYA20110214044445/ |archivedate=April 11, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small portion of the Disi aquifer lies beneath [[Jordan]], while the majority lies beneath [[Saudi Arabia]].  Saudi Arabia also extracts water from the aquifer (called the Saq aquifer in Saudi Arabia).&lt;ref name="Natgeo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100505-fossil-water-radioactive-science-environment/ |title=Underground "Fossil Water" Running Out |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |last=Handwerk |first=Brian |date=6 May 2010 |newspaper=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aquifer has created controversy between Saudi Arabia and Jordan, with each country demanding the other to use less of the shared water.  There is no formal agreement between the countries regarding the water and the Disi Water Conveyance Project is being constructed without Saudi consultation or involvement.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

[[Non-revenue water]] is a serious problem in Amman.  Currently, 40% of water in Amman is lost as non-revenue water.  The city rations water, with individual residents averaging 36 hours of water access weekly.  If the non-revenue water problem remains, it is possible that a large portion of the water provided by the Disi Water Conveyance project will also be lost as it is piped through Amman.&lt;ref name="gwi"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/10/6/general/amman-looks-to-boost-supply-and-plug-the-leaks.html |title=Amman looks to boost supply and plug the leaks |journal=Global Water Intelligence |date=June 2009 |volume=10 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Disi Water Conveyance project was first proposed in the 1990s, but was initially regarded as too expensive. A feasibility study was completed in 1996.&lt;ref name=Sweco&gt;{{cite web |title=Water and wastewater projects in Jordan |url=http://www.swecogroup.com/en/Sweco-group/Solutions/Water-and-environment/Water-and-Wastewater/Water-and-wastewater-projects-in-Jordan1/ |publisher=Sweco |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But it was not until 2007 that the Jordanian Government was able to contract a firm to begin construction.&lt;ref name=executive&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan - Water from a desert well |url=http://www.executive-magazine.com/getarticle.php?article=12040 |accessdate=6 April 2011 |newspaper=Executive |date=July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719161316/http://www.executive-magazine.com/getarticle.php?article=12040 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Amman.jpg|thumb|The water will be used to meet growing demand from Jordan's capital, [[Amman]].]]
The project proposed by the Jordanian government will pump {{convert|100,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} of water per year from 55 [[Water well|wells]] in the aquifer.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt;&lt;ref name=zawya/&gt;&lt;ref name=jt&gt;{{cite news |last=Namrouqa |first=Hana |title=Disi project construction in full force |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/index.php?news=29050 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |newspaper=The Jordan Times |date=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a total of 64 wells will be drilled, the extra wells to be used as [[piezometers]] to measure the elevation of the water.&lt;ref name=zawya/&gt; Nine of the 55 water producing wells will be used in emergencies only.  The wells producing water will be drilled {{convert|600|-|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep while the piezometers will be drilled to a depth of {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=zawya/&gt; The plan is to pump the piezometer wells for 25 years, according to the project leader.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt;

After being pumped from the wells, water will then be transported to [[Amman]], via a {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=on}}  pipeline, passing through a pumping station, then flowing by gravity and being pumped up again. The reservoirs near Amman are only {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} higher than the surface area where the pumping field is located. Nevertheless, the total elevation differential over which water needs to be lifted by both pumping stations is about {{convert|800|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccjo.com/Projects/Environment/DISIMUDAWWARATOAMMANWATERCONVEYANCESYSTEM/tabid/559/Default.aspx |title=Disi-Mudawwara Amman Water Conveyance System - Jordan |accessdate=April 5, 2011 |publisher=Consolidated Consultants}}&lt;/ref&gt; To pump the water through the proposed pipeline will require 4 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter of water.  The entire project would require approximately 4 percent of Jordan's current electrical production. The project is expected to be completed by January 2017 and to run for 25 years or until the [[Two Seas Canal]] is built.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt;

The {{convert|100,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} of water will be divided between the Abu Alanda reservoir and the Dabouq reservoir.  Approximately {{convert|40,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} of water will be sent to the Abu Alanda reservoir where it will be diluted with water from the Zara Ma’en desalination plant as well as water from Wala.  The remaining {{convert|60,000,000|m3|impgal|abbr=on}} of water will be sent to the Dabouq reservoir where it will be diluted with water from the Zai Treatment Plant as well as water from Wala.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt; It is estimated that the cost of one cubic meter of water from the project will be 0.74 [[Jordanian dinar|JOD]] (US$1.05).&lt;ref name =jt/&gt;

==Construction==
In June 2009, the Turkish firm [[GAMA Endustri|GAMA]] began construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Disi project to finish ahead of schedule |last=Namrouqa |first=Hana |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/index.php?news=18393&lt;!-- |url2=http://www.zawya.com/marketing.cfm?zp&amp;p=/Story.cfm/sidZAWYA20090714032649--&gt; |accessdate=7 April 2011 |newspaper=The Jordan Times |date=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2011, eight piezometer wells and two water producing wells have been completed.

[[File:Beduinphoto.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[Bedouin]] man in Southern Jordan]]

Construction was delayed by disgruntled members of a [[Bedouin|Bedouin tribe]] living in the area, who allegedly intimidated workers by shooting in the air and at construction equipment. All work was stopped for two weeks after two employees were killed in January 2011 &amp;mdash; allegedly murdered by a member of the Bedouin tribe.&lt;ref name=jt2&gt;{{cite news |last=Namrouqa |first=Hana |title=Safety concerns 'hindering progress' in Disi water project |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=34480 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |newspaper=[[The Jordan Times]] |date=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jt5"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=2229462861&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=28955&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD |title=Government warns rioters in southern Jordanian town |accessdate=March 16, 2011 |date=5 January 2011 |newspaper=The Jordan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tribe had been upset because GAMA did not rent its water tankers, according to Adnan Zu'b, Assistant Secretary Genera at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. To satisfy the tribe, GAMA then announced plans to rent tankers from the tribe.&lt;ref name=jt2/&gt; However, near the site of the killings, the town of [[Ma'an]] had protests against the government's failure to punish the killers.&lt;ref name=jt5/&gt; During October and November, 2011 the construction works have been suspended at southern part of the project from Hasa to [[Mudawwara]] due to security problems created by tribes, therefore there is delay in this part which will affect the completion date of the project.

==Structure and funding==
The project is funded on a [[build-operate-transfer]] concession contract between the Jordanian government and the Disi Water Company (Diwaco), a subsidiary of the Turkish construction company [[GAMA Enerji|GAMA Energy]]. GAMA Energy is a joint venture between the Turkish GAMA Holding and the US firm [[General Electric]] Energy Financial Services.&lt;ref&gt;General Electric: [http://www.genewscenter.com/content/detailEmail.aspx?ReleaseID=7280&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;changeCurrentLocale=5 GAMA, GE To Bring Water to Northern Jordan Through Investment In US$1 Billion Pipeline], 8 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Diwaco is responsible to build the project over a 4-year period and to operate it for another 25 years. At the end of the concession period the ownership will transfer to the Jordanian government.&lt;ref name=ume&gt;{{cite news |last=Attwood |first=Edward |title=US $1bn water project to bring hope to Jordan |url=http://www.utilities-me.com/article-56-us_1bn_water_project_to_bring_hope_to_jordan/ |accessdate=23 February 2011 |newspaper=Utilities Middle East |date=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diwaco will retain any profits and will bear the risk of losing its equity. Construction is undertaken by GAMA Power Systems, another subsidiary of GAMA Holding, under a turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contract with Diwaco. Operation will be undertaken by Disi Amman Operation Maintenance LLC, a fully owned subsidiary of the French water company [[Suez Environnement]], under a separate operating contract with Diwaco.&lt;ref name="tradearabia"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tradearabia.com/news/CONS_164108.html |title=$1bn Jordan water project set to start |accessdate=March 18, 2011 |date=8 July 2009 |publisher=TradeArabia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is funded through an equity contribution of about US$200M from Diwaco, a $300M grant and a $100M stand-by facility from the Jordanian government, as well as US$475M in foreign loans to Diwaco.&lt;ref name =jt/&gt;&lt;ref name="jt4"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=22039 |title=Disi project construction work officially begins |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |date=3 December 2009 |newspaper=The Jordan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's total cost is expected to be US$1.1 billion.&lt;ref name =jt/&gt; The U.S. [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] has lent US$250M to Diwaco to support U.S. foreign investment on the basis that General Electric partially owns GAMA Energy.&lt;ref name="opic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opic.gov/node/2319 |title=Disi Water PSC |accessdate=March 17, 2011 |publisher=Overseas Private Investment Corporation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721060643/http://www.opic.gov/node/2319 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state-owned French bank [[PROPARCO]], which is the part of the [[French Development Agency]] (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) each lent about US$100M to Diwaco.

==Radioactivity concerns==
The project became controversial in 2009 when a study performed by Avner Vengosh of [[Duke University]] revealed the Disi water to be highly [[radioactive]].  Water was tested from 37 existing wells in the aquifer, and all but one had concentrations of radioactive [[radium-226]] and [[radium-228]] isotopes that exceeded [[Drinking water#Regulation|international standards for drinking water]].&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt;  Some of the water tested exceeded standards by 2,000%.&lt;ref name=esc/&gt; Drinking water with these isotopes has been linked to [[bone cancer]] and [[leukemia]].&lt;ref name=bg&gt;{{cite news |last=Vinocur |first=Nick |title=Excess radiation found in ancient Jordan wells |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2009/02/26/excess_radiation_found_in_ancient_jordan_wells/ |accessdate=23 February 2011 |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though expensive, the water could be purified of the radioactive isotopes through [[Ion-exchange resin#Water purification|ion-exchange purification]].&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt;

Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity is not a problem because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources. This dilution would presumably halve the radioactivity of the water which, according to Vengosh's data, would not be enough to bring the water up to standards.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt;  The Ministry of Water and Irrigation, however, has declared Vengosh's data to be inaccurate, as his study did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project.  As radiation varies from well to well, it is possible that the data Vengosh collected does not accurately reflect the water sources to be used in the project.&lt;ref name=jt3/&gt;

Although testing at the [[Water well|well sites]] that supply Aqaba reveals high radioactivity, testing performed using water from the tap in Aqaba shows the water to be safe.  There is no confirmed explanation for this phenomenon, although it is hypothesized that the depth of the wells (the ones that supply Aqaba are relatively shallow) may play a role as the radiation varies greatly at shallow depths.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt;
In May, 2011, the President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.&lt;ref name=JT5&gt;{{cite news |last=Numan |first=Abeer |title=Disi water uncontaminated |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/index.php?news=37584 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |newspaper=The Jordan Times |date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This explanation has not been confirmed scientifically,  however.&lt;ref name=JT6&gt;{{cite news |title=More reassurance needed |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/index.php?news=37618 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |newspaper=The Jordan Times |date=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the inauguration of the conveyor in July 2013 Minister of Water and Irrigation Hazim El-Nasser said that after mixing Disi water radiation is less than 0.5 millisievert per year. The worldwide average natural dose of human's exposure to radiation is about 2.5-3 millisievert per year. "Disi water is purer than bottled water and I take full responsibility for what I’m saying,”  the Minister said during a press conference.&lt;ref name=Inauguration&gt;Jordan Times:[http://jordantimes.com/king-inaugurates-disi-water-project King inaugurates Disi water project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719175728/http://jordantimes.com/king-inaugurates-disi-water-project |date=July 19, 2013 }}, 17 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs are walked restrained by a [[Dog collar|collar]] around their neck or by a [[pet harness|harness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annarbor.com/pets/my-mantra-in-raising-and/|title=Commercialism: coming to a pet near you|last=Shaw|first=Lorrie|date=5 May 2010|publisher=AnnArbor.com|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by simply following their guardian by familiarity and verbal control. Commonly, the dog is walked by the guardian, or by another family member, but there are also professional dog walkers.&lt;ref name="lawyer"/&gt;

==Health benefits==
A study by [[Michigan State University]] showed that people who walk their dogs are 34% more likely to meet expected levels of exercise, with a recommended level of 150 minutes of activity such as dog walking per week. Matthew Reeves, the co-author of the study said, "There is no magic bullet in getting people to reach those benchmarks but walking a dog has a measurable impact."&lt;ref name=notjust&gt;{{cite news|title=Walkies Not Just For Dogs|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/234034/Walkies-not-just-for-dogs|newspaper=Daily Express|date=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by the [[University of Western Australia]] has discovered that walking your dog helps build relationships in your community research showed that people in the community would acknowledge and greet other people in the street exchange favors with neighbors which can encourage more exercise in the community giving pets and owners a chance at a healthier life.

==Professional dog walkers==
[[File:Dog walker on skates with six dogs cropped.jpg|thumb|right|This professional dog walker on skates is pulled rapidly down a street by six dogs in [[Summit, New Jersey]].]]
Professional dog walkers, both individuals and businesses, are paid by dog owners to walk their dogs for them.  Some dog walkers will take many dogs for a walk at once, while others will only take a single dog.&lt;ref name="lawyer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Lawyer-wants-to-bring-dog.6272446.jp|title=Lawyer wants to bring dog walkers to heel|last=Smith|first=Mark|date=5 May 2010|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of a walk might vary by breed or owners request ranging from short relief walks to longer walks with a specific amount of time set by the owner.  Also growing in popularity is "dog running". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url=https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a20864740/full-time-dog-runner/| title = Full-time Dog Runner | publisher=runnersworld.com| accessdate=8 June 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Dog runners are professionals who run with dogs, rather than walking with them. In some jurisdictions, dog walking businesses must be licensed and have animal first-aid-trained employees. Professional dog walking services can be obtained locally or through online referral services. Obtaining a position as a professional dog walker has become more difficult, with applicants having to pass rigorous exams and go through extensive training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-a-job-as-a-dog-walker-its-just-like-getting-into-harvard-1507214545|title=Want a Job as a Dog Walker?

In the [[United States]], the first professional dog walker is believed to have been [[Jim Buck]], who in 1960 launched his dog walking service in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=margalit&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/nyregion/jim-buck-made-walking-dogs-a-job-dies-at-81.html?hp&amp;_r=0 | title=Jim Buck, Who Made Walking Dogs a Job, Dies at 81 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=12 July 2013 | accessdate=13 July 2013 | author=Fox, Margalit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15761">{{For|uses of E-Pro|E-Pro (disambiguation)}}
An '''electronic patient-reported outcome''' ('''ePRO''') is a [[patient-reported outcome]] that is collected by electronic methods. ePRO methods are most commonly used in clinical trials, but they are also used elsewhere in health care.  As a function of the regulatory process, a majority of ePRO questionnaires undergo the [[linguistic validation]] process.

==Methods==
The two main methods currently used for ePRO are computers/Smartphones and telephone systems

''Computers'' are most often touch-screen devices, ranging from small hand-helds such as the Palm Pilot, through tablet PCs. The smaller devices are often used as electronic diaries, designed to be used for symptom reporting on a daily basis. Larger devices are generally used in a clinic setting. Computers generally run dedicated ePRO applications - the use of the web for ePRO is not yet widespread. Typically a single question at a time is presented on the screen, with a set of possible response options. The user taps on the appropriate response with finger or stylus, then moves on to the next questions.

''Telephones'' normally use an interactive voice response system ([[IVR]]). The user calls into a dedicated phone line, and hears a spoken script which details the question, and the possible responses. Each response option is given a number, and the user presses the corresponding number key on the phone keypad to record the choice. IVR systems are more often used for diaries, with the patient phoning in e.g. from home, but they can be used in a clinic setting.

There are also a number of custom devices designed specifically for use as ePRO data collection devices.

==Electronic diaries==
Diaries are used when it is desirable to obtain frequent assessments over a period of time, for example when a condition fluctuates in severity. In such cases recall of severity over a period of time is unlikely to be accurate. Research has shown substantial bias in such summary recall, with ratings unduly influenced by how the patient is feeling at the time of making the rating, and by maximum severity rather than average severity during the assessment interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Stone AA, Broderick JE, Shiffman SS, Schwartz JE |title=Understanding recall of weekly pain from a momentary assessment perspective: absolute agreement, between- and within-person consistency, and judged change in weekly pain |journal=Pain|volume=107|issue=1-2 |pages=61–69 |year=2004 |pmid=14715390 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2003.09.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diaries can overcome this problem by recording severity either on a momentary basis ("How bad is your pain right now?") or by recall over short periods ("How bad has your pain been today?"). However, when diary data is collected on paper, it is not known when the ratings are actually made, and there is evidence that compliance may be quite poor. In one study, patients were given an instrumented paper diary that recorded covertly when it was opened. The study showed frequent cases of "back-filling", filling in  a batch of entries some time, often days, after they were due, and even in some cases of "forward filling", completing entries before they were due.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Stone AA, Shiffman S, Schwartz JE, Broderick JE, Hufford MR |title=Patient non-compliance with paper diaries |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=324 |issue=7347 |pages=1193–1194 |date=2002-05-18 |pmid=12016186 |pmc=111114 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7347.1193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic diaries automatically time-stamp all entries, and can be set up to only allow entry within specified time-windows. This improves compliance, and ensures that true compliance can be documented. Documenting compliance is important if ePRO data are to be used to support regulatory applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM193282.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ePRO applications typically achieve compliance rates of over 80%, often over 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Meltzer EO, Kelley N, Hovell MF |title=Randomized, Cross-Over Evaluation of Mobile Phone vs Paper Diary in Subjects with Mild to Moderate Persistent Asthma |journal=Open Respir. Med. J. |volume=2 |pages=72–79 |year=2008 |pmid=19412327 |doi=10.2174/1874306400802010072 |pmc=2606655}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Friedberg F, Sohl SJ |title=Memory for Fatigue in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: The Relation Between Weekly Recall and Momentary Ratings |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=29–33 |year=2008 |pmid=18444018 |doi=10.1007/bf03003071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic diaries also have benefits in that they only allow valid, in-range entries to be made. Devices such as PDAs allow reminders to be given to patients when entries are due. Systems generally transfer data promptly to a central server, allowing tailored feedback to be given to patients. This can also improve compliance. Electronic diaries also eliminate the need for manual editing and entry of data, time-consuming and error-prone processes.

==Site-based==
The other main setting for ePRO is the clinic, with questionnaires completed when patients come in for their scheduled visits. In this supervised situation, compliance is less of an issue. The questionnaires used in site-based ePRO are often longer and more complex than those used in diaries, assessing [[quality of life]] and activities of daily living, for example, in some detail. They more often include branching logic ("if YES continue with the next question, if NO, goto question 34"). Such branching logic can be handled automatically by the ePRO application, and it is often not necessary for the patient even to know that branching is taking place. This makes it easier for the patient to use.

As with electronic diaries, the prevention of out of range or inconsistent entries, and elimination of manual editing and data entry are important features of site-based ePRO. Missing data within a questionnaire can be reduced or eliminated, and this is important as missing data has been identified as a crucial quality issue in questionnaire data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bernhard J, Cella DF, Coates AS, Fallowfield L, Ganz PA, Moinpour CM, Mosconi P, Osoba D, Simes J, Hurny C |title=Missing quality of life data in cancer clinical trials: serious problems and challenges |journal=Statistics in Medicine |volume=17 |issue=5-7 |pages=517–532 |date=1998-03-15 |pmid=9549801 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0258(19980315/15)17:5/7&lt;517::aid-sim799&gt;3.3.co;2-j}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patient acceptability==
From the early years of ePRO there has been concern about whether all patients can cope with computer technology. This is important,as if significant numbers of patients refuse to take part in clinical trials because of dislike of computers then there will be bias in the study population. One of the earliest ePRO studies used a LINC-2 minicomputer to collect patient data. The majority of patients preferred the computer to paper data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Slack WV, Hicks GP, Reed CE, Van Cura LJ |title=A computer-based medical-history system |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=274 |issue=4 |pages=194–198 |date=1966-01-27 |pmid=5902618 |doi=10.1056/NEJM196601272740406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings have been reported from many later studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Crawley JA, Kleinman L, Dominitz J |title=User preferences for computer administration of quality of life instruments |journal=Drug Information Journal |volume=34 |pages=137–144 |year=2000 |doi=10.1177/009286150003400119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Richter JG, Becker A, Koch T, Nixdorf M, Willers R, Monser R, Schacher B, Alten R, Specker C, Schneider M |title=Self-assessments of patients via Tablet PC in routine patient care: comparison with standardised paper questionnaires |journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases |volume=67 |issue=12 |pages=1739–1741 |year=2008 |pmid=18647853 |doi=10.1136/ard.2008.090209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elderly patients, and those not familiar with computers, might be expected to have more problems. But these groups also show high acceptance of ePRO, and again often prefer it to paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Yarnold PR, Stewart MJ, Stille FC, Martin GJ |title=Assessing functional status of elderly adults via microcomputer |journal=Percept.Mot.Skills |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=689–690 |year=1996 |pmid=8724947 |doi=10.2466/pms.1996.82.2.689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Allenby A, Matthews J, Beresford J, McLachlan SA |title=The application of computer touch-screen technology in screening for psychosocial distress in an ambulatory oncology setting |journal=European Journal of Cancer Care |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=245–253 |year=2002 |pmid=12492461 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2354.2002.00310.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Tiplady B, Goodman K, Cummings G, Lyle D, Carrington R, Battersby C, Ralston S |title=Patient Reported Outcomes in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Assessing the equivalence of electronic and paper data collection |journal=The Patient |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=133–143 |year=2010 |doi=10.2165/11535590-000000000-00000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there seems to be no great barrier to recruiting representative patient samples in ePRO studies.

==Validity and equivalence==
Establishing the validity of an ePRO instrument is in principle no different from that for other methods, such as paper. However most of the instruments in current use have been validated in paper form, and we need to ask (1) whether the paper data can be used to establish validity of the electronic version, and (2) whether data from paper and electronic versions can be used interchangeably.

The International Society for Pharmacoeconomomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) has issued guidelines on establishing equivalence between modes of administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Coons SJ, Gwaltney CJ, Hays RD, Lundy JJ, Sloan JA, Revicki DA, Lenderking WR, Cella D, Basch E |title=Recommendations on Evidence Needed to Support Measurement Equivalence between Electronic and Paper-based Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Measures: ISPOR ePRO Good Research Practices Task Force Report |journal=Value in Health |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=419–429 |year=2009 |pmid=19900250 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00470.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach is hierarchical, and depends on the degree of change made during the process of migration from paper to electronic format. Three levels are suggested. At the lowest level, where least change has been made, cognitive interviewing of patients as a check that they construe ePRO and paper in the same way is sufficient. This level includes both trivial changes (touch rather than circle a response choice) as well as changes that are supported by empirical findings in the literature. At the second level, equivalence studies comparing the scores obtained from the two modes should be carried out. At the third level, where most change has occurred, the ePRO instrument must be treated as a new instrument, and complete psychometric validation carried out.

There is a great deal of evidence supporting the general equivalence of paper and ePRO methods. Gwaltney and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gwaltney CJ, Shields AL, Shiffman S |title=Equivalence of Electronic and Paper-and-Pencil Administration of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: A Meta-Analytic Review |journal=Value in Health |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=322–333 |year=2008 |pmid=18380645 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00231.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have reported a meta-analysis in which they included 46 studies evaluating 278 scales. They concluded that there was good agreement between paper and ePRO, and no evidence of systematic bias. This general finding, of course, does not guarantee that any specific migration will lead to equivalence, and each case must be reviewed and documented.

It is not always necessary to validate an ePRO measure against a pre-existing paper version. In some cases an instrument may be developed and validated from the beginning in electronic form.  More commonly, perhaps, new instruments will be developed in parallel for paper and electronic use, as is the case with the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Fries, J. |author2=Cella, D. |author3=Rose, M. |author4=Krishnan, E. |author5=Bruce, B. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Progress in Assessing Physical Function in Arthritis: PROMIS Short Forms and Computerized Adaptive Testing |journal=The Journal of Rheumatology |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=2061–2066 |year=2009 |pmid=19738214 |doi=10.3899/jrheum.090358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standards of validity must be maintained throughout every target language population. In order to ensure that developmental standards are consistent in translated versions of an ePRO instrument, the translated instrument undergoes a process known as [[Linguistic validation]] in which the preliminary translation is adapted to reflect cultural and linguistic differences between diverse target populations. This process also accounts for any formatting errors that may occur in languages using non-Roman fonts.

==In practice==
Several successful regulatory approvals have used ePRO data in recent years, including [[ketorolac]] for [[ocular]] pain, [[eszopiclone]] for [[insomnia]], [[milnacipran]] for [[fibromyalgia]], [[Estradiol (medication)|estradiol]]/[[levonorgestrel]] for [[post-menopausal]] symptoms, and [[ruxolitinib]] for [[myelofibrosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=McCallister E, Usdin S |title=A PROfessional Trial|journal=BioCentury, December 5th 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of estradiol/levonorgestrel, detailed ePRO data on bleeding/spotting from a one-year clinical trial are presented in the patient information leaflet.&lt;ref&gt;http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=10549#nlm34076-0&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as clinical trial use, ePRO methods may be used to support patients in regular care. An example of this is the collection of symptom data from patients undergoing chemotherapy, using handheld diaries. This allows clinic staff to monitor outpatients, and to identify the occurrence of adverse reactions that may require intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Kearney, N. |author2=McCann, L. |author3=Norrie, J. |author4=Taylor, L. |author5=Gray, P. |author6=Gee-Lennon, M. |author7=Sage, M. |author8=Miller, M. |author9=Maguire, R. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Evaluation of a mobile phone-based, advanced symptom management system (ASyMS-¬) in the management of chemotherapy-related toxicity |journal=Supportive Care in Cancer |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=437–444 |date=2009-01-04 |pmid=18953579 |doi=10.1007/s00520-008-0515-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erika Sutter''' (1917-2015) was a Swiss [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] and a medical missionary in [[South Africa]]. She became a lecturer at the International Centre for Eye Health (ICEH) and at the [[Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute|Swiss Tropical Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cartercenter.org/health/trachoma_education/manuals%20and%20technical%20resources/manuals%20full%20media%20to%20link%20p/15%20p.pdf |title=Book |website=cartercenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by her faith, she joined the Swiss Mission in South Africa and worked at the Elim Hospital.

She wrote academic papers and books about her work. She was awarded an honorary doctorate degree by the [[University of Basel]], and the 1984 Woman of the Year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgzGqNhLY1UC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=erika+sutter+south+africa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jp9F6wYVfb&amp;sig=Id7TERqQsESwlaulkM_YWw_rxo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH5r-07JvXAhXETCYKHSloCeEQ6AEIXzAP#v=onepage&amp;q=erika%20sutter%20south%20africa&amp;f=false|title=Women Marching Into the 21st Century: Wathint' Abafazi, Wathint' Imbokodo|date=2000|publisher=HSRC Press|isbn=9780796919663|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Erika Sutter was born in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] on June 14, 1917 to Ernst Theodor Sutter and Meta (née Ris). She had a sister Trudi. Her family had a second home in [[Troistorrents]]. She was homeschooled until third grade. From fourth grade, she enrolled in Basel girls' high school Gymnasium am Kohlenberg&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/upenn-ebooks/reader.action?docID=1986826|title=ProQuest Ebook Central|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1937, Sutter enrolled in [[University of Basel]] and majored in [[botany]] and [[zoology]] along with minors in [[geography]] and [[physics]]. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She continued studying after her undergraduate years and completed a [[doctorate]] in [[plant physiology]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. She worked at the Institute of Botany during her student years.

After considering a [[teacher|teaching]] career, she worked at Swiss pharmaceutical firm [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] in the [[Physiology|animal physiology]] department. In 1948, she worked in the botany department at the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]] in Ultana, where she stayed for two years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Missionary career ==
Sutter first heard about the Swiss Mission in South Africa from her friend Marie-Louise Martin, who was then working as a [[Secondary school|high school]] [[chaplain]] in Basel. She contacted the [[Missionary|missionaries]] there to find out about the mission's work. Her plans were halted after the sudden deaths of her father and sister in 1945. Her interest in working for the Swiss Mission was reignited during her time in [[Sweden]]. Her encounters with missionaries there compelled her to pursue missionary work, and she left for South Africa in mid-April 1952.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Motivations ===
Although raised a devout [[Christian]], Dr. Sutter did not see her commitment to missionary service as a [[religious calling]], nor a means to fulfill her personal ambition. She explains in her [[biography]] that it was “simply her path”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Achievements ===
From 1952 to 1984, Sutter worked at the Elim Hospital as a member of the staff and as an ophthalmologist for around twenty years. During that time, she was responsible for eye services and training of ophthalmic [[Nursing|nurses]] in the [[hospital]]. She worked mostly in the [[Limpopo|Northern Transvaal]] regions and was involved extensively in preventive health care in the community through the Care Groups.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=0145d1d9-003f-4d8d-aacf-2a9b71765c0c@sessionmgr104|title=Swiss Missionaries in South Africa.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; To train to be an ophthalmologist, she returned to Switzerland to study ophthalmology and practice [[Surgery|surgical procedures]] in the Basel Eye Hospital. She returned to the Elim Hospital in 1965 as a certified ophthalmologist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As the only doctor in the eye department, she treated [[trachoma]] and various other eye diseases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, as the eye hospital expanded and more doctors assisted in eye treatments, Sutter was able to direct her focus on achieving other visions.

Sutter had wanted to start a nursing school for eye care since she started working in South Africa, and in 1975, her dream was fulfilled when the South African Nursing Council officially recognized their new curriculum and approved the school. At the school, African nurses could be trained and receive an official [[diploma]] in ophthalmic nursing. That same year, she also established the Rivoni Society for the Blind, a rehabilitation center that offered workshops and training for the visually impaired and the blind. The society also offered a school for blind children where they could read [[Braille]] and learn how to use a [[typewriter]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Care Groups ===
In an effort to reduce cases of [[trachoma]], an eye disease that is easily curable with the application of good hygienic practices, Sutter helped organize Care Groups with Selina Maphorogo, her translator and main motivator of the Care Groups.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.medicusmundi.ch/de/bulletin/mms-bulletin/frauengesundheit/frauenspezifische-gesundheitsarbeit-von-fragestellungen-zu-programmen/community-development-and-women2019s-self-reliance-in-south-africa|title=Community development and women’s self-reliance in South Africa|work=Medicus Mundi Schweiz|access-date=2017-12-12|language=de-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care Groups aimed to mobilize local people, mostly women, to spread awareness to local communities about trachoma and how to prevent it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result of their efforts, the number of active trachoma cases was reduced by 50% within three years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Care Groups have helped spread awareness and address a wide range of problems such as [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[malnutrition]] in the region.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The project quickly multiplied; by 2002, 10,000 women were working in 300 villages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Works  ==
One of Sutter’s most significant publications is ''Hanyane, a Village Struggles for Eye Health,'' an educational book that has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The book goes into detail about effective [[Preventive healthcare|preventive care]] and village development, and documents useful medical notes for ophthalmologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hanyane: A Village Struggles for Eye Health|last=Sutter|first=Erika|publisher=International Centre for Eye Health|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her work ''The Community is my University is'' a compilation of interviews with her and Selina Maphorogo. This book mainly focused on Care Groups and [[development aid]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Recognition ==

* Woman of the Year in 1984.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Honorary doctorate degree from the University of Basel for her work and accomplishments in South Africa in 1995. 
* Trachoma Gold Medal awarded by the French ''Ligue Internationale Contre le Trachome'' (1996).
* Ophthalmological Society of South Africa (2005). [[Mamphela Ramphele]], a South African politician and an activist against [[apartheid]], praised Erika as a “fellow global citizen, [who] not only opened the physical eyes of those she encountered but also their spiritual eyes, to appreciate the power they had within them.” &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Retirement ==
Sutter retired in 1984 at 67 and returned to Basel, Switzerland. In her retirement, she spent most of her time traveling and giving presentations and teaching at the Swiss Tropical Institute in Basel and at the International Centre for Eye Health in England.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Dr. Erika Sutter died in 2015 at age 98.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Water fluoridation''' is the controlled addition of [[fluoride]] to a [[water supply|public water supply]] to reduce [[tooth decay]],&lt;ref name=FRWG&gt;{{vcite journal |title=Recommendations for using fluoride to prevent and control dental caries in the United States |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=50 |issue=RR-14 |pages=1–42 |year=2001 |pmid=11521913 |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm |laysummary=http://cdc.gov/fluoridation/guidelines/tooth_decay.htm |laysource=CDC |laydate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is handled differently '''by country.''' Fluoridated water has fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride.&lt;ref name=FRWG/&gt; Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth it creates low levels of fluoride in [[saliva]], which reduces the rate at which [[tooth enamel]] demineralizes and increases the rate at which it [[Remineralisation of teeth|remineralizes]] in the early stages of cavities.&lt;ref name=Pizzo&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Pizzo G, Piscopo MR, Pizzo I, Giuliana G |title=Community water fluoridation and caries prevention: a critical review |journal=Clin Oral Investig |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=189–93 |year=2007 |pmid=17333303 |doi=10.1007/s00784-007-0111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a fluoridated compound is added to [[drinking water]], a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about ${{inflation|US|0.72|1999|r=2}} per person-year.&lt;ref name=FRWG/&gt;{{inflation-fn|US}} Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits.&lt;ref name=Taricska&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Fluoridation and defluoridation |author=Taricska JR, Wang LK, Hung YT, Li KH |title=Advanced Physicochemical Treatment Processes |editor=Wang LK, Hung YT, Shammas NK, editors |series=Handbook of Environmental Engineering 4 |doi=10.1007/978-1-59745-029-4_9 |isbn=978-1-59745-029-4 |publisher=Humana Press |year=2006 |pages=293–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the [[World Health Organization]] suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride.&lt;ref name=WHO2011&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44584/1/9789241548151_eng.pdf Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, 4th Edition] WHO, 2011. {{ISBN|9789241548151}}.

Countries practicing artificial water fluoridation vary in their recommended fluoride levels according to what health authorities in each have determined to be most effective for its citizens. The US recently reset the recommended optimal level of fluoride in drinking water because of observed increased [[Dental fluorosis|Fluorosis]] levels, likely due to additional fluoride sources like toothpaste and mouthwash which were not present when this level was originally set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/fluoride-levels-us-drinking-water-lowered-splotchy-teeth|title=US lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for first time in over 50 years|first=Associated Press in New|last=York|date=27 April 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC right}}

==Africa==
Of Africa's 1.1 billion people, about 400,000 get artificially-fluoridated water (in Libya, data pre-2003).&lt;ref name="OIMextent0"/&gt;

===Egypt===
Water is fluoridated in [[Egypt]], with no recommended minimum value but with a maximum value of 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

=== Libya ===
Before 2003, 400,000 Libyans were receiving artificially-fluoridated water.&lt;ref name="OIMextent0"/&gt;

=== Nigeria ===
Only a fraction of Nigerians receive water from waterworks, so water fluoridation affects very few people. A 2009 study found that about 21% of water sources naturally contain fluoride to the recommended range of 0.3–0.6 ppm. About 62% have fluoride below this range.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Akpata ES, Danfillo IS, Otoh EC, Mafeni JO |title=Geographical mapping of fluoride levels in drinking water sources in Nigeria |journal=Afr Health Sci |date=2009 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=227–33 |doi= |url=http://ajol.info/index.php/ahs/article/viewFile/52143/40772 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
[[South Africa]]'s Health Department recommends adding fluoridation chemicals to drinking water in some areas. It also advises removal of fluoride from drinking water (defluoridation) where the fluoride content is too high.&lt;ref&gt;ml "Water Fluoridation - The Facts", from South Africa's [http://www.doh.gov.za/department/ Department of Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210149/http://www.doh.gov.za/department/ |date=27 September 2007 }} website.

Legislation around mandatory fluoridation was introduced in 2002, but has been delayed since then pending further research after opposition from water companies, municipalities and the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=125&amp;art_id=vn20030108054021972C918779&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zambia ===
Approximately 947,000 (7% of the population) receives water with naturally occurring fluoride in it.&lt;ref name="extent" /&gt;

=== Zimbabwe ===
Roughly 2,600,000 (21% of the population) receives water with naturally occurring fluoride in it.&lt;ref name="extent" /&gt;

==Asia==

===China===
Fluoridation is banned in China. Naturally high fluoride levels in water are a serious problem in China.&lt;ref name="actionpa.org"&gt;http://www.actionpa.org/fluoride/countries.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, there is no water fluoridation in China.&lt;ref name=FL35&gt;{{citation |title=Fluoridation in China: A Clouded Future |last=Wei |first=Zan-dao |year=2002 |journal=Fluoride |issue=35 No. 1 |pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water fluoridation began in 1965 in the urban area of [[Guangzhou]]. It was interrupted during 1976–1978 due to the shortage of sodium silico-fluoride. It was resumed only in the [[Fangcun, Guangzhou|Fangcun]] district of the city, due to objections, and was halted in 1983. The fluoridation reduced the number of cavities, but increased [[dental fluorosis]]; the fluoride levels could have been set too high, and low-quality equipment led to inconsistent, and often excessive, fluoride concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petersen PE, Kwan S, Zhu L, Zhang BX, Bian JY |title=Effective use of fluorides in the People's Republic of China--a model for WHO Mega Country initiatives |journal=Community Dental Health |volume=25 |issue=4 Suppl 1 |pages=257–67 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19202775 |doi=10.1922/CDH_2475Petersen11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now reverse osmosis plants are widely used. Household and public system reverse osmosis plants are common in the market. Alleppey in Kerala is most affected with over-fluoridated water. Government-installed reverse osmosis plants supply free filtered water. Rotary International Club, Saratoga USA, helped to install 3 RO Plants in rural Alleppey.

{{As of|2014}}, there are 14,132 habitations in 19 States still containing fluoride above the permissible levels in drinking water. [[Rajasthan]] has the highest number of habitations (7,670) with high amount of fluoride in drinking water. [[Telangana]] has 1174, [[Karnataka]] has 1122 and Madhya Pradesh has 1055 habitation. Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh also has such habitations.

The government of India launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis in 2008–2009. In 2013–2014, the programme was brought under the National Rural Health Mission, which has so far covered 111 districts. The programme includes surveillance of fluorosis in the community, training and manpower support, establishment of diagnostic facilities, treatment and health education. The Indian Council of Medical Research has formed a task force on fluorosis to address issues related to prevention and control.&lt;ref name="The Hindu14"&gt;{{cite news|title=Huge population at fluorosis risk|publisher=The Hindu: Mobile Edition|date=28 December 2014|url=http://m.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/huge-population-at-fluorosis-risk/article6733103.ece/|accessdate=29 December 2014|first=Smriti|last=Kak Ramachandran|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150507185338/http://m.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/huge-population-at-fluorosis-risk/article6733103.ece/|archivedate=7 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also scientific evidence that fluoride in large amounts can lead to damage to health. When fluoride is supplied via drinking water, there is no control regarding the amount of fluoride actually consumed, which could lead to excessive consumption. Supply of fluoridated water forces those who do not so wish to also consume water with added fluoride."&lt;ref name=EndFinIsrael0/&gt; Many in the medical and dental communities in Israel criticized the decision as a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jalil|first1=Justin|title=Israel to discontinue fluoridation of tap water|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-to-discontinue-fluoridation-of-tap-water/|accessdate=3 March 2015|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In the early 1960s the city of [[Szolnok]] briefly fluoridated its water. The program was discontinued due to technical problems and a public view that fluoridation did not seem reasonable.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} Hungary has not used artificially fluoridated water since then.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Near the end of 2015, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was the only country in the European Union with a nationwide mandate for water fluoridation.&lt;ref name=EndFinIsrael0/&gt;&lt;ref name="iaomt0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iaomt.org/ireland-begins-give-water-fluoridation/ |title=Ireland Begins To Give Up On Water Fluoridation |work=iaomt.org |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IDM0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.yudu.com/Library/A387vu/IrelandsDentalDecemb/resources/index.htm |title=RCSI fluoride warning |work=Ireland's Dental Magazine |page=8 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of drinking water is fluoridated.

Implementation of fluoridation was held up by preliminary dental surveying and water testing,&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Forum on Fluoridation 2002, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; and a court case, Ryan v. Attorney General.&lt;ref name="ryan-ag-1965"&gt;

The parliament majority said that there were other and better ways of reducing tooth decay than water fluoridation. Four cities received permission to fluoridate tap water when it was legal.&lt;ref name=Larsson1981/&gt;{{rp|56–57}} An official commission was formed, which published its final report in 1981. They recommended other ways of reducing tooth decay (improving food and [[oral hygiene]] habits) instead of fluoridating tap water. They also found that many people found fluoridation to infringe upon personal liberty/[[freedom of choice]] by forcing them to be medicated, and that the long-term effects of fluoridation were insufficiently acknowledged. They also lacked a proper study on the effects of fluoridation on formula-fed infants.&lt;ref name=Larsson1981/&gt;{{rp|29}} In the year 2004 the allowed amount of fluoride in the water was decreased to 1,5&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svensktvatten.se/vattentjanster/dricksvatten/riskanalys-och-provtagning/kemiska-amnen-i-vatten/fluorid/|title=Fluor - Svenskt Vatten|website=www.svensktvatten.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]], since 1962, two fluoridation programs had operated in tandem: water fluoridation in the City of [[Basel]], and salt fluoridation in the rest of Switzerland (around 83% of domestic salt sold had fluoride added). However it became increasingly difficult to keep the two programs separate. As a result, some of the population of Basel were assumed to use both fluoridated salt and fluoridated water. In order to correct the situation, in April 2003 the [[Grand Council of Basel-Stadt]] resolved to cease water fluoridation and expand salt fluoridation to Basel.&lt;ref&gt;J. MEYER and P.

{{main|Water fluoridation in Australia}}

[[Australia]] now provides fluoridated water for 70% or more of the population in all states and territories. Many of Australia's drinking water supplies began fluoridation in the 1960s and 1970s. By 1984 almost 66% of the Australian population had access to fluoridated drinking water, represented by 850 towns and cities.&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;[http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/downloads/reports/1SP%20Flouridation%20part%201%20of%204.pdf Inquiry into Water Fluoridation in the ACT - Report by the Standing Committee on Social Policy, 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326182200/http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/downloads/reports/1SP%20Flouridation%20part%201%20of%204.pdf |date=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commonwealth"&gt;Commonwealth Department of Health, Fluoridation of Water: A Collection. 9; Commonwealth Department of Health, Fluoridation of Water in Australia 1984 (Canberra: Australian Government Publishing Service, 1985), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas within Australia have [[Fluoride#Natural occurrence|natural fluoride]] levels in the groundwater, which was estimated in 1991 to provide drinking water to approximately 0.9% of the population.&lt;ref name="parliament" /&gt;

===New Zealand===
The use of water fluoridation first began in [[New Zealand]] in [[Hastings]] in 1954.

'''George Sipa-Adjah Yankey''' is a [[Ghanaian]] [[lawyer]] and [[politician]]. He is the current CEO of Ghana Gas and served as [[Minister of State|Minister]] for Health of [[Ghana]]. He obtained his PhD in 1987 from the [[University of Warwick]] in the United Kingdom.

==Law and finance==
Yankey worked in the Ministry of Finance of Ghana and was the head of its Legal department between 1989 and 1995. He became Director of the Legal, Private Sector and Financial Institutions Department at the same ministry from 1996.&lt;ref name=statement&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=170372 |title=Press Statement By Dr. George Sipa-Adjah Yankey |accessdate=2010-07-26 |date=2009-10-16 |publisher=Ghana Home Page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics &amp; Ghana National Gas Company==
Yankey is a member of the [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]].

'''Dr. Gregory "Greg" Pratt''' is a fictional character on the [[United States]] [[television show]] ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', portrayed by [[Mekhi Phifer]] from April 4, 2002 to September 25, 2008. Mekhi Phifer was removed from the main cast opening credits in the 2nd episode of season 15.

== Early beginnings at County ==
Pratt's first appearance as a main character was late in Season 8 in the episode "Orion in the Sky" (2002), as a smart but arrogant intern from VA hospital.  He meets [[Mark Greene|Dr. Mark Greene]] on Greene's last day at County and is initially dismissive of him, before becoming more measured when he learns of Mark's terminal cancer, and by day's end he has learned a little about practicing medicine from Dr. Greene. Dr. Pratt wasn't present at Dr. Mark Greene's funeral but in flashback episode in Season 12 "Body &amp; Soul", it revealed Dr. Pratt worked that day at the hospital since it was understaffed with most of the doctors at Dr. Greene's memorial. Pratt later inherits Dr. Greene's locker.

In the beginning of his residency, Pratt shows immediate leadership and quick precision. But his limited experience and cowboy antics often led Pratt to collide with his chief resident [[John Carter (ER)|Dr. John Carter]] and other attendings over many occasions, including a procedure he was unqualified to do (though the patient survived) and resuscitating a patient who had been declared dead, and was brain-dead upon his "revival". He initially clashed with med student [[Michael Gallant]] as Michael's military background made him more by-the-book whereas Pratt liked to go around the rules, but they later became close friends. During the critical [[smallpox]] outbreak, Pratt proved his skills and courage as a swift physician by helping [[Luka Kovač|Dr. Luka Kovač]] and [[Jing-Mei Chen|Dr. Jing-Mei Chen]] save Dr. Romano's life. The entire hospital is thrown into chaos during the evacuation gone awry, and he along with Dr. John Carter, [[Abby Lockhart]], and Dr. Jing-Mei "Deb" Chen were forced into quarantine in the ER.

== Personal life and career at County ==
In Season 9, Pratt begins an off/on relationship with fellow physician, Dr. Jing-Mei "Deb" Chen. During the series, it was revealed that Pratt had a mentally handicapped adopted brother named Leon living with him, a man who kept Pratt safe and focused on school during his childhood but was left with the reasoning ability of a small child after surviving a gunshot to the head. Due to his handicap, Leon often got into trouble and would disrupt Pratt's professional and personal life, especially when he became involved with a group of thugs who stabbed him in the buttock over a confiscated gun, got him thrown in jail overnight, and then made him join them on a robbery that ended with one of the thugs dead and a cop badly injured (though he recovered thanks to good surgical work by [[Elizabeth Corday|Dr. Elizabeth Corday]]). To help give Pratt a break, Carter suggested that Leon leave town for a while, leading Pratt to send his brother away to stay with other family members in Baltimore. Leon never returned to the show and was not mentioned again in future seasons. Pratt and medical student Michael Gallant were briefly held for questioning by the Chicago police after a robbery/homicide occurred at a diner across the street; Chen had said that she might have seen a black man fleeing the scene.

During the tenth season, Pratt was supposedly fired by the frustrated Dr. Romano, whom he had been bumping heads with ever since Romano took over the ER. This was based on bogus allegations that Romano was collecting because of his overall dislike of Dr. Pratt, planning to build them up until he had enough ammunition to get rid of Pratt for good.  However, Romano never got to present these findings before the hospital director since he never showed up at the conference (unbeknownst to the others, he had been killed minutes earlier by a helicopter that crashed in the ambulance bay and crushed him). Dr. Anspaugh, correctly assuming that Romano was biased, told Pratt to keep up the good work.

Pratt and Chen's continuing relationship began to break down when Pratt's casual flirting with new medical student [[Neela Rasgotra]] led to Pratt telling Chen he did not see them having a serious future together. Their relationship ended early in Season 10 and Chen was often curt and dismissive towards Pratt for a long while, but they eventually became friends again.

In Season 10's season finale "Drive", Pratt is involved in a road rage shooting while driving a recent patient, Elgin Gibbs, home en route to dinner with Dr. Chen. As Pratt tried to drive away from the shooter, his car was forced off a bridge and into the Chicago river, leading to Pratt sustaining serious head injuries, and Chen suffering a broken leg.  Elgin died from his injuries. Their interactions became infrequent due to Chen's family problems, but Pratt went over to her house during Season 11's Christmas Eve episode when he learned she quit. Chen's father begged her to let him die so she injects him with a drug that kills him, and Pratt was aghast by this idea but ultimately supported Chen as she performed euthanasia, and then consoled her as she wept over the loss of her family. This ends his life and Pratt and Chen's relationship, since Chen returns to China to bury her father's remains and is never heard from again.

For the Chief Resident post that came up in season 11, Pratt was backed at first by [[Luka Kovač|Dr. Luka Kovač]] and later by [[Susan Lewis|Dr. Susan Lewis]], who had often been critical of his job performance in the past but told him she could see herself backing him for the job. However, he decided against applying for the position due to the extra workload, which was subsequently awarded to [[Archie Morris|Dr. Archie Morris]]- who, while by no means a bad doctor, was goofy and awkward and had none of Pratt's natural leadership and communications skills.

Dr. Pratt came to terms with his clouded past at the end of Season 11, making contact with his estranged father, Charlie Pratt (portrayed by [[Danny Glover]]). But, following on in Season 12, Pratt was unable to forgive his father for their estrangement even though proof emerged that Charlie had been forced out of Greg's life by his mom, and ended any reconciliation efforts. Later, after much counsel, Pratt restored ties with his half-brother Chaz (portrayed by [[Sam Jones III]]).

In the episode, "Strange Bed Fellows," Dr. Luka Kovač instructs Pratt to go to [[Darfur]], Africa to join Dr. John Carter in a [[Doctors Without Borders]] program after Pratt helped a friend avoid a DUI by sending a vial of his own blood for the blood alcohol test, rather than his friend's; the friend later drove drunk and nearly killed a kid. To avoid legal repercussions and also to force him to think about his actions Dr. Kovač sends him away. When Pratt challenges Kovač and says he won't go, Kovač says he has two choices: leave for Darfur or have the DUI case info released and see his medical career come to an end. Pratt eventually decides to go, giving him the opportunity to move up to the position of attending physician, which [[Victor Clemente|Dr. Victor Clemente]] could not fulfill. Pratt becomes a better doctor for going to Congo as he gets a sense of what it means to push himself under genuinely impossible and horrifying conditions. He sincerely thanks Luka for making him go, and the two doctors are back on good terms afterwards.

At the start of season 13, Pratt achieved his new title as attending, while Chaz moves in with him after Charlie abuses him and he joins Greg in cutting all ties to his rotten dad. However, later on, Pratt discovers his brother in a compromising position with another man. After much denial and a talk with [[Kerry Weaver|Dr. Kerry Weaver]] Pratt begins to understand and accept his brother's homosexuality. He also supports his brother's new job as an [[Emergency Medical Technician]] but clashes with Chaz's co-workers after they encourage him to drink near-fatal amounts of alcohol.

Later in the season, Pratt discovered a church holding an illegal prescription drugs exchange program between church members. Pratt tried to reason with the pastor to seek better alternatives. With no compromise being met, he decided to take part in the program to make it safer by donating some narcotics from the ER. However, when a member of the church died from the result of the drug exchange, an investigation was conducted by police and social workers. Pratt soon admitted to his chief, Dr. Kovač, that he was solely involved in the scheme, preventing any repercussions on the department. Pratt was arrested by the police (though Kovač helped bail him out) and was put before the review board at the hospital for an explanation of his actions. Surprisingly, Pastor Watkins of First Mission Baptist and his congregation showed up on Pratt's behalf and explained the entire story of his contribution. The board subsequently dismissed Pratt from any suspension, allowing him to retain his medical license and job.  Near the end of the season, Kovač asked Pratt to be best man at his wedding and Greg said yes.

After being overlooked for the position of Chief of the ER in favour of new attending [[Skye Wexler|Dr. Skye Wexler]], Pratt submitted his two weeks' notice of resignation stating that the administration of County General did not respect him; however, he soon changed his mind after meeting former [[Physician Assistant]] [[Jeanie Boulet]]. After this, Pratt pursued the ER Chief position and finally was able to have a serious adult relationship with the radiologist Dr. Bettina DeJesus.

At the end of the Season 14 finale, "The Chicago Way," Pratt entered an ambulance transporting a patient (portrayed by [[Steve Buscemi]]) who revealed himself to be a government informant in [[Witness Protection]]. With a botched attempt made on the patient's life in the ER, the Turkish mob targeting Pratt's patient finally succeeded when they booby trapped the ambulance Pratt rode in. A subsequent explosion resulted in a season-ending [[cliffhanger]].

== Death and 15th season ==
He died in the Season 15 premiere, "Life After Death," from injuries sustained in that explosion. Dr Morris tried to save him but unfortunately Pratt was unable to make it. It was further revealed in the episode that Pratt was going to receive an offer to become the new Chief of the ER. Former doctors, such as Dr. Kerry Weaver from Florida and Dr. John Carter from Africa, sent their condolences and gifts in honor of Pratt.

At the end, Morris hands Bettina the engagement ring which Pratt had intended to give to her. Among the ER staff who came to a remembrance at Ike's bar were [[Dr. Abby Lockhart]], Dr. Archie Morris,Dr. Neela Rasgotra, [[Tony Gates]], [[Sam Taggart]], [[Simon Brenner]], [[Chuny Marquez]], [[Haleh Adams]], [[Malik McGrath]], [[Frank Martin (ER character)|Frank Martin]], Paramedic Dumars, and his brother Chaz, who had become a new med student about halfway through Season 15.

During the 15th and final season of ''ER,'' at the end of the episode "The Book of Abby," long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Dr. Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Amongst them, a tag "Pratt" can be seen.

==Healthcare==
After independence in 1918 a health care system on the Bismarck model began to develop but in 1949 when it was absorbed into the USSR, it was reorganized according to the centralised [[Nikolai Semashko (medicine)|Semashko]] system. It was relatively well funded and the population’s health status was better than in other parts of the USSR. Lithuania moved away from a system funded mainly by local and state budgets to a mixed system, predominantly funded by the National Health Insurance Fund in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Lithuania"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lithuania|url=http://www.who.int/countries/ltu/en/|accessdate=3 July 2015|publisher=World Health Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deterioration in health which occurred during the first phase of social reforms was halted in 1994 and the standardized death rate decreased from 12.06 (per 1000 population) in 1994 to 10.16 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Health Care Systems in Transition|date=2000|publisher=WHO|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/95127/E69920.pdf?ua=1|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000 the vast majority of Lithuanian health care institutions were non-profit-making enterprises and a private sector developed, providing mostly outpatient services which are paid for out-of-pocket. The [[Ministry of Health (Lithuania)|Ministry of Health]] also runs a few health care facilities and is involved in the running of the two major Lithuanian teaching hospitals. It is responsible for the State Public Health Centre which manages the public health network including ten county public health centres with their local branches.  The ten [[Counties of Lithuania|counties]] run county hospitals and specialised health care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Health Care Systems in Transition|date=2000|publisher=WHO|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/95127/E69920.pdf?ua=1|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total expenditure on healthcare per head of the population was $1,579 in 2013, 6.2% of [[GDP]].  There were 12191 physicians in the country in 2009, 36.14 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name="Lithuania"/&gt;

There is now Compulsory Health Insurance for Lithuanian residents. There are 5 Territorial Health Insurance Funds, covering Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai and Panevėžys. Contributions for people who are economically active are 9% of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compulsory Health Insurance Contributions|url=http://www.vlk.lt/sites/en/health-insurance-in-Lithuania/compulsory-health-insurance-contributions/|publisher=VLK|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emergency medical services are provided free of charge to all residents. Access to hospital treatment is normally by referral by a General Practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accessing healthcare in Lithuania|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/Pages/healthcareinLithuania.aspx|website=NHS Choices|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescribable medicines are listed in the Lithuanian State Medicines Register.

'''Ludlow Murcott Moody''' [[CBE]] (1 November 1892 in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]] – 19 November 1981, Kingston), a qualified doctor, was the son of Charles Ernest Moody, and, like his brother [[Harold Moody (physician)|Harold Moody]] also studied medicine in London at [[King's College London]] [[Medical School]], winning the Warneford scholarship, the Huxley Prize for physiology, the Warneford Prize and the Todd Prize for Clinical Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who, Jamaica'' 1954&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother was the sculptor [[Ronald Moody]].

Returning to Jamaica, Ludlow Moody worked as government bacteriologist (1920–25), before setting up private practice in Kingston. During this period he was a [[Justice of the Peace]], a member of Jamaica Public Services Commission and served as [[Custos]] of Kingston from 1961 to 1963. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in laws from the [[University of the West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''British Medical Journal'', Vol 284, 16 January 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married twice: first to Vera Holme Manley (sister of Jamaican prime minister [[Norman Washington Manley]]), with whom he had one daughter, Pamela Margaret Moody, and later to Margaret Foster Smith. He was an Old Boy and former Chairman of the [[Wolmer's Schools]].

He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1966 for Public Service.&lt;ref&gt;Reported in ''Royal Society of Medicine News'' Vol. 59, October 1966 listing Birthday Honours.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Hood climbing accidents''' are [[mountain climbing]]- or [[hiking]]-related incidents on Oregon's [[Mount Hood]].  As of 2007, about 10,000 people attempt to climb Mount Hood each year.&lt;ref name="goesright"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the worst climbing accidents occurred in 1986, when seven teenagers and two school teachers froze to death while attempting to retreat from a storm.&lt;ref name="cbs2002"/&gt;

Despite a quadrupling of forest visitors since 1990, the number of people requiring rescue remains steady at around 25 to 50 per year, largely because of the increased use of cell phones and [[GPS]] devices.&lt;ref name="trace"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, 3.4 percent of search and rescue missions were for mountain climbers.  In comparison, 20% were for vehicles (including [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]]s and snowmobiles), 3% were for mushroom collectors, the remaining 73.6 percent were for skiers, boaters, and participants in other mountain activities.&lt;ref name="Kristi Keck"&gt;{{cite news

Regardless of route, Mount Hood is a technical climb. It requires ropes, [[crampons]], and [[ice axe]]s.  Approximately 95% of Mount Hood's climbs occur April through July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Hazards==
[[Cascade Range]] weather patterns can be deceptive, with sudden sustained winds of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|-1}}, and visibility quickly dropping from hundreds of miles to an arm's length; climbers can experience {{convert|60|F-change|C-change|0|adj=on}} temperature drops in less than an hour after leaving an access point.  This pattern is responsible for the most well known incidents of May 1986 and December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;See incident summary references.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avalanche]]s are popularly believed a major climbing hazard, but relatively few Mount Hood deaths are attributed to them.  For the 11-year period ending April 2006,&lt;ref&gt;
The statistical period of the ''Westwide Avalanche Network'' is 31 December 1994 to 30 April 2006, almost eleven and a half years.&lt;/ref&gt; there was one death on Mount Hood caused by an avalanche,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Oregon - Avalanche History

 | publisher = Oregon Mountaineering Association
 | accessdate = 2007-06-22

while 445 avalanche-related deaths occurred throughout North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Compared to other [[Western United States|western states]], Oregon has relatively few avalanche fatalities (16 of the 1009 for the U.S. from 1951 to 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are between 100 and 200 deaths each year worldwide from avalanches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The two major causes of climbing deaths on Mount Hood are falls and [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref&gt;See incident history.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to ''Mount Hood: A Complete History'' by Jack Grauer,
the first recorded climbing fatality on Hood's slopes occurred on July 12, 1896, when Frederic Kirn eschewed his guide and attempted the trip to the summit alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | date = July 1975
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirn's body was found on the Newton Clark Glacier on the east side of the mountain, after an apparent 40-story fall in connection with an avalanche.

In an unusual accident reported in Grauer's book, on August 27, 1934, Victor Von Norman successfully climbed the mountain via the southern route, along with a group of fellow [[University of Washington]] students. He then ventured too close to a [[fumarole]] between Crater Rock and the "Hogsback" that connects Crater Rock with the summit ridge, was overcome by oxygen-barren gases emanating from the fumarole, and fell about {{convert|50|ft|m}} to his death. A number of men who tried to retrieve the body over several days were also nearly overcome by the fumes, even after obtaining an oxygen mask, before finally succeeding in their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1961, experienced climber Colin Chisholm and his teenage son, Doug Chisholm climbed the Elliott Glacier. On the descent of Cooper's Spur a crampon slipped on ice caused a fall. The two fell 2000 feet onto and over crevasses on Elliot Glacier.  Colin broke ribs and Doug was unharmed. Their route became known as "The Chisholm Trail." .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On March 1, 1969, James Eaton died when he fell headfirst into a concealed 60 foot crevasse near the edge of the upper portion of the White River Canyon.  Eaton was a ski instructor and a member of the Mount Hood Ski Patrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Beginning on New Year's Eve in 1975, two 16-year-olds and an 18-year-old survived in a [[snow cave]] for 13 days through a snow storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On May 19, 1980, Tom Hanstedt died while descending the mountain's southeast face, falling deep into a crevasse on the Newton-Clark Glacier. His body was never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Accidents in North American Mountaineering, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 1981, David H. Turple and Bill Pilkenton died in a fall from [[Cooper Spur]] on the northeast side of the mountain.&lt;ref name="blog.oregonlive.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Body recovered from dangerously steep area of Mount Hood |date=July 28, 2008 |newspaper=The Oregonian |first=Dennis |last=Peck |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2008/07/climber_sparks_rescue_effort_o.html |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 1981, five members of the [[Mazamas|Mazamas climbing group]] died during a fall from [[Cooper Spur]] while descending.&lt;ref name="blog.oregonlive.com"/&gt;

Beginning on May 12, 1986, one of the worst U.S. climbing accidents occurred over the course of three days when seven students and two faculty of the [[Oregon Episcopal School]] froze to death during an annual school climb.&lt;ref name="cbs2002"/&gt; Of the four survivors, three had life-threatening hypothermia; one had legs amputated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On July 11, 1987, Arthur Andersen Jr. was killed when he and two other men fell on the south side of the mountain and slid into a crevasse.&lt;ref name="blog.oregonlive.com"/&gt;

In June 1990, William Ott died from hypothermia on the mountain. Ott's widow was not surprised to learn of her husband's fate. She said she had not expected her husband, who had terminal cancer, to return from the trip he had chosen to make by himself.&lt;ref name="blog.oregonlive.com"/&gt;

On September 25, 1995 Kenneth Budlong, 45, of Portland attempted to climb the peak via the Cathedral Ridge route. Budlong was very experienced, having summited the peak 22 times before. However, the weather turned very quickly, and Budlong vanished. Despite an extensive search over the following days, his whereabouts were never determined, and his body was never found.

On May 19, 1997, Carlos Loria, a solo climber summited successfully with his dog, Buckwheat.  While descending the [[Coe Glacier]] he slipped and fell {{convert|700|ft|m}}, fracturing his neck.  After being reported overdue by family, he was found by rescuers with facial [[lacerations]], slight hypothermia, and cervical trauma.  He was treated and helicoptered to Portland, but Buckwheat was not at the scene.  A month later, the dog appeared at Cooper Spur Inn, some {{convert|9.4|km|mi}} ENE across the rugged [[Mount Hood Wilderness]], evidently having survived on snow melt and berries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On September 6, 1997, an experienced [[Telemark skiing|telemark skier]], Mark Fraas of Hood River, ascended wearing crampons and carrying skis to the {{convert|10000|ft|m|adj=on}} level of Cooper Spur, not intending to summit.  He slipped and fell more than {{convert|1500|ft|m}} down the Chisholm Trail and [[Eliot Glacier]].  Twenty-five rescuers responded to his partner's cell phone call and found him dead.  Retrieval required technical mountaineering skills and equipment.  Fraas was not known to have any climbing experience.  This was at least the 13th fatality from Cooper Spur. All involve loss of footing, inability to [[self-arrest]], and a long fall over rock cliffs above the Eliot Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On May 31, 1998, during a graduation climb for [[The Mazamas]] mountaineering club, several participents were caught in an avalanche.  One died and one had serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The climbers were at the {{convert|10700|ft|m|adj=on}} level on the West Crater Rim route; the forecast was for "significant avalanche danger" and was posted "high avalanche hazard" at Timberline's climbing registration.
A large slab avalanche fracture occurred at the {{convert|10800|ft|m|adj=on}} level, {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} vertical below the westernmost summit ridge.
A roped team of three were swept down the steep slope through the Hot Rocks area.
One was killed by injuries during the fall and found under four feet of snow about an hour later along with a snapped rope.

On June 22, 1999, a 24-year-old medical student from Michigan apparently set out from a remote trailhead where his rental car was found.  Temperatures dropped 15 degrees and more than an inch of rain fell beginning the next day.  Ten days after his presumed disappearance, searching began with up to 70 rescuers combing the area.  Additional searches included [[Search and rescue dog|cadaver dog]]s and [[psychic]]s.  His body was never found.&lt;ref name="trace"/&gt;

On June 4, 2000, Diana Kornet, 29, slipped as she was looking over the northeast side of Mount Hood. She fell about 2500&amp;nbsp;ft to her death. She and six friends had reached the summit about 7 am. She had unroped, as many climbers do after reaching the summit, and left her ice axe when she went to take a look. It was windy in this exposed location. After one of her companions called 911, the sheriff's office sent a search plane and found Kornet's body at the 8,700-foot level at the top of Eliot Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Hood fatal fall from the summit|url=http://www.traditionalmountaineering.org/Report_Hood_FatalFall.htm|publisher=Report from the 2001 edition of "Accidents in North American Mountaineering"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2001, rescuers abandoned a search for a 24-year-old Hungarian exchange student who had been missing for six days.  He had been hiking with friends when he left the group with light clothing and no provisions.  Two days after his disappearance, the weather turned cold and snowy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the morning of Saturday, February 17, 2007, eight experienced climbers from the Portland area ascended in sunny, mild weather.  Observing worse weather mid-afternoon, they camped at the {{Convert|9300|ft|m|-2}} level of Illumination Saddle overnight.  Sunday morning, they abandoned a summit attempt and descended in freezing rain and snow, visibility less than {{Convert|30|ft|m|0}}, and winds at 40 to 70&amp;nbsp;mph (64 to 120&amp;nbsp;km/h). At about noon, disoriented, three of the climbers and a [[Labrador Retriever|black lab]] stepped off a cliff (at the {{Convert|8300|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} level at the east edge of [[Palmer Glacier]]) while roped together and fell down several hundred feet into White River Canyon.  One of the remaining five climbers was lowered by rope to search for the fallen group, but returned without seeing them.  They called for help by cell phone, and were advised of even worse weather advancing, so they dug in expecting another night.  However, rescuers arrived and evacuated them Sunday evening. The three fallen climbers were unable to dig into solid ice to build a [[snow cave]], so they improvised a shelter and were in hourly cell phone contact with rescuers.  They had a [[Mountain Locator Unit]], sleeping bags, [[GPS]], and a tarp.  The dog, [[Velvet (dog)|Velvet]], helped keep them warm.  Rescuers arrived Monday about 10:45 am.  One was hospitalized for a head injury, the others were treated for minor injuries and released.  The dog had broken nails and a cut on one of her back legs from cold exposure.&lt;ref name="goesright"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristi Keck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The climbers contacted rescuers by cell phone and obtained assistance to navigate to ''Illumination Saddle'', on the south side of the mountain.

On September 7, 2007, in the early afternoon two Portland-area climbers were ascending the Hogsback to the Pearly Gates when one slid to the edge of the Bergschrund and sustained injuries sufficient for him to call for rescue assistance.  His partner decided it was too dangerous to descend the frozen gravel and loose rock face and remained in place.  Rescuers arrived about five hours later, assessed the fallen climber, treated minor injuries and belayed him walking down.  The other climber required technical climbing equipment and was assisted down the Bergschrund.  He walked down and joined his partner about dawn at a Timberline [[snowcat]] at the top of the ski area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He slipped, leading to an uncontrolled slide of about {{convert|300|ft|m|-1}} vertical near Crater Rock. He was unable to arrest his fall using an ice ax, and blacked out after his head struck the surface. Another climber witnessed his fall and rushed to assist, observed head trauma and confusion, and called for help using a cell phone, then descended to meet rescuers. A third climber remained with him until help arrived since the victim was unable to descend on foot.

On January 22, 2011, three friends summited successfully in the afternoon, but one broke his crampon during descent.  At 5 p.m., his partners continued down without him separating from him at Crater Rock.  They notified authorities when he did not return, reporting he lacked a light and overnight gear though he had "a beacon" from REI, but did not know what it was, but said he would "pull the knob" if something happened.  The sheriff called for search assistance, and since [[Portland Mountain Rescue]] was already in the area for a winter bivouac exercise, they conducted an [[Mountain Locator Unit|MLU]] search at 8 p.m. and quickly identified a signal from White River Canyon.  It was a clear night near freezing with winds at {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}.  Night ski lighting from Skibowl and Timberline was clearly visible when they located the victim east of Palmer Glacier at {{convert|7700|ft|m}} around midnight in light garments.

Late on February 20, 2011, a snowboarder was reported lost on Mount Hood.  Initial information and cell phone tracking indicated he was northwest of Zig Zag Canyon.  Five searchers were unable to find him that night though visibility improved during the evening.  The next morning had better conditions and involved many more searchers.  He was found by a National Guard helicopter, which airlifted him to Timberline Lodge, cold but in good spirits.  As rescuers were debriefing with a sheriff, a call for assistance arrived from a 13-year-old male snowboarder who was out-of-bounds below the Timberline Ski area.  He was found within 20 minutes of the call, given hot drink and food, and escorted to Timberline's first aid room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On Sunday, March 24, 2013, college student Mary Owen set out in the early morning hours to complete a solo climb. She was supposed to be a part of a group climb, but when the leader of her group canceled the climb due to what he thought would be bad weather, Owen decided to climb alone.  As she climbed higher, whiteout conditions set in, and approximately 1000 vertical feet from the summit she decided to turn back.  Disoriented due to the conditions she became lost and, attempting to climb out of canyon, she slipped and fell about 40 feet, severely spraining her right ankle and suffering a puncture wound to her inner left thigh.  Unable to walk, she was stranded on the mountain for six nights, surviving on a one day's worth of snacks.  Though she registered to climb, some mishap caused her information to be lost and she was not reported missing until Thursday, March 28.  She was found alive on Saturday, March 30, by an Oregon Army National Guard Blackhawk helicopter rescue crew and flown directly to a hospital.  Aside from her ankle injuries, she suffered frostbite in her feet and toes, but recovered fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On June 22, 2013, experienced climber Dr. Kinley Adams, a Salem family dentist, set out for a day climb as part of training preparation for a planned climbing trip to Nepal.  He parked and registered at Timberline, and set out solo, but did not return as planned at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.  Searching began at 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. the next day, but was limited by low clouds, light rain, and worsening weather, which turned to winter conditions for the next few days.  Search and rescue aircraft found his body a week later, and it was recovered the following day by a highly technical mission due to dangerous snow and slope conditions.  Death occurred from multiple injuries caused by falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The women had set up camp at the top of a waterfall, with a tent and backpacks. It appeared that they lost their footing on the slippery rocks and fell. The two had met in 2008 as students at Laurelhust Elementary in Portland and became best friends. They graduated from St. Mary's Academy in 2016. Each had completed her freshman year—Place at Gonzaga University and Lang at Western Washington University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On February 13, 2018, 35-year-old Miha Sumi of Portland fell 700-1,000 feet on Hogsback, was critically injured, rescued and subsequently died.  Sumi was among a group of four climbers; Sumi and Matt Zavortink had reached the summit, while the other two waited on Hogsback. The group encountered tumbling ice and rocks, causing Sumi's fall.  Zavortink and other climbers in the area reached Sumi and performed CPR for about 90 minutes until a Blackhawk helicopter arrived and rescued him.

'''Myopericarditis''' is a combination of both [[myocarditis]] and [[pericarditis]] appearing in a single individual, namely inflammation of both the pericardium and the heart muscle. It can involve the presence of [[Pericardial effusion|fluid in the heart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Inflammatory Heart Diseases: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments|first1=Lei|last1=Lu|first2=RongRong|last2=Sun|first3=Min|last3=Liu|first4=Yi|last4=Zheng|first5=Peiying|last5=Zhang|date=1 July 2015|publisher=|journal=[[Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics]]|volume=72|issue=3|pages=851–855|doi=10.1007/s12013-015-0550-7|pmid=25682012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myopericarditis refers primarily to a pericarditis with lesser myocarditis, as opposed to a perimyocarditis, though the two terms are often used interchangeably. Both will be reflected on an [[ECG]].  Myopericarditis usually involves inflammation of the [[pericardium]], or the sac covering the heart.

The [[ACAM2000]] smallpox vaccine has been known to cause myopericarditis in some people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ACAM2000™: The new smallpox vaccine for United States Strategic National Stockpile|first1=Aysegul|last1=Nalca|first2=Elizabeth E|last2=Zumbrun|date=25 May 2010|publisher=|journal=Drug Design, Development and Therapy|volume=4|pages=71–79|pmid=20531961|pmc=2880337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00928577|title=Safety Surveillance Cohort Study of Vaccinia Vaccine (ACAM2000®) - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Horizons''' is the UK government's ten-year strategy for [[mental health]] in England, published in December 2009. It replaces the [[National Service Framework]] for mental health, and is intended to be a comprehensive programme of action for improving the mental well-being of the population and the services that care for people with poor [[mental health]] by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newhorizons.dh.gov.uk/about/index.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 

New Horizons, along with other documents published simultaneously, is claimed to bring a new focus on employment issues, including new mental health coordinators for every [[Jobcentre Plus]] district, and [[occupational health]] advice lines for small businesses. The strategy also aims to tackle [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] in people of all ages; to reduce suicides; to improve outreach to help excluded groups access support; and to tackle the [[Social stigma|stigma]] around [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/News/Recentstories/DH_109719]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charities and mental health bodies have reportedly welcomed the strategy in general, but have expressed concerns about how to translate it into funded actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2009/12/07/113377/mental-health-bodies-welcome-new-horizons.htm]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2007">'''[[Obesity]] in [[Switzerland]]''' has been increasingly cited as a major health issue in recent years, although the country had the lowest rate of obesity in Europe in 2015. 14.9% of the adult population had a [[body mass index]] of 30 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People from Zurich tend to be less active compared to people in the countryside.&lt;ref name="Neue Zürcher1"/&gt;

Swiss women are considered much slimmer than Germans.&lt;ref name="Süddeutsche1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Der Westen wird immer dicker|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/oecd-studie-fettleibigkeit-jeder-zweite-ist-zu-dick-1.1003848|publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=March 8, 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-nine per cent of Swiss women are considered to be overweight.&lt;ref name="Süddeutsche1"/&gt;

==Causes==
Inactivity is blamed for the lack of fitness in men in the [[canton of Zurich]].&lt;ref name="Neue Zürcher1"/&gt;

==Effects==
The obesity level in men in the [[canton of Zurich]] means that only 54.1% of men are fit enough for military duty.&lt;ref name="Neue Zürcher1"/&gt; In addition, physical symptoms like back pain, obesity and asthma are more frequently reported.&lt;ref name="Neue Zürcher1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4825">'''Olikoye Ransome-Kuti''' (30 December 1927 – 1 June 2003) was a [[paediatrician]], [[activist]], and [[health minister of Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jun/10/guardianobituaries.aids|publisher=The Guardian|author=Shola Adenekan|location=[[United Kingdom]]|date=June 1, 2003|title=Olikoye Ransome-Kuti|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
[[file:1940s family Ransome Kuti.png|thumb|right|[[Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti|Reverend Israel]] and [[Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti|Funmilayo]] beside him, Dolu is behind and Fela in foreground, baby in arms is Beko, Olikoye is to the right]]
Olikoye Ransome-Kuti was born in [[Ijebu Ode]] on 30 December 1927, in present-day [[Ogun State]], Nigeria. His mother, [[Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti]], was a prominent political campaigner and [[women's rights]] activist, and his father, Reverend [[Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti]], a Protestant minister and school principal, was the first president of the [[Nigeria Union of Teachers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.analysisworldmusic.com/images/1aawmoikelomepaper.pdf|format=pdf|website=World Music|title=Analysis|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707135016/http://www.analysisworldmusic.com/images/1aawmoikelomepaper.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother [[Fela Kuti|Fela]] would grow up to be a popular musician and a founder of [[Afrobeat]], while another brother, [[Beko Ransome-Kuti|Beko]], would become an internationally known doctor and political activist. Ransome-Kuti attended [[Abeokuta Grammar School]], [[University of Ibadan]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]] (1948–54).&lt;ref&gt;Shola Adenekan, [http://www.thenewblackmagazine.com/view.aspx?index=517 "Olikoye Ransome-Kuti: He Broke the Silence Surrounding HIV/Aids in Nigeria and Highlighted the Country's Plight"], ''The New Black Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He was a house physician at [[General Hospital, Lagos]]. He was senior lecturer at the [[University of Lagos]] from 1967 to 1970 and appointed Director of child health at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos and became Head of Department of Paediatrics from 1968 to 1976. He was professor of paediatrics at the [[Lagos University Teaching Hospital|College of Medicine, University of Lagos]] until his retirement in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Olukoye Ransome-Kuti|author=Abiodun Rafiu|journal=British Medical Journal|year=2003|pmc=1126279|page=1400|volume=326|issue=7403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=british&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof Olikoye Ransome-Kuti|url=http://hallmarksoflabour.org/citations/prof-olikoye-ransome-kuti-ofr-hlr/|website=Hallmark of Labour Foundation|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as senior house officer  at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], London, and as a [[locum]] in [[Hammersmith Hospital]] in the 1960s.

In the 1980s, he joined the government of General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] as the health minister. In 1983 along with two other Nigerians, he founded one of Nigeria's largest health focused NGOs - [[Society for Family Health Nigeria]] primarily concerned with family planning and child health services at the time. In 1986, he conveyed word of Nigeria's first [[AIDS]] case, a 14-year-old girl who had been diagnosed with [[HIV]]. He was minister until 1992, when he joined the [[World Health Organization]] as its Deputy Director-General.

He held various teaching positions, including a visiting professorship at Baltimore's [[Johns Hopkins University]]'s school of hygiene and public health. He wrote extensively for medical journals and publications.

He won both the Leon Bernard Foundation Prize and the [[Maurice Pate]] Award, in 1986 and in 1990 respectively.

==Death==
Olikoye Ransome-Kuti died on 1 June 2003. He was survived by his wife of 50 years Sonia and three children.&lt;ref name=british/&gt;

'''Persin''' is a [[fungicidal]] [[toxin]] present in the [[avocado]].&lt;ref name="OelrichsSeawright1995"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/nt.2620030504 |vauthors=Oelrichs PB, Ng JC, Seawright AA, Ward A, Schäffeler L, MacLeod JK |title=Isolation and identification of a compound from avocado (''Persea americana'') leaves which causes necrosis of the acinar epithelium of the lactating mammary gland and the myocardium |journal=Nat. Toxins |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=344–9 |year=1995 |pmid=8581318 |quote="non-fatal injury to the lactating mammary gland of  the mouse is from 60 to 100 mg/kg. At doses of person above 100 mg/kg, necrosis of myocardial fibres may occur and areas of myocardial fibrosis can be observed in animals surviving for seven days. Hydrothorax and/or pulmonary oedema may be present in more severely affected animals. [..] there have been few attempts to investigate the cause of possible toxic effects of  the plant in mammals."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persin is an oil-soluble compound structurally similar to a [[fatty acid]], and it leaches into the body of the fruit from the seeds. 

The relatively low concentrations of persin in the ripe pulp of the avocado fruit is generally considered harmless to humans. Negative effects in humans are primarily in [[allergy|allergic]] individuals. When persin is consumed by domestic animals through the leaves or bark of the avocado tree, or skins and seeds of the avocado fruit, it is toxic and dangerous.&lt;ref name=aspca&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/poison-control/plants/avocado.html ASPCA Poison Control: Avocado] on aspca.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JFM_(1987-2017)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morton|first1=Julia F.|title=NewCROP - Avocado Persea americana|url=https://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/avocado_ars.html|website=hort.purdue.edu|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathology ==
Consumption of the leaves and bark of the avocado tree, or the skin and pit of the avocado fruit have been shown to have the following effects:&lt;ref name=aspca/&gt;

*In birds, which are particularly sensitive to the avocado toxin, the symptoms are: increased heart rate, myocardial tissue damage, labored breathing, disordered plumage, unrest, weakness, and apathy. High doses cause acute respiratory syndrome ([[asphyxia]]), with death approximately 12 to 24 hours after consumption.
*Lactating rabbits and mice: non-infectious [[mastitis]] and [[agalactia]] after consumption of leaves or bark.
*Rabbits: cardial [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], submandibular [[edema]] and death after consumption of leaves.
*Cows and goats: [[mastitis]], decreased milk production after consumption of leaves or bark.
*Horses: clinical effects occur mainly in mares, and includes noninfectious [[mastitis]], as well as occasional [[gastritis]] and [[colic]]. 
*Cats, dogs: mild stomach upset may occur.&lt;ref name="aspca" /&gt;
*Hares, pigs, rats, sheep, ostriches, chickens, turkeys and fish: symptoms of intoxication similar those described above. The lethal dose is not known; the effect is different depending upon the animal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kgkat.tripod.com/avocado.html | title = Avocado Toxicity | last = Clipsham | first = R | accessdate = 2010-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mice: non-fatal injury to the [[lactating]] [[mammary gland]] from 60 to 100 mg/kg Persin. [[Necrosis]] of [[Cardiac muscle|myocardial fibre]]s with 100 mg/kg Persin. 200 mg/kg lethal.&lt;ref name="OelrichsSeawright1995"/&gt;

== Additional pharmacology ==
Animal studies show that exposure to persin leads to [[apoptosis]] in certain types of [[breast cancer]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0170 |vauthors=Butt AJ, Roberts CG, Seawright AA, Oelrichs PB, MacLeod JK, Liaw TY, Kavallaris M, Somers-Edgar TJ, Lehrbach GM, Watts CK, Sutherland RL |title=A novel plant toxin, persin, with ''in vivo'' activity in the mammary gland, induces Bim-dependent apoptosis in human breast cancer cells |journal=Mol Cancer Ther |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=2300–9 |year=2006 |url=http://mct.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/5/9/2300 |pmid=16985064}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown to enhance the [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] effect of [[tamoxifen]] ''[[in vitro]]''.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roberts CG, Gurisik E, Biden TJ, Sutherland RL, Butt AJ |title=Synergistic cytotoxicity between tamoxifen and the plant toxin persin in human breast cancer cells is dependent on Bim expression and mediated by modulation of ceramide metabolism |journal=Mol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45254">A '''personal health record''', or '''PHR''', is a [[health]] record where [[health data]] and other [[information]] related to the care of a patient is maintained by the patient.&lt;ref name=Tang&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tang |first1=Paul |last2=Ash |first2=Joan |last3=Bates |first3=David |last4=Overhage |first4=J. |last5=Sands |first5=Daniel |year=2006 |title= Personal Health Records: Definitions, Benefits, and Strategies for Overcoming Barriers to Adoption |journal=JAMIA |pages=121–126 |pmid=16357345 |pmc=1447551 |volume=13 |issue=2 |doi=10.1197/jamia.M2025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This stands in contrast to the more widely used [[electronic medical record]], which is operated by institutions (such as [[hospital]]s) and contains data entered by clinicians (such as billing data) to support insurance claims. The intention of a PHR is to provide a complete and accurate summary of an individual's medical history which is accessible [[The Internet|online]]. The health data on a PHR might include patient-reported outcome data, lab results, and data from devices such as wireless electronic weighing scales or (collected passively) from a [[smartphone]].

== Definition ==
The term "personal health record" is not new. The term was used as early as June 1978&lt;ref name=FIRST&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--no author listed--&gt; |title=Computerisation of personal health records |journal=Health Visitor |volume=51 |issue=6 |page=227 |date=June 1978 |pmid=248054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in 1956, there was a reference was made to a "personal health log."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dragstedt|first=CA|title=Personal health log|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=14 April 1956|volume=160|issue=15|page=1320|pmid=13306552|doi=10.1001/jama.1956.02960500050013 |url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/304838 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "PHR" may be applied to both paper-based and computerized systems&lt;ref name=AHIMA/&gt;; usage in the late 2010s usually implies an electronic application used to collect and store health data. 

In the early 2000s, healthcare organizations began to propose formal definitions of the term. For example:

{{quote|text=The Personal Health Record (PHR) is an Internet-based set of tools that allows people to access and coordinate their lifelong health information and make appropriate parts of it available to those who need it. PHRs offer an integrated and comprehensive view of health information, including information people generate themselves such as symptoms and medication use, information from doctors such as diagnoses and test results, and information from their pharmacies and insurance companies. |author=[[Markle Foundation]]'s Personal Health Working Group |source=''Connecting for Health'' (2003)&lt;ref name=CFH&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.connectingforhealth.org/resources/final_phwg_report1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Connecting for Health: A Public-Private Collaborative |date=1 July 2003 |author=Personal Health Working Group |publisher=Markle Foundation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104212409/http://www.connectingforhealth.org/resources/final_phwg_report1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} }}

{{quote|text=The personal health record (PHR) is an electronic, universally available, lifelong resource of health information needed by individuals to make health decisions. Individuals own and manage the information in the PHR, which comes from healthcare providers and the individual. The PHR is maintained in a secure and private environment, with the individual determining rights of access. The PHR is separate from and does not replace the legal record of any provider. |author=[[American Health Information Management Association|AHIMA]] {{abbr|e-HIM|Electronic Health Information Management}} Personal Health Record Work Group (2005)&lt;ref name=AHIMA&gt;{{cite journal |author=AHIMA e-HIM Personal Health Record Work Group |title=The Role of the Personal Health Record in the EHR |journal=Journal of AHIMA |date=July 2005 |volume=76 |issue=7 |pages=64A–D |pmid=16097127 |url=http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_027539.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_027539 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920134400/http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_027539.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_027539 |archive-date=20 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

{{quote |text=The industry model personal health record (PHR) is a private, secure web-based tool maintained by an insurer that contains claims and administrative information. PHRs may also include information that is entered by consumers themselves, as well as data from other sources such as pharmacies, labs, and care providers. PHRs enable individual patients and their designated caregivers to view and manage health information and play a greater role in their own health care. |author=[[America's Health Insurance Plans]] (2006)&lt;ref name=AHIP&gt;{{cite web |author=America's Health Insurance Plans |author-link=America's Health Insurance Plans |title=What are Personal Health Records (PHRs)? |date=13 December 2006 |url=http://www.ahip.org/content/default.aspx?docid=18330 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305034515/http://www.ahip.org/content/default.aspx?docid=18330 |format=DOC |archivedate=5 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

It is important to note that PHRs are not the same as [[electronic health record]]s (EHRs) or electronic medical records (EMRs), which are software systems designed for use by health care providers.&lt;ref name=CFH/&gt;{{rp|19–20}}&lt;ref name=AHIP/&gt; Like the data recorded in paper-based medical records, the data in EHRs are legally mandated notes on the care provided by clinicians to patients. However, generally there is no mandate requiring patients to track their own health data. Like EHRs and EMRs, PHRs may still fall under the regulatory scope of governments, depending on their origin&lt;ref name="FlaumenhaftPersonal18"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal health records, global policy and regulation review |journal=Health Policy |author=Flaumenhaft, Y.; Ben-Assuli, O. |volume=In Press |year=2018 |doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HHS-PHR-HIPAA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/special/healthit/phrs.pdf |format=PDF |title=Personal Health Records and the HIPAA Privacy Rule |date=15 December 2008 |website=Office of Civil Rights |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |dead-url=no |archive-date=17 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217205629/https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/special/healthit/phrs.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;, but rigorous regulatory protection of their data is still lacking in parts of the world.&lt;ref name="FlaumenhaftPersonal18" /&gt;

PHRs can contain a diverse range of data, including but not limited to:
{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|
*[[Allergies]] and [[adverse drug reactions]],
*[[Chronic diseases]],
*[[Family history (medicine)|Family medical history]],
*Illnesses and hospitalizations,
*Imaging reports (e.g. [[X-ray]]),
*Laboratory test results,
*Medications and dosing,
*Prescription record,
*[[Surgeries]] and other procedures,
*[[Vaccinations]], and
*[[Observations of daily living]] (ODLs)
}}

There are two methods by which data can arrive in a PHR.&lt;ref name=Tang /&gt; A patient may enter it directly, either by typing into fields or uploading/transmitting data from a file or another website. The second is when the PHR is tethered to an electronic health record, which automatically updates the PHR. Not all PHRs have the same capabilities, and individual PHRs may support one or all of these methods.&lt;ref name=Tang /&gt;

In addition to storing an individual's personal health information, some PHRs provide added-value services such as drug-drug interaction checking, electronic messaging between patients and providers, managing appointments, and reminders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MyChart|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/eclevelandclinic/mychart/default.aspx?wt.mc_id=1400|publisher=Cleveland Clinic|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
PHRs grant patients access to a wide range of health information sources, best medical practices, and health knowledge. All of an individual’s medical records are stored in one place instead of paper-based files in various doctors’ offices. Upon encountering a medical condition, a patient can better access test results, communicate with their doctors, and share information with others suffering similarly.&lt;ref name="ArcherPersonal11"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal health records: A scoping review |journal=JAMIA |author=Archer, N.; Fevrier-Thomas, U.; Lokker, C. et al. |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=515–22 |year=2011 |doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000105 |pmid=21672914 |pmc=3128401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AssadiConsumer17"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consumer Adoption of Personal Health Record Systems: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |author=Assadi, V.; Hassanein, K. |volume=19 |issue=7 |page=e270 |year=2017 |doi=10.2196/jmir.7721 |pmid=28751301 |pmc=5553007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, PHRs can benefit clinicians. PHRs offer patients the opportunity to submit their data to their clinicians' EHRs. This may help clinicians make better treatment decisions by providing more continuous data&lt;ref name=Tang/&gt;, resulting in improved efficiency in care.&lt;ref name="FordPersonal16"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal Health Record Use in the United States: Forecasting Future Adoption Levels |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |author=Ford, E.W.; Hesse, B.W.; Huerta, T.R. |volume=18 |issue=3 |page=e73 |year=2016 |doi=10.2196/jmir.4973 |pmid=27030105 |pmc=4830902}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some physicians may have concerns about patient-entered information and its accuracy, as well as whether the added patient engagement creates more unreimbursable work.&lt;ref name="ArcherPersonal11" /&gt;

PHRs have the potential to help analyze an individual’s health profile and identify health threats and improvement opportunities based on an analysis of drug interaction, current best medical practices, gaps in current medical care plans, and identification of medical errors. Patient illnesses can be tracked in conjunction with healthcare providers, and early interventions can be promoted upon encountering deviation of health status. PHRs also make it easier for clinicians to care for their patients by facilitating continuous communication as opposed to episodic. Eliminating communication barriers and allowing documentation flow between patients and clinicians in a timely fashion can save time consumed by face-to-face meetings and telephone communication. Improved communication can also ease the process for patients and caregivers to ask questions, to set up appointments, to request refills and referrals, and to report problems. Additionally, in the case of an emergency a PHR can quickly provide critical information to proper diagnosis or treatment.&lt;ref name="ArcherPersonal11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AssadiConsumer17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FordPersonal16" /&gt;

== Architecture ==
Like other [[health information technology]], PHR architecture can be roughly organized into three main components
&lt;ref name=ResearchAgenda2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaelber|first1=David C.|last2=Jha|first2=Ashish K.|last3=Johnston|first3=Douglas|last4=Middleton|first4=Blackford|last5=Bates|first5=David W.|title=A Research Agenda for Personal Health Records (PHRs)|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|date=Nov–Dec 2008|volume=15|issue=6|pages=729–36|doi=10.1197/jamia.M2547|pmid=18756002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1067502708001473|pmc=2585530}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
; Data
: The information collected, stored, analyzed, and exchanged by the PHR.
: Examples: [[medical history]], [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] results, [[Medical imaging|imaging]] studies, [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]]
; Infrastructure
: The platform that handles data storage, processing, and exchange.
: Examples: stand-alone software programs or websites, provider- or payer-connected (tethered) websites
; Applications
: The information exchange, data analysis, and content delivery capabilities of the system.
: Examples: scheduling appointments, medication refill or renewal, [[decision aids]], and [[patient education]] materials.

Architecture types remain various. However, in 2017, Roehrs ''et al.'' performed a systematic literature review of PHRs and were able to divide architecture types into two groups: model-based and coverage-based. Model architectures represent more traditional takes on PHRs, including health data that is still stored on paper. Coverage architectures represent more hybrid takes on the PHR, "with the PHR distributed inside and outside the health care organizations" based on the data's physical location.&lt;ref name="RoehrsPersonal17"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal Health Records: A Systematic Literature Review |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |author=Roehrs, A.; da Costa, C.A.; da Rosa Righi, R.; de Oliveira, K.S.F. |volume=19 |issue=1 |page=e13 |year=2017 |doi=10.2196/jmir.5876 |pmid=28062391 |pmc=5251169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The associated architectural types have different costs and benefits. Likewise, stand-alone, provider-tethered, and payer-tethered PHRs have different advantages and disadvantages for patients related to their individual circumstances. Such differences are among the priority areas in PHR research.&lt;ref name=ResearchAgenda2008/&gt; As PHRs may play a key role in advancing health information exchange, [[interoperability]] with other health IT systems is an important consideration for PHR architecture.&lt;ref name=ResearchAgenda2008/&gt; Additionally, PHR systems requires users to put forth an "'ongoing' effort to keep their account up to date" (maintain an active role in managing their own health), which in turn requires further examination of PHR architecture and adoption models by developers.&lt;ref name="AssadiConsumer17" /&gt;

==Delivery platforms==
One of the principal distinguishing features of a PHR is the platform by which it is delivered. The types of platforms include: paper, electronic device, and web.

===Paper===
Personal health information is recorded and stored in paper format.  Printed laboratory reports, copies of clinic notes, and health histories created by the individual may be parts of a paper-based PHR. This method is low cost, reliable, and accessible without the need for a computer or any other hardware. Probably the most successful paper PHR is the hand-held pregnancy record, developed in Milton Keynes in the mid-1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=UK Department of Health |date=1993 |title=Changing Childbirth, Part II: Survey of good communications practice in maternity services |pages=25-26 |location=London |publisher=HMSO |isbn=0-11-321623-8 |oclc=925009321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and now in use throughout the United Kingdom. These include the Scottish Woman-Held Maternity Record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Woman Held Maternity Record|url=http://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org/programmes/reproductive,_maternal__child/woman_held_maternity_record.aspx|website=Healthcare Improvement Scotland|publisher=NHS Scotland|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Wales Maternity Record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Wales Maternity Record (Cofnod Mamolaeth Cymru Gyfan)|url=http://www.awcpp.org.uk/10460.file.dld|website=All Wales Child Protection Procedures Review Group|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627085435/http://www.awcpp.org.uk/10460.file.dld|archivedate=27 June 2013|format=PDF|date=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Perinatal Institute notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the notes|url=http://www.perinatal.nhs.uk/notes.htm|website=Perinatal Institute|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517044447/http://www.perinatal.nhs.uk/notes.htm|archivedate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Paper-based PHRs may be difficult to locate, update, and share with others. Paper-based PHRs are subject to physical loss and damage, such as can occur during a natural disaster. Paper records can also be printed from most electronic PHRs. However, Fawdry ''et al.'' have shown that paper records are extremely flexible and do have distinct advantages over rigid electronic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fawdry |first1=R |last2=Bewley |first2=S |last3=Cumming |first3=G |last4=Perry |first4=H |year=2011 |title=Data re-entry overload: time for a paradigm shift in maternity IT? |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=104 |pages=405–412 |pmid=21969478|pmc=3184532 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.2011.110153|issue=10 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic devices===
Personal health information is recorded and stored in [[Personal Computer|personal computer]]-based software that may have the capability to print, backup, encrypt, and import data from other sources such as a hospital laboratory. The most basic form of a PC-based PHR would be a health history created in a word-processing program.  The health history created in this way can be printed, copied, and shared with anyone with a compatible [[word processor]].

PHR software can provide more sophisticated features such as data [[encryption]], data importation, and data sharing with health care providers. Some PHR products allow the copying of health records to a mass-storage device such as a [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], [[smart card]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kardas G, Tunali ET |title=Design and implementation of a smart-card-based healthcare information system |journal=Comput Methods Programs Biomed. |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=66–78 |date=Jan 2006 |pmid=16356586 |doi=10.1016/j.cmpb.2005.10.006|last2=Tunali }} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[USB flash drive]].&lt;ref name=EncryptionUSB2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright A, Sittig DF |title=Encryption Characteristics of Two USB-based Personal Health Record Devices |journal=J Am Med Inform Assoc. |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=397–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17460132 |pmc=2244899 |doi=10.1197/jamia.M2352|last2=Sittig }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PC-based PHRs are subject to physical loss and damage of the personal computer and the data that it contains. Some other methods of device solution may entail cards with embedded chips containing health information that may or may not be linked to a personal computer application or a web solution.

===Web applications===
Web-based PHR solutions are essentially the same as electronic device PHR solutions, however, web-based solutions have the advantage of being easily integrated with other services. For example, some solutions allow for import of medical data from external sources. Solutions including [[HealthVault]], and [[PatientsLikeMe]] allow data to be shared with other applications or specific people. Mobile solutions often integrate themselves with web solutions and use the web-based solution as the platform.

A large number of companies have emerged to provide consumers the opportunity to develop online PHRs. Some have been developed by non-profit organizations, while others have been developed by commercial ventures. These web-based applications allow users to directly enter their information such as diagnosis, medications, laboratory tests, immunizations and other data associated with their health. They generate records that can be displayed for review or transmitted to authorized receivers.

Despite the need for PHRs and the availability of various online PHR providers, there has not been wide adoption of PHR services. In fact, [[Google]], being among the most innovative companies in the world, discontinued its PHR service called [[Google Health]] on January 12, 2012. The reason cited for shutting down Google Health was that the service did not translate from its limited usage into widespread usage in the daily health routines of millions of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/update-on-google-health-and-google.html |title=An update on Google Health and Google PowerMeter |last1=Brown |first1=Aaron |last2=Weihl |first2=Bill |date=24 June 2011 |work=The Official Google Blog |publisher=Google |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/25/technology/25health.html|title=Google Is Closing Its Health Records Service|last=Lohr|first=Steve|date=2011-06-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys of web-based services have found wide variations in functions between services and only limited data on efficacy and safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernández-Alemán|first=José Luis|last2=Seva-Llor|first2=Carlos Luis|last3=Toval|first3=Ambrosio|last4=Ouhbi|first4=Sofia|last5=Fernández-Luque|first5=Luis|date=2013-11-13|title=Free Web-based Personal Health Records: An Analysis of Functionality|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10916-013-9990-z|journal=Journal of Medical Systems|language=en|volume=37|issue=6|pages=9990|doi=10.1007/s10916-013-9990-z|issn=0148-5598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menon|first=Shailaja|last2=Singh|first2=Hardeep|last3=Meyer|first3=Ashley N.

== EHRs, PHRs, patient portals and UHRs ==
The terms [[electronic health records]], personal health records, and [[patient portals]] are not always used correctly.  The generally agreed upon definition of these terms relates mainly to the ''ownership'' of the data. Once data is in a PHR it usually owned and controlled by the patient. Most EHRs, however, are the property of the provider, although the content can be co-created by both the provider and patient.  A patient has a legal right in most states to request their healthcare data and under recent USA legislation those providers using a certified EHR will be required to provide an electronic copy as well. In the UK, according to the governments's information strategy for the NHS every primary care practice in England will have to offer patients online access to their care records by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=UK Department of Health |authorlink1=Department of Health (United Kingdom) |title=The power of information: giving people control of the health and care information they need |website=Gov.UK |date=21 May 2012 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/giving-people-control-of-the-health-and-care-information-they-need}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, only 1% did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Peter|title=Should patients be able to control their own records|journal=BMJ|date=30 July 2012|volume=345|issue=e4905|doi=10.1136/bmj.e4905|pmid=22846414|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e4905|accessdate=30 August 2012|pages=e4905}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electronic health records]] and [[electronic medical records]] contain clinical data created by and for health professionals in the course of providing care.  The data is about the patient but the data resides in a health care provider's system.  The [[patient portal]] is typically defined as a view into the electronic medical records.  In addition, ancillary functions that support a health care provider's interaction with a patient are also found in those systems e.g. prescription refill requests, appointment requests, electronic case management, etc.  Finally, PHRs are data that resides with the patient, in a system of the patient's choosing.  This data may have been exported directly from an EMR, but the point is it now resides in a location of the patient's choosing.  Access to that information is controlled entirely by the patient.

A new concept being discussed is the UHR or "universal health record",&lt;ref name="UHR"&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Morgenthaler |title=Moving Toward an Open Standard, Universal Health Record |url=http://www.smart-publications.com/health_commentaries/Universal_Health_Record.php |website=Smart Publications |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111153122/http://www.smart-publications.com/health_commentaries/Universal_Health_Record.php |archivedate=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be a patient-centered and patient-controlled body of information that could be shared in a granular way with particular health care providers at the patient's discretion in support of the patient's work with health care providers. This project would enlist [[open source]] contributions and enhancements from developers, with particular emphasis on supporting patient expectations of privacy and responsible patient control of private health information (PHI).

While PHRs can help patients keep track of their personal health information, the value of PHRs to healthcare organizations is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaelber |first1=David |last2=Pan |first2=Eric |year=2008 |title=The Value of Personal Health Record (PHR) Systems |journal=AMIA Annu Symp Proc |pages=343–347 |pmid=18999276 |pmc=2655982 |volume=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Barriers to adoption ==
Since the [[National Academy of Medicine]] (previously the Institute of Medicine) called for greater adoption of PHRs in 1999&lt;ref name="FordPersonal16" /&gt;, the software has faced many barriers to adoption, including economic, technological, regulatory, behavioral, and organizational issues at both the environmental and individual levels.&lt;ref name=Tang/&gt;&lt;ref name="AssadiConsumer17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FordPersonal16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Matthew |last2=Johnson |first2=Kevin |year=2002 |title=Personal health records: evaluation of functionality and utility |journal=JAMIA |pages=171–180 |pmid=11861632 |pmc=344574 |volume=9 |issue=2 |doi=10.1197/jamia.M0978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShowellBarriers17"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Barriers to the use of personal health records by patients: A structured review |journal=PeerJ |author=Showell, C. |volume=5 |page=e3268 |year=2017 |doi=10.7717/peerj.3268 |pmid=28462058 |pmc=5410160}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study from 2002 was carried out in an effort to assess the functionality and utility of the budding online PHR. It found that most people did not keep record of minute details of their healthcare experiences and therefore made it difficult to get full value from web-based PHRs. The PHRs selected for evaluation offered limited functionality to the general public, with limitations in data entry, validation, and information display methods.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; A 2005 survey found that limited access to computers and the internet access, as well as low computer literacy levels, known as the [[digital divide]], was a barrier for low-income and aged populations.&lt;ref name=ElderlyBarriers2008&gt;{{Citation | last = Lober | first = WB | last2 = Zierler | first2 = B | last3 = Herbaugh | first3 = AL | last4 = Shinstrom | first4 = SE | last5 = Stolyar | first5 = A | last6 = Kim | first6 = EH | last7 = Kim | first7 = Y | year = 2006 | title = Barriers to the use of a Personal Health Record by an Elderly Population | periodical = AMIA Annu Symp Proc | pages = 514–8 | pmid = 17238394 | pmc = 1839577}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010–11 set of interviews of clinicians and patients found "that both usability concerns and socio-cultural influences are barriers to PHR adoption and use."&lt;ref name="LiuBarriers11"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Barriers to the adoption and use of personal health record systems |journal=Proceedings of the 2011 iConference |author=Liu, L.S.; Shih, P.C.; Hayes, G.R. |page=363–70 |year=2011 |doi=10.1145/1940761.1940811}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies and reviews in the mid- to late 2010s have revealed other issues such as privacy and confidentiality concerns, lack of motivation, low health literacy, health- and disease-related disabilities, and even administrative burdens.&lt;ref name="AssadiConsumer17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FordPersonal16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ShowellBarriers17" /&gt; 

=== Promotion and usability ===
Additionally, how the PHR is promoted by healthcare organizations, how useful their features are, and how well the care provider uses it, particularly in the realm of patient communication, can influence adoption and usage rates.&lt;ref name="RedlingPersonal12"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal Health Record Usage and Medical Practices |journal=Physicians Practice |author=Redling, R. |volume=22 |year=2012 |url=http://www.physicianspractice.com/personal-health-records/personal-health-record-usage-and-medical-practices/ |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PushpangadanConsumer15"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consumer Perspective on Personal Health Records: A Review of the Literature |journal=Online Journal of Nursing Informatics |author=Pushpangadan, S.; Seckman, C. |volume=19 |issue=1 |year=2015 |url=https://www.himss.org/consumer-perspective-personal-health-records-review-literature |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion may occur at several steps of the development and implementation process, from developers talking with providers about a proposed system, clinics forming patient focus groups, and providers posting physical and digital news of the PHR to patients.&lt;ref name="RedlingPersonal12" /&gt; The features and  usability of the system also drive adoption, with groups such as Kaiser Permanente and Cleveland Clinic seeing substantial increases in PHR use when adding the features users want.&lt;ref name="RedlingPersonal12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PushpangadanConsumer15" /&gt; Provider use and communication has also proved important; "[s]ecure communication with the physician is important because the patients will eventually leave (the PHR) if there is no conversation going on with the physician."&lt;ref name="RedlingPersonal12" /&gt; Additional studies have also show that when put to use, PHR's ability to enhance communication and collaboration can change patient patterns from sporadic visits to steady visits, and more significant PHR use.&lt;ref name="PushpangadanConsumer15" /&gt;

==Privacy and security ==
One of the most controversial issues for PHRs is how the technology could threaten the privacy of patient's protected health information (PHI). [[Medical data breach|Network computer break-in]]s are becoming more common&lt;ref name="ONCBreaches16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/breaches-protected-health-information.php |title=Breaches of Unsecured Protected Health Information |author=Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology |work=Health IT Dashboard |date=February 2016 |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, thus storing medical information online can cause fear of the exposure of health information to unauthorized individuals.&lt;ref name="CerratoMedical17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publichealthonline.gwu.edu/healthcare-data-breaches/ |title=Medical Data Breaches: The Latest Health Care Epidemic |author=Cerrato, P. |work=GW Public Health Online Blog |publisher=Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University |date=28 June 2017 |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to height, weight, blood pressure and other quantitative information about a patient's physical body, medical records can reveal very sensitive information. This includes fertility, surgical procedures, emotional and psychological disorders, and diseases, which many patients are reluctant to share even voluntarily.&lt;ref name="WeitzmanWilling12" /&gt; 

Various threats exist to patient information confidentiality:

; Accidental disclosure
: During multiple electronic transfers of data to various entities, medical personnel can make innocent mistakes to cause disclosure of data.&lt;ref name="EllisonTopThree14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/top-3-security-threats-to-the-healthcare-industry-tips-to-avoid-them.html |title=Top 3 Security Threats to the Healthcare Industry, Tips to Avoid Them |author=Ellison, A. |work=Becker's Health IT &amp; CIO Report |publisher=Becker's Healthcare |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Insider curiosity
: Medical personnel may misuse their access to patient information out of curiosity or for another purpose.&lt;ref name="EllisonTopThree14" /&gt;
; Insider subordination
: Medical personnel may leak out personal medical information for spite, profit, revenge, or other purposes.&lt;ref name="EllisonTopThree14" /&gt;
; Uncontrolled secondary usage
: Those who are granted access to patient information solely for the purpose of supporting primary care can exploit that permission for reasons not listed in the contract, such as research.&lt;ref name="HIQAInternat12"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hiqa.ie/system/files/Review-Secondary-Use-Health-Info.pdf |format=PDF |title=International Review of Secondary Use of Personal Health Information |author=Health Information and Quality Authority |publisher=Health Information and Quality Authority |date=January 2012 |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Outsider intrusion
: Former employees, network intruders, hackers, or others may access and steal information, steal hardware, damage systems, and disrupt operations.&lt;ref name="EllisonTopThree14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeBrisState17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.harvard.edu/cybersecurity/files/2017/01/risks-and-threats-healthcare-strategic-report.pdf |format=PDF |title=State of Cybersecurity &amp; Cyber Threats in Healthcare Organizations: Applied Cybersecurity Strategy for Managers |author=Le Bris, A.; El Asri, W. |publisher=ESSEC Business School |year=2017 |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological and regulatory issues play important roles in the privacy, security, and patient concerns surrounding PHI. On the technological side, failures occur at numerous points:

* breach of a patient data server connected to other unsecure systems&lt;ref name="DavisOCR18"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/ocr-investigating-banner-health-2016-breach-37-million-patient-records |title=OCR investigating Banner Health for 2016 breach of 3.7 million patient records |author=Davis, J. |work=Heathcare IT News |publisher=HIMSS Media |date=21 March 2018 |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* malware intentionally or accidentally installed on a server&lt;ref name="SanbornLifeBridge18"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/lifebridge-health-reveals-breach-compromised-health-data-500000-patients |title=LifeBridge Health reveals breach that compromised health data of 500,000 patients |author=Sanborn, B.J. |work=Heathcare IT News |publisher=HIMSS Media |date=23 May 2018 |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of PHR regulations are also worth mentioning.

PHRs have the potential to benefit the public health sector in areas such as health monitoring, outbreak monitoring, empowerment through information and resources, linking to services, and research.&lt;ref name="BowerActive17"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bower |first=JK |last2=Bollinger |first2=CE |last3=Foraker |first3=RE |last4=Hood |first4=DB |last5=Shoben |first5=AB |last6=Lai |first6=AM |title=Active Use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Personal Health Records (PHRs) for Epidemiologic Research: Sample Representativeness and Nonresponse Bias in a Study of Women During Pregnancy |journal=eGEMS |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1263 |year=2017 |doi=10.13063/2327-9214.1263 |pmc=5340503 |pmid=28303255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BonanderPublic10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bonander |first1=J |last2=Gates |first2=S |title=Public health in an era of personal health records: Opportunities for innovation and new partnerships |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=e33 |year=2010 |doi=10.2196/jmir.1346 |pmc=2956336 |pmid=20699216}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tapping into this potential has been a slow process due to both the public health sector not fully engaging with adopters&lt;ref name="BonanderPublic10" /&gt; and the adopters themselves exhibiting "reticence to share sensitive information."&lt;ref name="WeitzmanWilling12"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Willingness to share personal health record data for care improvement and public health: A survey of experienced personal health record users |journal=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making |author=Weitzman, E.R.; Kelemen, S.; Kaci, L.; Mandl, K.D. |volume=12 |page=39 |year=2012 |doi=10.1186/1472-6947-12-39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several surveys of Americans in the twenty-first century have indicated that anywhere between 63 to 73% would be willing to share at least some personal health information with public health officials for detecting disease outbreaks and other purposes.&lt;ref name="WeitzmanWilling12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MarkleSurvey06"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.markle.org/sites/default/files/research_doc_120706.pdf |format=PDF |title=Survey Finds Americans Want Electronic Personal Health Information to Improve Own Health Care |author=Lake Research Partners; American Viewpoint |publisher=Markle Foundation |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, caveats about retaining control of how the information is presented and used remain strong among respondents&lt;ref name="WeitzmanWilling12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MarkleSurvey06" /&gt;, with concerns about anonymity, government insensitivity, and discrimination.&lt;ref name="WeitzmanWilling12" /&gt; Given the questionable state of regulatory efforts to protect PHR data&lt;ref name="FlaumenhaftPersonal18" /&gt; from these and other concerns, the standard use of health data from PHRs in public health may still be far away.

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has taken the idea of PHR integration with public health efforts a step further, in 2016 suggesting a framework for a community health record "for integrating and transforming multisector data into actionable information."&lt;ref name="KingAComm16"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Community Health Record: Improving Health Through Multisector Collaboration, Information Sharing, and Technology |journal=Preventing Chronic Disease |author=King, R.J.; Garrett, N.; Kriseman, J. et al. |volume=13 |page=160101 |year=2016 |doi=10.5888/pcd13.160101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration of EHR, PHR, and county health data would allow the integration and presentation of data across residential blocks to entire zip codes. However, like PHR, significant social approval would have to occur, and data use agreements would have to be established.&lt;ref name="KingAComm16" /&gt;

The '''principles of motion economy''' form a set of rules and suggestions to improve the manual work in [[manufacturing]] and reduce [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and unnecessary movements by the worker, which can lead to the reduction in the work related [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]].

== Categories ==
The principles of motion economy can be classified into four groups:&lt;ref&gt;Kanawaty, G. (1992). ''Introduction to work study'', International Labour Office, {{ISBN|978-92-2-107108-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, F. E., Stewart, J. R., (2002). ''Motion and time study: for lean manufacturing'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|978-0-13-031670-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Principles related to the use of ''human body'',
# Principles related to the arrangement of the ''work place'',
# Principles related to the ''design of tools and equipment''.
# Principles related to ''time conservation''.

=== Use of Human Body ===
* The two hands should begin motions at the same time.  
* The two hands should not be idle at the same time except during rest periods.  
* Motions of the arms should be made in opposite and symmetrical directions and should be made simultaneously  
* Hand motions should be confined to the lowest classification with which it is possible to perform the work satisfactorily:
:#Finger motions
:#Wrist motions
:#Forearm motions
:#Upper arm motions
:#Shoulder motions 
* Momentum should be employed to assist the worker whenever possible, and it should be reduced to a minimum if it must be overcome by muscular effort.  
* Smooth continuous motions of the hands are preferable to zigzag motions or straight-line motions involving sudden and sharp changes in direction.
* Ballistic (i.e. free swinging) movements are faster, easier and more accurate than restricted or controlled movements.

=== Arrangement of the Work Place ===
* There should be a definite and fixed place for all tools and materials.  
* Tools, materials, and controls should be located close in and directly in front of the operator.  
* Drop delivers should be used whenever possible.  
* Materials and tools should be located to permit the best sequence of motions. 
* Arrange the height of the workplace and chair for alternate sitting and standing, when possible.  
* Provide a chair of the type and height to permit good posture.

=== Design of Tools and Equipment ===
* Combine tools whenever possible.  
* Preposition tools and materials.  
* Where each finger performs some specific movement, the load should be distributed in accordance with the inherent capacities of the fingers.  
* For light assembly, a screwdriver handle should be smaller at the bottom.
* Momentum should be used to help the worker in doing their task not to increase their task.

=== Time Conservation ===

* Even a temporary delay of work by a man or machine should not be encouraged.
* Machine should not run idle, it is not desirable that a lathe machine is running and its job is rotating but no cut is being taken.
* Two or more jobs should be worked upon at the same time or two or more operations should be carried out on a job simultaneously if possible.
* Number of motion involved in completing a job should be minimized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3706">A '''rare functional variant''' is a [[Mutation|genetic variant]] which alters gene function, and which occurs at low [[Allele frequency|frequency]] in a population.  Rare variants may play a significant role in complex disease, as well as some [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] conditions. Rare variants may be responsible for a portion of the missing [[heritability]] of complex diseases. The theoretical case for a significant role of rare variants is that [[allele]]s that strongly predispose an individual to disease will be kept at low frequencies in populations by [[purifying selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=DB|last2=Allen|first2=A|last3=Keebler|first3=J|last4=Margulies|first4=EH|last5=Petrou|first5=S|last6=Petrovski|first6=S|last7=Sunyaev|first7=S|title=Sequencing studies in human genetics: design and interpretation.|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=July 2013|volume=14|issue=7|pages=460–70|pmid=23752795|doi=10.1038/nrg3455|pmc=4117319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare variants are increasingly being studied, as a consequence of [[Exome sequencing|exome]] and [[whole genome sequencing]] efforts.

'''Religious views on smoking''' vary widely.  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] have traditionally used [[tobacco]] for religious purposes, while Abrahamic and other religions have only been introduced to the practice in recent times due to the [[European colonization of the Americas]] in the 16th century.

==Abrahamic religions==
With the exception of a few [[Christian denomination]]s, the [[Abrahamic religions]] originated before tobacco smoking was introduced to Europe from the New World. Therefore, these religions do not address it in their foundational teachings; however, modern practitioners have offered interpretations of their faith with regard to smoking.

===Christianity===
{{see also|Tobacco control#Early history of tobacco control}}
[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was known to enjoy smoking a pipe, and wrote poetry on how doing so enhanced his relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1725). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516212245/http://waeshael.home.att.net/edifying.htm Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, smoking was considered as inappropriate by certain [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Thompson |editor-first=Kenneth |date=2013 |chapter=7. The spread of the tobacco complex |title=Culture &amp; progress |url={{Google books|GeSAAAAAQBAJ|page=98|plainurl=yes}} |series=Early sociology of culture |volume=8 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=98 |isbn=978-1-136-47940-3 |quote=In 1877 the Methodist Episcopal Conference prohibited the use of tobacco by its ministers […]. Some other churches discourage or prohibit the use of it by members. […] in the revelation to Prophet Joseph Smith in 1833 there was this declaration: '[…] tobacco is not good for man […].'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1874 [[George Frederick Pentecost]] got into the so-called [[Daily Telegraph]] scandal: a smoking controversy, over which his counterpart [[Charles Spurgeon]], known as the 'prince of preachers', was exploited by the [[tobacco industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spurgeon's love of fine cigars |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/misc/cigars.php |publisher=The [[Spurgeons|Spurgeon]] Archive |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco was listed, along with drunkenness, gambling, cards, dancing and theatre-going, in J.M. Judy's ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/jmjdy10.txt Questionable Amusements and Worthy Substitutes]'', a book featuring anti-smoking dialogue which was published in 1904 by the Western [[Methodist]] Book of Concern.

Though there is no official [[canon law|canonical]] prohibition regarding the use of tobacco, the more traditional among the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es forbid their [[clergy]] or [[monasticism|monastics]] to smoke, and the [[laity]] are strongly encouraged to give up this habit, if they are subject to it. One who smokes is considered to be polluting the "Temple of the Holy Spirit" (i.e., the body), which has been sanctified by the reception of the [[Sacred Mysteries]] (Sacraments). (The view of the body being the "temple of the Holy Spirit" is also common in Protestant circles, and is quoted as a basis against not only tobacco use, but recreational drugs, eating disorders, sexual immorality, and other vices which can be harmful to the body. The Bible reference is I Corinthians 6:7-20.) In Orthodox cultures, various derogatory terms have developed to describe smoking, such as "[[incense]] of Satan". Father Alexander Lebedeff described the Orthodox approach as follows:
{{blockquote|You ask, "Are there canons that speak to the issues of … tobacco?" I would ask you, where are the Canons that forbid use of marijuana or snorting cocaine or downloading pornography from the Internet? Obviously, there are none. Does this mean that your innate Orthodox common sense should not be enough to guide you to recognize what is healthy and what is not? The Canons should not be considered a compendium of answers to all possible questions. God gave us a mind and a conscience and we should use them to determine what is right and what is wrong, whether or not the particular yes issue has been addressed in the canons or not.&lt;br /&gt;Smoking tobacco is a disgusting, filthy, addictive habit that turns the mouth of the smoker into an ashtray. It not only poisons the body of the smoker but pollutes the air that others around the smoker breathe. It is absolutely incompatible with the dignity of the Orthodox Priesthood, diaconate, or monastic state, whether the Canons specifically address it or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] does not condemn smoking, but considers excessive smoking to be sinful, as described in the Catechism (CCC 2290):
{{blockquote|The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine.}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have not permitted any active members to smoke since 1973,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000647 "Life Story: Jehovah Always Rewards His Loyal Ones", ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 2000, page 26.] The footnote reads: "The Watchtower of June 1, 1973, explained why from that time forward, an individual would need to quit smoking before he could be baptized and become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses."&lt;/ref&gt; and their literature has warned about physical and spiritual dangers of smoking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102000202 "Why Quit Smoking?", ''Awake!'', March 22, 2000, pages 4-7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] also requires its members to abstain from tobacco use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; It has called for governments to enact policies that include "a uniform ban on all tobacco advertising, stricter laws prohibiting smoking in non-residential public places, more aggressive and systematic public education, and substantially higher taxes on cigarettes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Joseph Smith]], recorded that on February 27, 1833 he received a [[revelation]] which addressed tobacco use. It is commonly known as the [[Word of Wisdom]], found in section 89 of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and prohibits the smoking or chewing of tobacco. ({{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89}}) While initially viewed as a guideline, this was eventually accepted as a commandment by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. The Word of Wisdom is also practiced to various degrees by other [[Latter Day Saint denominations]].

===Islam===
{{see also|Tobacco fatwa}}
The first [[fatwa]]s discouraging the use of tobacco dates from 1602.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=How tobacco firms try to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/04/21/84683.php|accessdate=5 February 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Observer (Bangladesh)|The Daily Observer]]|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, [[tobacco fatwa]]s (Islamic legal pronouncements) have been issued due to health concerns.

The holy book of [[Islam]], the [[Qur'ān]], does not specifically prohibit or denounce smoking, but gives behavioral guidance:

* “You may eat, drink, but not waste” (el-A‘râf 7/31)

In practice, at least one recent survey (Abbottabad, [[Pakistan]]) found that observant Muslims tend to avoid smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hameed|first1=A|last2=Jalil|first2=MA|last3=Noreen|first3=R|last4=Mughal|first4=I|last5=Rauf|first5=S|title=Role of Islam in prevention of smoking.|journal=Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad|date=2002|volume=14|issue=1|pages=23-5|pmid=12043328|url=http://www.ayubmed.edu.pk/JAMC/PAST/14-1/Hameed.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of young Muslim Arab-Americans found that Islamic influences were correlated with some diminished smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Islam|first1=SM|last2=Johnson|first2=CA|title=Correlates of smoking behavior among Muslim Arab-American adolescents.|journal=Ethnicity &amp; Health|date=November 2003|volume=8|issue=4|pages=319-37|doi=10.1080/13557850310001631722|pmid=14660124|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714038251~db=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, an Egyptian study found that knowledge of an anti-smoking [[fatwa]] did not reduce smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radwan |first1=GN |last2=Israel |first2=E |last3=El-Setouhy |first3=M |last4=Abdel-Aziz |first4=F |last5=Mikhail |first5=N |last6=Mohamed |first6=MK |title=Impact of religious rulings (Fatwa) on smoking. |journal=Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology |date=December 2003 |volume=33 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1087-101 |pmid=15119472 |url=http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012204303/http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |archivedate=2004-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the prevalence of smoking is increasing in Islamic countries.

The prominent scholar [[Yusuf al Qaradawi]] argues that smoking is no longer an issue of dispute among Islamic scholars due to the knowledge of health risks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reported juristic disagreement among Muslim scholars on the ruling concerning smoking, since its appearance and spread, is not usually based on differences between legal proofs, but on the difference in the verification of the cause on which the ruling is based. They all agree that whatever is proved to be harmful to the body and mind is prohibited, yet they differ whether this ruling applies to smoking. Some of them claimed that smoking has some benefits, others assured that it had few disadvantages compared to its benefits, whereas a third group maintained that it had neither benefits nor bad effects. This means that if scholars had been certain about the harmfulness of smoking, then they would undoubtedly have considered it prohibited.[…]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Second: Our inclination to consider smoking prohibited does not mean that it is as grave as major sins like adultery, drinking alcohol or theft. In fact, prohibited matters in Islam are relative; some of them are minor prohibitions whereas others are major, and each has its own ruling. The major sins, for example, have no expiation other than sincere repentance. However, the minor sins can be expiated by the Five Prayers, the [[Friday Prayer]], the Fasting of [[Ramadan]], the Night Vigil Prayer in Ramadan, and other acts of worship. They can also be expiated by avoiding the major sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192447/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |title=Is the Ruling on Smoking Still Controversial? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |archivedate=13 February 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All contemporary rulings tend to condemn smoking as potentially harmful or prohibit ([[haraam|haram]]) smoking outright as a cause of severe health damage. [[Arab Muslims]] tend to prohibit smoking (despite [[Saudi Arabia]] ranking 23rd in the world for the percentage of its population that smokes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanbedu.com/2009/10/09/saudi-arabia-don%E2%80%99t-keep-us-from-smoking/|title=Saudi Arabia:  Don’t Keep Us From Smoking|work=American Bedu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in South Asia, smoking tends to be considered lawful but discouraged:&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghouri|first1=N|last2=Atcha|first2=M|last3=Sheikh|first3=A|title=Influence of Islam on smoking among Muslims.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=4 February 2006|volume=332|issue=7536|pages=291-4|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7536.291|pmid=16455732|pmc=1360407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In many parts of the Arabic speaking world, the legal status of smoking has further changed during recent years, and numerous religious edicts or fatawa, including from notable authorities such as [[Al-Azhar University]] in Egypt, now declare smoking to be prohibited. The reasons cited in support of the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include Islamic law's general prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example, the Qur’an says, "And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to your own destruction (2; 195)." Additionally, jurists rely on the exhortations in the Qur’an not to waste money. Greater appreciation of the risks associated with [[passive smoking]], has also led recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance, distress, or harm to other people.&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
====Backlash====
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, tobacco companies including [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]] were involved in campaigns to undermine fatwas against smoking in [[Muslim majority countries]] by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a {{"'}}fundamentalist'? who wishes to return to [[Shariah|sharia law]]", and be "a threat to existing government".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boseley |first1=Sarah |title=How tobacco firms tried to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/20/tobacco-firms-tried-undermine-muslim-countries-smoking-ban|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[tobacco industry]] was also concerned that the [[World Health Organization]]'s encouraging of anti-smoking stance of [[Ulama|Muslim scholars]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO: "This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO ... The WHO has not only joined forces with Muslim fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Judaism===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Chofetzchaim1.jpg|thumb|The Jewish leader Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, an anti-smoking advocate.]] --&gt;
{{main article|Jewish law and history on smoking}}

Early on in the Hasidic movement, the [[Baal Shem Tov]] taught that smoking tobacco can be used as a religious devotion, and can even help bring the Messianic Era.  Rabbi [[Levi Yitchak of Berditchev]] is quoted as saying that "a Jew smokes on the weekdays and sniffs tobacco on the Sabbath".  Rabbi [[Dovid of Lelov]] taught that it is a good religious practice to smoke on Saturday nights after the Sabbath, and this practice is followed by the Rebbes of [[Lelov (Hasidic dynasty)|Lelov]] and [[Skulen (Hasidic dynasty)|Skulen]], however the current Rebbe of Skulen discourages people from following his example, in light of current views opposing smoking, and he himself only takes a few brief puffs of a cigarette after [[Havdalah]].  Many Hasidic Jews smoke, and many who do not smoke regularly will smoke on the holiday of [[Purim]], even if they do not do so any other time of the year, and some consider it to be a spiritual practice, similar to the smoke of the altar in the ancient Temple.  However, in recent years, many Hasidic Rabbis have come out against smoking, as have rabbis of other movements.

Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (1838–1933) was one of the first [[Judaism|Jewish]] authorities to speak out on smoking. He considered it a health risk and a waste of time, and had little patience for those who claimed addiction, stating that they never should have started smoking in the first place (''Likutei Amarim'' 13, ''Zechor le-Miriam'' 23).

A shift toward health-oriented concerns may be observed in different rabbinic interpretations of Jewish law (''[[halakha]]''). For instance, at a time when the link between smoking and health was still in doubt, Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] issued an influential opinion in 1963 stating that smoking was permitted, although still inadvisable. (''Igrot Moshe'' Y.D. II:49)

More recently, rabbinic [[responsa]] tend to argue that smoking is prohibited as self-endangerment under Jewish law and that smoking in indoor spaces should be restricted as a type of damage to others.  The self-endangerment rule is grounded partly on a Biblical verse that is read as an injunction to watch one's health - "ונשמרתם מאד, לנפשתיכם"  [Vi'nish'martem Me'od Li'naf'sho'tey'chem] {{bibleverse|Deut.||04:15|HE}} "And you shall watch yourselves very well..." Similarly, rabbinic rules against damaging others are traced back to Biblical and [[Talmud]]ic laws.

Famous Ashkenazi [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] rabbis have called on people not to smoke and called smoking an 'evil habit.' These rabbis include Rabbi [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv]], Rabbi [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]], Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Shapiro]], Rabbi [[Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz]], Rabbi [[Nissim Karelitz]], and Rabbi [[Shmuel Auerbach]]. Rabbi [[Shmuel Wosner|Shmuel HaLevi Wosner]] forbade people from starting to smoke and said that those who smoke should stop doing so. All of these rabbis also said that it is forbidden to smoke in a public place, where others might be bothered by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704132739/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking2.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704223348/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/vayakhel/VLasmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704131007/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/vayakhel/VLasmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among important Sephardi Haredi rabbis, Rabbi [[Ben Tzion Abba Shaul]] and Rabbi [[Moshe Tzedaka]] called on youth not to start smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5762/korach/KR62osmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907195654/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5762/korach/KR62osmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major Ashkenazi rabbis who explicitly forbade smoking include Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]], Rabbi [[Moshe Stern]], and Rabbi [[Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg]].

==Hinduism==

While not explicitly prohibited in Hinduism, tobacco use is seen as a kind of intoxication, and as such should not be done in public. Vaishnavas of ISKCON, founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, are prohibited from using tobacco.

Communal smoking of a sacred pipe is a religious ceremony in a number of Native American cultures, while other tribes are social smokers only, if they smoke at all. In some cases [[tobacco]] is smoked, in other cases, ''[[kinnikinnick]]'', or a combination of the two.

Naturally grown and harvested tobacco, prepared in the ways traditional to intact [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] ceremonial communities, is very different from commercially-marketed tobacco.&lt;ref name="Sacred"&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Traditional vs. Commercial Tobacco|url=http://keepitsacred.itcmi.org/tobacco-and-tradition/traditional-v-commercial/ |website=Keep It Sacred - National Native Network|accessdate=Oct 9, 2016|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Big Tobacco and Minorities: Native American Statistics |url=

There is a movement among Native peoples, including a resolution by The [[National Congress of American Indians]], to make sure that only naturally-grown tobacco is used in ceremonies,&lt;ref name="Sacred"/&gt; and that social smoking and use of commercial tobacco be avoided or ended altogether.&lt;ref name="Sacred"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vargas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vargas|first1=Yvonne|title= Tobacco use snuffing out dreams of Native communities|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2006/12/20/tobacco-use-snuffing-out-dreams-native-communities-129230/ |publisher= [[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |website= indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com|date=Dec 20, 2006|accessdate=Oct 9, 2016|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pagan faiths==
Tobacco use holds a sacred and/or neutral view in numerous if not all pagan religions and seen in some as liberty and intoxication with the [[Deity|divine]].

==Sikhism==
[[Guru Gobind Singh]] prohibited his [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] from smoking tobacco. He called tobacco "jagat jhoot" ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: "the world's lie").

A legend states that when Guru Gobind Singh Ji was riding his blue horse, Neela, it would not enter a tobacco field and reared up in front of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Guru_Gobind_Singh_and_Tobacco |title=Guru Gobind Singh and Tobacco |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroastrianism==

The idea of smoking tobacco has been looked down upon in modern [[Zoroastrian]] communities due to the scientific knowledge of it causing harm to the body. This stance on smoking does not have a direct relation to the texts of the [[Avestas]] and is not stated in the religion, rather the religion teaches to not misuse fire as it is holy. Zoroastrianism teaches to do what is best for the world based on the knowledge a person has on the topic, and indirectly the knowledge of smoking being harmful to the body causes people to condemn the act.

[[File:Single RCBR module.JPG|thumb|A single RCBR module]]

The '''rotating cell biofilm reactor (RCBR)''' is a new type of biological process based on [[biofilm]] active sludge used in [[Wastewater treatment|wastewaters treatment]]. RCBR reactors represent an evolution of [[rotating biological contactors]] plants: in fact, they are able to develop about ten times the biological surface of rotating biological contactors plants, considering the same biological reactors volume (made of the set of disks). Such a result is obtained using – instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree – many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary biological surface for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the depuration process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the reactor cell of a traditional rotating RBC plant. One of the main peculiarity of the RCBR plant is represented by the fact that the biological carriers are common recycled water bottle plastic caps.

The intrinsic message of this technology is obvious: ''“transform a waste into a resource for the environment”''.

After a first settling and/or screening treatment, wastewaters to be treated (civil, industrial, domestic) are pumped into RCBR modules. By the wastewaters contact, plastic caps are covered by a bacterial biological film. Bacteria are nourished by the organic substance dissolved into the water, purifying it. Purified waters can be drained on a surface body water or on the ground. If they are conveniently disinfected and complementing the modules with a tertiary depuration plant, these waters can be used to irrigate, to full the toilets, to wash objects and streets.

[[File:RCBR core component.JPG|thumb|RCBR rotating cell containing bacterial carriers]]

== Functioning ==
A stainless steel cell, full of plastic caps of different dimension, slowly rotates (1–3 rpm) partially submerged inside a tank, where there are wastewaters to be purified. Plastic caps spontaneously form a bacterial film that progressively presents, at first, [[Heterotrophic microorganism|heterotrophic]] bacteria development which are able to nourish of organic carbon pollutants; then the decrease of [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] concentration and then the development of [[Autotrophic nutrition|autotrophic]] bacteria. They belong to the [[nitrosomonas]] and [[nitrobacter]] category and they are able to oxidize ammonium, transforming it into [[nitrites]] and [[nitrates]].
The cell containing the carriers (caps) can be flooded as needed; in this way the depuration process control is obtained and it can be oriented both to the carbon removal both to the wastewaters [[denitrification]]. These plants, like happening for the biological disks, do not need any blower for the bacteria film oxygenation. It's the slow reactor rotation – alternatively submerged into sewage and into atmosphere – to guarantee the adequate oxygen supply for the oxidation aerobically of the sewage made by the biological film attached to the carriers. In this way it is possible to obtain a huge reduction of functioning and operating treatment costs.

[[File:Combined RCBR Modules.JPG|thumb|Two combined RCBR modules]]

== Configuration ==
RCBR technology is an entirely water biological treatment system, able to make more compact and efficient the biology of any wastewaters treatment plant. For the depuration of urban wastewaters it is placed downline of primary treatments (screening, oil separation, degritting, primary settling) and upline of water physical or chemical disinfection tertiary treatments (ultraviolets, ozone). This system offers the chance to realize into restrained spaces a huge surface of cohesion for the bacteria colonies, which are active for the depuration; this aspect makes it particularly suitable also for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters, in nitro-denitro configuration. Matching a series of more modules, some of them totally submerged by the wastewaters (in anoxic conditions) operate as denitrification stadium. Others, only partially submerged into the wastewaters, in presence of oxygen, operate the carbon removal and, at the same time, the ammonium [[nitrification]]. The system simplicity and the efficiency demonstrated in the tearing down also high elevations of suspended solid and organic carbon, make it usable as a pre-treatment, upline of drinkable systems of superficial and underground polluted waters (rivers, drains, stratum, ponds and temporary puddles of rain water).

== Consumption and maintenance ==
This biofilm system does not need any blower to oxygenate the bacteria colonies. It's the simple cell rotation to produce the oxygenation by simple diffusion. The energetic costs of this technology are really cheap and they are related only to the rotational movement impressed by an electric engine to the reaction cell, to maintain the device in a slow movement. The application of RCBR technology generally gets a reduction of the 90% of the water treatment electrical costs, with a medium consumption of 0.25 kWh per cubic meter of purified water.
RCBR's low consumption makes very easy to match these plants with renewable energy, like photovoltaic or aeolian plants. RCBR devices'  mechanical plant does not need any important operations of routine maintenance or any specialized technical expertise to control their operation. In fact, just the common greasing of the cell supporting rotation is requested.

== The invention ==
RCBR is an invention of Italian chemist Sergio Modenese. The first patent of the RCBR technology was registered in July 2013, by an innovative startup from Trentino Alto Adige, of whom the inventor is one of the founder partners.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

'''Shunamitism''' is the practice of an old man sleeping with, but not necessarily having sex with, a young [[virgin]] to preserve his youth.  The rationale was that the heat and moisture of the young woman would transfer to the old man and revitalize him.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Shapin and Christopher Martyn, “How to live forever: lessons of history”, [[British Medical Journal]], BMJ 2000;321;1580-1582]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is based on the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[David|King David]] and [[Abishag]], a young woman from [[Shunem]].  When King David was old and could not stay warm, his servants found Abishag to sleep with him, though he had no intimate relations with her: therefore, she was still a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Among scientific physicians, both [[Thomas Sydenham]] (17th century) and [[Herman Boerhaave]] (18th century) prescribed shunamitism for their patients.

'''Sociedad de Lucha Contra el Cancer''' ('''Society to Fight Cancer'''), a.k.a. '''SOLCA''', is an [[Ecuador]]an committee which disseminates techniques for fighting [[cancer]].  It was formed on December 7, 1951.

==History==

During the 40s, Dr. Juan Tanca Marengo, a distinguished [[Ecuadorian]] doctor and humanist, worried about public health and all the different types of [[cancer]], considered that it was necessary for him to share his oncologic knowledge with the medicine students and with doctors in general. His purpose was to establish prevention and healing campaigns, through the creation of an institute dedicated to the fight against cancer. December 7 of 1951, he calls a group of his closest doctor friends to found one of the public works with the most transcendence in [[Ecuador]]: the Sociedad de Lucha contra el cancer, or SOLCA.

In 1953, the government started to organize the creation of the building SOLCA, which was declared Society "fight with the cancer" in Ecuador.

However, researchers have tried to determine the age in various populations by taking [[urine]] samples of boys and determining the presence of [[spermatozoa]]. The presence of sperm in urine is referred to as ''spermaturia''.&lt;ref name="c" /&gt; From various sources, it appears that spermarche occurs between 13 and 15 years of age in most cases.&lt;ref name="d" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/1304761/?i=5&amp;from=/3965418/related Age of onset of spermaturia (spermache) in 669 Mexican children and its relation to secondary sexual characteristics and height] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==

In one study, boys were asked the circumstances in which their first [[ejaculation]] occurred.  Most commonly this occurred via a [[nocturnal emission]], with a significant number experiencing semenarche via [[masturbation]].  Less commonly, the first ejaculation occurred during [[sexual intercourse]] with a partner.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;A Study of White Middle-Class Adolescent Boys' Responses to "Semenarche" (The First Ejaculation), James H.

=== The LGBTI Force ===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:The Türk Psikologlar Derneği (in English, Turkish Psychological Association) gathers in May of 2014 to promote its new LGBTI unit, in Ankara, Turkey.jpg|thumb|262x262px|The TPD gathers in Ankara, Turkey, in May of 2014 to promote its new LGBTI Force.]] --&gt;In June 2014, the TPD launched a special unit to protect [[LGBT]] citizens from [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]], and other forms of [[discrimination]] in [[society]] that LGBT individuals face.

Their first meeting was 29 June 2014.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following the [[suicide]] of Turkish [[transgender sex worker]] [[Eylül Cansın]] on 5 January 2015, the LGBTI Force released a concerned announcement of how one widely broadcast suicide often leads to more suicides, especially among [[adolescents]] and [[youth|young adults]]. At their young age, [[depression (mood)|depression]] and suicidal thoughts and/or actions are often considered "[[:wikt:contagious|contagious]]," in a way. They encouraged [[mass media|media]] to avoid detailed descriptions of Eylül's suicide as to prevent the cultivation of ideas in any of the viewers minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://lgbtinewsturkey.com/2015/01/07/turkish-psychologists-association-lgbti-suicides-are-always-a-social-phenomenon/|title = Turkish Psychologists Association: LGBTI Suicides Are Always A Social Phenomenon|date = 7 January 2015|accessdate = 13 January 2015|website = LGBTI News in Turkey|publisher = LGBTI News in Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;
