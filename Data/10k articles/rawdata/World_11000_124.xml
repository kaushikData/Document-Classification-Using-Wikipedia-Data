'''"Allons, allons les enfants"''' ("Let's go, let's go children") was the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961]], performed in [[French language|French]] by [[France|French]] singer [[Colette Deréal]].

The song is a call from Deréal to the children of the world to get out of the towns and into the wider world to celebrate the joys of Spring. She sings that this is the only way for them to truly live.

The song was performed second on the night, following [[Spain]]'s [[Conchita Bautista]] with "[[Estando contigo]]" and preceding [[Austria]]'s [[Jimmy Makulis]] with "[[Sehnsucht (Jimmy Makulis song)|Sehnsucht]]". At the close of voting, it had received 6 points, placing 10th in a field of 16.

It was succeeded as [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monegasque representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1962|1962 Contest]] by [[François Deguelt]] with "[[Dis rien]]".

'''Ambasadori''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Амбасадори, "Ambassadors") were a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] pop band from [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] active from 1968 until 1980. The band is most notable for its 1975 hit single "[[:sh:Zemljo moja|Zemljo moja]]" as well as for representing Yugoslavia at the 1976 [[Eurovision Song Contest]], in addition to having two future pop stars [[Zdravko Čolić]] (between 1969 and 1971) and [[Hajrudin Varešanović|Hari Varešanović]] as its one time singers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockomotiva.com/starinarnica/feljton/sarajevska-pop-rock-skola-ambasadori-cola-ismeta-hari-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ambasadori were founded in Sarajevo in 1968&lt;ref&gt;http://sarajevo.co.ba/grupa-ambasadori/&lt;/ref&gt; by two military brass band musicians and [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) recruits — keyboardist Robert Ivanović who had come from Belgrade shortly prior to establishing the band and [[trombonist]] Srđan Stefanović. They soon brought guitarist Slobodan Vujović, a civilian, into the band. Still mostly a [[cover band]] at this stage, the group's repertoire centered around the 1960s [[Rhythm and blues|rhythm &amp; blues]] [[cover song|covers]] ([[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Wilson Pickett]], etc.) along with more covers of obligatory Yugoslav hits of the day and years past, and finally even a few original numbers written by the band members thrown into the mix. Their very first performance took place in May 1969 in Sarajevo's Dom JNA ([[Yugoslav People's Army]] House). Soon after, eighteen-year-old [[Zdravko Čolić]], a fresh high school graduate, joined the band as its new vocalist. With young Čolić as the vocalist, Vujović on guitar, Ivanović on keyboards, Ivica Sindičić on saxophone, Srđan Stefanović on trombone, Slobodan Jerković on bass guitar, Vlatko Anković on trumpet, and Tihomir Določek on drums, most of the band's activity involved gigging around Sarajevo in clubs like Trasa, FIS, and Sloga as well as the odd appearance in recently built [[Dom Mladih]] (Youth House), part of the new [[Skenderija]] complex. Over time, the group started getting more gig offers, which presented a problem since its band members that were also JNA recruits weren't available for many of them and as a result, those offers had to be declined.

By 1970, seeing their business opportunities limited by the strange setup within the band, Vujović and Čolić decided to step out and form a new group, '''Novi Ambasadori''' (New Ambassadors), bringing in drummer Perica Stojanović, organist [[Vlado Pravdić]], saxophonist Andrej "Lale" Stefanović, and bassist Zlatko Hold. With an almost all new lineup, the band also expanded its repertoire so that in addition to R&amp;B they now also began playing covers of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], etc. With Vujović now firmly established as the band's driving force and main songwriter, in the summer of 1970, Novi Ambasadori scored a month-long gig with [[Indexi]] in [[Dubrovnik]], their first tour-like experience and a taste of life on the road. 

Next step was competing at the 1971 [[:sh:Vaš šlager sezone|Vaš šlager sezone]] annual competitive festival in Sarajevo where they finished in 7th place with "Plačem za tvojim usnama", a song that songwriter [[Zdenko Runjić]] claimed to have composed and officially signed his name under despite it being a blatant rip-off of [[The Tremeloes]]' "Suddenly You Love Me" (itself a cover of [[Riccardo Del Turco]]'s "[[Siffler sur la colline|Uno tranquillo]]"). No one from the festival noticed the plagiarism and the band avoided controversy. The song became the band's debut release — 7-inch (two-side) single "Plačem za tvojim usnama" / "Zapjevaj" released in 1971 by [[Beograd Disk]] label. By now, Vujović's Novi Ambasadori dropped the 'Novi' part, continuing on as Ambasadori since the original band's founders Ivanović and Stefanović were no longer involved with music and gave up on protecting the name.

In 1975, Ambasadori scored a sizable hit with their entry at that year's [[:sh:Vaš šlager sezone|Vaš šlager sezone]] festival — [[Kemal Monteno]]-written patriotic schlager song "[[:sh:Zemljo moja|Zemljo moja]]", inspired by and dedicated to Yugoslav [[gastarbeiter]]s leaving their homeland in search of expanded employment opportunities throughout [[Western Europe]].

Ambasadori represented SFR Yugoslavia at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976 Eurovision Song Contest]], finishing second last among the 18 participating countries.

Other Ambasadori members that came and went throughout the 1968 -1970s include various musicians active on the Sarajevo music scene at the time and after, such as trombone player Srđan Stefanović, keyboard player Robert Ivanović, keyboard player [[Sinan Alimanovic]], keyboard player Neven Pocrnjić, saxophone player Ivica Sindic, drummer "Tica", trumpet player Krešimir "Keco" Vlašić (ex Pro Arte), singer Ismeta Dervoz (ex [[Kodeksi]]), drummer Perica Stojanović (ex [[Jutro]]), organist [[Vlado Pravdić]], bassist Ivica Vinković, bassist Zlatko Hold, saxophonist Andrej "Lale" Stefanović, etc.

{{History of Assyrian people}}
The '''Assyrian genocide''' (also known as '''''Sayfo''''' or '''''Seyfo''''', "Sword"; {{lang-syr|ܩܛܠܥܡܐ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ}} or {{lang|syr|ܣܝܦܐ}}) refers to the mass slaughter of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and those in neighbouring [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] by [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Ottoman troops]]&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander Laban Hinton pp 117"/&gt; during the [[First World War]], in conjunction with the [[Armenian genocide|Armenian]] and [[Greek genocide]]s.&lt;ref name="Travis2"&gt;Travis, Hannibal. ''Genocide in the Middle East: The Ottoman Empire, Iraq, and Sudan''. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2010, 2007, pp. 237–77, 293–294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anahit"&gt;Khosoreva, Anahit. "The Assyrian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire and Adjacent Territories" in ''The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies''. Ed. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]]. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2007, pp. 267–274. {{ISBN|1-4128-0619-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrian civilian population of upper [[Mesopotamia]] (the [[Tur Abdin]] region, the [[Hakkâri]], [[Van Province|Van]], and [[Siirt Province|Siirt]] provinces of present-day southeastern [[Turkey]], and the [[Urmia]] region of northwestern [[Iran]]) was forcibly relocated and massacred by the [[Ottoman people|Ottoman]] ([[Turkish people|Turkish]]) army, together with other armed and allied Muslim peoples, including [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Chechens]] and [[Circassians]], between 1914 and 1920, with further attacks on unarmed fleeing civilians conducted by local [[Arab]] militias.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt;

The Assyrian genocide took place in the same context as the Armenian and Greek genocides.&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, Dominik J. and Zimmerer, Jürgen (2008) "Late Ottoman Genocides: The Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and Young Turkish population and extermination policies." ''Journal of Genocide Research'', 10:1, pp. 7–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Assyrian genocide took place within the context of the much more widespread Armenian genocide, scholarship treating it as a separate event is scarce, with the exceptions of the works of [[Joseph Yacoub]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Assyrian Question'', Ed. Alpha Graphic, Chicago, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriele Yonan,&lt;ref&gt;Ein Vergessener Holocaust, Reihe Bedröhte Völker, Pogrom, Göttingen-Vienne, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; David Gaunt and Hannibal Travis,&lt;ref name="Anahit"/&gt; who have classified the genocide as a systematic campaign by the [[Young Turk]] government. Other scholars, such as Hilmar Kaiser, [[Donald Bloxham]] and [[Taner Akçam]] have differing opinions with regards to the extent of governmental involvement and systematic nature of the genocide, as part of the genocide denial movement, asserting a less systematic policy and different treatment in comparison to the Armenians.

Unlike the Armenians, there were no orders to deport Assyrians. The attacks against them were not of standardized nature and incorporated various methods of massacre; in some cities, all Assyrian men were slain and the others were forced to flee. These massacres were often carried out upon the initiatives of local politicians and Kurdish tribes. Exposure, disease and starvation during the flight of Assyrians increased the death toll, and women were subjected to widespread [[sexual abuse]] in some areas.

Estimates on the overall death toll have varied. Providing detailed statistics of the various estimates of the Churches' population after the genocide, David Gaunt accepts the figure of 275,000 deaths as reported by the Assyrian delegation at the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and ventures that the death toll would be around 300,000 because of uncounted Assyrian-inhabited areas.&lt;ref name="The Assyrian Genocide of 1915"&gt;David Gaunt, [http://www.seyfocenter.com/index.php?sid=2&amp;aID=36 "The Assyrian Genocide of 1915"], ''Assyrian Genocide Research Center'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolph Rummel]] gives the number of Christian deaths in Assyrian-populated regions of Turkey as 102,000 and adds to this the killing of around 47,000 Assyrians in Persia.

In 2007, the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] (IAGS) reached a consensus that the "Ottoman campaign against Christian minorities of the Empire between 1914 and 1923 constituted a genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, and [[Pontian Greeks|Pontian]] and [[Ottoman Greeks|Anatolian Greeks]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genocidescholars.org/images/PRelease16Dec07IAGS_Officially_Recognizes_Assyrian_Greek_Genocides.pdf Genocide Scholars Association Officially Recognizes Assyrian Greek Genocides. 16 December 2007.

==Terminology==
The Assyrian genocide is sometimes also referred to as ''Sayfo'' or ''Seyfo'' in English language sources, based on the modern Assyrian (Mesopotamian neo-Aramaic) designation ''Saypā'' ({{lang|arc|ܣܝܦܐ}}), "[[saif|sword]]", pronounced as ''Seyfo'', and as ''Sayfo'' in the [[Western Neo-Aramaic|Western dialect]] (the term abbreviates ''shato d'sayfo'' "year of the sword"). The [[Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]] name ''{{transl|arc|Qeṭlā ḏ-‘Amā Āṯûrāyā}}'' ({{lang|arc|ܩܛܠܐ ܕܥܡܐ ܐܬܘܪܝܐ}}), which literally means "killing of the Assyrian people", is used by some groups to describe these events. The word ''Qṭolamo'' ({{lang|arc|ܩܛܠܥܡܐ}}) which means ''Genocide'' is also used in Assyrian diaspora media. The term used in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] media is ''Süryani Soykırımı''.

In countries where significant [[Assyrian diaspora]] communities exist, the designation "Assyrian" has become [[Assyrian naming controversy|controversial]], notably in [[Assyrians/Syriacs in Germany|Germany]] and [[Assyrians/Syriacs in Sweden|Sweden]], alternative terms such as ''Assyriska/syrianska/kaldeiska folkmordet'' "Assyrian/Syriac/Chaldean genocide" are employed. Nestorians, Syrians, Syriacs, and Chaldeans were names imposed by Western missionaries such as the Catholics and Protestants on the Ottoman and Persian Assyrians.
The Greek, Persian, and Arab rulers of occupied Assyria, as well as Chaldean and Syriac Orthodox patriarchs, priests, and monks, and Armenian, British, and French laypeople, called them all Assyrians.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt;

==Background==

The Assyrian population in the Ottoman Empire numbered about one million at the turn of the twentieth century and was largely concentrated in what is now [[Iran]], [[Iraq]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt; However, researchers such as David Gaunt have noted that the Assyrian population was around 600,000 prior to World War I.&lt;ref name="The Assyrian Genocide of 1915"/&gt; There were also hundreds of thousands of Maronite Christians in Lebanon, with some Assyrian heritage but which are less often called Assyrians. There were significantly larger communities located in the regions near [[Lake Urmia]] in Persia, [[Lake Van]] (specifically the [[Hakkari]] region) and [[Mesopotamia]], as well as the eastern Ottoman [[vilayet]]s of [[Diyarbekir Vilayet|Diyarbekir]], [[Erzurum Vilayet|Erzurum]] and [[Bitlis Vilayet|Bitlis]]. Like other Christians residing in the empire, they were treated as second-class citizens and denied public positions of power. Violence directed against them prior to the First World War was not new. Many Assyrians were subjected to [[Kurds|Kurdish]] brigandage and even outright massacre and forced conversion to Islam, as was the case of the Assyrians of Hakkari during the [[massacres of Badr Khan]] in the 1840s and the [[Massacres of Diyarbakır (1895)|Massacres of Diyarbakır]] during the 1895–96 [[Hamidian Massacres]].&lt;ref name="Anahit"/&gt; The [[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]] received assurances from the Ottoman Sultan that they could kill Assyrians and Armenians with impunity, and were particularly active in [[Şanlıurfa|Urhoy]] and [[Amid|Diyarbakir]].&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt;

===Outbreak of war===
The Ottoman Empire began massacring Assyrians in the nineteenth century, a time of friendly relations between the Ottomans and the British, who were defending the Ottomans from the Russian Empire's efforts to include under its protection the communities of Ottoman Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt; In October 1914, the Ottoman Empire began deporting and massacring Assyrians and Armenians in [[Van, Turkey|Van]].&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt; After attacking Russian cities and declaring war on Britain and France, the Empire declared a holy war on Christians.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt; The German Kaiser and the German Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire directed and orchestrated the holy war, and financed the Ottomans' war against the Russian Empire.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt;

===Responsibility of the Ottoman government===
The degree of the responsibility of the Ottoman government and whether the genocide had a systematic nature has been the subject of different scholarly opinions. Concerning the responsibility of the Ottoman government, Hilmar Kaiser wrote that Talaat Pasha ordered the deportations of the Assyrians in the area on 26 October 1914, fearing their collaboration with the advancing Russian troops, but the order was postponed and abandoned three days later due to a lack of forces. When the Assyrians did not collaborate with Russians, any plans to deport them were cancelled. Kaiser wrote that the massacres of Assyrians were apparently not a part of the official Ottoman policy and that the Assyrians were ordered to be treated differently from the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaiser|first1=Hilmar|editor1-last=Bloxham|editor1-first=Donald|editor2-last=Moses|editor2-first=A.

Another Ottoman document orders Assyrians to be detained in their present locations, instead of their deportation, which, according to Akçam, indicates that the Assyrian population could have been treated differently from the Armenians, but that they were often "eliminated" alongside them.&lt;ref name=akcamsyr/&gt; [[Donald Bloxham]], a genocide scholar, stated that while Assyrians of western Persia, Hakkari, Bitlis, Van and Diarbekir were massacred along with Armenians, they were "not subject to the same systematic destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloxham|first1=Donald|editor1-last=Hovannisian|editor1-first=Richard G.|title=Looking Backward, Moving Forward: Confronting the Armenian Genocide|date=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412827676|page=34|edition=2|chapter=Determinants of the Armenian Genocide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominik J. Schaller and Jürgen Zimmerer wrote that due to the lack of an international diaspora and a nation state, the Assyrian were perceived as more vulnerable and less threatening by the Young Turks, which led to their extermination being "less systematic". Massacres of Assyrians were often undertaken through the initiatives of local officials and groups. Nevertheless, they classified the campaign against Assyrians as having "genocidal quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaller|first1=Dominik J.|last2=Zimmerer|first2=Jürgen|title=Late Ottoman Genocides: The Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and Young Turkish Population and Extermination Policies|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317990451|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Q3cAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst II, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]], the German special envoy in Constantinople, sent a report describing "systematic extermination" of the Christian population of the [[Diarbekir]] province by Reshid Bey, the governor. Martin Tamcke wrote that a German chargé d'affairs in Constantinople sent to the German Chancellery an article from a Young Turk-controlled newspaper, which mentioned the expulsion of Assyrians in the east as an example of the "cleansing of the empire of Christian elements". Tamcke wrote that documents such as these, along with oral traditions, are evidence of a systematic policy of extermination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tamcke|first1=Martin|editor1-last=Tozman|editor1-first=Markus K.|editor2-last=Tyndall|editor2-first=Andrea|title=The Slow Disappearance of the Syriacs from Turkey and of the Grounds of the Mor Gabriel Monastery|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=9783643902689|pages=20–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=no5_QSBVq7kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=The Collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the "Seyfo" against the Syrians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Gaunt compared the attacks on Assyrians in [[Hakkari]] and [[Diarbekir]], and wrote that while the former was mainly perpetrated upon the orders of the Turkish government, the latter was a local initiative of [[Committee of Union and Progress|CUP]] politicians unconnected with the central government, and with no orders to exterminate Assyrians in the area.&lt;ref name=gauntind/&gt;

===General characteristics===
According to historian David Gaunt, a primary characteristic was the total targeting of the Assyrian population, including farming villages as well as rebelling mountain tribes. The killing in rural regions was more extensive, while some survived the massacres in cities; Gaunt states that this indicates that a primary aim was the confiscation of land. The property, villages and animals of the villagers were destroyed totally to prevent their return. Gaunt states that organized troops were tasked with killing and expelling Assyrians in [[Hakkari]] and Ottoman-controlled parts of Persia, as well as resisting villages.&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, David.

Gaunt wrote that there was no standardized way of killing. He cites accounts of killings at town halls, river rafts, tunnels, streets, and during the flight of the victims. The methods included stabbing, decapitation, drowning, shooting and stoning among others according to eyewitness accounts cited by Gaunt; these accounts also record local officers having collections of body parts, such as ears, noses and "female body parts".&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

[[Percy Sykes]], a British officer in Persia, wrote that the Assyrians would have been exterminated if they had not fled to Persia. However, starvation, disease and fatigue cost the lives of 65,000 more Assyrians on their way to Persia or once they had arrived there, according to Christoph Baumer.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Diyarbekir===
The earliest programs of extermination took place in the southern province of Diyarbekir, under the leadership of [[Reşit Bey|Reshid Bey]].&lt;ref name="Anahit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See David Gaunt, "Death's End, 1915: The General Massacres of Christians in Diarbekir" in ''Armenian Tigranakert/Diarbekir and Edessa/Urfa''. Ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. UCLA Armenian History and Culture Series: Historic Armenian Cities and Provinces, 6. Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda Publishers, 2006, pp. 309–359.&lt;/ref&gt; A German Vice-Consul reported in July 1915 that Assyrians were being massacred in [[Diyarbekir Vilayet]]. A German Consul reported in September 1915 that the adult Christians of [[Diyarbakır]], [[Harput]], [[Mardin]], and [[Viranşehir]] had been targeted, and also mentioned an Ottoman reign of terror in [[Şanlıurfa|Urhoy]].&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt; According to the reports, the Assyrian population of [[Faysh Khabur]] was completely killed, along with all the male Assyrians of Mardin and Siirt. The widows and orphans of these men were reportedly left to flee to [[Mosul]] on foot, and died on their way due to starvation and harsh conditions. These atrocities prompted the Assyrian patriarch to appeal to the Russian representative in the Caucasus, claiming that the Turkish leaders were intent on killing all Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;Travis, Hannibal.

According to the Syrian Patriarchate, the Turkish government ordered an attack on the Christian villages near Mardin, which were mostly inhabited by Assyrians. The soldiers went beyond attacking property and killed civilians, for instance, the Assyrians of [[Kızıltepe|Kızıltepe/Tell Armen]] were gathered in a church and burned. In Diyarbekir, women and children were deported, but only a very small number reached their destinations as women were killed, raped or sold.&lt;ref&gt;de Courtois, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual accounts of the massacres include several villages. In the village of Cherang near Diyarbekir, 114 men were killed and the women and children were put to forced agricultural labor and given the choice to convert or die. The massacre was committed by an Al-Khamsin death squad, which were recruited by the government and led by officials, while composed of local urban Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, David.

In Hassana, a village near [[Cizre|Jezire]], the 300 inhabitants were massacred, with some managing to survive and flee. The inhabitants of the village of Kavel-Karre were attacked by Kurdish tribes on 19 June 1915 and killed; their bodies were then thrown into the [[Tigris River]]. In Kafarbe, 2&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Mor Gabriel Monastery]], 200 Assyrians were attacked by a clan of Kurds and murdered in 1917. However, there were also cases when those in power chose to protect the Assyrians, as Rachid Osman, the agha of [[Şırnak]] protected the 300–500 inhabitants of Harbol.&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, ''Massacres, Resistance, Protectors: Muslim-Christian Relations in Eastern Anatolia During World War I'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4mug9LrpLKcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Massacres,+resistance,+protectors&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ECZLTcCpFML48AahyaTJDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Deyr-Zor&amp;f=false p. 216-235].&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''[[The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]]'', Viscount Bryce and Arnold Toynbee included a letter from the Presbyterian American Church in Urmia, sent on 6 March 1916, which related information from a survivor of the events described. In the document, it is written that nearly all of the 30,000 Assyrians (called "Nestorians") of the [[Bohtan]] region had been massacred by the Kurds and Turkish soldiers with the orders of the government. While some Kurdish leaders tried to protect the population, they were unable to as the order had allegedly come from the government and such friendly acts were punished. All Christian villages of the plain were reportedly "wiped out", including three Protestant villages. In Monsoria, one of these villages, Assyrian women reportedly jumped into the Tigris River to prevent their capture by the Kurds. The surviving women and children were taken as captives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|date=1916|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|pages=180–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate presented to the peace conference after the war state that 77,963 Assyrians were killed in 278 villages of the Diyarbekir province.&lt;ref&gt;de Courtois, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Naayem writes that about 50 villages close to [[Midyat]] were ruined and their Assyrian inhabitants slaughtered, but he does not name any of them nor give any casualty figures. However, the figure agrees with the data of the patriarchate.&lt;ref&gt;de Courtois, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Van===
In October 1914, 71 Assyrian men of [[Yüksekova|Yüksekova/Gawar]] were arrested and taken to the local government center in [[Başkale]] and killed.&lt;ref name=bryce&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/brycereport_armenia.htm |title=British Government Report on the Armenian Massacres of April–December 1915 |author=Bryce, James Lord |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1914, Russian troops briefly occupied the towns of Başkale and Saray, following their retreat, the Assyrian and Armenian populations of these areas were accused of collaboration and targeted for revenge. According to eyewitness accounts collected by Russians and local observers, at least twelve villages were "wiped out" in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, David.

Jevdet Pasha the governor of Van, is reported to have held a meeting in February 1915 at which he said, "We have cleansed the Armenians and Syriac [Christian]s from Azerbaijan, and we will do the same in Van."&lt;ref&gt;[[Taner Akcam|Akçam, Taner]]. ''A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility''. New York: Metropolitan Books, 2006, p. 201. {{ISBN|0-8050-7932-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1915, [[Jevdet Bey]], Military Governor of [[Van Vilayet]], upon entering [[Siirt]] (or Seert) with 8,000 soldiers whom he himself called "The Butchers' Battalion" ({{lang-tr|Kasap Taburu}}),&lt;ref name="Anahit"/&gt; ordered the massacre of almost 20,000 Assyrian [[civilian]]s in at least 30 villages.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The same "butcher battalions" killed all the male Assyrian and Armenian population of [[Bitlis]]. They reportedly raped the women, and subsequently sold them or gave them as "gifts".&lt;ref name=Travis/&gt;

The town of Sa'irt/Seert (modern-day Siirt), was populated by Assyrians and Armenians. Seert was the seat of a Chaldean Archbishop [[Addai Scher]] who was murdered by the Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ara Sarafian]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=H0mfmdThGLAC&amp;pg=PA120]''&lt;/ref&gt; The eyewitness Hyacinthe Simon wrote that 4,000 Christians died in Seert.&lt;ref name="Gaunt, David 2006, p. 436"&gt;Gaunt, David.

Eyewitness accounts state that the Assyrian men were rounded up by criminal gangs and forced to a march to the valley of Zeryabe, where they were killed. This was followed by the gangs' attack on women. The Ottoman officer Raphael de Nogales described a "slope [...] crowned by thousands of half-nude and still bleeding corpses, lying in heaps". He then wrote that when he entered Siirt, he saw that the police and the locals were sacking Christian homes, and learned that the governors of the town directed the massacre, which had been arranged beforehand.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Adam|title=Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136937965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xDGBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=genocide+a+comprehensive+introduction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nx_xVNGNBsjjywOHrILoDQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Assyrian&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to "the Blue Book" of the American government, widespread ethnic cleansing and massacres occurred against the Assyrians as well as Armenians in the [[Hakkari]] area, with the orders for the deportations of Armenians being misinterpreted as orders against all Christians by the local Kurds. It was reported that an attack was launched on Assyrian dwellings in summer 1915, and that Assyrians were attempted to be "starved out". According to Paul Shimmon and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], an Assyrian village called "Goele", with the population of 300, was attacked and its men were killed, while the women and children were forced into slavery and the houses were pillaged. In another village with fifty houses, the Kurds reportedly killed the entire civilian population. "The Blue Book" states that in one district of Hakkari, only 17 Christian survivors were left from 41 villages.&lt;ref name=Travis/&gt; In April 1915, after a number of failed Kurdish attempts, Ottoman Troops invaded [[Yüksekova|Gawar]], a region of Hakkari, and massacred the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1916/09/18/archives/the-plight-of-assyria-needs-of-christian-and-kurd-in-that.html The Plight of Assyria]."

Retrieved 2010-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt; There were later reports of the mass killing of hundreds of Assyrians in the same area, and women being forced into sexual slavery.&lt;ref name=Travis/&gt;

David Gaunt wrote that the Assyrians of the Hakkari area were targeted in a "full ethnic cleansing" and asserted that they "faced the full wrath of the Ottoman government as well as the local Kurdish tribes". He claimed that due to their consistent contact and collaboration with the Russians, they were targeted with atrocities, and after a battle in which they collaborated with the Russians to defeat the Ottoman Army, the army perpetrated the massacres against Christians in Başkale, Siirt and Bitlis described above. Talaat Pasha also allegedly ordered a policy in which Ottoman troops, with the support of Kurdish tribes, defeated Assyrians and drove them to the mountains, subsequently destroying their property.&lt;ref name=gauntind&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gaunt, David|editor1-last=Bartov|editor1-first=Omer|editor2-last=Weitz|editor2-first=Eric D.|title=Shatterzone of Empires: Coexistence and Violence in the German, Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman Borderlands|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253006318|page=326|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the start of [[World War I]], the village of [[Gülgöze, Mardin|Gülgöze]] had about 200 families, and all were ethnic Assyrians that belonged to the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. During the [[Assyrian Genocide]], tens of thousands of refugees from throughout Tur Abdin arrived here for safety. At one point, the number of Assyrians in the village was up to 21980 people. Refugees arrived from villages including Habasnos, [[Midyat]], Bote, [[Keferze]], [[Elbegendi|Kafro Eloyto]], [[Mzizah]] and Urnas. Even refugees from outside Tur Abdin arrived, coming from villages such as Deqlath, Bscheriye, Gozarto, [[Hasankeyf|Hesno d Kifo]] and Mifarqin.

Being aware of the Turks and Kurds were coming to Gülgöze, the Assyrian villagers and refugees created a militia to defend themselves, which was led by Masud Mirza, the son of a Melik. Their resistance lasted 60 days, and ended in success.&lt;ref name="GauntBet̲-Şawoce2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaunt|first1=David|last2=Bet̲-Şawoce|first2=Jan|title=Massacres, Resistance, Protectors: Muslim-Christian Relations in Eastern Anatolia During World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mug9LrpLKcC&amp;pg=PA348|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-59333-301-0|page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the Kurdish authority of [[Midyat]] was given orders to attack Gülgöze and Arnas. However, [[Aziz Agha]], the leader of the [[Midyat]] area, told them that they didn't have enough soldiers to attack both areas, and therefore they would attack Gulgoze only, and then go to Arnas later on. Therefore, The Kurds of Tur Abdin and Ramman, under the generalship of Ahmed Agha and Salem Agha, collected themselves in [[Mardin]], and created a unit of 13,000 men. The government authorized the distribution of arms, and they headed towards Gülgöze, arriving late at night to begin the siege.

After hours of gun-battle, the Assyrians defeated the Kurds and drove them out, but there were many casualties on both sides regardless. After 10 days, The Kurds attacked again only to be beaten yet again, as they lost well over 300 men. Before the beginning of a third attempt, Kurdish leaders called for aid from the mayors of [[Diyarbakır]](Raschid) and [[Mardin]](Badri). However, A third attempt also failed and after 30 days of battle, Aziz Agha suggested a peace treaty between the two sides. 3 Assyrians met with Aziz to discuss a peace treaty, But the Assyrians refused to lay down their weapons, thus the battle continued. The siege continued for another 30 days leading to many deaths on both sides. In the end, the Kurdish soldiers surrendered and left the Assyrians of Tur Abdin alone, hence why the Tur Abdin region is the only Christian populated area left in Turkey outside of [[Istanbul]]. The total death toll of this 60-day siege is unknown, but there were at least 1,000 deaths with both sides losses combined.

===Assyrian resistance in upper Mesopotamia===
On March 3, 1918, the Ottoman army led by Kurdish soldiers assassinated one of the most important Assyrian leaders at the time. This resulted in the retaliation of the Assyrians. [[Malik Yosip Khoshaba]] of the Bit-Tiyari tribe led a successful attack against the Ottomans. Assyrian forces in the region also attacked the Kurdish fortress of [[Simko Shikak]], the leader who had assassinated [[Mar Shimun XIX Benyamin]], they successfully stormed it, defeating the Kurds, however Simko escaped and fled.

Assyrians were involved in a number of clashes in Turkey with Ottoman forces, including [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]] loyal to the empire. When armed and in sufficient numbers they were able to defend themselves successfully. However, they were often cut off in small pockets, vastly outnumbered and surrounded, and unarmed villagers made easy targets for Ottoman and Kurdish forces.

==Events in Persia==
{{see also|Persian campaign}}
The Assyrians in Persia armed themselves under the command of General [[Agha Petros]], who had been approached by the Allies to help fight the Ottomans.{{when|date=February 2015}} They put up a resistance, and Agha Petros' volunteer army had quite a few successes over the Ottoman forces and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] allies, notably at Suldouze where 1,500 Assyrian horsemen overcame the far larger Ottoman force of over 8,000, commanded by Kheiri Bey. Agha Petros also defeated the [[Ottoman Turks]] in a major engagement at Sauj Bulak and drove them back to Rowanduz. Assyrian forces in Persia were greatly affected by the withdrawal of [[Russia]] from the war and the collapse of [[Armenia]]n armed resistance in the region. They were left cut off, with no supplies, vastly outnumbered and surrounded.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt;

===Urmia and surroundings===
The Ottoman Empire invaded [[Iranian Azerbaijan|northwestern]] [[Persia]] in 1914.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt; Before the end of 1914, Turkish and Kurdish troops had successfully entered the villages in and around [[Urmia]]. On February 21, 1915 the Turkish army in Urmia seized 61 leading Assyrians from the [[France|French]] [[Mission (station)|missions]] as hostages, demanding large ransoms. The mission had enough money to convince the Ottomans to let 20 of the men go. However, on February 22 the remaining 41 were executed, having their heads cut off at the stairs of the Charbachsh Gate. The dead included bishop Mar Denkha.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
[[File:Ruins of Gulpashan.jpg|thumb|right|Old picture depicting the ruins of the Assyrian village of [[Golpashan]] ([[West Azerbaijan Province]], Iran) after its destruction by the invading Ottoman army.]]
Most of the Assyrian villages were unarmed. The only protection they had was when the Russian army finally took control of the area, years after the presence of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] had been removed. On February 25, 1915, Ottoman troops stormed their way into the villages of Gulpashan and Salamas. Almost the entire village of [[Golpashan]], of a population of 2,500, were massacred.&lt;ref name="Anahit"/&gt; In [[Salmas]], about 750 Armenian and Assyrian refugees were protected by Iranian civilians in the village. The commander of the Ottoman division stormed the houses despite the fact that Persians lived in them, and roped all the men together in large groups and forced them to march in the fields between Khusrawa and Haftevan/Hafdewan. The men were shot or killed in other ways. The protection of Christians by local Persian civilians is also confirmed in the 1915 British report: "Many Moslems tried to save their Christian neighbours and offered them shelter in their houses, but the Turkish authorities were implacable."&lt;ref name=bryce/&gt; According to American official accounts, the largest Assyrian village in the Urmia region was overrun and all its men killed, while the women were attacked. In Haftevan, the Russian troops later discovered more than 700 corpses, and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also claimed the abduction of 500 Assyrian girls. According to similar reports, 200 Assyrians were killed by burning in a church.&lt;ref name=Travis/&gt;

During the winter of 1915, 4,000 Assyrians died from disease, hunger, and exposure, and about 1000 were killed in the villages of Urmia.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWI9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT319|title=Information Quarterly|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in Urmia alone, 800 Assyrians were massacred and 2000 died from disease. American documents report widespread sexual violence against Assyrian women of all ages and the looting and destruction of the houses of about five-sixth of the Assyrian population. Reports state that over 200 girls were forced into sexual slavery and conversion into Islam. Eugene Griselle from the Ethnological Society of Paris gives the figure of 8,500 for the number of deaths in the Urmia region; according to other reports, out of an Assyrian population of 30,000, one-fifth was killed, their villages and churches destroyed. An English priest in the area estimates the death toll at 6,000.&lt;ref name=Travis/&gt;

However, David Gaunt wrote that the massacres were reciprocated by the Assyrians. Assyrian Jilu tribes were accused of committing massacres of local villagers in the plains of Salmas; local Iranian officials reported that between [[Khoy|Khoi]] and [[Jolfa, Iran (city)|Julfa]], a great number of villagers were massacred.&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, ''Massacres, Resistance, Protectors: Muslim-Christian Relations in Eastern Anatolia during World War I'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4mug9LrpLKcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Massacres,+resistance,+protectors&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ECZLTcCpFML48AahyaTJDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Urmia&amp;f=false p. 104].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, the Assyrian population of Urmia was nearly wiped out, 1,000 killed in the French and American mission buildings, 200 surrounding villages destroyed, and thousands perished of famine, disease, and forced marches.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt;

In early 1918, many Assyrians started to flee present-day Turkey. Mar Shimun Benyamin had arranged for some 3,500 Assyrians to reside in the district of [[Khoy|Khoi]]. Not long after settling in, Kurdish troops of the Ottoman Army massacred the population almost entirely. One of the few that survived was Reverend John Eshoo. After escaping, he stated:

{{quotation|You have undoubtedly heard of the Assyrian massacre of Khoi, but I am certain you do not know the details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Assyrians were assembled into one caravansary, and shot to death by guns and revolvers. Blood literally flowed in little streams, and the entire open space within the caravansary became a pool of crimson liquid. The place was too small to hold all the living victims waiting for execution. They were brought in groups, and each new group was compelled to stand over the heap of the still bleeding bodies and shot to death. The fearful place became literally a human slaughter house, receiving its speechless victims, in groups of ten and twenty at a time, for execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, the Assyrians, who were residing in the suburb of the city, were brought together and driven into the spacious courtyard of a house [...] The Assyrian refugees were kept under guard for eight days, without anything to eat. At last they were removed from their place of confinement and taken to a spot prepared for their brutal killing. These helpless Assyrians marched like lambs to their slaughter, and they opened not their mouth, save by sayings "Lord, into thy hands we commit our spirits. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The executioners began by cutting first the fingers of their victims, join by joint, till the two hands were entirely amputated. Then they were stretched on the ground, after the manner of the animals that are slain in the Fast, but these with their faces turned upward, and their heads resting upon the stones or blocks of wood Then their throats were half cut, so as to prolong their torture of dying, and while struggling in the agony of death, the victims were kicked and clubbed by heavy poles the murderers carried Many of them, while still laboring under the pain of death, were thrown into ditches and buried before their souls had expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young men and the able-bodied men were separated from among the very young and the old. They were taken some distance from the city and used as targets by the shooters. They all fell, a few not mortally wounded. One of the leaders went to the heaps of the fallen and shouted aloud, swearing by the names of Islam's prophets that those who had not received mortal wounds should rise and depart, as they would not be harmed any more. A few, thus deceived, stood up, but only to fall this time killed by another volley from the guns of the murderers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the younger and good looking women, together with a few little girls of attractive appearance, pleaded to be killed. Against their will were forced into Islam's harems. Others were subjected to such fiendish insults that I cannot possibly describe. Death, however, came to their rescue and saved them from the vile passions of the demons. The death toll of Assyrians totaled 2,770 men, women and children.&lt;ref name=Werda&gt;Joel Euel Werda.

===Baquba camps===
[[File:Reports of the missionary and benevolent boards and committees to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (1919) (14760129156).jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Ambrose Shedd|Dr. Shedd]]]]
By mid-1918, the British army had convinced the Ottomans to let them have access to about 30,000 Assyrians from various parts of Persia.
The British decided to relocate all 30,000 from Persia to [[Baquba]], northern Iraq, in the hope that this would prevent further massacres. Many others had already left for northern Iraq after the Russian withdrawal and collapse of Armenian lines. The transferring took just 25 days, but at least 7,000 of them had died during the trip.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, H. H.(Brig.-Gen.). ''The Baquba Refugee Camp&amp;nbsp;– An account of the work on behalf of the persecuted Assyrian Christians''. London, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Some died of exposure, hunger or disease, other civilians fell prey to attacks from armed bands of Kurds and Arabs. At Baquba, Assyrians were forced to defend themselves from further Arab and Kurdish raids, which they were able to do successfully.

A memorandum from American Presbyterian Missionaries at Urmia During the Great War 16 to British Minister Sir Percy Cox had this to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Capt. Gracey doubtless talked rather big in the hopes of putting heart into the Assyrians and holding up this front against the Turks. [Consequently,] We have met all the orders issued by the late [[William Ambrose Shedd|Dr. Shedd]] which have been presented to us and a very large number of Assyrian refugees are being maintained at Baquba, chiefly at H.M.G.'s expense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1920, the British decided to close down the Baquba camps. The majority of Assyrians of the camp decided to go back to the Hakkari mountains, while the rest were dispersed throughout Iraq, where there was already an Assyrian community.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, they would again be targeted there in the 1933 [[Simele massacre]].

==Death toll==
Scholars have summarized events as follows: specific massacres included 25,000 Assyrians in Midyat, 21,000 in Jezira-ibn-Omar, 7,000 in Nisibis, 7,000 in Urfa, 7,000 in the Qudshanis region, 6,000 in Mardin, 5,000 in Diyarbekir, 4,000 in Adana, 4,000 in Brahimie, and 3,500 in Harput.&lt;ref name="Anahit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Travis"&gt;Travis, Hannibal.

It estimated that about 275,000 "Assyro-Chaldeans" died between 1914 and 1918.&lt;ref name="Yacoub"&gt;{{fr icon}} Yacoub, Joseph. ''La question assyro-chaldéenne, les Puissances européennes et la SDN (1908–1938)'', 4 vol., thèse Lyon, 1985, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the Assyrians of the Ottoman Empire and Persia was about 600,000 before the genocide, and was reduced by 275,000, with very few survivors in 1930s Turkey or Iran.&lt;ref name="Travis2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, ''Massacres, Resistance, Protectors'', pp. 21–28, 300–3, 406, 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary newspapers reported death tolls of 200,000 to 250,000.&lt;ref name=Travis/&gt; Representatives from the [[Anglican Church]] in the region claimed that about half of the Assyrian population perished.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

The memorandum of the Assyrian Archbishopric of Syria ([[Damascus]]-[[Homs]]) to the 1920 peace conference, places the death toll at 90,313 people, with 345 villages burned and 156 churches destroyed. The archbishop demanded 250,000 pounds sterling of reparations to compensate for the destruction of the churches. The figures of the archbishopric places the death toll in Harput at 3,500, in [[Midyat]] at 25,830, in Diyarbekir and surroundings at 5,679, in Jezireh at 7,510, in [[Nusaybin]] at 7,000, in Mardin at 5,815, in [[Bitlis]] at 850, in [[Urfa]] at 340, and tens of thousands at other areas. The archbishopric states that the Ottoman government undertook massacres of Assyrian civilians with "no revolutionary tendencies" in the provinces of Diyarbekir, Urfa, Van, Harput and Bitlis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Courtois|first1=Sébastien|title=The Forgotten Genocide: Eastern Christians, the Last Arameans|publisher=Gorgias Press|isbn=9781593330774|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whDcogCNZs4C&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=assyrian+massacre+urfa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_HHuVOCQF4KaygOS9oHwBA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=assyrian%20massacre%20urfa&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the number of "Nestorians", which refers to the Assyrian population, killed in Persia and Azerbaijan between 1915 and 1918, R.J. Rummel used Toynbee's and other contemporary reports to calculate a figure of deaths between 46,800 and 47,200. He calculated a death toll of 102,000 Christians in the Assyrian-populated regions of Turkey, but these numbers also included the Armenians and Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rummel|first1=R.J.|title=Statistics Of Turkey's Democide Estimates, Calculations, And Sources|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP5.HTM|publisher=University of Hawai'i|accessdate=15 April 2015}} [https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB5.1A.GIF Table 5.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrians were not subject to genocidal policies to the extent of the Armenians. However, in some provinces, particularly Diyarbakır and Mardin, the Assyrian population was devastated. In other provinces the population was left relatively intact.

Hannibal Travis, Assistant Professor of Law at [[Florida International University]], wrote in the peer-reviewed journal ''Genocide Studies and Prevention: An International Journal'' that:&lt;ref name="Travis"/&gt;

{{quotation|Numerous articles in the American press documented the genocide of Assyrians by the Turks and their Kurdish allies. By 1918, ''The Los Angeles Times'' carried the story of a Syrian, or most likely an Assyrian, merchant from Urmia who stated that his city was "completely wiped out, the inhabitants massacred", 200 surrounding villages ravaged, 200,000 of his people dead, and hundreds of thousands of more starving to death in exile from their agricultural lands. In an article entitled "Native Christians Massacred", the Associated Press correspondent reported that in the vicinity of Urmia, "Turkish regular troops and Kurds are persecuting and massacring Assyrian Christians". Close to 800 were confirmed dead in Urmia, and another 2,000 had perished from disease. Two hundred Assyrians had been burned to death inside a church, and the Russians had discovered more than 700 bodies of massacre victims in the village of Hafdewan outside Urmia, "mostly naked and mutilated", some with gunshot wounds, others decapitated, and still others carved to pieces.}}

Other leading British and American newspapers corroborated these accounts of the Assyrian genocide. ''The New York Times'' reported on 11 October that 12,000 Persian Christians had died of massacre, hunger, or disease; thousands of girls as young as seven had been raped or forcibly converted to Islam; Christian villages had been destroyed, and three-fourths of these Christian villages were burned to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1915/10/11/archives/article-8-no-title.html|accessdate=2008-08-19|title=Turkish Horrors in Persia|work=New York Times|date=1915-10-11|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' of London was perhaps the first widely respected publication to document the fact that 250,000 Assyrians and Chaldeans eventually died in the Ottoman genocide of Christians, a figure which many journalists and scholars have subsequently accepted.

===Eyewitness accounts and quotes===
Statement of German Missionaries on Urmia.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;There was absolutely no human power to protect these unhappy people from the savage onslaught of the invading hostile forces. It was an awful situation. At midnight the terrible exodus began; a concourse of 25,000 men, women, and children, Assyrians and Armenians, leaving cattle in the stables, all their household hoods and all the supply of food for winter, hurried, panic-stricken, on a long and painful journey to the Russian border, enduring the intense privations of a foot journey in the snow and mud, without any kind of preparation. ... It was a dreadful sight, ... many of the old people and children died along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Yohannan, Abraham. ''The Death of a Nation: Or, The Ever Persecuted Nestorians or Assyrian Christians''. London: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1916, pp. 119–120. {{ISBN|0-524-06235-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest news is that four thousand Assyrians and one hundred Armenians have died of disease alone, at the mission, within the last five months. All villages in the surrounding district with two or three exceptions have been plundered and burnt; twenty thousand Christians have been slaughtered in Armenia and its environs. In Haftewan, a village of Salmas, 750 corpses without heads have been recovered from the wells and cisterns alone. Why? Because the commanding officer had put a price on every Christian head...

Assyrian historians attribute the limited recognition to the smaller number of Assyrian survivors, whose leader [[Mar Shimun XIX Benyamin]] was killed in 1918.&lt;ref name="Travis"/&gt; For example, there are one million Armenians living in the United States alone, but even they were unable to persuade Congress to pass a [[United States resolution on Armenian genocide]]. In addition, the widespread massacres of all [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Christians]] in [[Asia Minor]] is sometimes referred to by Armenian authors as an "[[Armenian Genocide]]".

===Timeline of recognition===
* On April 24, 2001, Governor of the [[United States|US]] state of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[George Pataki]], proclaimed that "killings of civilians and food and water deprivation during forced marches across harsh, arid terrain proved successful for the perpetrators of genocide, who harbored a prejudice against ... Assyrian Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 1, 2001|url=http://www.armenian-genocide.org/keyword_search.assyrian/Affirmation.196/current_category.40/affirmation_detail.html|title=New York State Governor Proclamation|accessdate=2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2007, the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]], the world's leading genocide scholars organization, overwhelmingly passed a resolution officially recognizing the Assyrian genocide, along with the genocide against [[Ottoman Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20071215131949.htm|work=AINA|title=International Genocide Scholars Association Officially Recognizes Assyrian, Greek Genocides|first=Adam|last=Jones|date=2007-12-15|accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote in favor was 83%. The [[Interparliamentary Assembly on Orthodoxy]] (I.A.O.), passed a resolution officially recognizing the Assyrian genocide in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seyfocenter.com/index.php?sid=2&amp;aID=340|title=Seyfocenter|work=Seyfocenter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===

There are monuments commemorating the victims of the Assyrian genocide in [[France]], [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], [[Armenia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seyfocenter.com/index.php?sid=2&amp;aID=423|title=The unveiling of the Assyrian genocide monument in Armenia Representatives of the Assyrian community|publisher=Seyfo Center|accessdate=May 27, 2012|author=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/2013089120251.htm|title=The Assyrian Genocide Monument in Belgium|work=aina.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]] and the [[United States]]. Sweden's government has pledged to pay for all the expenses of a future monument, after strong lobbying from the large Assyrian community there, led by Konstantin Sabo. There are three monuments in the U.S., one in [[Chicago]], one in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and the newest in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assyrian Genocide Monument Unveiled in Australia|url=http://www.aina.org/releases/20100807163306.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greek-genocide.org/monument_columbia.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525092527/http://www.greek-genocide.org/monument_columbia.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-25 |title=The Genocide of Greeks, 1914-1923 |work=greek-genocide.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, a monument to the victims was built in [[Fairfield City]] in [[Australia]], a local government area of [[Sydney]] where [[Assyrian Australians|one in ten]] of the population is of Assyrian descent. Designed by Lewis Batros, the statue is designed as a hand of a martyr draped in an [[Assyrian flag]] and stands at 4.5 meters tall. The memorial [[statue]] was proposed in August 2009. After conference with the community, Fairfield Council received more than 100 submissions for the memorial and two petitions. 

The proposal has been condemned by the [[Turkish Australians|Australian Turkish]] community. Turkey's consul general to Sydney expressed resentment about the monument, while acknowledging that tragedies had occurred to Assyrians in the period as well as Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey protests Assyrian 'genocide' monument|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_turkey-protests-assyrian-genocide-monument_195309.html|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairfield City Champion, 16 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Assyrian Genocide Monument Unveiled in Australia|url=http://www.aina.org/releases/20100807163306.htm|agency=Assyrian International News Agency|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=31 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902172634/http://www.aina.org/releases/20100807163306.htm|archivedate=2 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30th of August 2010, twenty-three days after it was unveiled, the Australian monument was vandalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assyrian Genocide Monument in Australia Vandalized|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20100829191841.htm|agency=Assyrian International News Agency|date=August 30, 2010|accessdate=31 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831052445/http://www.aina.org/news/20100829191841.htm|archivedate=31 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assyrian memorial vandalised|url=http://www.fairfieldchampion.com.au/news/local/news/general/assyrian-memorial-vandalised/1926968.aspx|publisher=Fairfield Champion|date=30 August 2010|accessdate=31 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831211453/http://www.fairfieldchampion.com.au/news/local/news/general/assyrian-memorial-vandalised/1926968.aspx|archivedate=31 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genocide monument in Sydney, Australia was vandalized again on the 15th of April 2016, with the words "F**k Armenians, Assyrians and Jews" spray painted on the monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/assyrian-memorial-in-bonnyrigg-vandalised-20150416-1mmvgt.html|title=Assyrian memorial in Bonnyrigg vandalised|first=Kate|last=Aubusson|date=16 April 2015|publisher=|via=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aua.net/2015/04/assyrian-genocide-monument-vandalized-2015/|title=Assyrian Genocide Monument Vandalized 2015 – Assyrian Universal Alliance|website=aua.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkish perceptions ===
There are different perceptions in Turkey regarding the Assyrian genocide. The Armenian Turkish newspaper ''Agos'' has called the events the "Assyrian Genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seyfo’nun 100. Yılında Süryaniler harekete geçiyor|url=http://www.agos.com.tr/tr/yazi/10257/seyfonun-100-yilinda-suryaniler-harekete-geciyor|publisher=Agos|accessdate=16 April 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish journalist Mehmet Alaca referred to the events as "Seyfo" in his 2012 article in ''[[Radikal]]'' and wrote that tens of thousands of Assyrians were murdered and expelled at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alaca|first1=Mehmet|title=Mezopotamya'nın kadim talihsizleri|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/yenisoz/mezopotamyanin_kadim_talihsizleri-1110702|publisher=Radikal|accessdate=16 April 2015|language=Turkish|date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, historian Bülent Özdemir of the [[Balıkesir University]] has pointed out to an "Assyrian rebellion" in Midyat in 1915, and said that the Ottoman Empire cannot be accused of committing a genocide against the Assyrians in any way, claiming that this was supported by documents in foreign archives. He claimed that the fabrication of such a genocide was part of an Assyrian identity-building process. In 2007, Turkish Assyrian Mıtra Hazail Soumi classified the events not as a genocide, but as a massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yağcı|first1=Zübeyde Güneş|title=BÜLENT ÖZDEM R, Süryanilerin Dünü Bugünü I.

'''Avukaya''' is an ethnic group of [[South Sudan]]. Some members of this ethnic have fled to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] due to persecution.  About 50,000 members of this ethnic group live in South Sudan. Many members of this ethnic group belong to the Christian minority of South Sudan. The Avukaya traditionally live in a rain-forest area in [[Equatoria]] close to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in Southern Sudan.

Historically, the Avokaya people are originally in [[Maridi]] town, Mambe, Bahr-Olo and Amaki. Besides Maridi, the Avukaya people are found in Tore Payam of Yei river County, Yei town, Bangolo Payam in [[Mundri County]] and other towns of the Sudan too. The Avokaya are the group of ethnic tribes that combined with the Moru on the mountains to put an end to the King Gbudwe of the Azande invasion of their territory. They are known for a dance called Mamburuku and socialisation with other tribes. Many speak languages in addition to [[Avokaya language|Avokaya]].

The Avukaya commonly enjoy Pirinda with Nyasa (food made of [[sorghum]] or [[millet]] or [[cassava]] flour). They also like some wild fruits [[Omi]] and [[Kaniki]]) and yams.

'''Benin–Haiti relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|current and historical relationship]] between [[Benin]] and [[Haiti]].

==History==

Haiti and [[Benin]] maintain diplomatic relations with a Haitian office in Cotonou, although Benin does not currently maintain an official diplomatic presence in the country due to the 2010 earthquake. Benin contributed a contingency of 32 police/civilian personnel to [[MINUSTAH]].

The two countries share an extensive cultural history by way of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the resulting importing of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] as a religious force in Haitian society. The earthquake was followed, among many reactions, by an outburst of solidarity prayers in Benin with the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/africa-helps-haiti-earthquake-victims|title=Africa helps Haiti earthquake victims|publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]|date=20 January 2010|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional ceremonies were organized to appease the spirits and seek the blessing of ancestors for the Haitians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/benin-voodoo-rituals-calm-spirits-haiti|title=Benin: Voodoo rituals to calm the spirits in Haiti|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its uniform adoption of [[proportional representation]] in 1999, the [[United Kingdom]] used [[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] for the [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. The [[European Parliament constituency|European Parliament constituencies]] used under that system were smaller than the later regional constituencies and only had one [[Member of the European Parliament]] each.

The constituency of '''Birmingham North''' was one of them.

It consisted of the [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|Westminster Parliament constituencies]] of [[Aldridge-Brownhills (UK Parliament constituency)|Aldridge-Brownhills]], [[Birmingham Erdington (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Erdington]], [[Birmingham Perry Barr (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Perry Barr]], [[Birmingham Stechford (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Stechford]], [[Sutton Coldfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton Coldfield]], [[Warley East (UK Parliament constituency)|Warley East]], [[Warley West (UK Parliament constituency)|Warley West]], [[West Bromwich East (UK Parliament constituency)|West Bromwich East]], and [[West Bromwich West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Bromwich West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ |title=David Boothroyd's United Kingdom Election Results |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Felderer Gedenktafel.png|thumb|300px|right]]
[[File:Schlern - Rosengarten - September.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Rosengarten group]], one of South Tyrol's landmarks celebrated in the ''Bozner Bergsteigerlied'']]

The '''Bozner Bergsteigerlied''' ({{lang-en|'''[[Bozen]] mountaineer song'''}}) is one of the two unofficial hymns of the [[South Tyrol]]eans, the other being the ''[[Andreas Hofer|Andreas-Hofer]]-Lied''. Its lyrics were composed in 1926 by Karl Felderer in [[Ritten|Moos am Ritten]] to the melody of an old [[History of Tyrol|Tyrol]]ean craftsmen's song. 

At the time of its composition, the [[Italianization of South Tyrol]] campaign of the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]] had reached its height, effecting a prohibition of all names related to "Südtirol" and "Deutsch-Südtirol". Therefore, the lyrics never mention South Tyrol directly, referring instead to its geographical extension. 

In the first verse, its north-south extension is described by the way of the [[Eisack]] source and the [[Salurn|''Salurner Klause'']], a bottleneck which used to mark the border between the German and [[Italian language|Italian-speaking]] area. The West-East extension is characterized by the mountain [[Ortler]] and the [[Dolomites|Sexten Dolomites]]. In the following verses, various landmarks of South Tyrol such as the [[Schlern]] and the [[Rosengarten group]] are celebrated.

The '''coat of arms of Cluj-Napoca''' is the heraldic symbol standing for the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]]. The city's first recorded coat of arms dates back to 1369, and since then, the coat of arms has mostly kept its features, until 1948. In 1970 a new coat of arms was designed by the communist authorities, inserting the original heraldic symbol.

The current design dates from 1996, when the former mayor [[Gheorghe Funar]] organised a contest for the new symbol of the city.

== Description and symbolism ==
The current shield of Cluj-Napoca is party per fess; yellow (instead of [[or (heraldry)|or]]), bearing a white (instead of [[argent]]) [[Dacian Draco]]. The lower part is party per pale. The dexter part is of [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], bearing Goddess Athena - [[Minerva]]. The sinister part is of [[gules]], bearing the [[Monument of the Memorandists]].

The shield is topped by a [[mural crown]] with seven towers, which shows the city's status as a county seat. This is the only element that respects the rule.

Furthermore, the colors are the [[flag of Romania|national colors]], which contradicts the Committee's regulation on not using the {{lang-ro|[[flag of Romania|tricolor]]}} on the coat of arms of local authorities.

== History ==
[[File:CoA of Cluj (interbellum).png|thumb|left|The coat of arms of [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] Municipality between 1926 and 1948]]

Cluj's traditional coat of arms and seal was first awarded in 1377 by king [[Louis I of Hungary]]. It represents three towers, a city wall with a gate in silver on a blue background. It was the coat of arms of Cluj until communist rulers modified it introducing other elements but preserving the three towers in the bottom field. The three towers coat of arms was abandoned by nationalist mayor [[Gheorghe Funar]], in a move which did not respect the respective Romanian law. As of 2009 the subsequent mayors of [[Cluj-Napoca]] failed to reintroduce the traditional coat of arms as demanded by many heraldists, historians and civil activists.

The coat of arms of Leipzig dates back to the 14th century and is based on the Wettin shield of Meissen. It had the lion from the start and to it was added a second field with blue pales around 1475. These are called the Landsberger Pfähle, for Leipzig was under Mark Landsberg, [[Margraviate of Landsberg]].

Only the city may use the arms, as it is the right of it as the right of its name according to German law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leipzig.de/buergerservice-und-verwaltung/unsere-stadt/stadtwappen-und-marketingwappen/&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat of arms of [[Chemnitz]] is very similar.

DIIS - The Danish Institute for International Studies is a public institute for independent research and analysis of international affairs, financed primarily by the Danish state. DIIS conducts and communicates multidisciplinary research on globalisation, security, development and foreign policy.

DIIS has approximately 100 employees, comprising both research and support staff. Researchers have different academic backgrounds, mostly in social studies, international development studies, military studies and anthropology. DIIS contributes to the education of researchers both at home and in developing countries and welcomes practitioners from relevant ministries for prolonged periods of time, in order to qualify the knowledge of how DIIS research is used outside of academic circles. 
The institute performs and communicates basic research, research-based consultancy and commissioned work. Commissioned policy work can be requested by the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]], its ministries, NGOs and other clients. DIIS participates in academic networks and publishes in high-ranking academic journals. 
The legal foundation for DIIS states, that the institute must continuously assess Denmark's foreign policy and political situation and inform the Danish media, politicians and the public about its findings. 

DIIS was founded as an independent institution by law nr. 411 of 6 June 2002, and the Institute commenced activities on 1 January 2003. DIIS was created as a fusion of the former Center for Freds og Konfliktforskning (COPRI), Center for Udviklingsforskning (CUF), Dansk Center for Holocaust- og Folkedrabsstudier (DCHF) og Dansk Udenrigspolitisk Institut (DUPI). The current law is [http://law%20nr%20554%20of%2018%20June%202012 law nr 554 of 18 June 2012]. 

DIIS is led by a board primarily from academia, in order to secure that the institute fulfils its scholarly obligations. The director is appointed by the board and advised by an internal Research Committee on strategic planning of the institute's research. DIIS is committed to the Principles of Research Integrity.

According to the law, the purpose of DIIS is to:
1.	Conduct, promote and coordinate independent research on international affairs.
2.	Perform research and analysis as requested by the Danish Parliament, the government or on own initiative and follow the international development in order to evaluate Denmark's foreign- and security political situation in a broad political and economical understanding, including Denmark's place in relation to development policies.
3.	Communicate research results, analysis and knowledge as well as conduct documentation- and information activities including a public library, on international relations.
4.	Participate in the education of researchers through cooperation with other research institutes, including support the development of research capacity in developing countries, as well as supporting further education for the users of the Institute
5.	Act as connector between Danish and international research environments within research on international affairs.

The Think Tanks and Civil societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania ranks DIIS in [https://repository.upenn.edu/think_tanks/ the annual Go To Think Tank Index]. The institute is ranked consistently high: in 2017 DIIS was ranked fifth among research institutes in Western Europe, and in 2018 the index improved DIIS’ ranking to fourth in Western Europe.

''' Dothenses'''  was a population of ancient [[Numidia]] whose location is unknown, but it could be located near the cave of [[Djebel-Taya]] and [[Thibilis]], in [[Guelma]] ([[Algeria]]). The existence of this city is known thanks to numerous votive inscriptions dedicated to god 
[[Bacax]] recorded on the walls of the cave of Djebel-Taya. In five of these inscriptions is mentioned about the Dothenses community, that would be responsible for conducting the annual offerings to the deity in the spring months.

The '''flag of [[Dalmatia]]''' consists of two identical horizontal stripes of [[blue]] and [[yellow]]. Like the [[Croatian flag]], it draws its modern roots from the period of the [[Austrian Empire]], specifically from the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. The [[coat of arms of Dalmatia]] - blue with three golden crowned leopard (lion guardant) heads - is never used on it, it is a simple yellow over blue bicolour without any emblem, as was custom of Austrian ''"landesfarben"''. The coat of arms was possibly sometimes set in it, but this was far from official. 

Bi-colour flag of Dalmatia was designed in 1802., and made for the first time mede in 1803. The flag is officially in use as a flag of Kingdom of Dalmatia since 1822. when it was accepted by Royal Council in Zadar. After 1918. there was no administrative region of Dalmatia, and no flag was used. The Dalmatian counties of modern-day Croatia inherit blue and yellow colours, but no one has the right to "claim" the entire historical Dalmatian coat of arms. The coat of arms is, on the other hand, included in the Croatian coat of arms and the flag.&lt;ref&gt;Željko Heimer, February 8 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

However, mostly as souvenirs, the banners of arms of Dalmatia were sometimes used, and occasionally Italian groups with pretensions on Dalmatia, or those who left Dalmatia after [[World War II]], used such flags in the last 50 years - always unofficially. An alternate version of the flag, featuring [[bleu celeste]] instead of azure, is almost indistinguishable from the modern [[flag of Ukraine]], though there is no connection between the two.

'''Ganga''' is a type of singing that originated from rural [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], and [[Montenegro]]. It is most commonly found in the regions of [[Herzegovina]] and [[Dalmatia]], but it can also be heard in [[Lika]], [[Karlovac County|Karlovac]] and rural areas of western Montenegro. It is characterized by a lone singer singing a single line of lyrics, followed by others joining in, using a vocal style that is best described as a [[wail]].

Ganga is situated mainly in small towns. The culture surrounding Ganga is protected by the [[Croatian Ministry of Culture]] to preserve its place in Croatian culture and to encourage its study. Several popular [[Croatian music|Croatian musicians]] have incorporated some Ganga into their work. 

==History==

The folk songs of [[Duvno]] are descendants of Ganga music and also study the history of Ganga. The parallels with [[ojkavica]] from Dalmatia indicates that Zadar hinterland, Dalmatia, Imotski region and western Herzegovina sang the same type of Ganga.

==Style==

Ganga is an expressive form of singing. Recently has Ganga begun to address political issues, frequently adopting overtly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] overtones and incorporating themes from the [[Croatian Homeland War]]. Although both men and women regularly perform Ganga, it is extremely unusual for them to perform together, although it was not unusual for Catholic and Muslim men to perform together.

Ganga is a dissonant form of singing, using two clashing notes to project sound over long distances. For example, if one person is singing a "C" note, a second person sings either a half-step above or below ("B" or "C#"). Ganga is traditionally sung by sheepherders across stretches of valleys, for long-distance communication with each other.

Ganga is sung more in the summer than in the winter, because of the lack of farming in rural areas in the winter.

===Variations===

''Ojkanje'' refers to the characteristic style of singing with a shaking voice, often described as "from the throat". Elements of local folk singing is usually referred to as old or ''starovinska'' singing. Such singing in the [[Cetina Valley]] is called ''ojkavica,'' in the Dalmatian hinterland ''ojkavica'', in the hinterland ''ojkavica'', in line Kotari and [[Bukovica]] ''orzenje'' - the rouge rozganje and in Hercegovini and ''Imotski pivanje''. It is a remnant of [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] singing by local people, retained as part of their identity and history. It originated in Archaic and Medieval times, when the [[Illyrians]] were present. "Ganga / kënga" in Albanian (i.e. descendant of the Illyrian language branch) means just "song".

The '''Garessina''' or '''Muma''' is a [[breed]] of small [[sheep]] from the Garessina, the area surrounding [[Garessio]] in the [[province of Cuneo]], in [[Piemonte]] in north-west Italy.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; It is raised principally in the valleys of the [[Tanaro (river)|Tanaro]], its affluent the Negrone, and the Casotto; it is not raised commercially, but kept as a family sheep.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt; It has been influenced by Spanish [[Merino]] and French Alpine breeds. The wool is of fine quality.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; The Garessina is one of the forty-two autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep-breeders.&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt;

Under the national Piano Sviluppo Regionale or regional development plan for 2000–2006, a subsidy was available for those who kept Garessina sheep; in 2004 it was claimed for 64 head.&lt;ref name=rare2/&gt; In 2013 the total number recorded for the breed was 110.&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt;

'''''Geoff Lloyd with Annabel Port''''' was a drivetime radio programme, broadcast on [[Absolute Radio]].

The show ran for two hours, between 6pm and 9pm, Monday to Thursday, and 6pm to 8pm on Fridays. Presented by [[Geoff Lloyd]], it also featured his 'symposium', comprising himself, [[Annabel Port]], Gareth Evans and newsreader Tania Snuggs. A daily podcast of the previous afternoon's show was also produced. During the introductions of each of the podcasts, Geoff read out dedications sent in by listeners, known as a ''Podication''.

On 18 January 2017, Geoff announced on air that the show will be coming to an end in Spring 2017. The final show was broadcast on 12 April 2017.

==Features==

*'''Introduction''' - Geoff says: "It's x minutes past five , it's Absolute Radio, I'm Geoff Lloyd and it's hometime". After jingles etc. Geoff introduces the team (typically Annabel Port, 'Gruff', person reading tweets and "your newsreader" Tania Snuggs) who all give a cheerful "hello" over the jolly tune of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wi1d0FNgdQ We're from Barcelona] by [[I'm from Barcelona]].
*'''Geoffanory''': A play on the BBC programme [[Jackanory]], in which Geoff presents a phone in topic and then gives an example story from his own (often rather odd) life, asking the callers to better it. Calls are then put on the air, with texts and e-mail read out by Annabel.
*'''Talk to the Animals''': An occasional feature where callers who are close to an animal are invited to call in. If they can get the animal to make a noise within 10 seconds, they win a prize (normally gig tickets).
*'''Annabel's All Star Postbag''': A feature where Annabel Port reads letters supposedly sent into the show by famous people. The background music for the section is an old Geoff Show favourite, [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=typewriter+tip+tip+tip&amp;aq=0 Typewriter Tip Tip] from the Typewriter Scene of the 1970 film ''[[Bombay Talkie]]''.
*'''Record of the Week''': Each week, Geoff chooses a song and plays it each day, as his record of the week.
*'''Podication (Podcast only material)''': Carried over from [[the Geoff Show]] days, this feature appears at the end of the podcast editions of each show. Listeners can email in and ask for a specific day's podcast to be dedicated to them or someone they know, with Geoff reading their email out.
*'''Members Only Hour''': From 7pm Monday to Thursday, the show is only open to members. Geoff advises non-members to tune to another station, playing obscure songs and audio clips and pretending they are other stations. Listeners are asked to submit their 'apologies' for missing Members Only Hour via Twitter and Facebook. A selection of these are read out by Annabel. There then is usually either phone-in topic revealed, deemed too high-brow for the usual listeners. Occasionally, bands play live sessions during this segment.
*'''Feed the Trolls''': Every day Annabel is tasked with finding a popular news article (often from left or right-wing news sites) and creating a comment that will cause a response (nb. [[Internet Troll|Trolling]]). Comments are usually the opposite to the general view of comments already on the site, and the comment is written earlier in the day to get maximum response. Funny responses and the how it was received are read at the end of the show on Monday - Thursday (often being rushed to fit in) and just before 7pm on a Friday.
The show also regularly featured music sessions from bands and singers, many of which are available to watch on the show's website.
*'''I Want to Be Adored''': A caller was asked a series of questions by Geoff and the symposium then told the caller what they thought of him/her. Listeners were encouraged to text in either 'pass' or 'fail', depending on whether or not they liked the person, with Annabel then reading the percentages out and determining whether the person is or is not liked and loved by general society. A prize was given whether the caller is loved or not, for going through such an ordeal. The theme tune was "I Want to Be Loved by You" by [[Marilyn Monroe]]. This feature was dropped in January 2009.
*'''A Pause for Port''': Annabel tells a story about a song she listened to earlier that day. The story begins nicely, but Annabel then starts to analyse the lyrics and draw negatives from them, with the story normally ending with how she would engage in some sort of self-harm rather than listen to the song again. Geoff then plays the aforementioned song. This feature was discontinued in July 2009.
*'''The Big I Am...''': Carried over from Geoff's old evening show, a feature where listeners have to text in a description of what they are doing, starting with the words "I am" in the style of the original social networks, with all Facebook status updates once having to begin with "I am". Annabel read out a selection to "I Am What I Am" by [[Gloria Gaynor]]. This was originally a daily feature.
*'''Any Other Business''': This feature was broadcast Mon-Thurs, just after 7 o'clock and showcased late listener contributions to phone-in topics from previous shows. It was retired upon the introduction of the Members' Only Hour
*'''Annabel's challenge''': Each week, Geoff gives Annabel a task.

==Geoff Lloyd's Hometime Show==
Between its launch in 2008 and August 2015, the show ran from 5pm to 8pm on Monday to Thursday, and 6pm to 8pm on Fridays, under the name "Geoff Lloyd's Hometime Show", with many of the same features as the show after that time. It was moved because the no-repeat guarantee was extended for an extra hour until 6pm, with a new show hosted by [[Danielle Perry]] between 4pm and 6pm

'''Hungarian Sign Language''' is the [[sign language]] of Deaf people in [[Hungary]]. There is historical evidence that Hungarian and [[Austrian Sign Language]] are related, but Bickford (2005) found that Hungarian, Slovak, and Czech Sign formed a cluster with Romanian, Bulgarian, and Polish Sign rather than with Austrian.&lt;ref&gt;Bickford, 2005. [http://www.sil.org/silesr/2005/silesr2005-026.pdf ''The Signed Languages of Eastern Europe'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009 the Hungarian Parliament unanimously passed an act on Hungarian Sign Language and The Protection of Hungarian Sign Language.

{{Hungarian language}}
[[File:Ungarische Dialekte.png|thumb|250px|right|The Hungarian dialects in Hungary and other countries according to an older Hungarian distribution]]

The [[dialects]] of the [[Hungarian language]] identified by [[Ethnologue]] are: [[Great Hungarian Plain]], West Danube, Danube-[[Tisza]] (territories between the two rivers),  King's Pass Hungarian (Pass in [[Apuseni Mountains]]), Northeast Hungarian, Northwest Hungarian, [[Székely]] and West Hungarian.  These dialects are, for the most part, [[mutually intelligible]].

The Hungarian [[Csángó]] dialect, which is mentioned but not listed separately by Ethnologue, is spoken primarily in [[Bacău County]]  in eastern Romania. The Csángó Hungarian group has been largely isolated from other [[Hungarian people]], and they therefore preserved a dialect closely resembling an earlier form of Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;http://mek.oszk.hu/02700/02789/html/119.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian researchers distinguish ten dialects. The dialects are as follows:{{cn|date = May 2013}}

*[[Western Transdanubia]],
*[[Central Transdanubia]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Little Hungarian Plain]],
*[[Southern Transdanubia]],
*[[Southern Great Plain]],
*region of [[Palóc]],
*region of [[Tisza]]–[[Körös River|Körös]],
*Northeast Hungary,
*[[Transylvanian Plain]],
*[[Székelys|Székely]],
*[[Moldavia|Moldavian]] (Csángó),

==Classification==
{{expand section|date=September 2013}}

There is a regular [[sound change]] in some{{which|date=September 2013}} Hungarian dialects by omitting the sound /l/ at the end of the words and [[Compensatory lengthening|lengthening the preceding vowel]]. In case of ''vacak'''ol''''' &lt;vaczakol&gt; (potters about), singular third person, people say in some Hungarian dialects ''vacak'''ó''''', instead of ''hoz'''ol''''' → ''hoz'''ó''''' "you bring", ''viszel'' → ''visző'' &lt;vis&gt; "you take" and for ''kap'''ol''''' → ''kap'''ó''''' "you get". In many cases syllable-final /l/ is also vocalized in the middle of words, e.g. ''sz'''öl'''lő'' → ''sz'''ő'''lő'' "grape". Furthermore, a similar change has happened to the partner-sound /r/ by the same rule: ''mik'''or''''' → ''mik'''ó''''' "when", and ''akk'''or''''' → ''akk'''ó''''' "then".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">The '''Instituto de Física Corpuscular (IFIC''', [[English language|English]]: ''Institute for Corpuscular Physics'') is a [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] and [[University of Valencia]] joint center dedicated to experimental and theoretical research in the fields of [[particle physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[cosmology]], [[astroparticle physics|astroparticles]] and [[medical physics]].

It is located at the [http://www.pcuv.es scientific park] of the University of Valencia, in [[Paterna]] ([[Valencia, Spain]]).

==History==
In the autumn of 1950 Prof. Joaquin Catalá formed a group in Valencia to study [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and [[elementary particles]] using [[nuclear emulsion]]s. 
He had first been working in [[Bristol]] with [[Cecil Frank Powell|C.F. Powell]],
who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1950 for using this technique to detect
particles in [[cosmic rays]].

Prof. Catalá’s group first operated as a Local Division of the Instituto de Óptica Daza de Valdés 
belonging to CSIC and specialized in photo-nuclear studies. One of Catalá’s students, Fernando Senent, later becoming Professor and director of the Institute, produced what was the first Spanish thesis in Experimental Particle and Nuclear Physics. It was at the beginning of 1960 when the Institute got its present name, IFIC, Instituto de Física Corpuscular. IFIC, hence, is one of the oldest Spanish Institutes in Experimental Physics and the oldest studying particle and nuclear physics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="988">'''Māras''' ({{IPA-lv|mɑːras̪|}})  or '''Māra Day''' (sometimes referred as '''Great Māra Day''' or '''Mother Day''') was a [[Latvians|Latvian]] festival, devoted to [[Māra]], an ancient deity, and was celebrated on [[15 August]].  According to [[Sun|solar]] calendar, Māras marks the midpoint between [[Jāņi]], which is summer [[solstice]], and [[Miķeļi]], that represents the end of the harvest season. The actual date, likely, is the result of [[Christianity|Christian]] influence, identifying Māra with [[Virgin Mary]], whose devoted holiday ([[Assumption of Mary]]) is observed on 15 August.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3127">Colonel '''Necabettin Ergenekon''' (born 1926, in [[Erzurum]]) is a [[Turkish Army]] officer who retired in 1982, having been commander of the [[Turkish Gendarmerie]] in [[Adıyaman Province]] after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]]. Born ''Necabettin Baltacı'', he changed his name "some time in the '60s" to avoid confusion with another person by the same name.&lt;ref name=Zaman/&gt; At one time, Ergenekon was the commanding officer of [[Veli Küçük]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Akin Ünver (2009), "[http://dspace.cigilibrary.org/jspui/bitstream/123456789/27137/1/Turkeys%20Deep-State%20and%20the%20Ergenekon%20Conundrum.pdf?1 Turkey’s “Deep-State” and the Ergenekon Conundrum]", The Middle East Institute Policy Brief 23, April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Ergenekon was suspected by later-assassinated state prosecutor [[Cevat Yurdakul]] as being behind a string of mysterious deaths in the 70s, but no legal action was ever taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalHaberDetay&amp;ArticleID=911847|accessdate=2008-12-27|title=Özel Harp Dairesi’nden Jitem’e|section=Radikal 2 |work=[[Radikal]]|date=2008-12-07|first=Ahmet|last=Insel|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the development of public discussion about the [[Ergenekon (organization)|Ergenekon organization]] in the 2000s, Ergenekon's name has sometimes been raised as a possible participant, possibly even responsible for its naming. Ergenekon rejects these allegations and says his name (chosen for the [[Ergenekon]] myth) has been besmirched by traitors.&lt;ref name=Zaman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=715853&amp;title=veli-kucukun-komutani-ergenekon-vatan-hainleri-soyadimi-kirletti|accessdate=2008-11-19|title=Veli Küçük'ün komutanı Ergenekon: Vatan hainleri soyadımı kirletti|language=Turkish|date=2008-07-19|work=Zaman|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011041058/http://zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=715853&amp;title=veli-kucukun-komutani-ergenekon-vatan-hainleri-soyadimi-kirletti|archivedate=2008-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key [[Ergenekon trials]] witness [[Tuncay Güney]] claims Ergenekon introduced him to [[Veli Küçük]], a key defendant in the trials. Güney also alleged that Ergenekon had had discussions with [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;yenicaggazetesi.com.tr, [http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/yeni/haberdetay.php?hit=12496 GÖZDEN KAÇAN AYRINTI]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008 ''[[Yeni Şafak]]'' claimed that Ergenekon had led the [[1995 Azeri coup d'état attempt]], which had support from elements in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 17 December 2008, [http://todayszaman.com/news-161485-report-garihs-execution-warrant-issued-in-1995.html Report: Garih’s execution warrant issued in 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yeni Şafak]]'', 24 December 2008, [http://yenisafak.com.tr/Gundem/?t=24.12.2008&amp;i=156509 Üzeyir Garih'in ipi Aliyev'e darbe planında çekildi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sakara drum''' is one of the four major families of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] drums of [[Nigeria]]. The other families are the Dundun/Gangan or [[talking drum]], the [[Batá drum]] and the [[Gbedu]] drum.
Each family includes drums of different sizes, with the mother drum (iya ilu) playing the lead role and other drums playing in support.&lt;ref name=kayinsola&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sakara is also made and used by the [[Hausa people]] of northern Nigeria.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite web

The Sakara is a shallow drum with a circular body made with baked clay.&lt;ref name=lagbaja&gt;{{cite web

The clay shell is perhaps ten inches in diameter and one and a half inches deep, sloping inward funnel-wise towards the back. The skin is secured to the shell with twine and tuned using pegs spaced around its body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The men use goat skin to make the heads of these drums, or for the largest drum may use cow or antelope skin.&lt;ref name=voa/&gt;
The fingers of one hand change the tone of the drum, while the drummer hits the face of the drum with a stick. 
When several sakara drums are played together, the iya ilu is the main voice, and dictates the pace and rhythmic style. 
The fixed pitch omele ako and omele abo drums talk rhythmically, and the smaller and higher-toned omele "chord" drum adds flavour by playing varied pitches.&lt;ref name=lagbaja/&gt;

The Yoruba have traditionally used Sakara drums for a variety of purposes. They are played during Yoruba wedding ceremonies. The [[Were music|Wéré music]] was traditionally played using Sakara drums to call Muslims to feast and prayer during [[Ramadan]]. 
[[Fuji music]] grew from this musical form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Taras Shevchenko Transnistria State University''' ({{lang-ru|Приднестровский государственный университет имени Т. Г. Шевченко}}) is the main university located in [[Tiraspol]], the capital of [[Transnistria]]. The original university in Tiraspol was founded in 1930 as the [[Institute of public education]] in the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], then being a constituent part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

Honouring the Ukrainian poet and painter [[Taras Shevchenko]] it was renamed during his 125th anniversary celebration in 1939.

In July 1992 the university was officially moved to Chișinău, where it continues to function under the name of ''Universitatea de Stat din Tiraspol'' (UST).&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/usttemporar/informatii-generale/conducere/istorie&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the university was split in two, both claiming to be the original university founded in 1930.

The TSTSU consists of 12 buildings.  It offers internationally accredited courses in partnerships with universities in Russia. Students can study both internally and in absentia. Not only citizens of Transnistria can study there but also people from abroad. Education can be both free and paid.

The university has 14 faculties and 84 chairs, offering 54 different majors. Attendance is given at between 10,000 and 15,000 students per year and classes are taught in three languages: Russian, Moldovan and Ukrainian.

The university employs over 1,000 teaching staff including 36 Doctors and 220 Masters of Science.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.president-pmr.org/english/index_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pridnestrovie.net/universities.html&lt;/ref&gt; Among its publications, the [[Atlas of Pridnestrovie]] is often used as a source for data, specialized maps and statistics on Transnistria.

The '''Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC)''' ({{lang-si|ශ්‍රී ලංකා ගුවන් විදුලි සංස්ථාව}}, ''Shrī Lankā Guvan Viduli Sansthāva'', {{lang-ta|இலங்கை ஒலிபரப்புக் கூட்டுத்தாபனம்}}, ''Ilangkai Oliparappuk Kūṭṭuttāpaṉam'') came into existence on 5 January 1967 when [[Radio Ceylon]] became a public corporation. [[Dudley Senanayake]] who was the Prime Minister of [[Ceylon]] in 1967 ceremonially opened the newly established Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation along with Minister [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] and the Director General of the CBC, [[Neville Jayaweera]].The first board of Directors of CBC consisted of Mr. Neville Jayaweera (CCS), Mr.A.L.M.Hashim, Mr.Dharmasiri Kuruppu, Mr. K.A.G. Perera and Mr. Devar Surya Sena. After the first board meeting it was decided unanimously to appoint the chairman, Mr.Jayaweera, as the new Director General.

==Radio Ceylon==
The Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), formerly Radio Ceylon, is the oldest radio station in South Asia, and was founded as [[Colombo]] Radio in 1925. [[Edward Harper (engineer)|Edward Harper]] who was then the ''Chief Engineer'' at the Telegraph Department in 1921, was the first person who initiated experimental broadcasts in Ceylon. The first ever broadcast on an experimental basis took place in 1923. [[gramophone record|Gramophone]] music was played from the Ceylon Telegraph Office with the aid of a transmitter built by engineers of the Telegraph Department. The transmitter was built using radio equipment from a captured German submarine. Ceylon began a broadcasting service three years after the launching of broadcasting services in Europe.

Edward Harper who is known as the'' 'Father of Broadcasting in Ceylon''' founded the Ceylon Wireless Club together with British and Sri Lankan radio enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="Edward Harper"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reference to Edward Harper, the Father of Broadcasting in Ceylon (World Music Central)|url=http://worldmusiccentral.org/article.php/2006011112411332|accessdate=27 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910190114/http://worldmusiccentral.org/article.php/2006011112411332|archivedate=10 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Hugh Clifford]], the British Governor, spoke to the nation on Colombo Radio for the first time on 16 December 1925. This was a historic occasion. The advent of broadcasting in Sri Lanka, places the country alongside Great Britain, the United States of America and Germany, in terms of international broadcasting history.

==Radio SEAC==
During [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] took over radio operations in Colombo and Radio Seac was born.&lt;ref name="Radio SEAC"&gt;{{cite web |title= Radio SEAC Ceylon (Radio Heritage Foundation)|url=http://www.radioheritage.net/FDD.asp|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombo based (British) announcers, [[David Jacobs (broadcaster)|David Jacobs]] and [[Desmond Carrington]] (who joined the [[BBC]] after the war) were among those who presented the news and radio programs for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] across South-East Asia. When the war was over, [[Radio Seac]] was handed back to the Government of Ceylon. This was when the name was changed to ''Radio Ceylon''. The name change heralded a new chapter in broadcasting in South Asia.

[[File:Slbc.jpg|right|thumb|Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]]

==Radio Ceylon==
Radio Ceylon enjoyed the status 'King of the airwaves' of South Asia in the 1950s and 1960s. Millions of listeners tuned into the radio broadcasts. This was the golden era of Radio Ceylon.&lt;ref name="Radio Ceylon"&gt;{{cite web |title=When Ceylon ruled the airwaves|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2006/01/01/stories/2006010100150400.htm |accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clifford Dodd]], an administrator from Australia was brought in under the [[Colombo Plan]].

The '''''šubara''''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|шубара}}) is a type of traditional male winter hat used by the [[Serbs]] in [[Serbian dress|folk attire]]. It is in a conical or cylindrical shape predominantly in black colour, because of the black lamb/sheep fur (woolen).&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=KN5BAAAAYAAJ |title=Natural resources and beauties of the Socialist Republic of Serbia |page=87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=qblAAAAAIAAJ |title=A Serbian village }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a traditional peasant hat used in harsher and colder times.

It usually has the [[cockade]] (''kokarda'') of the [[Serbian eagle]] or other [[Serbian symbols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=DicVpKMgBY8C |title=Armies in the Balkans 1914–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
