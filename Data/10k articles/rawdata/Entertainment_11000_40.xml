[[File:Horse race, Churchill Downs 2008-04-18.jpg|thumb|250px|Horse racing is a very popular sporting event involving animals.]]

'''Animals in sport''' are a specific form of working animals.  Many animals, at least in more commercial sports, are highly trained.  Two of the most common animals in sport are horses and dogs.

==Types of animal sporting events==
There are many types of animal sporting events, with varying levels of participation from humans. Some are solely between the animals while others use the animals in a lesser role.  Most sports involve training, while some can also involve selective breeding.

There are some large-scale events that include animals in a variety of sports.  A rodeo can comprise many different sports, ranging from bull riding to pole bending. Some of the most well known types of animal racing may be, Horse racing, Dog racing (Greyhound racing), Pigeon racing, Camel racing, and (even Mule racing which mainly takes place in some parts of California etc,) as well as many more.
[[File:JASDogRace.JPG|thumb|Greyhounds preparing for a race.]]

===Racing===

Racing is the most popular form of animal-related sport, particularly horse racing.  Some racing events directly involve humans as riders while others see the animals race alone.  In some sports the rider is not directly riding the animal, instead being pulled along.  Examples of this include harness racing, dogsled racing and popular ancient Greece and Roman Empire sport of chariot racing.

[[Greyhound racing]], a popular form of animal racing, dates back to the 1800s in the United States, after the dogs were brought over from Europe to help control the [[hare]] population. While track racing is the most common, there are other forms of racing.  [[Pigeon racing]], for example, sees [[homing pigeons]] finding their way home from a set distance away. [[Kambala]], he-buffalo racing in coastal Karnataka, India is a rural spectator racing conducted every year during winter in about 50 towns/villages.
Racing events are a common way to [[gambling|gamble]], with billions spent worldwide every year.  This is one reason that some countries or states have made such sports illegal.

===One-on-one and team events===
There are some non-racing competitive events involving animals.  [[Polo]] is an example, with competitors hitting a [[ball]] with [[mallet]]s while on horseback.  [[Elephant polo]] dates back to the early 20th century when members of the British aristocracy in [[Nepal]] began playing the sport.

In the 14th to 16th centuries [[jousting]] was a popular one-on-one tournament event involving knights on horseback.

===Fighting===
[[File:Bull attacks matador.jpg|thumb|Bullfighting is legal in some countries.]]
In most counties the act of two or more animals fighting each other, such as [[cockfighting]], and [[dog fighting]], is seen as cruel and is therefore illegal.  Some legal animal fights take place around the world, including [[cow fighting]] and [[camel wrestling]].  There are also some legal forms of sport where humans fight animals, such as [[bullfighting]] which has a long history in Spanish and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] tradition.  Not all animals are large, however, with [[cricket fighting]] being a popular (though illegal to gamble on) sport in [[Macau]] and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theregister.co.uk/2004/08/16/cricket_fighting_ring/ HK feds bust illegal]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other [[blood sport]]s in history that were intended as entertainment, many of which involved [[bait (dogs)|baiting by dogs]].  Many different types of animal have been placed into a pit, sometimes tied to a post, and set upon by dogs.  This ranges from [[rat-baiting]] and [[badger-baiting]] to [[bear-baiting]] and [[lion-baiting]].  There are even some tales of [[human-baiting]].

Animals that take part in animal fights are usually specifically bred for strength and stamina.

===Hunting===
[[File:BedaleHunt2005.jpg|thumb|Fox hunting has been a recent controversial issue, particularly in the United Kingdom.]]
{{main|Hunting}}
Hunting began as a crucial component of [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, being an important source of food.  The domestication of animals and the development of [[agriculture]] lessened the need for hunts, with food being more readily available. Hunting became a sport for those of the high [[social class]]es.  In most parts of [[medieval]] Europe, the upper-class (aristocracy and higher clergy) obtained as privilege the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory.

Dangerous hunting, as for lions or wild boars, usually on horseback (or from a [[chariot]], as in [[History of ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]]) also had function similar to [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and manly sports: an honourable, somewhat competitive pastime to help the aristocracy practice skills of war in times of peace.  In [[ancient Rome]] the "[[Venatio]]" was a form of entertainment that pitted humans against animals in an amphitheater.

In modern times, hunting is usually legal as long as the hunter has a license, though there are some unregulated forms in some countries.  Animals can be on either side of a hunt, assisting the hunters or being hunted themselves.

[[Fox hunting]] has been a controversial issue, particularly in the United Kingdom, regarding its necessity and the cruelty involved (See [[Fox hunting legislation]]).

====Fishing====
[[Fishing]] is somewhat different from other sports and is most commonly a pastime or hobby.  However, it can also be [[Sport fishing|a competitive sport]].

====Pigeon shooting====
[[Pigeon shooting]] was one of the [[Shooting at the 1900 Summer Olympics|shooting events]] of the [[1900 Summer Olympics]]. Competitors in these events had to kill as many live pigeons as possible. Birds were released one at a time from 'traps' in front of the shooters.

===Shows of training or breeding===
[[File:JackRussellJump wb.jpg|thumb|A [[Jack Russell Terrier]] competing in a dog agility event.]]
Shows are intended to highlight the excellence of training or [[Selective breeding|breeding]] of the animals involved.  There is a variety of horse riding sports in this category, including [[show jumping]] and [[dressage]], both of which are featured at the [[Olympic Games]]. At lower levels, [[horse show]]s offer a wide variety of competition both [[Equestrianism|riding and driving]] as well as [[halter (horse show)|In-hand]] classes that evaluate [[equine conformation]].

Dogs, being easily [[domesticated animal|domesticated]], are one of the most popular animals to have in shows. [[Cattle]] and [[sheepdog trial]]s are popular in many countries and are used to show how well a dog can [[muster (livestock)|gather]] livestock. Other [[dog sports]] of this category include [[dog agility]] events, whereby the dogs must tackle [[obstacle course]]s, and [[obedience trial]]s, where they must execute a predefined set of tasks.

[[Crufts]], a British [[conformation show]] for dogs, has grown since it started in 1886.  While dogs are the most common show animal, [[cat show]]s are also common.  Both of these animals have a wide variety of breeds and compete in categories, comparing each individual to the breed "ideal."

Some unusual animals also take part in shows, such as the competitors in [[rabbit show jumping]] and [[common chaffinch]]es in [[vinkenzetting]].

==Popular culture==
Films and television series about animals in sport can be realistic or fictional, involving animals in an activity that they cannot really perform.  ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'' is a fairly accurate portrayal of the famous American [[Seabiscuit|horse of the same name]], while ''[[MVP: Most Valuable Primate]]'', a film about a [[hockey]]-playing [[chimpanzee]], is unrealistic.

The 1980 [[animation|animated]] film ''[[Animalympics]]'' is a spoof of the Olympic Games and features [[anthropomorphic]]ised animals.  In the combination [[live action]] and [[animation]] film ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', animated animals play a game of [[association football|football]].  Similarly, several television commercials used the [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] and other animals in live-action and [[Computer animation|CGA]] roles to appear to be playing [[American football]].

From 1976 to 1999, the [[BBC]] broadcast ''[[One Man and His Dog]]'', a television series about sheepdog trials.  They also commissioned three series of ''[[Pets Win Prizes]]'', a [[game show]] with contestants' pets having to perform in various tasks.

''[[Man vs. Beast]]'' is an American television show that pitches humans against animals in a variety of unusual challenges, including [[competitive eating]] between world champion [[Takeru Kobayashi]] and a [[brown bear]].

An '''aquarium''' (plural: ''aquariums'' or ''aquaria'') is a [[vivarium]] of any size having at least one transparent side in which aquatic plants or animals are kept and displayed. [[fishkeeping|Fishkeepers]] use aquaria to keep [[fish]], [[invertebrate]]s, [[amphibians]], aquatic reptiles such as [[turtle]]s, and [[aquatic plant]]s. The term "aquarium", coined by English naturalist [[Philip Henry Gosse]], combines the [[Latin]] root ''aqua'', meaning water, with the suffix ''-arium'', meaning "a place for relating to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/aquarium | title = Definition of aquarium | publisher = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary | accessdate = 2007-04-03 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070404103239/http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/aquarium| archivedate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist [[Robert Warington]], who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough [[oxygen]] to support animals, so long as the numbers of animals did not grow too large.&lt;ref name="Grier"/&gt; The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first [[public aquarium]] at the [[London Zoo]] in 1853, and published the first manual, ''The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea'' in 1854.&lt;ref name="Grier"&gt;Katherine C. Grier (2008) "Pets in America: A History". p. 53. University of North Carolina Press&lt;/ref&gt; An aquarium is a water-filled tank in which fish swim about. Small aquariums are kept in the home by hobbyists. There are larger public aquariums in many cities. This kind of aquarium is a building with fish and other [[aquatic animals]] in large tanks. A large aquarium may have [[otters]], [[turtles]], dolphins, and other sea animals. Most aquarium tanks also have plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jokpeme.com/2017/10/aquariums-is-water-filled-tank-in-which.html|title=Aquariums is a water-filled tank in which fish swim about|last=Trump|first=Francis|date=October 11, 2017|work=Jokpeme|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength [[Acrylate polymer|acrylic]]. [[Cuboid]] aquaria are also known as '''fish tanks''' or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as '''fish bowls'''. Size can range from a small glass bowl, under a gallon in volume, to immense public aquaria of several thousand gallons. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.

===Antiquity===
In 1369, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of China established a [[porcelain]] company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaining [[goldfish]]; over time, people produced tubs that approached the shape of modern fish bowls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brunner | first = Bernd | title = The Ocean at Home | publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | year = 2003 | location = New York | isbn = 1-56898-502-9 | pages = 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhard Baldner]], who wrote ''Vogel-, Fisch- und Tierbuch'' (Bird, Fish, and Animal Book) in 1666, maintained [[weather loach]]es and [[newt]]s.&lt;ref name = "duqmbv"&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 25&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes held that the aquarium was invented by the Romans, who are said to have kept [[Galeichthys feliceps|sea barbels]] in marble-and-glass tanks, but this is unlikely to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wetwebmedia.com/MythRomanAqKlee.htm|title=Myth Roman Aq Klee|website=www.wetwebmedia.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth century===

In 1832, [[Jeanne Villepreux-Power]], a pioneering French marine biologist, became the first person to create aquaria for experimenting with aquatic organisms. In 1836, soon after his invention of the [[Wardian case]], Dr. [[Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward]] proposed to use his tanks for tropical animals. In 1841 he did so, though only with aquatic plants and toy fish. However, he soon housed real animals. In 1838, [[Félix Dujardin]] noted owning a [[saltwater aquarium]], though he did not use the term.&lt;ref name=Brunner35&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, [[Anne Thynne]] maintained [[Scleractinia|stony corals]] and [[seaweed]] for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced marine aquarium in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CrBMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA449&amp;ots=wRUXd0ykn7&amp;dq=anne%20thynne%20zoology&amp;pg=PA449#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| journal= Annals and Magazine of Natural History | title= On the increase of ''Madrepores'' | pages=449–461 | year=1859 | volume=3 | number=29 | publisher=Taylor and Francis | location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; English chemist [[Robert Warington]] experimented with a 13-gallon container, which contained goldfish, [[Vallisneria|eelgrass]], and [[snail]]s, creating one of the first stable aquaria. The aquarium principle was fully developed by Warington, explaining that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large.&lt;ref name="Grier"/&gt; He published his findings in 1850 in the [[Chemical Society|Chemical Society's]] [[scientific journal|journal]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:L'aquarium; vue intérieure.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Jardin zoologique'' at the [[Bois de Boulogne]] included an aquarium that housed both fresh and saltwater animals, 1860 in Paris.]]
The keeping of fish in an aquarium became a popular hobby and spread quickly. In the United Kingdom, it became popular after ornate aquaria in cast-iron frames were featured at the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In 1853, the aquarium craze was launched in England by [[Philip Henry Gosse]] who created and stocked the first public aquarium in the [[London Zoo]] which came to be known as the Fish House.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 99&lt;/ref&gt; Gosse coined the word "aquarium", opting for this term (instead of "aquatic vivarium" or "aqua-vivarium") in 1854 in his book ''The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea''.&lt;ref name="Grier"/&gt; In this book, Gosse primarily discussed saltwater aquaria.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 38&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, the aquarium became a fad in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 57&lt;/ref&gt;
Tank designs and techniques for maintaining water quality were developed by Warington, later cooperating with Gosse until his critical review of the tank water composition. [[Edward Edwards (zoologist)|Edward Edwards]] developed these glass-fronted aquaria in his 1858 patent for a "dark-water-chamber slope-back tank", with water slowly circulating to a reservoir beneath.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlouraquariums.org.uk/Papers/b%20AQUARIUM%20HISTORY/History%20Papers/Parlour%20aquarum.htm |title=The first Parlour Aquariums and the Victorian Aquarium Craze |last=Alexander |first=Bob |date=November 2005 |work=History of parlour aquarium |publisher=parlouraquariums.org |accessdate=24 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722221227/http://www.parlouraquariums.org.uk/Papers/b%20AQUARIUM%20HISTORY/History%20Papers/Parlour%20aquarum.htm |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germans soon rivaled the British in their interest. In 1854, an anonymous author had two articles published about the saltwater aquaria of the United Kingdom: ''Die Gartenlaube'' (The Garden House) entitled ''Der Ocean auf dem Tische'' (The Ocean on the Table). However, in 1856, ''Der See im Glase'' (The Lake in a Glass) was published, discussing freshwater aquaria, which were much easier to maintain in landlocked areas.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862 [[William Alford Lloyd]], then bankrupt because of the craze in England being over, moved to Grindel Dammthor, Hamburg, to supervise the installation of the circulating system and tanks at the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck|Hamburg Aquarium]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} During the 1870s, some of the first [[Aquarium fish clubs|aquarist societies]] were appearing in Germany.&lt;ref name=Brunner75&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 75&lt;/ref&gt; The United States soon followed. Published in 1858, Henry D. Butler's ''The Family Aquarium'' was one of the first books written in the United States solely about the aquarium.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 69&lt;/ref&gt; According to the July issue of ''The North American Review'' of the same year, William Stimson may have owned some of the first functional aquaria, and had as many as seven or eight.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 71&lt;/ref&gt; The first aquarist society in the United States was founded in [[New York City]] in 1893, followed by others.&lt;ref name=Brunner75/&gt; The ''New York Aquarium Journal'', first published in October 1876, is considered to be the world's first aquarium magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Victorian era]] in the United Kingdom, a common design for the home aquarium was a glass front with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] coating). The bottom would be made of [[slate]] and heated from below.&lt;ref name=Sanford&gt;{{cite book | title = Aquarium Owner's Guide | last = Sanford | first = Gina | publisher = [[DK Publishing]] | location = New York | year = 1999 | pages = 9–13 | isbn = 0-7894-4614-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced systems soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in metal frames.&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt; During the latter half of the 19th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a wall, mounting it as part of a [[window]], or even combining it with a [[birdcage]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 86–89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
Around 1908, the first mechanical aquarium air pump was invented, powered by running water, instead of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reefkeeping.com/issues/2004-09/rv/feature/index.php |title=A History of the Hobby by Roger Vitko |publisher=Reefkeeping.com |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the air pump into the hobby is considered by several historians of the hobby to be a pivotal moment in its development.&lt;ref&gt;Whittall, Robin.

[[File:Pike aquarium c1908.jpg|thumb|[[Esox|Pike]] in an aquarium {{circa|1908}}, at the [[Belle Isle Aquarium]], [[Belle Isle Park]]]]

Aquaria became more widely popular as houses had an electricity supply after [[World War I]]. [[Electricity]] allowed artificial lighting, as well as [[aeration]], [[filtration]], and heating of the water.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 93&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, amateur aquarists kept native fish (with the exception of goldfish); the availability of exotic species from overseas further increased the popularity of the aquarium.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 78&lt;/ref&gt; Jugs made from a variety of materials were used to import fish from overseas, with a [[bicycle pump|bicycle foot pump]] for aeration.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic shipping bags were introduced in the 1950s, making it easier to ship fish.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 82&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual availability of air freight allowed fish to be successfully imported from distant regions.&lt;ref name = "duqmbv"/&gt; Popular publications started by [[Herbert R. Axelrod]] influenced many more hobbyists to start keeping fish.&lt;ref name=Fromson&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Fromson|title=Herbert R. Axelrod, a Hustler who Built a Fortune on a Fish Tale|journal=The New York Times Magazine|date=31 December 2017|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, metal frames made [[marine aquarium|marine aquaria]] almost impossible due to corrosion, but the development of [[tar]] and [[silicone]] sealant allowed the first all-glass aquaria made by Martin Horowitz in Los Angeles, CA. The frames remained, however, though purely for aesthetic reasons.&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt;

Japan played an increasingly important role in shaping aquarium design in the latter part of the twentieth century, with the [[aquascaping]] designs of [[Takashi Amano]] influencing fishkeepers to treat home aquariums as aesthetically pleasing compositions, rather than simply as a way of displaying fish specimens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert R.

=== Materials ===
Most aquaria consist of [[glass]] panes bonded together by 100% [[silicone]] sealant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aquarium Silicone, Tank Repair, Applications, DIY, How To Use|url=http://www.aquarium-pond-answers.com/2007/03/aquarium-silicone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; with plastic frames attached to the upper and lower edges for decoration. The glass aquarium is standard for sizes up to about {{convert|1000|L|USgal Impgal}}. However, glass as a material is brittle and has very little give before fracturing, though generally the sealant fails first.&lt;ref name=Adey&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamic Aquaria|last1 = Adey|first1 = Walter H.|last2 = Loveland|first2 = Karen|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|year=1991|isbn=0-12-043792-9|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaria are made in a variety of shapes, such as [[cuboid]], [[hexagonal prism|hexagonal]], angled to fit in a corner (L-shaped), and bow-front (the front side curves outwards).&lt;ref name=Sanford2&gt;{{cite book | title = Aquarium Owner's Guide | last = Sanford | first = Gina | publisher = [[DK Publishing]] | location = New York | year = 1999 | pages = 162–169 | isbn = 0-7894-4614-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish bowls are generally either made of plastic or glass, and are either spherical or some other round configuration in shape.

The very first modern aquarium made of glass was developed in the 19th century by Robert Warrington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/articles/74| title=History of Fish Tank Materials|accessdate= 2010-05-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100514073351/http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/articles/74| archivedate= 14 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Victorian age]], glass aquariums commonly had slate or [[steel]] bottoms, which allowed them to be heated underneath by an open-flame heat source. These aquariums had the glass panels attached with metal frames and sealed with putty. Metal-framed aquariums were still available until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them. [[Poly (methyl methacrylate)|Acrylic]] aquariums first became available to the public in the 1970s. [[Laminated glass]] is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.&lt;ref name=Adey/&gt;

Glass aquaria have been a popular choice for many home and hobbyist aquarists for many years. Once silicone sealant became strong enough to ensure a long-term water-tight seal, it eliminated the need for a structural frame. In addition to lower cost, glass aquaria are more scratch resistant than acrylic. Although the price is one of the main considerations for aquarists when deciding which of these two types of aquaria to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear.

Acrylic aquaria are now the primary competitor with glass. Prior to the invention of [[UV stabilizers in plastics|UV stabilization]], early acrylic aquaria discolored over time with exposure to light; this is no longer the case. Acrylic is generally stronger than glass, weighs less, and provides a certain amount of temperature insulation. In colder climates or environments, it is easier to achieve and maintain a tropical temperature and requires less capacity from an aquarium heater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reef-one.com/technology/benefits-of-acrylic.html |title=Benefits of Acrylic for Home Aquariums |publisher=reef-one.com |last=Crosswell |first=Tom |accessdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309175603/http://www.reef-one.com/technology/benefits-of-acrylic.html |archivedate=2009-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acrylic-soluble cements are used to directly fuse acrylic together.&lt;ref name=Adey/&gt; Acrylic allows for the formation of unusual shapes, such as the hexagonal tank.&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt; Compared to glass, acrylics are easier to scratch; but unlike glass, it is possible to polish out scratches in acrylic.&lt;ref name=Adey/&gt;

Large aquaria might instead use stronger materials such as [[fiberglass]]-reinforced [[plastic]]s. However, this material is not transparent.&lt;ref name=Adey/&gt; Reinforced [[concrete]] is used for aquaria where weight and space are not factors. Concrete must be coated with a waterproof layer to prevent the water from breaking down the concrete, as well as preventing contamination of the water by the concrete.&lt;ref name=Adey/&gt;

Plywood can also be used when building aquaria. The benefits of using plywood include: lower construction costs, less weight, and better insulation. A popular positioning choice for plywood aquaria is keeping them in a wall. Here the use of plywood is hidden by sinking the aquarium inside the wall. Putting insulation between the two helps with the insulation of a heated tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2011/12/aafeature|title=Feature Article: Building a Plywood Aquarium|last=liquid|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kreisel&lt;!-- Wikilink directs here from Monterey Bay Aquarium --&gt;====
[[File:Jellyfish Art Tank.jpg|thumb|alt=3 jellyfish in water in a cylindrical tank (the wall behind the tank has a floral design)|A typical kreisel tank housing several jellyfish]]
A kreisel tank ("kreisel" being German for "spinning [[top]]" or "[[gyroscope]]") is an aquarium shaped like a horizontal cylinder that is designed to hold delicate animals such as [[jellyfish]] and newborn seahorses. These aquariums provide slow, circular water flow with a bare minimum of interior hardware to prevent the inhabitants from becoming injured by pumps or the tank itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.advancedaquarist.com/issues/dec2004/lines.htm|title=Delicatessen Part I: Creating a system for rare and delicate animals|last=Blundell|first=Adam|publisher=Pomacanthus Publications, LLC |magazine=Advanced Aquarist |volume=3 |date=December 2004 |accessdate=2007-04-04 |dead-url=no |archive-date=26 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526201532/http://www.advancedaquarist.com/issues/dec2004/lines.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tank has no sharp angles around its sides and keeps the housed animals away from plumbing. Water moving into the tank gives a gentle flow that keeps the inhabitants suspended. Water leaves the tank through a screen which prevents animals from being drawn into the pump intake or overflow line.

There are several types of kreisel tanks. In a true kreisel, a circular tank has a circular, submerged lid. ''Pseudokreisels'' are "U" or semicircle shaped, usually without a lid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wrobel |first=Dave |url=http://jellieszone.com/captivejellies.htm|title=Captive Jellies: Keeping Jellies in an Aquarium | publisher = The Jellies Zone |accessdate=2007-04-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410061052/http://jellieszone.com/captivejellies.htm| archivedate=10 April 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stretch kreisels'' are a "double gyre" kreisel design, where the tank length is at least twice the height. Using two downwelling inlets on both sides of the tank lets gravity create two gyres in the tank. A single downwelling inlet may be used in the middle as well. The top of a stretch kreisel may be open or closed with a lid. There may also be screens about midway down the sides of the tank, or at the top on the sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raskoff |first1=Kevin A. |last2=Sommer |first2=Freya A. |last3=Hamner |first3=William M. |last4=Cross |first4=Katrina M. |date=February 2003 |title=Collection and culture techniques for gelatinous zooplankton |journal=Biological Bulletin |volume=204 |issue=1 |pages=68–80 |jstor=1543497 |doi=10.2307/1543497 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to combine these designs; a circular shaped tank is used without a lid or cover, and the surface of the water acts as the continuation of circular flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-Jellyfish-Tank |title=How to Start a Jellyfish Tank: 12 steps (with pictures) |publisher=wikiHow |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biotope====
Another popular setup is the [[Aquascaping#Biotopes|biotope]] aquarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotope Aquarium|url=http://www.aquariumbase.com/biotope-aquarium-explained/|website=aquariumbase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biotope aquarium is a recreation of a specific natural environment. Some of the most popular biotopes are the freshwater habitats of the [[Amazon river|Amazon]] and [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] rivers, the African [[rift lake]] environments of [[Lake Malawi]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]], and saltwater [[coral reef]]s of [[Great Barrier Reef|Australia]], the [[Red Sea]], and the [[Andros, Bahamas#Marine life|Caribbean]]. The fish, plants, substrate, rocks, wood, coral, and any other component of the display should completely match that of the local natural environment. It can be a challenge to recreate such environments, and most "true" biotopes will only have a few (if not only one) species of fish and invertebrates.

Finally, an emerging concept for the home is that of a wall mounted aquarium,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wallmountedaquarium.net/|title=Wall Mounted Aquarium|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are displayed at the [[Living Art Marine Center]].

===Aquarium size and volume===
[[File:Kelp Forest exhibit full main viewing window at Monterey Bay Aquarium.jpg|thumb|left|A {{convert|1200000|L|USgal Impgal|adj=on}} aquarium at [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] in California, displaying a [[kelp forest]] ecosystem|alt=Photo of {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} yellow plants in water behind glass wall divided into sections.]]

An aquarium can range from a small glass bowl containing less than {{convert|1|L|USpt}} of water to immense public aquaria that house entire ecosystems such as [[kelp forest]]s. Relatively large home aquaria resist rapid fluctuations of temperature and [[pH]], allowing for greater system stability.&lt;ref name=Sanford2/&gt; Beginner aquarists are advised to consider larger tanks to begin with, as controlling water parameters in smaller tanks can prove difficult.

&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep water conditions at suitable levels, aquariums should contain at least two forms of [[Filter (aquarium)|filtration]]: biological and mechanical. Chemical filtration should also be considered under some circumstances for optimum water quality. Chemical filtration is frequently achieved via [[activated carbon]], to filter medications, [[tannin]]s, and/or other known impurities from the water.

Reef aquaria under {{convert|100|L|USgal Impgal}} have a special place in the aquarium hobby; these aquaria, termed [[nano reef]]s (when used in reefkeeping), have a small water volume, under {{convert|40|L|USgal Impgal|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Reef Hobbyist Magazine, pp. 42–46, Q2 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical limitations, most notably the [[weight]] of water ({{convert|1|kg/L|lb/U.S.gal lb/Impgal|3}}) and internal [[fluid pressure|water pressure]] (requiring thick glass siding) of a large aquarium, restrict most home aquaria to a maximum of around 1 cubic metre in volume (1000 L, weighing {{nowrap|1,000 kg}} or {{nowrap|2,200 lb}}).&lt;ref name=Sanford2/&gt; Some aquarists, however, have constructed aquaria of many thousands of litres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Public aquarium]]s and [[oceanarium]]s designed for exhibition of large species or environments can be dramatically larger than any home aquarium. The [[Georgia Aquarium]], for example, features an individual aquarium of {{convert|6,300,000|USgal|l}}.

==== Nano aquariums ====
A new trend is to have very small aquariums, termed mini aquariums (less than 150 litres or 40 gallons) or nano aquariums (less than 75 litres or 20 gallons). These can be either freshwater or saltwater, and are intended to display a tiny but self-contained ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPxZAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=nano+aquarium&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGvsPCmILLAhXMHB4KHaxlDhoQ6AEINDAD|title=Mini Aquariums|first1=David E.|last1=Boruchowitz|first2=Jay F.|last2=Herndal|date=2008|publisher=T.F.H.

==Components==
[[File:Aquarium.png|thumb|[[Filter (aquarium)|Filtration]] system in a typical aquarium: (1) intake, (2) mechanical filtration, (3) chemical filtration, (4) biological filtration medium, (5) outflow to tank|alt=Drawing of transparent 3-dimensional rectangle with two boxes and one cylinder above it and one longer, thin cylinder within it. Arrows point from the rectangle long cylinder to the top box, from the top box to the lower box, from the lower box to the other cylinder, from that cylinder back to itself, and from the cylinder to the rectangle.]]

The typical hobbyist aquarium includes a filtration system, an artificial lighting system, and a heater or chiller depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Many aquaria incorporate a hood, containing the lights, to decrease evaporation and prevent fish from leaving the aquarium (and anything else from entering the aquarium).&lt;ref name=Sanford2/&gt;

Combined biological and mechanical aquarium [[Filter (aquarium)|filtration systems]] are common. These either convert ammonia to nitrate (removing nitrogen at the expense of aquatic plants), or to sometimes remove [[phosphate]]. Filter media can house [[microbes]] that mediate [[nitrification]]. Filtration systems are sometimes the most complex component of home aquaria.&lt;ref name=dakin&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heater (aquarium)|Aquarium heater]]s combine a heating element with a [[thermostat]], allowing the aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature.&lt;ref name=Sanford2/&gt; [[Thermometer]]s used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external [[Liquid crystal thermometer|plastic strip thermometers]], and battery-powered LCD thermometers.&lt;ref name=Sanford2/&gt; In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to [[airstone]]s or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.&lt;ref name=Adey/&gt;

An aquarium's physical characteristics form another aspect of aquarium design. Size, lighting conditions, density of floating and rooted plants, placement of [[bog-wood]], creation of caves or overhangs, type of [[substrate (aquarium)|substrate]], and other factors (including an aquarium's positioning within a room) can all affect the behavior and survival of tank inhabitants.

An aquarium can be placed on an aquarium stand. Because of the weight of the aquarium, a stand must be strong as well as level. A tank that is not level may distort, leak, or crack.&lt;ref name=Sanford2/&gt; These are often built with cabinets to allow storage, available in many styles to match room [[decor]]. Simple metal tank stands are also available.&lt;ref name=Sanford2/&gt; Most aquaria should be placed on [[polystyrene]] to cushion any irregularities on the underlying surface or the bottom of the tank itself that may cause cracks.&lt;ref name=Sanford2/&gt; However, some tanks have an underframe making this unnecessary.

==Aquarium maintenance==
Large volumes of water enable more stability in a tank by diluting effects from death or contamination events that push an aquarium away from equilibrium. The bigger the tank, the easier such a [[systemic shock]] is to absorb, because the effects of that event are diluted. For example, the death of the only fish in an {{convert|11|L|USgal Impgal|0|adj=on}} tank causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a {{convert|400|L|USgal Impgal|adj=on}} tank with many other fish in it represents only a minor change. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks, as they require less attention.

Several [[nutrient cycle]]s are important in the aquarium. Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface. Similarly, carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air. The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle. Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste. Appropriate handling of the [[nitrogen cycle]], along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is enough to keep these other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium.

An aquarium must be maintained regularly to ensure that the fish are kept healthy. Daily maintenance consists of checking the fish for signs of stress and [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/maintenance_schedule.htm| title=A Preventative Maintenance Schedule|accessdate= 2010-05-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100525222821/http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/maintenance_schedule.htm| archivedate= 25 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, aquarists must make sure that the water has a good quality and it is not cloudy or [[foamy]] and the [[temperature]] of the water is appropriate for the particular species of fish that live in the aquarium.

Typical weekly maintenance includes changing around 10–20% of the water while cleaning the [[gravel]], or other substrate if the aquarium has one; however some manage to avoid this entirely by keeping it somewhat self-sufficient. A good habit is to remove the water being replaced by "vacuuming" the gravel with suitable implements, as this will eliminate uneaten foods and other residues that settle on the [[Substrate (aquarium)|substrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algone.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52:aquarium-maintenance-tips&amp;catid=35:tank-maintenance&amp;Itemid=34| title=Aquarium Maintenance Tips|accessdate= 2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many areas [[tap water]] is not considered to be safe for fish to live in because it contains chemicals that harm the fish. Tap water from those areas must be treated with a suitable water conditioner, such as a product which removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralizes any heavy metals present. The water conditions must be checked both in the tank and in the replacement water, to make sure they are suitable for the species.

===Water conditions===
The [[Solution|solute]] content of water is perhaps the most important aspect of water conditions, as [[total dissolved solids]] and other constituents dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms interact with their environment. Salt content, or [[salinity]], is the most basic measure of water conditions. An aquarium may have [[freshwater]] (salinity below 500&amp;nbsp;parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; [[brackish water]] (a salt level of 500 to 30,000&amp;nbsp;PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as [[estuary|estuaries]]; and salt water or [[seawater]] (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000&amp;nbsp;PPM), simulating an ocean environment. Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.

Saltwater is typically alkaline, while the [[pH]] ([[alkali]]nity or [[acid]]icity) of fresh water varies more. Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; [[hard water|hard or soft water]] may be preferred. Hard water is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic.&lt;ref name=Axelrod/&gt; [[Chemical oxygen demand|Dissolved organic content]] and dissolved gases content are also important factors.

Home aquarists typically use tap water supplied through their local [[water supply network]] to fill their tanks. Straight tap water cannot be used in localities that pipe chlorinated water. In the past, it was possible to "condition" the water by simply letting the water stand for a day or two, which allows the [[chlorine]] time to dissipate.&lt;ref name=Axelrod/&gt; However, [[chloramine]] is now used more often and does not leave the water as readily. [[Dechlorinator|Additives]] formulated to remove chlorine or chloramine are often all that is needed to make the water ready for aquarium use. Brackish or saltwater aquaria require the addition of a commercially available [[artificial seawater|mixture of salts]] and other minerals.

[[File:Outdoor heated fish tank enclosed by glass plus reflections.jpg|thumb|250px|This aquarium features a heated tank and a glass-enclosed top for warmth during winter.]]

Some aquarists modify water's alkalinity, hardness, or dissolved content of organics and gases, before adding it to their aquaria. This can be accomplished by additives, such as sodium bicarbonate, to raise pH.&lt;ref name=Axelrod/&gt; Some aquarists [[Water filter|filter]] or purify their water through [[Purified water|deionization]] or [[reverse osmosis]] prior to using it. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) to reduce the level of treatment. Some hobbyists use an [[algae scrubber]] to filter the water naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algaescrubber.net|title=Algae Scrubbers|work=algaescrubber.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water [[temperature]] determines the two most basic aquarium classifications: [[tropics|tropical]] versus [[Coldwater fish|cold water]]. Most fish and plant species tolerate only a limited temperature range; tropical aquaria, with an average temperature of about {{convert|25|C|F}}, are much more common. Cold water aquaria are for fish that are better suited to a cooler environment. More important than the range is consistency; most organisms are not accustomed to sudden changes in temperatures, which can cause shock and lead to disease.&lt;ref name=Axelrod/&gt; Water temperature can be regulated with a [[thermostat]] and heater (or cooler).

Water movement can also be important in simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift [[wikt:current|currents]], depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Water movement can be controlled via aeration from air pumps, powerheads, and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).

===Nitrogen cycle===
{{main|Nitrogen cycle}}

Of primary concern to the aquarist is management of the [[waste]] produced by an aquarium's inhabitants. Fish, invertebrates, [[fungus|fungi]], and some bacteria excrete [[nitrogen]] waste in the form of [[ammonia]] (which converts to [[ammonium]], in water) and must then either pass through the [[nitrogen cycle]] or be removed by passing through [[zeolite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Monks |first=Neale |title=Aquarium Filter Maintenance |website=Fish Channel |publisher=BowTie, Inc. |url=http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-health/healthy-aquariums/aquarium-filter-maintenance.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023133331/http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-health/healthy-aquariums/aquarium-filter-maintenance.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia is also produced through the [[decomposition]] of plant and animal matter, including [[feces|fecal]] matter and other [[detritus]]. Nitrogen waste products become toxic to fish and other aquarium inhabitants at high concentrations.&lt;ref name=Axelrod&gt;{{cite book | title = Exotic Tropical Fishes | last = Axelrod | first = Herbert, R. | publisher = T.F.H. Publications. | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-87666-543-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} In the wild, the vast amount of water surrounding the fish dilutes ammonia and other waste materials. When fish are put into an aquarium, waste can quickly reach toxic concentrations in the enclosed environment unless the tank is cycled to remove waste.&lt;ref name=Axelrod/&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}}

====The process====
A well-balanced tank contains organisms that are able to [[metabolism|metabolize]] the waste products of other aquarium residents. This process is known in the aquarium hobby as the nitrogen cycle. [[Bacteria]] known as [[nitrification|nitrifiers]] (genus ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'') metabolize nitrogen waste. Nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia from the water and metabolize it to produce [[nitrite]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Nitrite is toxic to fish in high concentrations. Another type of bacteria (genus ''[[Nitrospira]]'') converts [[nitrite]] into [[nitrate]], a less toxic substance. (''[[Nitrobacter]]'' bacteria were previously believed to fill this role. While biologically they could theoretically fill the same niche as ''Nitrospira'', it has recently been found that ''Nitrobacter'' are not present in detectable levels in established aquaria, while ''Nitrospira'' are plentiful.){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} However, commercial products sold as kits to "jump start" the nitrogen cycle often still contain ''Nitrobacter''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In addition to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by metabolizing ammonia and nitrate. When plants metabolize nitrogen compounds, they remove nitrogen from the water by using it to build [[biomass]] that decays more slowly than ammonia-driven [[plankton]] already dissolved in the water.

====Maintaining the nitrogen cycle====
[[File:Echinotitti.JPG|thumb|Live plants in an aquarium help to complete the nitrogen cycle, by utilizing nitrate as fertilizer. This 60-litre aquarium contains ''[[Anubias barteri]]'' and ''[[Echinodorus bleheri]]''. A [[heater (aquarium)|heater]] and small [[filter (aquarium)|filter]] are in the background.]]
What hobbyists call the nitrogen cycle is only a portion of the complete cycle: nitrogen must be added to the system (usually through food provided to the tank inhabitants), and nitrates accumulate in the water at the end of the process, or become bound in the biomass of plants. The aquarium keeper must remove water once nitrate concentrations grow, or remove plants which have grown from the nitrates.

Hobbyist aquaria often do not have sufficient bacteria populations to adequately denitrify waste. This problem is most often addressed through two [[filtration]] solutions: [[Activated carbon]] filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other [[toxins]], while biological filters provide a medium designed to enhance [[colony (biology)|bacterial colonization]]. Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, stop working when their pores fill, so these components have to be replaced regularly.

New aquaria often have problems associated with the nitrogen cycle due to insufficient beneficial bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James M. |last=Kostich |date=2005

|title=New Tank Syndrome |website=Aquatics Unlimited |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510140511/http://www.bestfish.com/breakin.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, fresh water has to be matured before stocking them with fish. There are three basic approaches to this: the "fishless cycle", the "silent cycle" and "slow growth".

In a [[fishless cycling|fishless cycle]], small amounts of ammonia are added to an unpopulated tank to feed the bacteria. During this process, [[ammonia]], [[nitrite]], and [[nitrate]] levels are tested to monitor progress. The "silent" cycle is basically nothing more than densely stocking the aquarium with fast-growing aquatic [[plant]]s and relying on them to consume the [[nitrogen]], allowing the necessary bacterial populations time to develop. According to anecdotal reports, the plants can consume nitrogenous waste so efficiently that ammonia and nitrite level spikes seen in more traditional cycling methods are greatly reduced or disappear. "Slow growth" entails slowly increasing the population of fish over a period of 6 to 8 weeks, giving bacteria colonies time to grow and stabilize with the increase in fish waste. This method is usually done with a small starter population of hardier fish which can survive the ammonia and nitrite spikes, whether they are intended to be permanent residents or to be traded out later for the desired occupants.

The largest bacterial populations are found in the filter, where is high water flow and plentiful surface available for their growth, so effective and efficient filtration is vital. Sometimes, a vigorous cleaning of the filter is enough to seriously disturb the biological balance of an aquarium. Therefore, it is recommended to rinse mechanical filters in an outside bucket of aquarium water to dislodge organic materials that contribute to nitrate problems, while preserving bacteria populations. Another safe practice consists of cleaning only half of the filter media during each service, or using two filters, only one of which is cleaned at a time.

===Biological load===
[[File:Small aquarium.jpg|thumb|A very heavily stocked 19-liter aquarium containing ''[[Paracheirodon innesi]]'', ''[[Trigonostigma heteromorpha]]'', and ''[[Hemigrammus erythrozonus]]''|alt=Photo displaying plants, small fish, and tipped-over clay pots]]
The biological load, or bioload, is a measure of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants. High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset. Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size. The water's [[surface area]] limits [[Oxygen saturation|oxygen]] intake. The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement. Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to tank volume. Adding plants to an aquarium will sometimes help greatly with taking up fish waste as plant nutrients. Although an aquarium can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm. Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aquarium if not promptly removed. The bioload is processed by the aquarium's [[biofilter]] filtration system.

====Calculating capacity====
[[Limiting factor]]s include the oxygen availability and filtration processing. Aquarists have  [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]] to [[Approximation|estimate]] the number of fish that can be kept in an aquarium. The examples below are for small freshwater fish; larger freshwater fishes and most marine fishes need much more generous allowances.
*3&amp;nbsp;cm of ''adult'' fish length per 4&amp;nbsp;litres of water (i.e., a 6&amp;nbsp;cm-long fish would need about 8&amp;nbsp;litres of water).&lt;ref name="Ulrich Baensch"&gt;{{cite book

*1&amp;nbsp;inch of ''adult'' fish length per US gallon of water.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Baensch"/&gt;
*1&amp;nbsp;inch of ''adult'' fish length per 12&amp;nbsp;square inches of surface area.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

Experienced aquarists warn against applying these rules too strictly because they do not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behaviour, filtration capacity, total biomass of plant life, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Interpet Manual of Fish Health
|publisher=Salamander Books
|year=1988
|isbn=0-86101-368-9
|author1=Chris Andrews |author2=Adrian Exell |author3=Neville Carrington }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is better to apply the overall mass and size of a fish per gallon of water, than simply the length. This is because fish of different sizes produce quite differing amounts of waste. Establishing maximum capacity is often a matter of slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, following a [[trial and error]] approach.

====Other factors affecting capacity====
One variable is differences between fish. Smaller fish consume more oxygen per gram of body weight than larger fish. [[Labyrinth fish]] can breathe atmospheric oxygen and do not need as much surface area (however, some of these fish are territorial, and do not appreciate crowding). [[Barb (fish)|Barb]]s also require more surface area than [[tetra]]s of comparable size.&lt;ref name=Axelrod/&gt;

Oxygen exchange at the surface is an important constraint, and thus the surface area of the aquarium matters. Some aquarists claim that a deeper aquarium holds no more fish than a shallower aquarium with the same surface area. The capacity can be improved by surface movement and water circulation such as through aeration, which not only improves oxygen exchange, but also waste decomposition rates.&lt;ref name=Axelrod/&gt;

Waste density is another variable. Decomposition in solution consumes oxygen. Oxygen dissolves less readily in warmer water; this is a double-edged sword since warmer temperatures make fish more active, so they consume more oxygen.&lt;ref name=Axelrod/&gt;

In addition to bioload/chemical considerations, aquarists also consider the mutual compatibility of the fish. For instance, predatory fish are usually not kept with small, passive species, and territorial fish are often unsuitable tankmates for shoaling species. Furthermore, fish tend to fare better if given tanks conducive to their size. That is, large fish need large tanks and small fish can do well in smaller tanks. Lastly, the tank can become overcrowded without being overstocked. In other words, the aquarium can be suitable with regard to filtration capacity, oxygen load, and water, yet still be so crowded that the inhabitants are uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/moashowmanyfish/|title=MOA's: How Many Fish?, Stocking Freshwater Aquariums|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For planted freshwater aquariums, it is also important to maintain a balance between the duration and quality of light, the amount of plants, CO2 and nutrients. For a given amount of light, if there is insufficient number of plants or insufficient CO2 to support the growth of those plants, so as to consume all the nutrients in the tank, the result would be algae growth. While there are fishes and invertebrates that could be introduced in the tank to clean up this algae, the ideal solution would be to find the optimal balance between the above-mentioned factors. Supplemental CO2 can be provided, whose quantity has to be carefully regulated, as too much CO2 may harm the fishes.{{Original research inline|date=December 2017}}

==Aquarium classifications==
[[File:58g aquascape.jpg|thumb|A planted freshwater aquarium|alt=Photo showing a tank filled with water and multiple aquatic plants.]]
From the outdoor ponds and glass jars of antiquity, modern aquaria have evolved into a wide range of specialized systems. Individual aquaria can vary in size from a small bowl large enough for only a single small fish, to the huge public aquaria that can simulate entire marine [[ecosystem]]s.

One way to classify aquaria is by salinity. [[Freshwater aquarium|Freshwater aquaria]] are the most popular due to their lower cost.&lt;ref name=Sanford3&gt;{{cite book 
| title = Aquarium Owner's Guide 
| last = Sanford | first = Gina

| isbn = 0-7894-4614-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; More expensive and complex equipment is required to set up and maintain [[marine aquarium|marine aquaria]]. Marine aquaria frequently feature a diverse range of [[invertebrate]]s in addition to species of fish.&lt;ref name=dakin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanford3/&gt; [[Brackish-water aquarium|Brackish water aquaria]] combine elements of both marine and freshwater fishkeeping.&lt;ref name=Sanford3/&gt; Fish kept in brackish water aquaria generally come from habitats with varying salinity, such as [[mangrove|mangrove swamp]]s and [[estuaries]]. Subtypes exist within these types, such as the [[reef aquarium]], a typically smaller marine aquarium that houses [[coral]].&lt;ref name=Sanford3/&gt;

Another classification is by [[temperature]] range. Many aquarists choose a [[tropical fish|tropical aquarium]] because tropical fish tend to be more colorful.&lt;ref name=Sanford3/&gt; However, the [[coldwater fish|coldwater aquarium]] is also popular, which is mainly restricted to [[goldfish]], but can include fish from temperate areas worldwide and native fish keeping.&lt;ref name=Sanford3/&gt;
[[File:Aquarium fg01.jpg|thumb|A [[Seawater|saltwater]] aquarium|alt=Photo of water, coral, and fish behind a glass wall.]]

Aquaria may be grouped by their species selection. The [[community tank]] is the most common today, where several non-aggressive species live peacefully. In these aquaria, the fish, [[invertebrate]]s, and [[aquatic plant|plants]] probably do not originate from the same geographic region, but tolerate similar water conditions. Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well. Most marine tanks and tanks housing [[cichlids]] have to take the aggressiveness of the desired species into account when stocking. Specimen tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps ones found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a natural ecosystem. This type is useful for fish that cannot coexist with other fish, such as the [[electric eel]], as an extreme example. Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding.

Ecotype, ecotope, or [[biotope]] aquaria is another type based on species selection. In it, an aquarist attempts to simulate a specific natural ecosystem, assembling fish, invertebrate species, plants, decorations and water conditions all found in that ecosystem. These biotope aquaria are the most sophisticated hobby aquaria; public aquaria use this approach whenever possible. This approach best simulates the experience of observing in the wild. It typically serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants.

{{Main|Public aquarium}}
Most public aquarium facilities feature a number of smaller aquaria, as well those too large for home aquarists. The largest tanks hold millions of gallons of water and can house large species, including [[shark]]s or [[Beluga (whale)|beluga whales]]. [[Dolphinarium|Dolphinaria]] are specifically for dolphins. Aquatic and semiaquatic animals, including [[otter]]s and [[penguin]]s, may also be kept by public aquaria. Public aquaria may also be included in larger establishments such as a [[marine mammal park]] or a [[marine park]].

==Virtual aquariums==
A virtual aquarium is a [[computer program]] which uses [[3D graphics]] to reproduce an aquarium on a [[personal computer]]. The swimming fish are [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] in [[Real-time computer graphics|real time]], while the background of the tank is usually static. Objects on the floor of the tank may be mapped in simple [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s so that the fish may appear to swim both in front and behind them, but a relatively simple 3D map of the general shape of such objects may be used to allow the light and ripples on the surface of the water to cast realistic [[shadow]]s. Bubbles and water noises are common for virtual aquariums, which are often used as [[screensaver]]s.

The number of each type of fish can usually be selected, often including other animals like [[starfish]], [[jellyfish]], [[seahorse]]s, and even [[sea turtle]]s. Most companies that produce virtual aquarium software also offer other types of fish for sale via Internet [[download]]. Other objects found in an aquarium can also be added and rearranged on some software, like [[treasure chest]]s and giant [[clam]]s that open and close with air bubbles, or a bobbing [[Scuba diving|diver]]. There are also usually features that allow the user to tap on the glass or put food in the top, both of which the fish will react to. Some also have the ability to allow the user to edit fish and other objects to create new varieties.

'''''Battleship''''' is the name of two video games based on the [[Battleship (film)|film]] of the same name (which in turn is based on the board game [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]), both of them published by [[Activision]] in 2012. The [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] versions are a [[first-person shooter]] developed by [[Double Helix Games]] while the [[Wii]], [[Nintendo DS|DS]] and [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] versions are a [[turn-based strategy]] game developed by Magic Pockets.

==Plot==
{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}
''Battleship'' follows elite demolitions specialist Cole Mathis as he clashes against an aquatic-based extraterrestrial peril in the sand and sea of the beautiful Hawaiian archipelago. He uses his battle command to command the ships to battle against the alien fleet at sea. The human ships at sea are the Nimitz-class carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), Iowa-class battleship USS Missouri (BB-63), fictional Ticonderoga-class cruiser USS Yukon, fictional Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS John Quincy Adams, fictional Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate USS Chesapeake, and fictional Virginia-class submarine USS Laredo.
 
The Nintendo versions of the game follows instead the adventures of Capt. Danny Hunter and Lft. Roads and is a [[turn-based strategy]] instead of a [[first-person shooter]].

==Reception==

===First-person shooter (PlayStation 3 &amp; Xbox 360)===
The [[first-person shooter]] game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has received mostly negative reviews. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave the Xbox 360 version 40.67% and 38/100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox360/657787-battleship/index.html|title=Battleship (Xbox 360)|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/battleship |title=Battleship for Xbox 360 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PlayStation 3 version 39.43% and 44/100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps3/657788-battleship/index.html|title=Battleship (PlayStation 3)|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/battleship |title=Battleship for PlayStation 3 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PlayStation Official Magazine - UK|PlayStation Official Magazine UK]] remarked "It isn't even the sketchy gameplay that sinks this Battleship – it's the abhorrently commercial objective apparent in every second of rushed gameplay"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/review/battleship-ps3-review/ Battleship review], [[PlayStation Official Magazine - UK|PlayStation Official Magazine UK]]. Retrieved March 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turn-based strategy (Wii, DS &amp; 3DS)===
Reviews for the [[turn-based strategy]] game for the Wii, DS and 3DS were significantly more positive, but were nonetheless mixed. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave the 3DS version 55.83% and 55/100,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/3ds/660034-battleship/index.html|title=Battleship (3DS)|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/battleship |title=Battleship for Nintendo 3DS Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Wii version 55.50% and 54/100,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/wii/658209-battleship/index.html|title=Battleship (Wii)|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/battleship |title=Battleship for Wii Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the DS version 40.00%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ds/658208-battleship/index.html|title=Battleship (DS)|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo World Report called it "competent", but essentially no more than a second rate variation on [[Advance Wars series|Advance Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, James (28 May 2012). [http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/30316 Wii version review], Nintendo World Report.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'' gave a more positive review, acknowledging that the game is an Advance Wars copycat but concluding "Those looking to recreate the movie on the go are out of luck here, but if you're after a complex and thoughtful game of naval tactics, ''Battleship'' should be right up your galley."&lt;ref&gt;Willington, Peter (14 May 2012). [http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/3DS/Battleship+%283DS%29/review.asp?c=40939 3DS version review], ''[[Pocket Gamer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1827">A '''casino pit''' is an area of a casino which typically contains tables for [[Blackjack]], [[Craps]], [[Roulette]], and other games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjrnet.com/member/bjapr/P.htm |title=Black Jack Encyclopedia of Casino Twenty-One|accessdate=2007-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a pit is organized as two rows of gaming tables arranged back-to-back. The tables face outward toward a public aisleway. The space between the rows is restricted to dealers and other casino personnel. Besides dealers, the pit personnel include game supervisors, still called by their traditional title of "[[floorman]]" (even though many are now women); clerks who man computer terminals where information about players and tables is input; a [[pit manager]] (or "pit boss") who supervises the entire pit; and various other personnel who are in and out of the pit to supply tables with chips, empty money boxes, and perform other maintenance tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamingtoday.com/Glossary/casino.cfm |title=General Casino Terminology |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818231428/http://www.gamingtoday.com/Glossary/casino.cfm |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pits may vary in size, depending on the size of the casino, but are typically eight to twelve blackjack-sized tables or six to eight large craps or roulette tables. At the end of each pit may be nothing more than a barrier keeping the public out, or another game table facing a cross aisle. Small casinos may feature only one pit, while larger resorts in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] or [[Monte Carlo]] may have a dozen or more, with pits devoted to a single game such as craps or roulette.

The '''Catch Wrestling Association''' (CWA) was a [[professional wrestling]] organization based in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] that was founded in 1973. It was run by [[Otto Wanz]]. The CWA featured a traditional brand of mat wrestling mixed with various “Strong Man” competitions. The company was engaged in talent-share agreements with other wrestling promotions, including [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] and the [[American Wrestling Association]].  These agreements expanded the opportunities given to many European wrestlers. CWA's biggest card was the [[Euro Catch Festival]], which was held twice a year (it was held in [[Graz]], [[Austria]] in the summer, while in the winter, it was held in [[Bremen]], [[Germany]]).

Matches were fought using European rules, including dividing the match into rounds and having the possibility of a victory by [[knockout]]. The CWA World Heavyweight Championship was recognized as the legitimate European World Championship as counterpart to the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]], [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] and [[WWE|WWF]] titles in North America and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling|NJPW]]'s [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] in Japan.

It is notable for having been selected as one of ten games in the PAX 10 2008 out of over eighty entries.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
It has been described as innovative.&lt;ref name="jayisgames" /&gt;
The protagonist is a robot named Chronotron who travels back in time to cooperate with himself.&lt;ref name="xplay"&gt;

The main character must fetch an item before moving to the next room.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
Solving the puzzles requires sending the main character back in time to coordinate with previous selves.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
The gameplay requires thinking ahead.&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt;
''Chronotron'' records the control input, not the protagonist's position.&lt;ref name="pixelsocks" /&gt;
As a result, actions by later selves can interfere with earlier selves.&lt;ref name="pixelsocks" /&gt; 
A number of web sites have licensed ''Chronotron'', including [[Kongregate]] and MTV's [[AddictingGames]].&lt;ref name="pixelsocks" /&gt;  It was featured on the front page of Kongregate.&lt;ref name="statejournal" /&gt;
The game appears on over 2,000 web sites&lt;ref name="statejournal" /&gt;
and has been played more than seven million times.&lt;ref name="statejournal"&gt;{{Cite news

The developer splits advertising revenue evenly with Kongregate and made more than $1,000 in 2008.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;  The developer had made nearly $15,000 in profits from the game in 2008.&lt;ref name="statejournal" /&gt;

==Development==
''Chronotron'' was developed by [[Madison, Wisconsin]] based&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt; Scarybug Games, which consists of a single person: Joe Rheaume.&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ibabuzz" /&gt;
Rheaume was the sole developer of ''Chronotron''.&lt;ref name="pixelsocks"&gt;{{cite web

| archivedate = 2008-09-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Development for ''Chronotron'' took seven months.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
''Chronotron'''s sponsorship support was handled through FlashGameLicense.com.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
Interest in sponsoring ''Chronotron'' allowed Scarybug Games to hire Romanian artist Bogdan Ene to replace the graphics.&lt;ref name="isthmus"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chronotron'''s time travel elements was inspired by advertising for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Blinx: The Time Sweeper]]''&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt; and an article on ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pixelsocks" /&gt;
Rheaume claims to not have played ''Blinx''.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
''Chronotron'' was released before the release of ''Braid''.&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rheaume claims to have "thought of the idea of recording input and going back looping on yourself."&lt;ref name="pixelsocks" /&gt;
Rheaume wanted there to be no limit on how many times you could travel back in time.&lt;ref name="pixelsocks" /&gt;
The game contains references to time travel stories including ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', and ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
The puzzle platformer elements were inspired by ''[[The Lost Vikings]]''.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
Rheaume notes the similarity between cooperating with your self to the cooperation between the three Vikings in ''The Lost Vikings''.&lt;ref name="pixelsocks" /&gt;
Puzzle pacing, with later puzzles building on what is learned earlier, was inspired by ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]''.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
''Portal'' also inspired the use of humorous signs in game as hints.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;

Rheaume is a Flash developer for his day job.&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt;
Chronotron was built as a hobby.&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt;
As a hobby, Rheaume can develop ideas which don't fit the ideas, time constraints, and budgets of his regular job's client projects.&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt;
Chronotron was developed because Rheaume thought it would be fun to play.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
Rheaume developed it further because he "thought it really had legs."&lt;ref name="pixelsocks" /&gt;
Interest from other people kept Rheaume going.&lt;ref name="pixelsocks" /&gt;

The name of the game and the protagonist comes from "chrono" for "time" and "tron" as a generic term for "robot."&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt;

==Reception==
The game was selected as one of the ten games for the prestigious PAX 10 in 2008.&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt;
Joe Rheaume was an invited guest to show Chronotron to the [[Penny Arcade Expo]] in 2008 as part of the PAX 10.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
''Chronotron'' was selected as one of ten games from over eighty submitted.&lt;ref name="isthmus" /&gt;
''Chronotron'' is the only browser-based Flash game in the PAX 10 2008.&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt;

''Chronotron'' has been described as "a very deep, complex game involving time travel and past selves."&lt;ref name="ibabuzz" /&gt;
Game designer [[Greg Costikyan]] described ''Chronotron'' as "a simple, satisfying, and enjoyable exploration of the effects of one novel mechanic on a well-established form."&lt;ref name="playthisthing"&gt;

A review on [[Jay Is Games]] described ''Chronotron'' as "a platform puzzler with a really innovative (and addictive) twist."

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same review said of the "rewind mechanic", "the concept is refined—and executed almost to perfection."&lt;ref name="jayisgames" /&gt;
A reviewer on ''Rock, Paper, Shotgun'' said "Certainly I feel worn out after wrapping my head around a few levels, but also satisfied and pleased &amp;mdash; you really should go play this."&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun" /&gt;
[[Kotaku]] called it "a hell of a fun flash game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The developer believes the "biggest" and "fairest criticism" are problems with synchronizing robots' actions between time loops.&lt;ref name="ibabuzz" /&gt;

'''Denmark''' had competed in the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] three times. The Danish broadcaster [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] hosted the first Junior Eurovision Song Contest in [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], having developed the contest's predecessor [[MGP Nordic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=junioreurovision.tv|url=http://2006.junioreurovision.tv/content/view/59/59/|title=Copenhagen 2003|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having come in the top five in the first three contests, DR decided to withdraw Denmark from the contest to continue with MGP Nordic with [[Sweden in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]]'s [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] and [[Norway in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Norway]]'s [[NRK]].&lt;ref name="scanpullout"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''ESCToday''|date=18 April 2006|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/5926|title=Scandinavian JESC pull-out|accessdate=2009-04-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117203712/http://esctoday.com/news/read/5926|archivedate=17 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 DR revealed that they have no current plans to return to Junior Eurovision in the near future, being happy with the MGP Nordic competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6920|title=Denmark: No return to JESC in 2007|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2006-12-07|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) had previously been negotiating with commercial broadcasters to replace the Nordic broadcasters at Junior Eurovision. [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] has said however that they had no plans to return Denmark to Junior Eurovision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/5936|title=Junior: 'Commercial channels to take part'|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2006-04-20|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2018, it was reported that the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] is calling on Danish broadcaster [[DR (broadcaster)|Denmarks Radio]] (DR) to return to Junior Eurovision after a 13-year break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://eurovoix.com/2018/02/17/denmark-ebu-wants-see-countries-return-junior-eurovision/|title= Denmark: EBU Wants To See Country’s Return to Junior Eurovision |date=17 February 2018|publisher=Eurovoix|last=Granger|first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Disclaimer II''''' is the second album released by the South African [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Seether]]. This disc is a recompilation of the band's first album, ''[[Disclaimer (Seether album)|Disclaimer]]'', from 2002. Although the 12 tracks from the original album are present, they have been slightly remixed and differ from the original. Also, the majority of the remixed tracks feature additional lead guitar melodies with the addition of a permanent lead guitarist to the band's line-up prior to the release of the album. This is also the first Seether album to feature contributions from their current drummer John Humphrey. In [[Europe]], the album includes four tracks more than its predecessor; in the [[United States]], the album has eight extra tracks, some of which had been previously released on soundtracks, such as "Hang On," which had been featured on the 2003 [[Daredevil: The Album|''Daredevil'' soundtrack]] and "Out of My Way," which had been featured on the soundtrack to the 2003 [[horror film]] ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]''. "Fine Again" also appeared on ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' and ''[[1080° Avalanche]]''.

A primary reason for the reworking of ''Disclaimer'' was the popularity of "[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]." Originally a simple acoustic ballad, it was remade into an electric, duet version with vocals by [[Amy Lee]]. This new version was originally featured on the 2004 [[The Punisher: The Album|''Punisher'' soundtrack]] and had an accompanying [[music video]]. Both the US and European releases include the new rendition of "Broken," and ''Disclaimer II'' subsequently became Seether's most successful album commercially. The song "Sold Me" was used for [[WWE]]'s [[Bad Blood (2004)|Bad Blood]] pay per view, along with WWE also using "Out of My Way" as the entrance theme of [[Zach Gowen]]. The song "Take Me Away" is an acoustic version of a track from their first independent album (originally as Saron Gas), ''Fragile'' (2000).

== Background ==

The idea of releasing Disclaimer II was a record label decision. [[Shaun Morgan]] didn't want include the new version of [[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]] with [[Amy Lee]] on the first album, because he thought the first album was finished. Eventually the band and the label came to a compromise; they recorded extra tracks for the album, as they wanted to include it as a bonus CD. Instead, the label discontinued the first barcode on the first album and they had to add the new version of Broken, as it was part of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPJ5tDclwBQ "THE STORY OF SEETHER | (2002-2017)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kungliga Dramatiska Teaterns Elevskola''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for "The Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school"), also known as '''Dramatens elevskola''', was the acting school of [[Sweden]]'s national stage, [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|The Royal Dramatic Theatre]], and for many years (1787–1964) seen as the foremost theatre school and drama education for Swedish stage actors. It was established in 1787 by the theatre and art loving King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] and was for many years under the protection of the [[Swedish Royal Family|Swedish royal family]].

==History==
The school was founded in 1787. Previously, actors had been educated as personal students of individual actors at the theatre, but it was decided that a school was necessary for a more secure succession of the profession and to teach children in the profession from the start from examples made by the continent.  In 1788, it was called The Children's Theatre, teaching children between the ages of 9-14{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  The school is noted to have performed a play for the king and the royal court. One of the first students known was [[Lars Hjortsberg]], who also performed at this occasion and became one of the stars of Swedish theatre history. The school was re-organised in 1793 by [[Anne Marie Milan Desguillons]] and her spouse, two actors from the French Theatre in [[Bollhuset]] in Stockholm. The students was often used in small parts by the royal theatre and in student performances. The instructors were often actors from the royal theatre.

The quality of the drama school was considered to be one of [[Europe]]'s greatest (equivalent to British [[RADA]]) {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and up until 1964 it still featured traditional [[fencing]], [[ballet]]-training, plastik (''plastique''; body movement and posture on stage), [[recital]]- and [[voice]]-training (following the same instructions since 1819) and teachings of skilled masking techniques - everything much the same since the 18th Century. The education originally was one year long, but later in the end of the 1910s became two years and later in 1930s extended to three years (as a third year as practising actor at the national stage in its productions was included and compulsory for all).

In the 1960s, Sweden - as many other countries - was influenced by new theatre traditions; such as [[method acting]] and new international thoughts on drama education. The International Theatre Institute arranged several symposia in Europe, which both students and teachers attended and the debate grew. This was also the 1960s and in the early days of the great emerging liberation movement through the world and soon with student revolts all over Europe; it was a time of change in the world of arts and culture, as well as in society in general and in the political debate. The opinion in Sweden was strong to make the acting school a national, non-traditional, independent theatre school governed by the state. The old education and teaching methods were questioned, and it was soon decided by the Swedish government that the school was to be separated from the Royal Dramatic Theatre (aka Dramaten) and become independent.

It was the then-managing director of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, [[Ingmar Bergman]], who in 1964 initiated the final decision of separation (mostly because he was frustrated that the increasing number of students required more room and deserved more attention than he felt Dramaten could upbring at the time). However, he later came to regret this decision, bitterly calling it (in a late 1990s interview) "the most stupid thing I've done in my entire life" as he later felt that the long inherited theatre tradition was completely lost within the Dramaten building.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} For better or worse can always be debated (what tools and training methods make good actors?); but it's a fact that the students lost contact with the Royal Dramatic Theatre's long tradition, drama history and practising actors (who also regularly had taught at the acting school what other actors/directors once had taught them; and others before them).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Looking back, many in Sweden now believe that the 1964 separation definitely affected negatively on the quality of theatre training and acting education in the country; a tradition was lost after 1964 and today many feel that the later national drama educational forms just couldn't quite reach the former standards that the Royal Dramatic Theatre's former acting school presented.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The last class of Dramatens elevskola was the class of 1967 (whose students enrolled in 1964 and graduated three years later).

An '''epiphany''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] ἐπιφάνεια, ''epiphaneia'', "manifestation, striking appearance") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by [[psychologist]]s&lt;ref name="Jarvis1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2008"/&gt; and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of [[innovation]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeemingMadden2009"/&gt;

Epiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include [[Archimedes]]'s discovery of a method to determine the density of an object ("[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!") and [[Isaac Newton]]'s realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;

==History==
The word epiphany originally referred to insight through the [[divine]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platt, V. J. (2011) ''Facing the Gods. Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion''. Cambridge University Press.'' ''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is [[supernatural]], as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;

The word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist [[James Joyce]]. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as "a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it."&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, ''Epiphany in the Modern Novel.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971. P. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment ''[[Stephen Hero]],'' although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]]).
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flammarion engraving]]. From "L'atmosphère", book of 1888]]
In traditional and pre-modern cultures, [[initiation]] rites and [[western esotericism|mystery religion]]s have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The [[Greek drama]]tists and [[Greek poetry|poets]] would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of ''[[catharsis]]'' or ''[[kenosis]]'', respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of [[William Burroughs]]' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, "a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork." Both the [[Dadaist]] [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Pop Art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]] would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of [[fine art]] (for example a [[Fountain (Duchamp)|urinal as a fountain]]), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of "what art is" or is not.

==Process==
Epiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kounios|first1=John|last2=Beeman|first2=Mark|title=The Aha! Moment: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Insight|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=210–216|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01638.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.521.6014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt; The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt;

==Myth==
A common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt; Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that "the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems".&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ("I have found it!").&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt; The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly [[Albert Einstein]] was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in [[Bern]] and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, "a storm broke loose in my mind," which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called "the happiest thought of my life" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of [[holistic]] understanding in a prepared mind was said to give [[Charles Darwin]] his "hunch" (about [[natural selection]]), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story,&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt; and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Another myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-11"/&gt;

==In religion==
{{Further information|Epiphany (holiday)|theophany|hierophany}}
In Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the [[Visit of the Magi]] as the [[revelation]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the infant Christ, and commemorate the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]] on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or [[Theophany]]) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by [[John the Baptist]] and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6.&lt;ref name="The Season of Epiphany"/&gt; Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either [[Ash Wednesday]], or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.

In more general terms, the phrase "religious epiphany" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to [[Arjuna]]'s realization that [[Krishna]] (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the "[[Bhagavad Gita]]") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be [[bodhodaya]], from Sanskrit [[bodha]] 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the [[bodhi]] tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining [[Nirvana]]. The Zen term ''[[kensho]]'' also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a ''[[koan]]''.

'''Fishtank Interactive''' was a [[Germany|German]] publishing label and was a division of [[Ravensburger Spieleverlag]]'s [[Ravensburger Interactive]]. It was founded in 2000 to try to expand the horizons of Ravensburger Spieleverlag by publishing more mature games than the rest of the mostly pre-school oriented games of the company, without sullying its reputation. Its releases were usually action games, or [[real-time strategies]], and were known for low production values highlighted by the lack of important features like [[multi-player]] playability. The division alongside its parent were sold in May 2002 to [[JoWooD Productions]].

==Releases==
Fishtank Interactive released the following games for PC:

*[[1914 - The Great War]]
*[[AquaNox]] - also released for [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] 
*[[Archangel (video game)|Archangel]]
*[[Beam Breakers]]
*[[Car Tycoon]]
*[[Etherlords]]
*[[Evil Islands: Curse of the Lost Soul]]
*[[RIM: Battle Planets]]
*[[S.W.I.N.E.]]

==Development==
Aside from publishing, Fishtank Interactive also developed the game [[Car Tycoon]].

Frank dropped out of school to work and help the family. When he was 35 he went back to college. He then went to law school and at some stage was assistant attorney general of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Petersburg Independent'' Monday May 6, 1974 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19740506&amp;id=SdtaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WX0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6501,1817218&amp;hl=ko Section B Never Satisfied Marks This Man - Bethia Caffery]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''French Film Festival UK''' (also named FFF UK) is an association founded in 1992. The association was first based in Edinburgh and Glasgow, before spreading to other parts of the United Kingdom. The Festival takes place generally between November and the beginning of December, with a programme of French or French-language movies (films, shorts, documentary, animations, etc.).

== History ==

=== The Festival debut ===
The festival began during Britain's presidency of the EC and was one of the artistic events initiated when [[Edinburgh]] hosted the Euro-summit in 1992. It was created on the initiative of two film journalists Richard Mowe and Allan Hunter who ran the festival in tandem for a number of years. Hunter now has relinquished the reins to concentrate on other activities, including the Glasgow Film Festival and the Italian Film Festival UK, both of which he is a co-director. Mowe is now director of the French Film Festival UK, co-director of the Italian Film Festival UK and director of the distribution company CinéFile as well as continuing his journalistic activities. Ilona Morison now has joined the FFF UK team as deputy director.

== Year by year ==

=== 1992 ===
It was the year of [[Josiane Balasko]], [[Gérard Jugnot]], [[Indochine (film)|Indochine]], [[Madame Bovary]] and then newcomer [[Arnaud Desplechin]]'s La Vie des morts. The [[Air France]] photographic archive was on show.

=== 1993 ===
[[Jean Reno]]'s mega-hit time-travelling comedy ''[[Les Visiteurs]]'' hit these shores to great success although the Festival would have to wait a few years for Reno himself to appear. Instead actor Christine Bujeau appeared in his place. Director [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] came and conquered with [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] and other films in his canon; there was [[Bertrand Blier]]'s Un, deux, trois soleil; [[Coline Serreau]]'s ''[[La Crise]]'' (including a special screening and dinner in the Royal Museum of Scotland for sponsors [[Paribas]]) and a special focus on [[Claude Chabrol]]. The festival introduced [[Cédric Klapisch]] to the British public with ''[[Riens du tout]]''. A link was forged with the [[Brest European Short Film Festival]] ensuring a selection of new French short films. [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Claude Sautet]] sent messages of support.

=== 1994 ===
The Festival have brought [[Michel Deville]] and ''Aux petits bonheurs'', [[Gérard Jugnot]] back again this time with ''Casque Bleu''; The César winning [[Tonie Marshall]] was discovered with ''Pas très catholique'' as well as [[Philippe Lioret]] and his audience award-winner ''[[Tombés du ciel]]''. Antoine Desrosières, a young directorial Turk, brought his youthful protagonists [[Mathieu Demy]] and Aurélie Thierrée and ''A la belle étoile''. The Harcourt Studio's photographic archives were on show.

=== 1995 ===
It was the year of [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] whom we introduced to the UK long before ''[[La Haine]]'' thrust him into the spotlight; [[Claude Lelouch]] was among the guests with [[Alessandra Martines]]; [[Josiane Balasko]] appeared on screen with [[Gazon Maudit]]; Hervé Palud and [[Louis Becker]] accompanied ''[[Un indien dans la ville]]'' and a test audience of youngsters gave their verdicts on dubbed and subtitled versions. Marion Vernoux was another discovery for ''Personne ne m'aime''. Bernard Stora won the audience award for ''Consentement Mutuel'' and Patrick Braoudé enchanted with the original ''[[Neuf mois]]''. We celebrated 100 years of [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] in a poster show.

=== 1996 ===
The grande dame of French cinema, [[Agnès Varda]] received a retrospective in her honour and in her presence. [[Patrice Leconte]] launched ''Les grands ducs''. [[Gabriel Aghion]] camped it up with ''[[Pédale douce]]'' … [[Michel Serrault]] and [[Carmen Maura]] discovered ''Le bonheur est dans le pré'' and pupils went to school with ''Le maître des éléphants'' with special screenings for teachers and their charges. [[Abel Gance]]'s monumental ''[[La Roue]]'' featured a live score by [[Adrian Johnston (musician)|Adrian Johnston]]. A restored copy of ''[[Jour de fête]]'' gave [[Jacques Tati]] a new lease of life. [[Didier Bourdon]] clowned around in ''Les trois frères'' and in person. And there were new films from [[Pascale Ferran]], [[Agnès Merlet]] and [[Tonie Marshall]].

=== 1997 ===
The real-life [[Lucie Aubrac]] made a heart-rending appearance in support of [[Claude Berri]]'s Resistance epic. [[Bernard Giraudeau]] presented his breathtaking ''Les caprices d'un fleuve'' and screenwriter [[Éric Assous]] discussed his scripts for ''La femme défendu'' and ''Les Randonnneurs''.  We discovered [[Robert Guédiguian]] long before Marius et Jeanette with ''A la vie, à la mort'' – and on screen there was Godard, Kassovitz and Klapisch, [[Michel Piccoli]] made his directorial debut, [[Alain Chabat]] showed dogged determination with Didier and Philippe Muyl's ''Tout doît disparaître''. [[Jan Kounen]] delivered Dobermann while [[Pascale Ferran]] and Pierre Trividic presented ''Petit arrangements avec les morts''.

=== 1998 ===
Claude and Annie Miller presented ''[[La classe de neige]]'' and other landmark films including ''La meilleure façon de marcher'', ''Garde à vue'', ''Le Sourire'', and ''L'éffrontée''. [[Antoine de Caunes]] showed his serious side in ''L'homme est une femme comme les autres'' and was present with actress [[Elsa Zylberstein]]. [[Patrice Chéreau]] also took the plane to talk about ''Ceux qui m'aiment prendront le train''. The classic choice of [[René Clair]]'s ''Un chapeau de paille d'italie'' was accompanied by a live score by Ramond Alessandrini. [[Patrice Leconte]] launched ''[[Une chance sur deux]]'' at its London premiere and Betrand Tavernier made a lasting impression with ''[[Capitaine Conan]]''. [[Francis Veber]] caused ripples of laughter with ''Le dîner de cons'', subsequently a huge box office hit. Danièle Doubroux tantalised with ''Le journal du séducteur'' – and there were startling debuts by Jean-François Richet (''Ma 6T va crack-er''), [[Sébastien Lifshitz]] with Les corps ouverts, Olivier Dahan with ''Déjà mort'' and Laurent Bouhnik with ''Zonzon''. Claude Duty brought his shorts.

=== 1999 ===
Time to vive la différence: women film-makers were ready for their close-ups, among them [[Anne Fontaine]], [[Valérie Lemercier]], [[Brigitte Rouan]], [[Diane Kurys]] and Danièle Dubroux – all were guests except Kurys. [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''La carrosse d'or'' gleamed anew in a restored print. [[Michel Deville]] returned to form with ''La maladie de Sachs'' and first film talents included Smadi Wolfman, director Olivier Péray and producer David Kodsi (all guests) with Petits désordres amoureux as well as [[Stéphane Brizé]], Didier Le Pêcheur and Christine Carrière. Alain Beigel (guest) revealed the talents of [[Emma de Caunes]] in ''Milles bornes'' – and accompanied his first feature, one of the year's most refreshing debuts.

=== 2000 ===
Bertrand Blier gathered together a who's who of French stars for ''Les acteurs'' and came to talk about them. We took a special look at les thrillers with such acclaimed titles as: ''Scènes de crimes'' (Frédéric Schoendoerffer) with [[Charles Berling]], and [[André Dussollier]]; ''Le cousin'' ([[Alain Corneau]]) starring [[Alain Chabat]], [[Patrick Timsit]], and [[Marie Trintignant]]; ''Au coeur du mensonge / The Colour of Lies'' ([[Claude Chabrol]]) starring [[Jacques Gamblin]], [[Sandrine Bonnaire]], [[Antoine de Caunes]] and Valéria Bruni-Tedeschi; Total Western / The Hunted Man (guest [[Eric Rochant]]) starring [[Samuel Le Bihan]], [[Jean-François Stévenin]] and [[Jean-Pierre Kalfon]]; as well as Une affaire du goût / A tasteful affair ([[Bernard Rapp]]) introduced by actor Jean-Pierre Lorît. [[Isabelle Huppert]] starred in three Les destinées sentimentales (Olivier Assayas) and in contemporary roles in two films by Benoît Jacquôt L'ecole de chair and Pas de scandale. Là-bas … mon pays / Over There … My Country (Alexandre Arcady) took a fresh look at Algeria with [[Antoine de Caunes]] playing a celebrated television journalist while Le vache et le président (Philippe Muyl, also a guest) proved a delightful film for young people about a boy's bid to save his favourite cow and was scene by thousands of school children. Other guest included Anne Villaceque for Petite Cherie, and Sabine Franel for Le premier du nom. A new company CinéFrance was established to continue the pioneering work of the festival throughout the year, and to date has released successfully Au coeur du mensonge and La vache et le président with more titles pending.

=== 2001 ===
The return of [[Josiane Balasko]] for ''Un crime au paradis''; Jean-Pierre Salomé for ''Belphégor''; [[Claude Miller]] for ''Betty Fisher''; [[Thierry Lhermitte]] for ''Le prince du pacifique''; [[Lucy Russell (actress)|Lucy Russell]] for ''L'anglaise et le duc''; Thomas Gilou for ''La vérité 1 and 2''; [[Mehdi Charef]] for ''Marie-Line''; Fabrice Genestal for ''La Squale''; [[Yves Lavandier]] for ''Oui mais …'' and Anne-Sophie Birot and Islid Lo Besco for ''Les filles ne savent pas nager''; [[Christian Carion]] for ''Une hirondelle a fait le printemps'' and Pierre-Olivier Scotto and Thierry de Ganay for ''Le roman de Lulu''. Lynda Benahouada and Mohamed Chaouch attended to support Samia.

=== 2002 ===
Serge le Peron for Léaud l'unique; [[Patrice Leconte]] for L'homme du train; [[Olivier Dahan]] for Le peit poucet and La vie promise; [[Éric Berger]] for Tanguy; [[Etienne Chatiliez]] for Tanguy (in London); Agnes Obadia and [[Jean-Julien Chervier]] for Du poil sous les roses; [[Nicolas Philibert]] retro at the French Institute, Edinburgh.

=== 2003 ===
The FFF offered a substantial retrospective –  devoted to the work of [[Alain Corneau]] in his presence which also helped to "grow" the festival's influence as some screenings started in October in the run-up to the festival itself which ran from 7 to 30 November. In [[Glasgow]] the Corneau retrospective found a home at the CCA, adding yet another venue to the line-up while the Ciné Lumière devoted a weekend to the retro. In [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]], the festival's founding cities, the response to the overall programme which embraced work by [[Claude Miller]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Jean Becker (director)|Jean Becker]], [[Raoul Ruiz]], Philippe Muyle, [[Jeanne Labrune]], [[Michel Deville]], [[Robert Guédiguian]] and [[Danièle Thompson]] among many, proved pleasingly buoyant and maintained the growing momentum seen over the last couple of years. Stirling Macrobert were cautiously upbeat about the participation on four titles. Sidebar activity included the stunning exhibition of photographs by Nicolas Guerin, a photographer who works for Positif, shown at the French Institute in Edinburgh and on the walls of GFT's Café Cosmo; a round table on literary adaptations in the cinema featuring Franco-Scottish input from Bernard MacLaverty, [[Alain Corneau]] and Leslie Hills at the French Institute where additional attractions included a programme of documentaries on writers as well as four portraits of directors [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]], [[Claire Denis]], [[Jean-Jacques Beineix]] and [[Robert Guédiguian]]. Again the level of activity built on initiatives started in previous years. One of the resounding causes for optimism was the positive reaction to the educational programme (Moi César, Le Papillon and Vivre me tue) which proved popular with pupils, students and teachers. The strong opening weekend (and closing at London Ciné Lumière) with many guests in attendance including [[Alain Corneau]], Nadine Trintingnant, Jean Veber, Nicolas Vannier, and Nicolas Guerin, ensured that the festival had a vibrant send-off and produced vibes that resonated over the days ahead. Distribution of guests ensured that Dundee (Jean and Louis Becker) and Aberdeen (Thomas Chabrol) shared in the bounty.

=== 2004 ===
The star appearance in [[Glasgow]] of [[Jean Reno]], created a storm of interest. Guests appeared variously in London, Glasgow, and [[Edinburgh]] and included [[Gael Morel]] for Le Clan, [[Dominique Cabrera]] for Folle embellie, Abelllatif Kechiche for L'esquive, and [[Emmanuel Mouret]] for Venus et fleur. Consul general Pierre Antoine-Berniard hosted an agreeable brunch at his residence and guests of honour included director Gael Morel, Unifrance's Antoine Khalife, Sylvain and Sally Chomet, Scottish director Richard Jobson, Palme Dog promoter Toby Rose and others including the French Institute's Olga Poivre d'Arvor. Education events surrounded Les choristes, Malabar Princess, Genesis and Raining Cats and Frogs. Special teaching packs were devised by Glasgow Film Theatre's learning team in collaboration with local authorities. Such events are becoming an increasingly important of FFF activities, with teachers demonstrating an unprecedented demand and interest. The tribute to [[Alain Delon]] whose image adorned the cover of the brochure, drummed up a strong following for La Piscine, Mr Klein and Melodie en sous sol.

=== 2005 ===
There was a mini-celebration of le cinema francais to enable the French Film Festival UK to change calendar dates and to join forces in 2006 with the [[Renault]] French Film Season to become an all-encompassing showcase for French cinema in the UK. Titles presented comprised: Afiter You / Après vous; Just Friends / je préfère qu’on reste amis; The Art of Breaking Up / Un fil a la patte and The Ax / Le Couperet. Sadly the collaboration was short-lived and in 2007 the Festival regained its traditional November slot.

=== 2006 ===
The year of the collaboration with the [[Renault]] French Film Season. The Panorama section of the Festival was devoted to titles featuring such big name stars as [[Carole Bouquet]], [[Sandrine Bonnaire]], [[Sabine Azéma]], and, from the younger generation, [[Romain Duris]] and [[Audrey Tautou]]. Themes range from school rebellion (Bad Spelling, to be released by CineFile), a right royal romp which has already had considerable coverage over here (Palais Royal!, Momentum Pictures) and 1968 revolutionary fervour (Regular Lovers, Artificial Eye).  Cutting-edge, new talent is celebrated in the Discovery section. [[Xavier Giannoli]]'s An Adventure (Momentum Pictures) depicts a strange psychological encounter between [[Ludivine Sagnier]] and [[Nicolas Duvauchelle]], while Mon Ange (Parasol Peccadillo) features [[Vanessa Paradis]] in her first screen role for six years, playing a hooker with a heart of gold who suddenly finds her world turned upside down. Master Classes, open to all, were scheduled with [[Bertrand Tavernier]], the subject of the 2006 retrospective. As someone who has carved his own unique niche in French cinema as a dedicated cinéphile, producer, script-writer, and director, Tavernier has won countless international awards for his work which will be discussed at public events in London, Glasgow, [[Edinburgh]] and [[Dundee]]. He will also present his latest film Holy Lola with [[Jacques Gamblin]] and [[Isabelle Carré]] plus the cult hit Death Watch, made in Glasgow with [[Romy Schneider]] and [[Harvey Keitel]]. The festival is presided over by honorary patron [[Sylvain Chomet]], the Oscar-nominated creator of Belleville Rendez-vous currently working on this side of the Channel – another example of Franco-British fusion in action. There were three launches – in [[Edinburgh]] (Cockles and Muscles with Jacques Martineau and Olivier Ducastel), [[Glasgow]] (Lemming with Dominik Moll) and London (Le Temps qui reste) with [[Melvil Poupaud]]. Russian Dolls had its London bow at the Cineworld Shaftesbury Avenue followed by [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s masterclass and screening of Holy Lola. The delegation comprised, among others, Marie Gillain, Melvil Poupaud, Dominik Moll, Cédric Klapisch, Olivier Marchal, Bertrand Tavernier, Olivier Ducastel, Jacques Martineau, Edouard Colin, as well as Jacques Bonnaffé and Aisa Maiga (the latter low profile pair had least to contribute to the proceedings being secondary characters in their respective films Cockles and Russian Dolls).

=== 2007 ===
After a year of close collaboration with Unifrance and the showcase in London designed to promote films with UK distribution in place, it was agreed that the two events should regain their separate identities in 2007. The policy change within Unifrance was communicated relatively late in the planning of the FFF UK 2007 leaving the 15th edition of the festival locked in to dates from 15 April to 6 May (not necessarily the ideal timeframe) while the Rendezvous ran earlier from 29 March to 1 April and was based only in London. The FFF UK welcomed a range of guests including [[Christian Vincent (director)|Christian Vincent]], the subject of this year's retro. He attended screenings in three cities (London, Edinburgh, Glasgow) as well as taking part in masterclasses at Screen Academy Scotland in Edinburgh and at the Alliance française in Glasgow. Another three-city guest was director [[Patrick Grandperret]] who presented his new film Meurtrières / Murderers. [[Michel Hazanavicius]], the director of OSS 117 attended with actress Bérénice Béjo – and took part in two screenings at Filmhouse [[Edinburgh]] and Vue Ocean Terminal. Unfortunately they had to cut their [[Glasgow]] date because of a funeral in France. The final attendee was [[Claudie Ossard]], one of France's most powerful producers (Amélie / Betty Blue / Delicatessen) who presented her new production Paris je t'aime with FFF UK patron [[Sylvain Chomet]] (director of one of the segments). She used the occasion to talk shop with Chomet about their new live-action feature project.

=== 2008 ===
The introduction of a Preview section devoted to showcasing films with UK distribution already in place (as a way of filling the gap left by the demise of the 2008 Unifrance London Rendezvous) also produced dividends. In particular the take-up for Priceless (top performer) and A Secret. The line-up of guests included Lola Doillon attending the openings in Edinburgh and Glasgow with her first film Just About Love, [[Jean Becker (director)|Jean Becker]] and [[Jean-Pierre Darroussin]] supporting Conversations with My Gardener in Scotland and London, and Lebanese film-maker [[Danielle Arbid]] in attendance for A Lost Man. Daroussin and also accompanied The Premonition, his first film as a director with actress Valerie Stroh. [[Lionel Bailliu]] worked tirelessly at master classes built around his feature Fair Play and his short film Squash at Screen Academy Scotland and Stirling University as well as the Alliance Française in Glasgow. London additionally welcomed [[Pierre Salvadori]], [[Serge Bozon]] and Barbara Carlotti, and Damien Odoul. The only guest who failed to appear was [[Melvil Poupaud]], who had to return at the last moment to the States for re-shoots on his new film. Award-winning photographer Fabrizio Maltese appeared in Edinburgh and Glasgow to publicise his exhibition Faces of French Cinema at the Institut franìais. He was accompanied by his editor Boyd van Hoeij.

=== 2009 ===
The 17th edition featured two contrasting tributes to diverse but legendary figures: [[Jacques Tati]] and [[Jean Eustache]]. A new documentary The Magnificent Tati premiered in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]], presented by its director Michael House while Tati expert Professor [[David Bellos]] from Princeton University introduced all major screenings of Tati's oeuvres. The focus on [[Jean Eustache]], curated by [[Edinburgh]] University, was presented by Eustache expert Jerome Game and Professor Keith Reader from Glasgow University. Panorama gathered titles featuring the crème de la crème of French stars among them [[Gérard Depardieu]], [[Nathalie Baye]], [[Josiane Balasko]], [[Catherine Frot]], [[André Dussollier]], [[Gérard Jugnot]], [[Jean-Pierre Darroussin]], [[Fabrice Luchini]], [[Chiara Mastroianni]], and [[Emmanuel Mouret]] as well as a clin d'oeil on novelist Françoise Sagan. The Discovery section, among a wide selection, showcased [[Guillaume Depardieu]]'s final moving performance and an arresting new Swiss film Another Man whose director Lionel Baier was in attendance with the support of the cultural department of the Swiss Embassy. Director and sailor Pierre Marcel presented his documentary Tabarly (the Gallic master mariner Eric Tabarly). Top French titles due on UK screens later in that year included the Cannes Film Festival award winner A Prophet by [[Jacques Audiard]] and Welcome by [[Philippe Lioret]]. In addition to regular cities (Glasgow, Edinburgh, London, Manchester, Warwick, Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee) we welcomed to the fold Dumfries, Durham, Cambridge, St Andrews and Stirling. The Rhône-Alpes region around Lyon active in film locations, tourism and commerce held a special gala evening as part of the celebration.

=== 2010 ===
The festival welcomed more than 20,000 spectators. An even wider geographical selection was on offer through the addition of the Horizons label, warmly embracing the world of Francophonie and its varied cultures thanks to the input of TV5 Monde. After the memorable [[Jacques Tati]] tribute and retrospective in 2009 the festival maintained the link by focussing on the work of [[Pierre Étaix]] in his presence and in particular the restored copy of Le grand amour. With his roots in the circus, he helped Tati on many of his films, developed multiple skills and carved his own film career working with everyone from Robert Bresson to [[Jerry Lewis]]. A close-up on a key figure in French cinema, André Techiné whose concerns have involved identity, sexuality and roots, was mounted in association with Stirling University's Bill Marshall. The new films cover titles from major directors such as [[Bertrand Tavernier]], [[Rachid Bouchareb]], Jean-Jacques Beineix and Costa-Gavras, to the newer generation of Christophe Honoré, Stephane Brizé, Cédric Kahn, and Zabou Breitman.

=== 2011 ===
[[Daniel Auteuil]] supported in person his remake Marcel Pagnol's classic The Well-Digger's Daughter (as actor and director) while Daniel Armogathe, President of the Marseille Cinematheque shared his Pagnol insights at screenings of the film in Edinburgh and Glasgow, part of a delegation from Marseille. Following the previous recent celebrations of [[Jacques Tati]] and, in 2010, [[Pierre Étaix]], we saluted in their presence a Belgian burlesque duo in the same tradition Fiona Gordon and Dominique Abel and their Cannes hit The Fairy. The Belgian flag also was flown by Bouli Lanners (The Giants) and Dominique Reding's Robert Mitchum is Dead, all organised by Edouard Notte, lecturer in French language and literature at Edinburgh University in collaboration with WBI (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Francophone Community). The delightful opening choice of Romantics Anonymous starring [[Isabelle Carré]] and [[Benoît Poelvoorde]] was directed by [[Jean-Pierre Améris]] who accompanied his film at most screenings. There were superb documentaries such as Oceans, Special Flight, Think Global and a portrait of Charlotte Rampling (The Look) through animation (Zep's colourful Titeuf and A Cat in Paris) to significant new works by [[Alain Cavalier]], André Techiné, [[Philippe Claudel]], [[Danielle Arbid]] (who accompanied her controversial Beirut Hotel) as well as The Women on the 6th Floor's Philippe Le Guay. Scots actor Jamie Sives demonstrated the Auld Alliance in action and teamed up with director Vincent Vizioz for Temblay-en-France.

Classic cinema was not neglected with [[Jean Delannoy]]'s collaboration with [[Jean Cocteau]] Love Eternal and Fantomas by [[Louis Feuillade]], the first great master of feature-length film-making, accompanied with a live electronic score by two cult Parisian DJs Jean-Yves Leloup and Éric Pajot (aka RadioMentale) in Dundee and The Hippodrome, Bo'ness.

=== 2012 ===
The 20th Anniversary of the festival between 8 November and 2 December in over 12 cities including London, [[Edinburgh]] and Paris.
The guests of the festival were: [[Chantal Akerman]], [[Pierre Jolivet]], [[Eric Lange]], Sophie Lellouche, François Pirot and [[Noémie Lvovsky]] with a piano recital by [[Jason Kouchak]] held at the ambassadors residence in Paris.
This year, the festival has screened in preview the movie ''Asterix and Obelix: On Her Majesty'' with great actors like [[Gérard Depardieu]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], Dany Boon or [[Valérie Lemercier]]. A retro was made in honor of [[Chantal Akerman]] and his film Almayer's Folly. The Horizons unveiled panorama feature films like ''All Our Desires'' by [[Philippe Lioret]], ''My Worst Nightmare'' Anne Fontaine with [[Benoit Poelvoorde]] or ''Happiness never comes alone'' with Sophie Marceau. ''Under Discovery'', ''Headwinds of Lespert'' or first name Mathieu Delaporte and Alexandre de Patellière were broadcast. There was a special Quebec Cinema Showcase that highlights Québec film culture. The animated films ''The Suicide Shop'' and ''Ernest and Celestine'' made strong impression. While a classic item made rediscover old films such as ''Borsalino'' with [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]].

=== 2013 ===
The guests of this edition were: [[Anouk Aimée]], [[Daniel Auteuil]], [[Jean-Pierre Améris]], [[Sylvain Chomet]], [[Gregory Monro]], Benazeth Catherine and [[Yolande Moreau]]. A slideshow is dedicated specifically to the immortal [[Louis de Funès]] and his films such as The crossing of Paris of [[Claude Autant-Lara]] and the megalomania of [[Gérard Oury]]. The Horizons panorama made discover films like capital with Gad Elmaleh, or The Man Who Laughs with [[Gérard Depardieu]]. The view was also discover a beautiful hilarious movie ''Me, Myself and Mum'' featuring the incredible personable actor- director Guillaume Galienne.

=== 2014 ===
This year, the Horizons panorama in the brochure included the hit movie ''Belle and Sebastian'' by [[Nicolas Vanier]] or he tells the friendship between a boy and a dog, all our strength From Nils Tavernier or man that is loved too with [[Guillaume Canet]] by [[André Téchiné]] . The section contains the Discovery Domestic Life Isabelle Czajka Heirs of Marie- Castille Mention – Schaar or even Alone with [[François Cluzet]]. The animated portion still has its success this time Day of the Crows by Jean-Christophe Dessaint or Loulou, the incredible secret of Gregory by Eric Omond Solotareff. A tribute to World War I was done with different films on this theme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4460">'''Fruit Basket Turnover''' or '''Fruit Basket Upset''', also known as '''Fruit Salad''', '''Fruit Bowl''', '''Fruits Basket''' {{sic}} and others is a [[children's game]].

'''Fruit Basket''' usually refers to a variation in which each fruit is ostensibly associated with only one player, and the player in the centre must call two fruit names.

==Rules==

The game is played as follows:

* The players are divided into equal-sized groups, with each group having the name of a [[fruit]].
* A [[circle]] is formed with a number of chairs equal to one less than the number of players. The players sit on the chairs, ensuring that members of each group are evenly distributed around the circle.
* One player will be left without a [[chair]], and will stand in the centre of the circle.
* The player standing in the centre calls out one of the fruit names. When this happens, all players in that group must stand up from their seats and move to another seat in the circle. The player in the centre must attempt to take one of the free seats while the other players are moving.
* A new player will then be left in the centre, enabling the game to be repeated. If any player failed to move even though their group's fruit name was called, they are required to move into the centre and the player previously in the centre sits in their seat.
* Instead of stating a fruit name, the player in the centre may call "Fruit Basket Turnover!", "Fruit Basket Upset!" or "Fruits Basket!", in which case ''everybody'' must move to a different seat.
* There is often a restriction that the player must move to a seat not adjacent to their own

In some variants of the game, a player can be eliminated from the game, usually if they either fail to move when their fruit name is called, or are due to appear in the centre for two rounds in a row. Whenever a player is eliminated, a chair is also removed from the circle. The game resembles a combination of the games [[Musical Chairs]] and [[Duck Duck Goose]].

In an outdoor version of the game, the players stand along the side of a large open area, and must run from one side to the other without being tagged when their fruit, or 'turnover', is called. Any player who is caught by the player in the middle must join the player in the middle to help catch players on future moves. Eventually, all players are caught.

==Party game variant==
A variation of the game, played by older children and young [[adult]]s, does not make use of fruit names. Instead, the player in the centre calls out the description of a group of people (for example, "women", "people who have been to [[Kansas]]", etc.) and all people in that group are required to move. The only limit on this is that the person in the centre must be a member of the specified group (e.g., only a woman may call on "women" to move).
:Another variant, sometimes called "I Never", reverses this limit, requiring the centre to describe a group by something that the centre has never done, calling "I've never...".

==References to the game==
The most well-known reference in Western youth culture to Fruits Basket is the [[Fruits Basket|anime and manga series]] of the same name, where it is used as a [[metaphor]] for ability to integrate with a social group.  In that series, the [[protagonist]] [[Tohru Honda]] describes that whenever she played the game in [[school]], she was assigned the name "[[onigiri]]" (rice ball).  Although she was fine with this, she later realized that the other children playing never called this name because an onigiri is not a fruit and didn't belong in a fruits basket, thus leaving her sitting as they continued to play. However, at the end of episode 5, when she is accepted into the Sohma family, we see one child call "onigiri!" and, smiling, Tohru joins in the game. The series title itself originates from the fact that Tohru previously thought that she could never actually fit in with the [[List of Fruits Basket characters#The Sohmas|Sohma family]], just as a rice ball could never belong in a fruits basket, but, being accepted into the family proves otherwise, and she learns that she has a home with them.

The anime [[Mitsudomoe (manga)|Mitsudomoe]] makes reference to the game in episode 1 of season 1 but is portrayed in a violent yet humorous way.

'''''Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth''''' (first published by Gambit, Boston, 1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] (a professor of the history of science at MIT) and [[Hertha von Dechend]]  (a scientist at 
Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität) is a nonfiction work of history and [[comparative mythology]], particularly the subfield of [[archaeoastronomy]].  
It is mostly about the claim of a [[Megalithic]] era discovery of [[axial precession]], and the encoding of this knowledge in mythology. The book was severely criticized by academics upon its publication.

==Argument==
{{rewrite section|date=September 2018}}
The main argument of the book may be summarized as the claim of an early ([[Neolithic]]) discovery of the [[precession of the equinoxes]] (usually attributed to [[Hipparchus]], 2nd century BCE), and an associated very long-lived [[Megalithic]] civilization of "unsuspected sophistication" that was particularly preoccupied with astronomical observation.
The knowledge of this civilization about precession, and the associated [[astrological age]]s,
would have been encoded in [[mythology]], typically in the form of a story relating to a [[millstone]] and a young protagonist—the "Hamlet's Mill" of the book's title, a reference to the kenning '' [[Amlodhi|Amlóða]] kvren'' recorded in the Old Icelandic ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
Chapter VI, Amlodhi's Quern: "Shakespeare's Gentle Prince [...] who was known once upon a time as a personage of no ordinary power, of universal position, and, in the North, as the owner of a formidable mill. [...] The Mill is thus not only very great and ancient, but it must also be central to the original Hamlet story. It reappears in the ' Skaldskaparmal'', where Snorri explains why a kenning for gold is 'Frodhi's meal'"
&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors indeed claim that mythology is primarily to be interpreted as in terms of [[archaeoastronomy]] ("mythological language has exclusive reference to celestial phenomena"), and they mock alternative interpretations in terms of fertility or agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;"Nevertheless, the expression of this proto-scientific vision of the cosmos was not mathematical but mythological. All the gods are stars, and mythological language has exclusive reference to celestial phenomena: for example, "earth" in myth means only "the ideal plane laid through the ecliptic" (p. 58); all stories of floods "refer to an old astronomical image" (p. 57). Without bothering to refute alternative positions which hold that some, at least, of the gods and myths stemmed from concern with fertility or meteorological phenomena, the authors merely mock "the fertility addicts" (p. 308) and "the Fecundity-'Trust" (p. 381)." White (1970:541).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's project is an examination of the "relics, fragments and allusions that have survived the steep attrition of the ages".&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet's Mill'', as quoted in Leach 1970&lt;/ref&gt; 
In particular, the book reconstructs a myth of a [[heavenly mill]] which rotates around the celestial pole and grinds out the world's [[salt]] and [[soil]], and is associated with the [[maelstrom]]. The millstone falling off its frame represents the passing of one age's pole star (symbolized by a ruler or king of some sort), and its restoration and the overthrow of the old king of authority and the empowering of the new one the establishment of a new order of the age (a new star moving into the position of pole star). 
The authors attempt to demonstrate the prevalence of influence of this hypothetical civilization's ideas by analysing the world's mythology (with an eye especially to all "mill myths") using 
{{quote|[...] cosmographic oddments from many eras and climes...a collection of yarns from Saxo Grammaticus, Snorri Sturluson ("Amlodhi's mill" as a [[kenning]] for the sea!), [[Firdausi]], [[Plato]], [[Plutarch]], the ''[[Kalevala]]'', ''[[Mahabharata]]'', and ''[[Gilgamesh]]'', not to forget Africa, the Americas, and Oceania....&lt;ref name="Puhvel1970"/&gt;}}

Santillana and Dechend state in their introduction to ''Hamlet's Mill'' that they are well aware of modern interpretations of myth and folklore but find them shallow and lacking insight: "...the experts now are benighted by the current folk fantasy, which is the belief that they are beyond all this - critics without nonsense and extremely wise". Consequently, Santillana and Dechend prefer to rely on the work of "meticulous scholars such as [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]], [[Karl Richard Lepsius|Lepsius]], [[Daniel Chwolson|Chwolson]], [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Boll]] and, to go farther back, of [[Athanasius Kircher]] and [[Petavius]]..."

They give reasons throughout the book for preferring the work of older scholars (and the early mythologists themselves) as the proper way to interpret myth; but this viewpoint did not sit well with their modern critics schooled in the "current anthropology, which has built up its own idea of the primitive and what came after".&lt;ref&gt;All quotations are from the Introduction to ''Hamlet's Mill'', first edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santillana had previously published, in 1961, ''The Origins of Scientific Thought'', on which  ''Hamlet's Mill'' is substantially based. Compare various statements in ''Hamlet's Mill'' to this quotation from ''The Origin of Scientific Thought'': "We can see then, how so many myths, fantastic and arbitrary in semblance, of which the Greek tale of the [[Argonauts|Argonaut]] is a late offspring, may provide a terminology of image motifs, a kind of code which is beginning to be broken. It was meant to allow those who knew (a) to determine unequivocally the position of given planets in respect to the earth, to the firmament, and to one another; (b) to present what knowledge there was of the fabric of the world in the form of tales about 'how the world began'."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in pages 35-36 of {{cite book| title=Against Method |edition=3rd |last=Feyerabend
|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Feyerabend
|isbn=0-86091-481-X| date=2000| publisher=Verso| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Hamlet's Mill'' was severely criticized by academic reviewers&lt;ref&gt;"The cowed reviewer is soon reduced to wondering whether mere critical prose should even be expended on something that obviously solicits the suspension of disbelief." Puhvel (1970). "As will presently be apparent, my reaction to this book is hostile - so before my prejudices get out of hand, let me try to explain what it is all about." (Leach 1970) "De Santillana has served us well once more by underscoring a pioneering idea, but von Dechend's implementation of that idea will prevent many scholars from recognizing its validity." White (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; on a number of grounds: tenuous arguments based on incorrect or outdated linguistic information;&lt;ref&gt;"The long-forgotten period-piece etymologies of [[Max Müller]] and [[Adalbert Kuhn]] ("surely a great scholar", p. 381) are blithely resurrected (for example, Sanskrit ''Pramantha'' matching Greek ''Prometheus'', p. 139), while more up-to-date authorities are caricatured as "severe philologists, slaves to exact 'truth'" (p. 294). Puhvel (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; lack of familiarity with modern sources;&lt;ref&gt;"..but in all other respects they choose to ignore almost completely nearly everything that has been written about their subject matter over the past forty years [...] Academic arrogance of this sort is impenetrable; in the certitude of their faith out authors are bound to dismiss all criticism as tendentious, and so, as critic, I have nothing left to say except that I do not believe a word of it." Leach 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; an over-reliance on coincidence or analogy;&lt;ref&gt;"Her only proofs are analogy, often strained. On a single page (425) she connects myths of Greece, Japan, Egypt, Iceland, the Marquesas, and the Cherokee Indians. On page 309, a rabbinical and a Pawnee tradition show "mistakable" identity. On page 320 we read "here ancient Greek myth suddenly emerges in full light among Indian tribes in America, miraculously preserved." One might quote such passages indefinitely." White (1970:541).&lt;/ref&gt; and the general implausibility of a far-flung and influential civilization existing and not leaving behind solid evidence. At most, it has been given a grudging sort of praise. Thus, [[Jaan Puhvel]] (1970) concluded that
{{quote|This is not a serious scholarly work on the problem of myth in the closing decades of the twentieth century. There are frequent flashes of insight, for example, on the cyclical world views of the ancients and on the nature of mythical language, as well as genuinely eloquent, quasi-poetic homilies.&lt;ref name="Puhvel1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Puhvel |first=Jaan |date=1 December 1970 |title=Hamlet's Mill. An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time |department=Reviews of Books |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=75 |issue=7 |pages=2009–2010 |doi=10.1086/ahr/75.7.2009 ||jstor=1848027}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Writing in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', [[Edmund Leach]] noted:
{{quote|[The] authors' insistence that between about 4000 B.C. and 100 A.D. a single archaic system prevailed throughout most of the civilized and proto-civilized world is pure fantasy. Their attempt to delineate the details of this system by a worldwide scatter of random oddments of mythology is no more than an intellectual game. [...] Something like 60 percent of the text is made up of complex arguments about Indo-European etymologies which would have seemed old-fashioned as early as 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leach |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Leach |date=12 February 1970 |title=Bedtime Story |journal=The New York Review of Books |volume=14 |page=36 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/11061 |publisher=American Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] referred to ''Hamlet’s Mill'' as:
{{quote|[...] amateurish in the worst sense, jumping to wild conclusions without any knowledge of the historical value of the sources or of previous work done. On the Scandinavian side there is heavy dependence on the fantasies of [[Viktor Rydberg|Rydberg]], writing in the last [19th] century, and apparent ignorance of progress made since his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = H. R. Ellis | date = 1974 | title = Review of ''Hamlet's Mill'' | url = | journal = Folklore | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 282–283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast the classical scholar [[Harald Reiche]] positively reviewed ''Hamlet's Mill''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Hamlet's Mill'', review by: Harald A. T. Reiche". (1973). ''The Classical Journal'', 69(1): 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Reiche was a colleague of [[Giorgio de Santillana|Santillana]] at [[MIT]], and himself developed the archaeoastronomical interpretation of ancient myth in a series of lectures and publications similar to ''Hamlet's Mill'' (dealing more specifically with [[Greek mythology]]), including an interpretation of "the layout of Atlantis as a sort of map of the sky".&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/JHAS./0011//0000100.000.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish astronomer [[Peter Nilson]], while recognizing that ''Hamlet's Mill'' does not qualify as a work of science, expressed admiration for it as well as it being a source of inspiration when he wrote his own book on classic mythologies based on the night sky: ''Himlavalvets sällsamheter'' (1977).

Barber &amp; Barber (2006), itself a study aiming to "uncover seismic, geological, astrological, or other natural events" from mythology, appreciates the book for its pioneer work in [[mythography]], judging that "Although controversial, &lt;nowiki&gt;[Santillana and von Dechend]&lt;/nowiki&gt; have usefully flagged and collected Herculean amounts of relevant data."&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Elizabeth Wayland and Barber, Paul T., ''When They Severed Earth from Sky: How the Human Mind Shapes Myth''. 2006. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-12774-3}}. p. 185, n.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the conclusions the authors draw from their data have been "virtually ignored by the scientific and scholarly establishment.”&lt;ref&gt;Roy G. Willis and Patrick Curry (2004), ''Astrology, Science and Culture: Pulling Down the Moon'', p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
The full hardcover title is ''Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth &amp; the Frame of Time''. Later softcover editions would use ''Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and its Transmission Through Myth''. 
The English edition was hastily assembled and published five years prior to Santillana's death. 
Hertha von Dechend (who is generally held to have written more of the book)&lt;ref&gt;"The mass of the book, including thirty-nine appendices, is clearly von Dechend's work." White (1970:541).&lt;/ref&gt; prepared an expanded second edition several years later. 
The essay was reissued by [[David R. Godine, Publisher]] in 1992. The German translation, which appeared in 1993, is slightly longer than the original. The 8th Italian edition of 2000 was substantially expanded.&lt;ref&gt;From 552 to 630 pages (see 'Editions').&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">'''INRI studio''' is an independent production house from [[Singapore]], founded by cult director [[Tzang Merwyn Tong]] in 1999. The studio has - to this date - produced two films, ''[[A Wicked Tale]]'' and ''[[e’Tzaintes]]'', both of which premièred to critical acclaim in the international film festival circuit. The studio’s mission is to create a platform for writers, storytellers, musicians and film-makers to come together to present alternative art forms to mainstream audiences. Their [[Mantra]] – To Provoke the Senses and Open the Mind.

==History==
INRI studio was a concept that came about in 1999 when [[Tzang Merwyn Tong]] and long time friend Armen Rizal Rahman, an aspiring musician, decide that it was time they band together to create a production company they can call their own. They roped in Lee Amizadai and together the unit identified themselves as INRI studio.

The trio went on to make their very first film together. Using their scrap earnings and savings that they have accumulated over the years, the team of film-makers started work on their first film ''e’Tzaintes''. The film’s a teenage black comedy about a bunch of social outcasts. It was a project that took them 3 years to complete.

The film was a hit when it premièred at GV Grand at Great World City in [[Singapore]] on January 2003. Tickets to this independent première were completely sold out with people even paying to sit on the aisles.

''e’Tzaintes'' went to travel to a couple of film festivals. It premièred in Europe in 2004 as the Opening Night Film of the [[Berlin]] Asia-Pacific Film Festival and was screened as part of the Asian New Force at the [[Hong Kong]] IFVA Festival.

The studio then embarked on their second film, ''A Wicked tale'', starring Evelyn Maria Ng as the [[Little Red Riding Hood]] character in [[Tzang Merwyn Tong]]’s dark re-imagination of the [[Brothers Grimm]] fable. The film made its World Premiere to a full house crowd at the Rotterdam International Film Festival and was later invited to FanTasia Film Festival to be screened as one of the Closing Night films. The movie won the Gold Remi Award at [[WorldFest]] in Houston. On December 2005, INRI studio made history by being the first short film in Singapore to be released commercially on [[DVD]].

The INRI studio collective now consists of artists, writers, musicians and filmmakers coming together to explore new ways of how they can take things to the next level. An underground music project is currently in the pipeline.

==Etymology==
The word [[INRI]] is inspired by the inscription on the cross from which [[Jesus Christ]] was crucified. [[INRI]] is a Latin acronym for Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum (literally translated as [[Jesus]] of Nazareth King of Jews). The letters can be found inscribed on a stylized plaque (or parchment) hanging just above the corpse of [[Christ]] on many depictions of the [[Crucifixion]].

Contrary to belief, the use of the name [[INRI]] is neither religious nor sacrilegious. Tzang Merwyn is known to be a big fan of mythology and he considers the crucifixion a romantic and inspiring historic parable.

It’s a story about a man (assumed by many as a heretic) who refuses to deny accusations that he was the Saviour even though he was about to be nailed to the cross. The story is symbolical of the kind sacrifice one has to make to stage a revolution, and the letters, INRI, a reminder to Tzang and his team mates that mockery and ridicule awaits those who choose to do things differently.

'''''Kalimba''''' is a [[Puzzle game|puzzle]]-[[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed for the [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] by Danish developer [[Press Play (company)|Press Play]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]]. In the game, initially known as "Project Totem", players must move pieces of a [[totem pole]] through various levels while avoiding obstacles. The name comes from the music sample kalimba by mr scruff in windows versions.

==Gameplay==
A noble [[shaman]] on the island of Kalimba protects her people through a mystic totem pole. When an evil shaman destroys both the good shaman and the totem pole, she discovers that her spirit can control pieces of the totem and plans to use that ability to save the island's inhabitants by building a new, stronger totem pole.

The player controls two colored pieces of the totem pole simultaneously; when the player moves one piece in a given direction, the second piece copies the action. The totem pieces may pass safely through anything that matches their own color, but otherwise must avoid all enemies and pitfalls. If a piece is lost through contact with an enemy or other obstacle, both pieces are lost, but the pieces reset to the most recently passed checkpoint. As players advance, they collect items scattered throughout the level. Upon completion of the level, points are scored for each item collected, but are reduced by the number of times the pieces were lost. The completed level unlocks a totem piece that also serves to rank the player's performance in that level. Levels may be replayed in order to improve both score and time of completion.

In cooperative mode, each player controls a pair of totem pieces of the same color. Playing through a different set of levels from the single-player mode, players must work together to arrange their pieces in ways to complete the levels. Scoring and ranking are otherwise the same as the single-player version.

==Development==
First announced in April 2014 as "Project Totem", ''Kalimba'' was developed by Press Play, a Danish gaming studio that was acquired in 2012 by Microsoft Studios. In November 2014, the name was changed to ''Kalimba'' officially and a release date of December 17, 2014 was announced for Xbox One, with a Windows PC release planned for January 2015. At the initial announcement, Press Play mentioned that the game would also be released on [[Xbox 360]], but after the release date for Xbox One was announced, Press Play said, "while there are plans to hopefully bring Kalimba to [Xbox] 360 in the future, there's nothing concrete in the works at the moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/14/7220847/project-totem-kalimba-release-date-xbox-one-press-play|title=Press Play's Project Totem renamed Kalimba, launches Dec. 17 on Xbox One (update)|author=Samit Sarkar|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=November 14, 2014|accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Press Play announced the official release date of the PC version of ''Kalimba'', which was released on Steam April 22, 2015.&lt;ref name="Update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/kalimba-is-coming-to-pc-with-free-and-paid-dlc-290486.phtml|title=Kalimba is coming to PC, with free and paid DLC|author=Chris Carter|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=April 14, 2015|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further announced an update to both versions that would add two new gameplay modes along with a [[Downloadable content|DLC]] expansion that added new single-player and co-op levels to the game.&lt;ref name="Update"/&gt; One of the new modes allows single players to [[speedrun]] the levels and compete against [[ghost (video gaming)|ghosts]] of other players, while the second mode introduces new challenges for co-op play.&lt;ref name="PP-PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressplay.dk/1139/kalimba-now-on-steam-and-thats-not-all/|title=Kalimba – Now on Steam!

''Kalimba'' has received generally positive reviews.&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; Reviewers have complimented the game on its concept and the fun of playing the game cooperatively, but have said that the game's graphics and sounds are ultimately "forgettable".&lt;ref name="GameSpot" /&gt; The game was both nominated and shortlisted for a 2015 BAFTA award in the 'Best Original Property' category.&lt;ref&gt;http://awards.bafta.org/award/2015/games/original-property&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24569">This article provides a '''list of notable awards for [[webcomic]]s''' and some of the winners from each year. 

Many webcomics artists have received honors for their work. In 2006, [[Gene Luen Yang]]'s graphic novel ''[[American Born Chinese]]'', originally published as a webcomic on [[Modern Tales]], was the first graphic novel to be nominated for a [[National Book Award]].&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;Bosman, Julie.  (October 12, 2006). "National Book Award Finalists Chosen". ''[[The New York Times]]'', Pg. E2 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Hertzfeldt]]'s animated film based on his webcomics, ''[[Everything Will Be OK]]'', won the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]] Jury Award in Short Filmmaking, a prize rarely bestowed on an animated film.&lt;ref name="Sundance"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bay Area films keep it real at Sundance festival|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20070116/ai_n17130219/pg_2/|accessdate=2007-01-16|author=De Benedetti, Chris |publisher=Oakland Tribune}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webcomic artists have also won comic awards from organizations that generally honor print comics, such as the [[Ignatz Awards]] and [[Eisner Awards]], and there are awards, such as the [[Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards]], which are given only to webcomics. 

==Awards given only to webcomics==

===Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards===

From 2001 until 2008, the [[Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards]] were given out, with voting rights granted only to online [[cartoonist]]s. Because of the large number of categories, such as "Best Art", "Best Writing", "Best Gag Comic" and "Best Newcomer", only the winners of the main category "Best Comic" are listed here. The following articles provide complete listings of all nominees and winners in each year:

===The Webcomic List Awards===
In 2009 and 2010, users of [[internet forum]] The Webcomic List held an amateur award ceremony, where winners of its various categories were selected through a panel of judges. The ceremony itself was presented in the form of a webcomic, allowing it to spoof televised award shows as well as exhibit sample portions of the awardees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/the-webcomic-list-awards-are-presented-in-a-webcomic/|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|title=The Webcomic List Awards are presented… in a webcomic|last=Alverson|first=Brigid|date=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/2010-webcomic-list-award-winners/|work=Comics Beat|title=2010 Webcomic List Award Winners|last=MacDonald|first=Heidi|author-link=Heidi MacDonald|date=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eisner Award===

{{Main|List_of_Eisner_Award_winners#Best_Digital_Comic/Webcomic}}

The Will Eisner Comic Industry Award, commonly shortened to the Eisner Award, is a prize given for creative achievement in American comic books. In 2003, Justine Shaw's ''[[Nowhere Girl]]'' received a nomination for an Eisner award in the "best new series" category, while Shaw was nominated for "talent deserving of wider recognition", making her the first webcomic artist to be nominated for an Eisner.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Matthew (April 18, 2003). "DC leads in nominations; Norman artist in race for award". ''[[The Daily Oklahoman]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;21D.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' noted in 2016 that the Eisner's conflation of "[[digital comic]]" and "webcomic" may cause independent works to be overshadowed by online services such as [[Marvel Unlimited]] and [[DC Comics]]' "Digital First".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/05/why-the-eisners-need-to-show-webcomics-some-love.html|work=[[Paste Magazine]]|title=Why The Eisners Need to Show Webcomics Some Love|last=Rosberg|first=Caitlin|date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was split into "Best Digital Comic" and "Best Webcomic".

===Harvey Awards===

{{Main|List of Harvey Award winners#Best Online Comics Work}}

The Harvey Awards, named for writer-artist [[Harvey Kurtzman]] (1924-1993) and coordinated by the publisher [[Fantagraphics]], are given for achievement in comic books. The Harveys were created as part of a successor to the [[Kirby Awards]] which were discontinued after 1987.

Following the revamp in 2018 after the awards moved to [[New York Comic Con]], the "Best Online Comics Work" has been renamed "Digital Book of the Year".&lt;ref name="comicsbeat"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McDonald |first1=Heidi |title=Details of the 2018 Harvey Awards announced and it’s a big change |url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/details-of-the-2018-harvey-awards-announced-and-its-a-big-change/ |website=The Beat |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignatz Awards===

{{Main|Ignatz Award#Outstanding Online Comic}}

The Ignatz Awards are intended to recognize outstanding achievements in comics and cartooning by small press creators or creator-owned projects published by larger publishers. They have been awarded each year since 1997, but skipped a year in 2001 due to the show's cancellation after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Recipients of the award are determined by the votes of the attendees of the annual [[Small Press Expo]].

'''Metro TV''' is [[Indonesia]]'s first 24-hour [[news channel]], based in [[West Jakarta]]. The station was established on 25 November 2000 and now has over 53 [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] sites all over the country. It is owned by [[Surya Paloh]] who also owns the ''[[Media Indonesia]]'' daily. These two, along with other newspapers distributed in different parts of Indonesia, are part of the [[Media Group]].

It is the only TV station to offer [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] news and no sinetron ([[soap opera]]) programs in Indonesia, although recently the station has also begun to broadcast entertainment and multicultural programs such as the tech show "e-Lifestyle," the [[satire|satirical]] news and current affairs show "Republik Mimpi" (The Dream Republic), musical programming such as Musik + and Idenesia, and other special or regional programming.

==History==
MetroTV was established on 25 October 1999. initially planned test of transmission born name as MetroTV ('''Media Televisi Indonesia''' operated by [[Media Indonesia]] by President Main General Manager Director's father [[Surya Paloh]].

MetroTV was launched on 25 November 2000 by [[Putra Nababan]] as first [[news anchor]]ed and first [[newscast]]. MetroTV was the first [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] television company to have been officially inaugurated by the [[President of Indonesia]] himself.

==Concept==
Metro TV has a different concept than the other stations in [[Indonesia]]. It broadcasts 24 hours a day, with programmes focused on news around the world.

Metro TV broadcast three new [[English language]] programmes, World News, Indonesia Now, and Talk Indonesia. It also had [[Chinese language]] programmes such as ''Metro Xin Wen'', as well as IT, documentary, and culinary programmes. It has a motivation programme, ''[[Mario Teguh Golden Ways]]''. It also shows business programming, including "Economic Challenges" and ''[[Bisnis Hari Ini]]'' (''Business Today'').

Metro TV also has an [[informercial]] block, usually residential, but sometimes, any price of product and technology. The infomercial block usually airs on networks and stations during morning on weekends. The block has no commercial breaks. This channel is owned by [[Media Group]], which also owns ''[[Media Indonesia]]'' and ''[[Lampung Post]]'' newspapers.

However, Metro TV was not the first [[Indonesia]]n channel to be broadcast in English. [[RCTI]] became the first Indonesian channel to broadcast in English when showing ''[[Indonesia Today]]'' on 1 November 1996. This English news programme was made with a specific target audience in mind: foreigners who wanted to know the latest news and more information about Indonesia. It ended in 2001. Metro TV later broadcast ''[[Metro This Morning]]'' and ''[[News Flash]]''. ''Metro This Morning'' ended in March 2007. Metro TV was the only news channel in Indonesia until 2008, when [[Lativi]] was re-branded as [[TV ONE (Indonesia)|TV ONE]] by dropping all of sitcoms as well as soap operas, focusing on news and sports programmes.

==Gameplay==
[[File:minigore01.png|left|thumb|230px|alt=In-game screenshot|In-game image showing the dual-stick controls.]]
Players control the main character, John Gore (voiced by [[Arin Hanson]]), in a world called "Hardland." Gameplay revolves around Gore shooting creatures called "furries", who are trying to kill him. A [[clover]]leaf will generate randomly after a certain number of furry kills. Collecting three clovers will turn Gore into a minotaur, granting him invincibility and allowing him to stomp on enemies. This lasts for about 15–20 seconds. The player has three lives and accumulates points for each furry killed. There are also [[OpenFeint]] and [[Game Center]] leaderboards and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2009/06/06/exclusive-minigore-gameplay-video-john-gore-kicks-some-furry-ass/|title=Exclusive 'Minigore' Gameplay Video: John Gore Kicks Some Furry Ass|publisher=TouchArcade|first=Blake |last=Patterson |date=June 6, 2009|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Martin of 148Apps scored the game 4 out of 5, criticizing the lack of depth in the initial release, but praising the well executed core gameplay; "It's really fun, no learning curve whatsoever, it looks good, and it will definitely appeal to the iPhone's [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|A.D.D.]] audience."&lt;ref name=148Apps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.148apps.com/reviews/minigore/|title=Minigore Review|first=Richard |last=Martin|publisher=148Apps|date=August 4, 2009|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; AppSpy's Dave Flodine also scored it 4 out of 5, again finding the game had a lack of depth but was solid in and of itself; "The presentation is of a high quality, but the gameplay never really ramps up enough to be overwhelming."&lt;ref name="AppSpy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appspy.com/review/3226/minigore|title=Minigore Review|first=Dave |last=Flodine|publisher=AppSpy|date=July 31, 2009|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Chris Reed scored it 8 out of 10, making similar observations as 148Appps and AppSpy; "''Minigore'' doesn't have a ton of depth, but the core game provides stylish, fun shooting action that leaves you wanting more."&lt;ref name="GSpot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/minigore/reviews/minigore-review-6268068/|title=Minigore Review|first=Chris|last=Reed|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=July 2, 2010|accessdate=July 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003044613/http://uk.gamespot.com/minigore/reviews/minigore-review-6268068/|archivedate=October 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pocket Gamer]]'s Jon Jordan scored it 7 out of 10, praising its "great graphics and audio," but criticizing the lack of content, which he assumed "will arrive in future updates."&lt;ref name="Pocket"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Minigore/review.asp?c=14734|title=Minigore Review|first=Jon |last=Jordan|publisher=[[Pocket Gamer]]|date=August 3, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s Matt Casamassina also scored it 7 out of 10. He praised the artwork and in-game humor, but called the game "a very straightforward shooter without any genuine surprises [...] The experience is so straightforward that you will inevitably be left wanting more unless the simple promise of the highest score is enough to keep you shooting the same enemies on the same stage endlessly." As with Jon Jordan, he expressed the hope that future updates would add some depth to the game.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2009/07/30/minigore-review|title=Minigore Review|first=Matt|last= Casamassina|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=July 30, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mobile cinema''' is a [[movie theater|cinema]] on wheels.

An example is the [[Screen machine]] Mobile Cinema of [[Scotland]], which provides conventional up-to-date 35mm screenings of recent movies, with full digital surround sound, air conditioning, comfortable raked seating, and full disabled access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/the-screen-machine-a-reel-adventure-1-1034334 |title=The Screen Machine: A reel adventure |work=[[The Scotsman]] |publisher=[[Johnston Press]] |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French have their own Cinemobile system. 
There are also smaller mobile cinemas employing digital projection technology. Examples of these include the Sol Cinema in the UK and  Gorilla Cinema, which was established in 2000, and uses solar power and batteries to enable projection in even more remote locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorillacinema.co.uk/cinema Gorilla Cinema Mobile Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; It often takes place outdoors at night or housed in marquees and other temporary structures. More recently, the mobile cinema world has seen the relaunch of a recently restored 1967 custom built mobile cinema unit (see 'History' below).

Since 2006, Italy's [[Cortomobile]], a mobile cinema seating two viewers, has projected short films and animations in cinema festivals&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=284 Jessica Goethals]; "Film in motion finds its way through Florence." ''The Florentine.net'', November 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the protagonist of the [[First Car Film Festival]] (Florence) in March 2009.

Since 1995, Cinetransformer International of Miami, Florida has circulated a fleet of mobile cinema units for use in event and experiential marketing. With a patented stadium style configuration of 91 seats, the Cinetransformer debuted as the world's first 3D mobile cinema at Comic Con in 2010 with the release of Jackass 3 in 3D. It was chosen again in 2011 to debut Final Destination 5 In 3D.

==History==
During the Russian Civil War between Communists and counter-revolutionaries, the early cinema pioneer, [[Dziga Vertov]], helped establish and run a film-car on [[Mikhail Kalinin's]] [[agit-train]]. He had equipment to shoot, develop, edit, and project film. The trains went to battlefronts on agitation-propaganda missions intended primarily to bolster the morale of the troops. They were also intended to stir up revolutionary fervor of the masses.

[[File:Ministry of Technology side.jpg|thumb|Ministry of Technology 1967]]
[[File:Vintage Mobile Cinema 2010.jpg|thumb|Vintage Mobile Cinema 2010]]
In the late 1960s, [[Tony Benn]], working under [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government, commissioned seven custom built mobile cinema units for the [[Minister of Technology|Ministry of Technology]] campaign to 'raise standards' and promote British industry. The project was short-lived and the units were sold off at government auction in 1974, most are thought to have been long since decommissioned and disappeared. However, one has survived via purchase by [[Sir William McAlpine]] to tour with the [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|Flying Scotsman]] locomotive he rescued from America, and consequently donated to the Transport Trust in 1975 where it was in preservation for 15 years. It has since been through several private owners and following a full restoration is now in operation as Vintage Mobile Cinema, based in the South West of England. In May 2015, the only remaining Vintage Mobile Cinema was sold and will be moving to its new home on the Hertfordshire/Buckinghamshire border.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vintagemobilecinema.co.uk Vintage Mobile Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile cinema was very popular during the colonial periods in Africa when Land Rovers were used as movie vans to transport a white linen screen, usually mounted on the Land Rover, a portable generator, a 16mm projector and mounted loudspeakers. In this way rural areas received propaganda and educational films, usually shown in the evenings during dark hours.

==Worldwide examples==

===Sol Cinema===
The Sol Cinema is based in the UK and seats 8 people, leading it to be billed as the World's smallest solar powered cinema in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/kent/hi/things_to_do/newsid_8940000/8940605.stm |title=Thanet films screened in world's smallest solar cinema |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses an LED projector showing short films in cinematic surroundings complete with usherettes; batteries to store the energy from the Sun to power the cinema. Their photovoltaic panels harness the sunlight, even as the films are being shown so they never run out of power. The Sol Cinema won a Digital Hero award for best use of sustainable technology in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesolcinema.org/reviews/the-mirror-sol-cinema-wins-digital-hero-awards Digital Hero awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Total Film magazine listed the Sol Cinema at number 26th in the 'Best Movie Cinemas in the World'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesolcinema.org/reviews/sol-cinema-in-total-film-magazine Total Film magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sol Cinema is booked to perform at Glastonbury Festival each year. It also tours all over the UK and Ireland.

===The Irish travelling Picture show ===

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

In Ireland, mobile cinemas operated from the 1920s to the mid-1960s. A portable wooden structure was erected, with seating for up to 250 people. The building had wooden sides and a canvas roof, approximately 40&amp;nbsp;ft. by 24&amp;nbsp;ft. The 35mm projector was housed in a caravan at one end of the building. These shows travelled winter and summer in all sorts of weather; at times gales forced them to remove the canvas roof of the cinema sometimes at night when the winds made it hard to do so. There were up to 20 families touring Ireland, mainly in isolated areas where the nearest permanent cinema was miles away. These mobile cinemas stayed up to 3 weeks in a village before moving to another area. The families lived in caravans had their own generators and a stock of films with them. During the war, transport became difficult as fuel for motor vehicles was in short supply. Some cinemas settled down for the duration of the war, whilst others reverted to horses to move their equipment from village to village and saved their fuel to run the generators. Even then they had to buy extra fuel on the black market at up to 30 shillings a gallon. The children of the showmen went to the local national schools for the duration of their stay; some went to 16 - 18 schools a year. Admission fees were around 1 shilling and 6 pence to 2 shillings for adults around the time when they ceased to tour in the 1960s. The arrival of TV ended these mobile cinemas however they will be remembered for bringing cinema to people in isolated areas some who had never seen talking movies. Most of the films shown were about 8 years old and had been bought by the show people who some had up to 5 weeks stock in hand showing for 2 hours a night , even though the showman owned the films they did not have the permission to show them to the public without paying excise duty each time they were shown needless to say they did not so every now and then along would come an excise officer and seize a film  or at least just the Title of a film

Most of the families changed to amusement shows, some operated their own circus, others went the way of stage shows some settled down to live in towns and villages. Most are still represented in show business by way of children and grandchildren others have moved to other countries. The names of some of these families are well remembered: The Lyons family, Mullins, Cullens, McCormacs, Courtneys, Lynns, McFaddens, Barrets, Corvinos, Roses, Gazetts, Bradleys, and many more; the names of some have nearly been forgotten by all but the oldest. In 1949, one of these families, Brian Lyons, was featured in the ''Times Pictorial'' in a full front page of images of their show and also a large article on other pages. The photos were all taken in Rosscarbery West Cork and contained some shots of locals sitting in the cinema. Over the years, a number of these mobile cinemas went up in flames due mainly to the type of film that was in use which was made up of a nitro solution. Luckily, no one was ever hurt though the buildings were destroyed in most cases. Most of those that suffered this fate were back on the road before long with help from other showmen. Today the name of McCormack, Mullins, McFadden, and Courtney are some of the names that still follow the roads to bring entertainment to the people of Ireland both in the city and remote country areas.

===Australia===
Since 1999, Road Movie has been involved with unique cinematic events using mobile cinemas throughout South Australia, both in the city and country locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadmovie.com.au Road Movie Mobile Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mongolian Radio Sport's Federation''' ('''MRSF''') (in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], '''Монголын Радио Спортын Холбоо''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Mongolia]].  Early activities of the organization focused on [[radiosport]], and the MRSF was active in promoting [[Amateur Radio Direction Finding]] competitions throughout the country. MRSF supports local competitions in [[Amateur Radio Direction Finding]] as well as a national team that travels to regional and world championship events.  Although the MRSF has broadened its scope and now supports many kinds of radio activities, the organization's name continues to reflect this early heritage.  MRSF represents the interests of Mongolian amateur radio operators before Mongolian and international telecommunications regulatory authorities.&lt;ref name="mrsf"&gt;Mongolian Radio Sport Federation (2008).

'''Old Chicago''' was a combination [[shopping mall]] and indoor [[amusement park]] that existed in the [[Chicago]] [[suburb]] of [[Bolingbrook, Illinois]], from 1975 until 1980. It was billed as "The world's first indoor amusement park", and it was intended to draw visitors all year round, rain or shine. It opened to great fanfare and over 15,000 visitors on June 17, 1975, with an enormous building that housed major rides, such as two [[roller coaster]]s and a [[Ferris wheel]], as well as a turn-of-the-century themed shopping mall. However, only six months after opening, the complex ran into financial troubles due to construction cost overruns. The opening of a competing amusement park in the same general region (known today as [[Six Flags Great America]]) hurt attendance, and the lack of large anchor stores failed to draw enough local and repeat shoppers. Despite management changes, the center continued to lose money. By 1978, the mall began closing on Mondays and Tuesdays and in early 1980 the entire amusement park shut down and the rides were sold, only five years after opening. Efforts to find alternative uses for the huge building failed, and the structure was demolished in the spring of 1986.

Its address was 555 S. Bolingbrook Drive, Bolingbrook, Illinois 60439.

==History==
Designer Robert Brindle conceived of the idea behind Old Chicago after a visit to [[Knott's Berry Farm]] amusement park in [[Buena Park, California]], and wished to put an entire park - complete with [[roller coaster]], [[Ferris wheel]], and [[log flume]]s - indoors so that it could be open year-round. Brindle's concept featured an early 20th-century decor inside, with the mall featuring smaller local shops and boutiques rather than the traditional [[department store]]s that anchored most malls.

Over two years in the making, Old Chicago was opened to the public on June 17, 1975, in a [[grand opening]] party that attracted over 10,000 invited guests, causing massive traffic jams. The Old Chicago TV commercial featured an 18-year-old Michelle Mauthe tap-dancing on top of the dome during high winds, while a cameraman filmed from inside a helicopter.

Construction on the mall was not yet complete and much of the electrical wiring was still exposed. When local officials saw the situation, the mall owners were told that they would not be able to open June 26 as scheduled. Construction crews worked around the clock to complete the project, and after a last-minute inspection, the mall opened on time to another crowd of over 15,000. In the mall's first months of operation, it received over 50,000 visitors each weekend.

Soon, problems began developing with the mall's hurried construction. As early as July 1975, a malfunction in the mall's sprinkler system caused a six-hour shutdown of the mall. Later that year, a small fire in a trash compactor forced an evacuation of the mall. In November, [[acrobatics|acrobat]] Jimmy Troy fell to his death from the [[trapeze]] during a [[circus]] at the mall.

Only six months after opening, the mall was on the verge of [[bankruptcy]] due to millions of dollars in overruns in construction. Brindle was removed as general manager, and [[Illinois Central Railroad]] (an investor in the project) installed Clyde Farman.

The outdoor [[Six Flags Great America]] (then known as Marriott's Great America) theme park opened in 1976, drawing visitors away from Old Chicago. Unusual stores, boutiques, and a lack of recognizable anchor stores proved to be another of Old Chicago's undoings; the mall was not very successful in attracting ''local'' residents week after week because of a lack of stores they wanted to shop in. Late in 1976, as attendance declined, stores in the mall began closing down.

==Closing==
Illinois Central took full control of the mall's logistics in early 1977, rescheduling the hours of operation and spending over $8 million adding new attractions. A series of management changes occurred, but the shops continued closing one by one.

By 1978, Old Chicago began closing on Mondays and Tuesdays. More fires struck during 1979:  The Old Chicago [[Tobacco]] Company caught fire when a tobacco dryer malfunctioned. There were no sprinklers in the area where the fire started. A [[Fourth of July]] [[fireworks display]] also ignited prematurely, causing minor injuries to two people.

Finally, in March 1980, the entire amusement park shut down and the rides were sold. The last remaining stores left soon afterward, as management pitched the idea of recreating the mall as a discount outlet. The plan didn't attract investors and the mall closed in August 1981. A group of investors purchased the enormous building shortly afterward with plans to convert it into a [[casino]]. The village of Bolingbrook nixed the idea and the building was put up for [[auction]] in 1982. Illinois Central expressed their desire to demolish the structure, but the village, in the hopes of finding a buyer, changed its zoning laws to prevent the destruction. While Bolingbrook sought a new buyer for the building, structural damage from roof leaks began damaging the vacant building. In addition, [[Vandalism|vandals]] repeatedly broke into the building, causing more damage.

In 1985, the building was finally sold to investment banker C.L. Carr, who initially pledged to keep the building open as an entertainment complex, but later attempted to sell parcels of the land beneath it. Last-ditch efforts to salvage the enormous building - as an international trade center for the [[People's Republic of China]], as a venue for the 1992 [[World's Fair]], even as a [[Major League Baseball]] [[stadium]] for the [[Chicago White Sox]] - would all fail and the building was demolished in the spring of 1986.

==Old Chicago's legacy==
Director [[Brian De Palma]] filmed scenes from his [[1978 in film|1978]] supernatural thriller film ''[[The Fury (1978 film)|The Fury]]'' at Old Chicago.

The concept of an amusement park inside a mall emerged years later at two famous malls&amp;mdash;[[West Edmonton Mall]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada ([[Galaxyland]]), and [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] ([[Nickelodeon Universe]]), as well as [[Adventuredome]] at [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]] in Las Vegas, and [[Ferrari World]] in [[Abu Dhabi]]. The Mall of America's amusement park was originally operated by the company who owned Knott's Berry Farm.

The now-expanded street where Old Chicago once stood is still named for the mall. Arena Auto Auction's address is 200 Old Chicago Drive.

The Chicago Loop roller coaster that stood inside the mall's amusement park is now called the ''[[Canobie Corkscrew]]'' and operates at [[Canobie Lake Park]]. It was among the first four in the world to turn riders upside down twice, along with Corkscrew at Knott's Berry Farm, Wabash Cannonball at Opryland USA, and Corkscrew at Magic Harbor, all four opening in 1975.

Lotz]]. It denotes the period that followed an earlier [[Big Three television networks|network era]], television's first institutional phase that started in the 1950s and ran through to the mid-1980s, and television's later [[multi-channel transition]].&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) "The Television Will Be Revolutionized". New York, NY: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It describes a period that saw the deterioration of the dominance of the [[Big Three television networks]]: [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]], and follows the creation of a wide variety of [[cable television]] channels that catered specifically to niche groups. The post-network era saw the development of technologies that deliver a wider diversity of programming choice, less constraints on a consumers choice of medium, decentralization of the location of their viewing, and freedom of choice over time of their viewing. For [[Amanda D. Lotz]], the post-network era has been defined by five C's: "choice, control, convenience, customization, and community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=The Television Will be Revolutionized|date=2007|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814752203|pages=241–256|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|chapter=Conclusion: Still Watching Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; These five concepts, which have defined the post-network era, all relate to the ways in which viewers have greater access to a wider array of content which can be consumed on their own terms. The concept comes from the field of [[Television studies]], and has been used by various academics to discuss numerous different topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=edited by Jonathan|last2=Jones,|first2=Jeffrey P.|last3=Thompson|first3=Ethan|title=Satire TV : politics and comedy in the post-network era|date=2009|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|isbn=0814731988|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartels|first1=Larry M.|last2=Rahn|first2=Wendy M.|title=Political attitudes in the post-network era|date=2000|publisher=Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association|location=Washington|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~bartels/postnet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=edited by Amanda D.|title=Beyond prime time : television programming in the post-network era|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415996694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been endorsed by media scholar [[Henry Jenkins]], co-director of the Media Industries Project Michael Curtin, and American Studies, and Film and Media professor [[Jason Mittell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Television will be revolutionized.|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9781479865253|edition=Second edition.|url=http://nyupress.org/books/9781479865253/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=The Television Will be Revolutionized|date=2007|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814752203|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|url=http://nyupress.org/books/9780814752203/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Developments==
Vast modifications were made to the way in which the television industry was operated following the earlier [[Big Three television networks|Network Era]] and a period of [[Multi-channel transition]]. The major factor governing the transition to a post-network paradigm was a computational and generational shift in the audience. These emergent developments in the post-network era have led television audiences to split attention between many different channels, devices, and forms of media as [[Television program]]s are no longer confined to the [[Television set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Television will be revolutionized.|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1479865253|pages=1–20|edition=Second edition.|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeshifting Technologies===
The development of technologies with timeshifting abilities such as the [[VCR]] and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] rendered broadcast times irrelevant, and also shifted discussion away from simple differentiation between cable and free-to-air television.&lt;ref name="revolutionizing131"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Television will be revolutionized.|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1479865253|pages=131–166|edition=Second edition.|chapter=Revolutionizing Distribution: Breaking Open the Network Bottleneck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although much of this technological change coincided with the [[Multi-channel transition]], its effect can be felt well into the post-network era, creating the groundwork for future technological developments including [[Hulu]] and [[Netflix|Netflix On-Demand]].

===Digitization of Content===
The increasing [[digitization]] of content has presented viewers with an increasing level of access to high quality televisual content on [[DVD]] and online.&lt;ref name="revolutionizing131"/&gt; This has fostered the development of new portable methods of delivering media that help to bring television to spaces outside of the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Television will be revolutionized.|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1479865253|pages=53–94|edition=Second edition.|chapter=Television Outside the Box: The Technological Revolution of Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, multiple new [[revenue stream]]s have emerged as television networks are able to sell shows through online storefronts like [[iTunes]]. The DVD market, too, has become a financially viable place to extract additional profits from television shows post-broadcast.&lt;ref name="revolutionizing131"/&gt; In the case of [[Family Guy]], this even led to the show's renewal in 2005 due to strong DVD sales, four years after its initial cancellation.

===Changes to Advertising===
In order to reap the benefits of advertising in an era where television programs are no longer necessarily watched first-run on network television station, advertisers have innovated, using [[product placement]] in more popular television shows and producing their own [[branded entertainment]], a form of media in which the content and advertising messages are inextricably linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Television will be revolutionized.|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1479865253|pages=167–206|edition=Second edition.|chapter=The New Economics of Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from traditional advertising practices that only saw the broadcast of a number of 30-second adverts in chunks during pre-planned ad-breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Television will be revolutionized.|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9781479865253|pages=21–52|edition=Second edition.|chapter=Understanding Television at the Start of the Post-Network Era}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web 2.0 Technologies===
A major aspect of the post-network era has been the development of new technologies that change the ways in which television is consumed and distributed. These technological changes have come about with the invention of the [[tablet computer|tablet]], the use of [[smart phones]], web-enabled devices connected to the television like many modern gaming consoles saw the subsequent development and wide uptake of [[Video on demand|online VOD]] services like [[Netflix]] and [[Hulu]], as well as specific, network-branded streaming services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Television will be revolutionized.|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1479865253|pages=53–94|edition=Second edition.|chapter=The Technological Revolution of Television: Television Outside the Box}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in technology created a new-found level of convenience and mobility for viewers, as television trends towards a situation in which you can watch "whatever show you want, whenever you want, on whatever screen you want".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=The television will be revolutionized|date=2007|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814752197|page=1|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|url=http://www.nyupress.org/webchapters/9780814752197_Lotz_intro2.pdf|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amanda D. Lotz]] argues that technologies like [[Netflix]] and [[NBCUniversal Television Group|NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[Disney–ABC Television Group|ABC]]'s own [[Hulu]] have clearly impacted the way in which we access television, allowing us to catch up on television shows whenever we please rather than adhering to a first run schedule. [[Hulu]] also allows for interaction between fans of television shows while they are watching episodes through the site's inbuilt comment feature, creating the sort of immersive media experience and fostering a [[participatory culture]] of affiliation, two major interests of [[Henry Jenkins]]. This technological change also brings a change in theatricality, as television producers respond to the ways in which their audiences watch television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Television will be revolutionized.|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1479865253|pages=95–130|edition=Second edition.|chapter=Making Television: Changes in the Practices of Creating Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content in the Post-Network Era===
One of the major developments in the post-network era has been the decision by a fragmented cable network system to target specific groups with their programming rather than a homogeneous mass audience. As consumers began to watch television programs on tablets and cell phones in their own time, niche channels emerged from the expansion of cable television networks, advertising became integrated into television shows rather than ad-breaks, and people were no longer tied to a 24-week first-run broadcast cycle. Producers responded to changing consumption patterns by changing the ways in which they produce television content, which resulted in the creation of shows like [[Sex and the City]], [[Breaking Bad]] and [[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]] (which aired on [[Television network|network television]]) with features that were unrepresentative of those developed in the Network era and during the [[Multi-channel transition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Television will be revolutionized.|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1479865253|pages=233–262|edition=Second edition.|chapter=Television Storytelling Possibilities at the Beginning of the Post-Network Era: Five Cases}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lotz|first1=Amanda D.|title=Cable guys : television and masculinities in the twenty-first century|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9781479800483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===German colonial period===
Prostitution grew with the [[Togoland|colonisation by Germany]]. Initially occurring along the coast, especially Lomé, and then spreading inland as colonisation advanced into the interior.&lt;ref name="walther"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walther|first1=Daniel J.|title=Sex and Control: Venereal Disease, Colonial Physicians, and Indigenous Agency in German Colonialism, 1884-1914|date=15 March 2015|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1782385912}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lomé, [[Aného]] and [[Atakpamé]], African prostitutes serving only European males were required to live in designated areas known as ''kasernierung''. A brothel was built in Lomé in 1909 to replace the ''kasernierung'' area. Initially it housed 40 prostitutes.&lt;ref name="walther" /&gt;

===French colonial period===
Following the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]] and subsequent French control of the country, prostitution continued to flourish. The large number of single, or married men away from home, colonists and troops created the demand for prostitution.&lt;ref name="ency"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ditmore|first1=Melissa Hope|title=Encyclopedia of prostitution and sex work|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0313329685}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other French colonies, military brothels ([[Bordel militaire de campagne]]) were set up around where troops were stationed.&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt;

== Gender inequality ==
Experts convened by the [[United Nations]] found that typically "all the responsibility" of the problems that are faced in the sex industry are usually placed on women. In response to the issues noted by this committee, the government of Togo has declared that July 31 is Women's Day throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/wom1529.doc.htm|title=Women's Anti-Discrimination Committee Takes up Report of Togo; Experts Say Traditional Practices, Sexual Stereotypes Remain Challenges {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this may have been what encouraged them to enact on some of their new policies, such as actively enforcing laws that protect children against the sex trade. This committee noted that sex was a two person act and that the men who are typically the demand market for sex workers need to be examined too and held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Sexual health==
HIV&lt;ref name="unaids" /&gt; and [[syphilis]]&lt;ref name="syphilis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halatoko|first1=Wemboo Afiwa|last2=Landoh|first2=Dadja Essoya|last3=Saka|first3=Bayaki|last4=Akolly|first4=Koffi|last5=Layibo|first5=Yao|last6=Yaya|first6=Issifou|last7=Gbetoglo|first7=Dodji|last8=Banla|first8=Abiba Kere|last9=Pitché|first9=Palokinam|title=Prevalence of syphilis among female sex workers and their clients in Togo in 2011|pmc=5320666|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=17|issue=1|pages=219|doi=10.1186/s12889-017-4134-x|pmid=28222772|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are problems in the country. Sex workers and their clients are high risk groups, especially as [[condom]] use is inconsistent,&lt;ref name="hiv11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitché|first1=Palokinam|last2=Gbetoglo|first2=Komi|last3=Saka|first3=Bayaki|last4=Akakpo|first4=Séfako|last5=Landoh|first5=Dadja Essoya|last6=d'Alméida|first6=Stéphane|last7=Banla|first7=Abiba Kere|last8=Sodji|first8=Dométo|last9=Deku|first9=Kodzo|title=HIV prevalence and behavioral studies in female sex workers in Togo: a decline in the prevalence between 2005 and 2011|pmc=3809967|journal=The Pan African Medical Journal|volume=15|pages=62|doi=10.11604/pamj.2013.15.62.2457|pmid=24198868|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are 11 different prevention programmes distributing condoms throughout the country.&lt;ref name="unaids" /&gt;

HIV prevalence has dropped amongst sex workers: 29.5% in 2005,&lt;ref name="hiv11" /&gt; 13.1% in 2011&lt;ref name="hiv11" /&gt; and 11.7% in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (National adult HIV prevalence was 2.1% in 2016.)&lt;ref name="unaids" /&gt; However, prevalence rates vary across the country; although the average amongst sex workers was 13.1% in 2011, it ranged from 19.5% in Lomé to 7.8% in the [[Savanes Region, Togo|Savanes]] and [[Kara Region|Kara]] Regions.&lt;ref name="hiv11" /&gt;

A study in 2008 noted that as many as 60% of long truck drivers in Togo that were having sexual relations with sex workers were not using a condom during sex. Additionally, around 50% of the truck drivers interviewed stated that they had not been tested for HIV, which is a concerning statistic considering the prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases in Togo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaya|first=Issifou|last2=Landoh|first2=Dadja Essoya|last3=Saka|first3=Bayaki|last4=Vignikin|first4=Kokou|last5=Aboubakari|first5=Abdoul-Samadou|last6=N’dri|first6=Kouamé Mathias|last7=Gbetoglo|first7=Kodjo Dodji|last8=Edorh|first8=Atavi-Mensah|last9=Ahlegnan|first9=Komla|date=2016-04-12|title=Consistent Condom Use during Casual Sex among Long-Truck Drivers in Togo|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0153264|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0153264|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4829217|pmid=27071059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2011 found 2.2% of sex workers were infected with syphilis, and 2.3% of clients. This also varied by region with those in Lomé having the highest rate of infection at 3.1%.&lt;ref name="syphilis" /&gt;

Homosexual men, women, and couples do not receive the same access to the ability to be diagnosed and treated for a potential case of HIV/AIDS that heterosexual couples receive.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

==Human rights concerns==
In the 2000s concerns were raised internationally about child prostitution in Togo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=TOGO: Child prostitution goes unchecked in Togo |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/49619/togo-child-prostitution-goes-unchecked-in-togo |newspaper=IRIN Africa |location=Lomé |date=23 April 2004 |access-date=14 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Togolese law explicitly prohibits the [[sexual exploitation]] of children and child prostitution, although it is not effectively enforced.&lt;ref name=HRR&gt;{{cite news|title= 2010 Human Rights Report: Togo |work=[[US State Department]]|date=|url= https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154374.htm|accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGO organizations such as UNICEF have intervened to try to get child prostitutes off  the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/wcaro/2009_2839.html |title=Togo - Nadia's story: from prostitution to rehabilitation |last1=Martin-Achard| first1= Nicolas |last2=Bonnaud |first2= Hadrien |date=20 November 2008 |website=www.unicef.org |publisher=UNICEF |access-date=14 September 2015 |quote=In line with the objectives for 2012 and in partnership with the Government of Togo, UNICEF provides a minimum package of services to vulnerable children.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also reports of women being trafficked for prostitution.&lt;ref name=HRR/&gt;

Another issue in Togo is that the laws do not protect well against child trafficking, and these children are usually sold in to the sex industry. Togo does not enforce the law that prevents selling children into sex slavery, and there is also no statutory rape law in Togo. Since 2007 the Togolese government has done a better job of raising awareness for people in Togo about the issues of [[child sexual exploitation]] and child prostitution. They released a code in 2007 which protected the rights of children in certain areas of life, and this code led to the eventual release of hundreds of child sex workers throughout the country of Togo, after they improved their efforts to enforce this code.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Once these children were rounded up, they were properly taken care of, and tested for a variety of medical issues, mostly of mostly sexual health aspects.

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Togo}}
Togo is a source, transit and, to a lesser extent, destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. The western border of the Plateau region, which provides easy access to major roads leading to [[Lomé|Lome]], and [[Accra]], Ghana, was a primary source for trafficking victims during the reporting period. Most Togolese victims are children exploited within the country. Traffickers bring children from rural areas to Lome, where they are exploited in child sex trafficking. Girls from Ghana are exploited in sex trafficking in Togo. From September to April, many Togolese adults and children migrate in search of economic opportunities to [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Niger]], and [[Mali]], where many are subjected to sex trafficking. Togolese women have been fraudulently recruited for employment in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Lebanon]], the [[United States]], and [[Europe]], where they are subjected to [[forced prostitution]].&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Togo 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271299.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=15 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Togo as a "[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]" country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Togo 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282766.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in a raid in the capital city Lome, over 200 people were arrested in an operation designed to reduce child prostitution. The government had previously announced on the radio its commitment to address the issue. The government's minister for child protection, Agneley Christine Mensah, said that the children who had been arrested would be taken into care and helped "to acquire new trades and skills so that they can be integrated into normal social and economic life".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4737563.stm|title=Togo child prostitute crackdown|date=2 August 2005|access-date=13 August 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10263">A '''rating site''' (less commonly, a ''rate-me site'') is a [[website]] designed for [[User (computing)|users]] to vote on or rate people, [[Web content|content]], or other things.  Rating sites are typically organized around attributes such as physical appearance, body parts, voice, personality, etc.  They may also be devoted to the subjects' occupational ability, for example teachers, professors, lawyers, doctors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pfeiffer, Sacha.|url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2006/09/20/ratings_sites_flourish_behind_a_veil_of_anonymity/|title=Rating Sites Flourish Behind a veil of Anonymity|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
===Features===
Rating sites typically show a series of images (or other content) in random fashion, or chosen by computer algorithm, rather than allowing users to choose.  They then ask users for a rating or assessment, which is generally done quickly and without great deliberation.  Users score items on a scale of 1 to 10, yes or no.  Others, such as BabeVsBabe.com, ask users to [[pairwise comparison|choose between two pictures]].  Typically, the site gives instant feedback in terms of the item's running score, or the percentage of other users who agree with the assessment. They sometimes offer aggregate statistics or "best" and "worst" lists.  Most allow users to submit their own image, sample, or other relevant content for others to rate.  Some require the submission as a condition of membership.

Rating sites usually provide some features of [[social network service]]s and [[online communities]] such as [[Internet forum|discussion forums]] [[Instant messaging|messaging]], and [[Personal message|private messaging]].  Some function as a form of [[dating service]], in that for a fee they allow users to contact other users.  Many social networks and other sites include rating features.  For example, [[MySpace]] and TradePics have optional "rank" features for users to be rated by other users.

===Subject matter===
One category of rating sites, such as [[Hot or Not]] or HotFlation, is devoted to rating contributors' physical attractiveness.  Other looks-based rating sites include RateMyFace.com (an early site, launched in the Summer of 1999) and NameMyVote, which asks users to guess a person's political party based on their looks. Some sites are devoted to rating the appearance of pets (e.g. kittenwar.com, petsinclothes.com, and meormypet.com).  Another class allows users to rate short video or music clips.  One variant, a "[[Darwinian poetry]]" site, allows users to compare two samples of entirely computer-generated poetry using a [[Condorcet method]].  Successful poems "mate" to produce poems of ever-increasing appeal.  Yet others are devoted to disliked men (DoucheBagAlert), [[bowel movement]]s (ratemypoo.com), unsigned bands (RateBandsOnline.com), politics (RateMyTory.Com), nightclubs, business professionals, clothes, cars, and many other subjects.

When rating sites are dedicated to rating products (epinions.com), brands (brandmojo.org), services, or businesses rather than to rating people (i-rate.me), and are used for more serious or well thought-out ratings, they tend to be called [[review site]]s, although the distinction is not exact.

== History ==
The popularity of rating people and their abilities on a scale, such as 1–10, traces back to at least the late 20th century, and the algorithms for aggregating quantitative rating scores far earlier than that.  The 1979 film ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' is an example of this.  The title derives from a rating system [[Dudley Moore]] uses to grade women based upon [[beauty]], with a 10 being the epitome of attractiveness.  The notion of a "perfect ten" came into common usage as a result of this film.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In the film, Moore rates [[Bo Derek]] an "11".

In 1990, one of the first computer-based photographic attractiveness rating studies was conducted.  During this year psychologists [[J. H. Langlois]] and [[L. A. Roggman]] examined whether facial attractiveness was linked to geometric averageness.  To test their hypothesis, they selected photographs of 192 male and female Caucasian faces; each of which was computer scanned and digitized.  They then made computer-processed composites of each image, as 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-face composites.  The individual and composite faces were then rated for attractiveness by 300 judges on a 5-point [[Likert scale]] (1 = very unattractive, 5 = very attractive).  The 32-composite face was the most visually attractive of all the faces.&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, J. H. &amp; Roggman, L. A. (1990). "Attractive faces are only average". ''Psychological Science'', 1, 115–121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent studies were done on a 10-point scale.

In 1992, ''[[Perfect 10 (magazine)|Perfect 10]]'' magazine and video programming was launched by Xui, the original executive editor of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine, to feature only women who would rank 10 for attractiveness.  [[Julie Kruis]], a swimsuit model, was the original [[spokesmodel]].  In 1996, Rasen created the first "''Perfect 10'' Model Search" at the [[Pure Platinum]] club near [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]].  His contests were broadcast on [[Network 1]], a domestic [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[satellite channel]].  Other unrelated "Perfect 10" contests became popular throughout the 1990s.

The first ratings sites started in 1999, with RateMyFace.com (created by Michael Hussey) and TeacherRatings.com (created by John Swapceinski, re-launched with Hussey and further developed by [[Patrick Nagle]] as [[RateMyProfessors]]).  The most popular of all time, Hot or Not, was launched in October 2000.  Hot or Not generated many spin-offs and imitators.  There are now hundreds of such sites, and even meta-sites that categorize them all. The rating site concept has also been expanded to include Twitter and Facebook accounts that provide ratings, such as the humorous Twitter account [[WeRateDogs]].

== Criticism ==
Rating sites have a social feedback effect; many high school principals and administrators, for example, have begun to regularly monitor the status of their teaching staff via student controlled "rating sites".&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kimberly Stauffer|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nb/woodlands/news/4511012.html | title= More area schools monitor online rating sites - CISD officials see benefits and pitfalls to Internet postings}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  Some looks-based sites have come under criticism for promoting vanity and self-consciousness.  Some claim they potentially expose users to [[sexual predator]]s.
Most rating sites suffer from similar [[self-selection bias]] since only highly motivated individuals devote their time to completing these rankings, and not a fair sampling of the population.  Additionally,  individuals can post multiple comments, thereby skewing the ranking.{{Original research inline|date=September 2007}}

* '''[[RateMyProfessors.com]]''': a "teacher rating site" originally launched as TeacherRatings.com and in May 1999 by John Swapceinski, a software engineer from [[Menlo Park, California]], that allows college and university students to anonymously assign ratings to professors of American, Canadian, British, Irish, New Zealand, and Australian institutions. The site contains more than six million ratings, for over 500,000 professors.
* '''[[RateMyTeachers]]''': a is a review site used to rate [[elementary school]], [[middle school]] and [[high school]] teachers' performance (and popularity) as a service to students, parents and the teachers themselves. Participants give numerical ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 in three different categories to their current or former teachers. Visitors can also leave an optional brief comment based on their experience with the teacher.  Comments and teacher entries are screened by a private moderation community. The site contains over twenty million reviews.

{{about|regular tunings of musical scales in general|alternative tunings of the guitar known as "regular"|Regular tuning}}

In the traditional theory of music, a '''regular temperament''' is an assignment of relative [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es to the notes of the [[chromatic scale]] (i.e. a ''[[musical tuning|tuning]]'' of this scale),&lt;ref&gt;The relative pitches assigned to this scale are naturally inherited by its subscales—the [[diatonic and chromatic#Diatonic scales|diatonic major]] scales and their [[relative minor]]s and its [[pentatonic scale#Major pentatonic scale|pentatonic subscales]], for instance. All regular temperaments other than [[Equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|12-tone equal temperament]] and its derivatives also naturally generate relative pitch assignments for extra notes which can be (and have been) used to create extensions of the chromatic scale to more than 12 notes.&lt;/ref&gt; in which every interval of a [[perfect fifth]]&lt;ref&gt;Premises of this definition are that octaves are untempered—that is, the frequencies of their end-points are in the ratio of 2 to 1—, that every octave is identically divided by notes selected from the same set of [[pitch class]]es and that a "perfect fifth" is the interval between the first and fifth [[scale degree]]s of a [[diatonic major scale]], however tuned. Equivalently, it is the interval formed by juxtaposing 4 [[diatonic semitone]]s and 3 [[chromatic semitone]]s,  or  the interval between the notes sounded by two keys separated by 6 others on a standard [[musical keyboard]], not necessarily tuned according to the now standard [[Equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|12-tone equal temperament]], and with the proviso that if the upper note is a flat then so is the lower, and if the lower note is a sharp then so is the upper.  The term "perfect" is used here solely to distinguish the interval referred to from [[augmented fifth|augmented]] and [[diminished fifth#Augmented fourth and diminished fifth|diminished fifth]]s (such as the interval between B and F), and does not imply that the fifth has to be [[Just intonation|just]].&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Musical temperament|tempered]]&lt;ref&gt;That is, has had the frequency ratio between its end-points adjusted to be close to, but not exactly equal to, its just value of 3/2.  The purpose of this tempering is commonly to reduce the frequency ratio between the end-points of the  [[major third]]s and [[minor sixth]]s and increase that between the end-points of the [[minor third]]s and [[major sixth]]s so that they are closer to their just values of 5/4, 5/3, 6/5 and 8/5 respectively.  In practice, this means that the frequency ratio between the end-points of the tempered fifths will normally be less than 3/2.&lt;/ref&gt; by the same amount.&lt;ref&gt;Bergholt ([[#CITEREFBergholt1895|1895]]; 212, p.510; 214, p.637), Lloyd &amp; Boyle ([[#CITEREFLloydBoyle1978|1978]], p.163); Panetta ([[#CITEREFLPanetta1987|1987]], [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OoyCpZhaxQ4C&amp;pg=PA15 p.15]); Lindley &amp; Turner-Smith ([[#CITEREFLindleyTurner-Smith1993|1993]], p.43); Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/n13/mode/1up xi], [https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/32/mode/1up/search/tempered+third 32–44]); Donahue ([[#CITEREFDonahue2005|2005]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=FTRADRMfld4C&amp;pg=PA39 p.39]); Duffin ([[#CITEREFDuffin2007|2007]], pp.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i5LC7Csnw7UC&amp;pg=PA39 39], 33–46); Blood ([[#CITEREFBlood2013|2013]], [https://www.dolmetsch.com/defst1.htm Tc-Te]); Di Veroli ([[#CITEREFDi Veroli2013|2013]], p.42); Dolata ([[#CITEREFDolata2016|2016]], [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=DdQ4DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 p.98]). Lindley ([[#CITEREFLindley1984|1984]], p.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=oXE5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8 8]), Lindley, ([[#CITEREFLindley2001|2001]], p.249) and Jorgensen ([[#CITEREFJorgensen1991|1991]] , p.776)  use the term "regular meantone temperament" to refer to the same concept.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tuning in which all the perfect fifths remain untempered&lt;ref&gt;That is, the frequency ratio between their end-points has its [[Just intonation|just value]] of 3/2.&lt;/ref&gt;  is called "[[Pythagorean tuning]]".  In this article, unless the context implies otherwise, the unqualified term "fifth" by itself will mean "perfect fifth".

Authorities differ as to which tunings they regard as being included amongst those they refer to as "temperaments", and therefore as to whether or not they include Pythagorean tuning amongst those they refer to as "regular temperaments". Some treat the term "temperament" as a synonym for "tuning",&lt;ref&gt;Ellis ([[#CITEREFEllis1885|1885]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/431/mode/1up 431], [https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/433/mode/1up 433]), Bosanquet ([[#CITEREFBosanquet1889|1889]],  p.[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofmusi00stai#page/421/mode/1up 421–2]), and Lloyd &amp; Boyle ([[#CITEREFLloydBoyle1978|1978]], p.162), for instance. Bosanquet defines "temperament" to mean "the division of the octave", and takes the division produced by what he calls the "Pythagorean system" to be one instance of this.&lt;/ref&gt; others reserve the term "temperament" for tunings that are not any form of [[just intonation]] (including Pythagorean tuning),&lt;ref&gt;Duffin ([[#CITEREFDuffin2007|2007]], p.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i5LC7Csnw7UC&amp;pg=PA38 38]) and Blood ([[#CITEREFBlood2013|2013]], [https://www.dolmetsch.com/defst1.htm Tc-Te]), for example.&lt;/ref&gt; and one eminent musicologist, [[James Murray Barbour]], required a temperament to have at least one interval with an [[irrational number|irrational]] frequency ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], [https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/n15/mode/1up pp.xii], [https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/5/mode/1up 5]). Although Barbour, somewhat inconsistently, seems to include Pythagorean tuning amongst the ones he refers to as "regular temperaments".&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, all regular temperaments and Pythagorean tuning are collectively referred to as "regular tunings".&lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet ([[#CITEREFBosanquet1876|1876]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924022233088#page/n83/mode/1up 60], [[#CITEREFBosanquet1889|1889]],  p.[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofmusi00stai#page/421/mode/1up 421–2]) uses the expression "regular system" rather than "regular tuning" for the same concept.&lt;/ref&gt; Tunings and temperaments which include perfect fifths of different sizes are called "irregular".

In the [[diatonic]] scales of [[Common practice period|common practice]] Western music, any note is either separated from another by a whole number of perfect fifths, or is in the same [[pitch class]] as such a note.&lt;ref&gt;That is, it differs from such a note by a whole number of octaves.&lt;/ref&gt;
In these scales, therefore, the interval between any pair of notes can be formed  either by adding a whole number of fifths to, or subtracting them from, a whole number of [[octave]]s, or by subtracting a whole number of octaves from a whole number of fifths.  A regular tuning of such scales, therefore, can be constructed from a single [[circle of fifths|chain of fifths]],  the pitch of any note being determined by that of a single reference note and the common size of all the perfect fifths.  There are, however, some more extended scales for which the construction of regular tunings requires two or more chains of fifths offset from each other by intervals which cannot be formed from combinations of whole numbers of fifths and octaves.

A modified concept of regular tuning has been proposed by some modern musical theorists, who define it to be a general system of music intervals produced by combining together intervals of a finite number of fixed sizes, not necessarily including a fifth or an  octave.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;See, for example, Milne et. al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]] and [[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2008|2008]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of regular temperaments are [[meantone temperament]]s and [[equal temperament]]s.

== Description and examples ==
In the chromatic scale of [[Western culture#music|western music]], the perfect fifths are the intervals between any two successive notes in the following list:

{{centre| F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F, C, G, D, A, E, B, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,}}

or its extension to include notes with more flats or sharps.  An assignment of pitches to these notes, and others in the same pitch classes, is a regular tuning if the intervals between pairs of successive notes in the list are all the same size.  The tuning is Pythagorean if the intervals are all [[just intonation|just]]  perfect fifths, or is a regular temperament if they are tempered fifths.

Denote the size of the fifth, as a fraction of an octave, by ''f''.&lt;ref&gt;That is, the size of each fifth is 1200''f'' cents, and the frequency ratio between its end-points is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   For the fifths to qualify as tempered, ''f'' must be close, but not exactly equal,  to its just value of {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3/2)}}.&lt;ref&gt;Where &amp;nbsp;{{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}&amp;nbsp;, for any positive &amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;, is the [[binary logarithm]] of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/ref&gt;   To preserve the proper pitch ordering of the notes within each octave,&lt;ref&gt;Here specified using [[scientific pitch notation]], in which the subscript indicates the octave to which the note belongs, with C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; being [[middle C]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{center|C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt; B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;, }}
it must also satisfy the inequalities, 4/7 &lt; ''f'' &lt; 3/5.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood ([[#CITEREFBlackwood1985|1985]], pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=0LL_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200 200–1]); Milne et. al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.22]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In such a regular tuning, the common size of the intervals E–F and B–C, the [[diatonic semitone]], is 3 − 5''f'' of an octave.  The common size of the intervals between the flattened version of a note and the note itself, or between the note itself and its sharpened version, the [[chromatic semitone]], is 7''f'' − 4 of an octave.
The common size of the intervals C–D, D–E, F–G, G–A and A–B, the [[whole tone]], is the sum of the diatonic and chromatic semitones, or 2''f'' − 1 of an octave.   The diatonic semitone is larger than, smaller than, or equal to, the chromatic semitone according as ''f'' is less than, greater than,  or equal to, 7/12.  In the last case, the diatonic and chromatic semitones are both 1/12 of an octave, exactly half the size of a tone, and the tuning is [[12-tone equal temperament]].

Unless ''f'' = 7/12, as in  12-tone equal temperament, the first five notes in the list above, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, will not belong to the same [[pitch class]]es as the last five, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore not be [[enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]] to them.  If ''f'' &gt; 7/12, each sharp is 12''f'' − 7 of an octave sharper than its otherwise enharmonically equivalent flat, whereas, if ''f'' &lt; 7/12,  it is 7 − 12''f'' of an octave flatter. On a standard [[musical  keyboard]], with only the 12 notes of the chromatic scale in each octave, only one note from each of the enharmonically alternative  pairs, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  can be assigned to any one of the appropriate black keys.   The assignments traditionally chosen were either F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, or F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/25/mode/1up 25–44]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of the intervals G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; (and of the other  [[diminished sixth]]s, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F)  is 7 − 11''f''  of an octave.  For most of  the regular temperaments used in practice in the past, these intervals were too [[consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|dissonant]] to perform acceptably as perfect fifths, and were then referred to pejoratively as "[[wolf interval]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Donahue ([[#CITEREFDonahue2005|2005]], p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=FTRADRMfld4C&amp;pg=PA215 215]). Sometimes also called "wolf fifths", despite their really being diminished sixths (Jorgensen [[#CITEREFJorgensen1991|1991]], p.10; Donahue, [[#CITEREFDonahue2005|2005]], p.23;  Barbour, [[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/n15/mode/1up xii]).&lt;/ref&gt;

A regular tuning is obtained by selecting the desired size of the perfect fifths &lt;ref&gt;Here taken to be measured in octaves and fractions of an octave.   Mathematically, the size of an interval in this sense is the base-2 logarithm of the frequency ratio between its end-points, or equivalently, &amp;nbsp;''s''/1200&amp;nbsp; where &amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp; is its size in [[cent (music)|cent]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; and constructing one or more chains of fifths, in which the upper end-point of each fifth is the same as the lower end-point of the next one in the same chain.  The scale to be tuned  comprises all the notes belonging to the same pitch classes as those at the end-points of the fifths in all the chains.  If an end-point of one of the fifths in each chain is taken as a reference, the pitches of all the notes of the scale relative to those references can be determined by travelling in either direction by a whole number of fifths along the appropriate chain, starting from its reference, and then moving up or down by a whole number of octaves.   When there is more than one chain, the pitches of the notes in one chain relative to those of another are completely determined by any single interval between any pair of notes, of which one belongs to the first chain and the other to the second.

===Examples===
If a chain of twelve fifths starts from the note A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, the notes at the ends of successive fifths in the chain will be:
{{centre| A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F, C, G, D, A, E, B, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

If the G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;  at the end of the chain is not in the same [[pitch class]] as the A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; at its start, then extending the chain upwards will produce notes D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:-0.35em;"&gt;{{music|doublesharp}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ... etc., and extending it downwards will similarly produce notes D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:-0.6em;"&gt;&amp;#x266d;&amp;#x266d;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ... etc.  The following tables give the sizes in fractions of an octave of the intervals between the note C at the start of an octave and each of the naturals, sharps and flats within the octave immediately above it when it is tuned with a regular tuning whose fifth is a fraction {{math|''f''}} of an octave.  The columns of the tables are ordered according to the sizes of the corresponding intervals.

The regular tunings given as examples below have either been  proposed or used as a means of determining the relative pitches of the notes in the above sequence.

====Notation====
:{{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3/2) }}, the size, in octaves, of a just (i.e. Pythagorean) perfect fifth, equivalent to about 702 cents.
:{{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5/4) }},  the size, in octaves, of a just major third, equivalent to about 386 cents
:{{math| ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} 4 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 2 }}, the size, in octaves, of a [[syntonic comma]], equivalent to about 21.5 cents.
:{{math| ''c&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} 12 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 7 }}, the size, in octaves, of a [[pythagorean comma|ditonic (i.e. Pythagorean) comma]], equivalent to about 23.5 cents.
:{{math| ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} ''c&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, the size, in octaves, of a [[schisma]], equivalent to about 1.95 cents.

====12-tone equal temperament====
:When ''f'' = 7/12, as it is in the now standard 12-tone equal temperament, the total span of twelve fifths will be exactly 7 octaves, the notes G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; will belong to the same pitch classes as F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, and the diminished sixths, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F  will be the same size, 7/12 of an octave, as the perfect fifths.

====Other equal temperaments====
:'''a.''' When ''f'' =  ''m/n'', a [[rational numbers|rational]] [[fraction (mathematics)#Simple, common, or vulgar fractions|fraction]] of an octave, where ''m'' and ''n'' are positive integers [[Coprime integers|with no proper common factor]], then ''n'' of those fifths will span exactly ''m'' octaves, and a chain of that many fifths will generate a scale of ''n'' notes per octave, spaced equally apart at intervals of 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of an octave.   The resulting temperament is called "''n''-tone equal temperament".  If  {{math| ''m/n'' ≠ 7/12}}, the pitch class of each sharp will be ''different'' from that of its enharmonically alternative flat, and separated from it by an interval of {{math|{{!}} 12 ''m/n'' − 7 {{!}}}} of an octave.   Examples include [[17 equal temperament|17-tone]], [[19 equal temperament|19-tone]], [[22 equal temperament|22-tone]], [[31 equal temperament|31-tone]],  [[41 equal temperament|41-tone]] and  [[53 equal temperament|53-tone]] equal temperaments, with fifths of sizes 10/17, 11/19, 13/22, 18/31, 24/41 and 31/53 of an octave respectively.

:'''b.''' If a whole number, ''r'', of interleaved chains of fifths, of the same size, ''m/n'' of an octave, as above, are offset from one another by intervals of 1/(''r n'') of an octave, they will generate a scale of ''r n'' notes per octave, spaced equally apart at that same interval, thus producing an ''r n''-tone equal temperament.   Examples include [[24 equal temperament|24-tone]], [[34 equal temperament|34-tone]] and [[58 equal temperament|58-tone]] equal temperaments, each with two interleaved chains of fifths of sizes 7/12, 10/17 and 17/29 of an octave respectively, and [[72 equal temperament|72-tone]] equal temperament with 6 interleaved chains of fifths of size 7/12 of an octave.

====Pythagorean tuning and schismic temperament====
:When all the fifths are Pythagorean—that is, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f''  {{=}}  ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;—the total span of twelve fifths is larger than 7 octaves by the Pythagorean comma, which is more than a quarter of this tuning's diatonic semitone.&lt;ref&gt;And nearly a quarter of the semitone of 12-tone equal temperament.&lt;/ref&gt;  The diminished sixths, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F, are flatter than the fifth by this amount, sufficient for them to qualify as wolves.

:Apart from the presence of wolves, Pythagorean tuning has the disadvantage that its normal thirds and sixths are quite dissonant.  Its  major thirds, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;–C, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;–G, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D, F–A, C–E, G–B, D–F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A–C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  for instance, are wider than just by a syntonic comma, as are its major sixths, and its normal minor sixths and  thirds are correspondingly narrower than just by the same amount, which is too large for any of these intervals to be recognised as [[consonance and dissonance#Consonance|consonance]]s.  The diminished fourths, E–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F, on the other hand, are narrower than just major thirds by only a schisma, thus making them reasonably consonant.  By extending the tuning as far as the notes G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doubleflat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and  D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doublesharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; (for the chromatic scale from A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; to C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; around the spiral of fifths), or D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doubleflat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and  A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doublesharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; (for the chromatic scale from E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; to G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; around the spiral of fifths), each note of the chromatic scale can be made to serve as the bass for reasonably good thirds and sixths, as indicated in the following table:

:The names given in parentheses in this table are those assigned to the corresponding intervals by traditional musical terminology, where the degree assigned to an interval is determined by the number of letter-named notes included in it.

:[[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]] gave the name "[[schismatic temperament|skhismic temperament]]"&lt;ref&gt;Ellis ([[#CITEREFEllis1885|1885]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/435/mode/1up 435]).  Now usually spelt "schismic".&lt;/ref&gt; to a Pythagorean tuning whose thirds and sixths were regarded as being  the intervals given in the above  table, rather than the ones those names would refer to in traditional musical terminology.

====Quarter-comma meantone====
:In [[quarter-comma meantone]], the size of the perfecf fifths,  &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f''  {{overset|def|{{=}}}}  ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''|4}} {{=}} {{sfrac|(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 2)|4}} }}, is chosen so that four of them span an interval of two octaves plus a just [[major third]], thus making all the major thirds and minor sixths of the resulting scale perfectly just.  The  total span of twelve of these fifths is less than 7 octaves by the so-called [[lesser diesis]], which is about 40% of an equal-temperament semitone.   The diminished sixths, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F, are sharper than the fifth by this amount, which is again sufficient for these intervals to qualify as wolves.   The title "quarter-comma meantone" derives from the fact that the size of the fifth in this temperament is smaller than its just value by a quarter of the syntonic comma.&lt;!--- which is the amount, 4 log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) −  log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5) − 4 of an octave, by which four just fifths exceed two octaves plus a just major third. --&gt;

====Other meantones====

:If ''q'' is a positive rational fraction, a regular temperament with fifths of size &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f''  {{overset|def|{{=}}}}  ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''q c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;—that is,  a multiple ''q'' of a syntonic comma smaller than their just size of   &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;—is commonly referred to as "''q''-comma meantone".   Fractions other than 1/4 which have been suggested as possible values for ''q'' are 1/3, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/9, 1/10, 2/7, 2/9, 3/10 and 5/18.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/31/mode/1up/search/tempered+third 31–44])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Helmholtzian temperament====
:A regular tuning with a fifth of size &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f'' {{overset|def|{{=}}}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}}}}&amp;nbsp;, and with the thirds and sixths identified with the intervals specified by the scheme of [[#table2|table 2]] is called "Helmholtzian temperament".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis ([[#CITEREFEllis1885|1885]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/435/mode/1up 435]).&lt;/ref&gt;   In this temperament, the major thirds and minor sixths, as given by the scheme of table 1, are perfectly just,  while the fifths and minor thirds are flatter than just, and the fourths and major sixths sharper than just, by the imperceptible amount of an eighth of a schisma.

== More recent alternative concept ==

In the traditional definition of regular tuning, it is taken for granted that the perfect fifth whose size is being fixed by the tuning is that of the diatonic major scale of common practice Western music.   A regular tuning in this sense is thus inextricably tied to the structure of that scale and others closely associated with it.  It is a much less useful concept for other styles  of music whose scales cannot be straightforwardly derived from the diatonic.&lt;ref&gt;Erlich ([[#CITEREFErlich2006|2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Some musical theorists have recently proposed an alternative definition of regular tuning which can be applied to a wider range of musical styles.  According to this alternative definition, a regular tuning is a collection of intervals which can be produced by combining together intervals of a finite number of fixed sizes.&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt; For the purposes of the definition, an interval is regarded as being completely determined by just its size and direction (ascending or descending), independent of any specific range of pitches which it might span, with a descending interval being regarded as the negative of an ascending one of the same size.  Thus, the intervals between any of the pairs of notes [C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], etc., in 12-tone equal temperament, for example, are considered to be merely separate instantiations of the ''same'' interval—an ascending tempered major third of size one-third of an octave—, and the intervals between the pairs [E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], etc., to be instantiations of its negative—a ''descending'' tempered major third of the same size.  An ascending interval in this sense can therefore be represented by a single number that specifies it size, and a descending one by the negative of the number specifying its size.

A regular tuning in this alternative sense is not required to contain octaves or perfect fifths, or to be usable for tuning any of the usual scales of common practice music, and will therefore not necessarily be obtainable as the set of intervals of a regular tuning in the traditional sense.  The collection of intervals that  can be produced by combining together octaves, just perfect fifths and just major thirds,&lt;ref&gt;That is, the collection of all [[5-limit tuning|5-limit intervals]].&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, although a regular tuning according to this alternative definition, cannot be the set of intervals of any tuning that is regular under the traditional definition.&lt;ref&gt;Any tuning of a diatonic scale which contains both a just perfect fifth and a just major third must always contain perfect fifths of at least two different sizes. If the major third C–E is perfectly just, for example, then at least one of the fifths C–G, G–D, D–A or A–E cannot be perfectly just.&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of this article, the term "regular tuning", unless otherwise qualified, will be used in this alternative  sense.

Intervals that can be combined together to produce all the other intervals of a given regular tuning are called "generators" of the tuning. Any interval of such a tuning must have the form  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + … + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, where &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … }}, and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are generators for it, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … }}, and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are integers. The minimum number of non-zero generators needed to produce all the intervals of the tuning is called its "rank",&lt;ref&gt;Milne et al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.20])&lt;/ref&gt; and regular tunings of rank 2 are called "linear".   The collection of ''all'' intervals obtainable by combining together the generators of a regular tuning has the mathematical structure of a [[Free abelian group#Rank|free abelian group]] of the same rank.  The theory of these groups can  therefore be useful for investigating the properties of regular tunings.

===Examples===

====The intervals of a regular tuning in the traditional sense====
[[Image:Rank-2 temperaments with the generator close to a fifth and period an octave.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Some examples of linear tunings generated by an octave and a perfect fifth, generally tempered (Milne et al., [[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.18]).]]
The intervals of any regular tuning in the traditional sense can be obtained by combining together its perfect fifth, a pure octave, and possibly some intervals separating chains of fifths that may be offset from one another.  That set of Intervals is therefore a regular tuning in the alternative sense.  The set of intervals of an equal temperament—in which just one size of interval is needed to produce all the others—has rank 1.  Since the intervals of Pythagorean tuning and meantone and Helmholtzian temperaments can be produced from their fifths and the octave, but not from any intervals of just one size, those sets of intervals have rank 2, and are therefore linear.

====''p''-limit tuning and just intonation====

An interval obtainable as a combination of generators whose  sizes in octaves are all of the form {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'')}}, with all {{math|''q''}}  being prime numbers no greater than some fixed prime {{math|''p''}}, is called a "[[limit (music)#Prime limit|''p''-limit interval]]", and a regular tuning is called a ''p''-limit tuning if all its intervals are ''p''-limit intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Wright ([[#CITEREFWright2009|2009]], p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=g4ONAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137 137]).  As thus defined, a ''p''-limit tuning is automatically also a ''q''-limit tuning for any other prime ''q'' greater than&amp;nbsp;''p''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since the intervals of Pythagorean tuning are generated by the octave, of size one (i.e. {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}) octave, and the just perfect twelfth, of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)}} octaves, they form a 3-limit tuning.  Likewise, the set of intervals generated by the octave, a just perfect twelfth, and a just major seventeenth, of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}} octaves, constitutes a 5-limit tuning.  Since this set of intervals cannot be generated by any smaller collection of generators, it is a regular tuning of rank 3.

In just intonation, the pair of notes forming every consonance has a frequency ratio whose numerator and denominator are small whole numbers.  As a consequence, these intervals must belong to a ''p''-limit tuning for some small prime {{math|''p''}}.   Thus, the intervals of Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale|syntonic diatonic scale]], for instance, in which the relative pitches of the notes are completely determined by the requirement that all  three of its  [[primary triad]]s be perfectly just [[major chord]]s, form a 5-limit tuning, since they can be generated by intervals of sizes {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}, {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)}}, and {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}} octaves.

By going one step further, to proper [[7-limit tuning]]s,&lt;ref&gt;That is, to one which does in fact contain an interval of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(7)}} octaves.&lt;/ref&gt;  it is possible to obtain regular tunings with perfectly just septimal intervals.  The regular tuning generated by intervals of sizes {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}, {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)}}, {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}, and {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(7)}} octaves, for instance, is a 7-limit tuning of rank 4 which contains perfectly just [[harmonic seventh]] intervals of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;({{frac|7|4}})}} octaves, as well as perfect fourths and fifths, and major and minor thirds and sixths which are all perfectly just.

===Temperament mappings===
By definition, a tempered interval is one which is  very nearly—but not quite—just.  Thus, if &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; are all either tempered or just intervals of a regular tuning, there must be some just intervals, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, such that &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; are all very close to zero.&lt;ref&gt;Or equal to zero whenever the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; happens to be perfectly just.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … ,}} and {{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are all just, they must belong to a ''p''-limit tuning for some small prime ''p''.   If they are all distinct, and there is no interval which can be expressed in two or more different ways as a combination of them,&lt;ref&gt;If this is the case, the intervals &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … }}, and {{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are said to be "''independent''".&lt;/ref&gt; then the association of the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + … + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; to the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + … + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, for each ''r''-tuple, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of integers, defines a mathematical [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the ''p''-limit tuning generated by &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; onto the regular tuning generated by &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  This function, which turns out to be a useful tool for the construction of tunings with desired properties, is called a ''temperament mapping''.&lt;ref&gt;Milne et al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.20])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
=====For the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament=====
The only just interval of 12-tone equal temperament is the octave.  Its tempered intervals are its  perfect fourth and fifth, and its major and minor third and sixth, whose sizes in octaves are {{frac|5|12}},{{frac|7|12}}, {{frac|1|3}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|3|4}}, {{frac|2|3}}, respectively. The corresponding just intervals can all be generated from the octave, just perfect fifth and just major third.&lt;ref&gt;The just perfect fourth can be obtained by subtracting a just perfect fifth from an octave, the just minor third by subtracting a just major third from a just perfect fifth, the just major sixth by subtracting a just perfect fifth from the sum of an octave and a just major third, and the just minor sixth by subtracting a just major third from an octave.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|7 |12}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  {{sfrac|1|3}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.

=====For a tuning generated by an octave and a fifth=====
If a regular tuning generated by an octave  and a tempered perfect fifth of size &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f''}}&amp;nbsp; octaves, the sizes of its perfect fourth, major and minor thirds, and major and minor  sixths, in octaves, are   {{math|1 − ''f'' }}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math|4 ''f'' − 2 }}, &amp;nbsp;{{math| 2 − 3 ''f'' }}, &amp;nbsp;{{math| 3 ''f'' − 1 }}&amp;nbsp;, and
{{math| 3 − 4 ''f'' }}, respectively.  If &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f'' {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{frac|''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''|4}} }}&amp;nbsp; (quarter-comma meantone), the octave, major thirds and minor sixths are perfectly just, but all other consonances are tempered.  If &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f'' {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{frac|''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''|3}} }}&amp;nbsp;(one-third-comma meantone), the octave, minor thirds and major sixths are perfectly just, and all other consonances are tempered.  Otherwise, all consonances except the octave are tempered.&lt;ref&gt;Or will be so far out of tune as to be no longer consonant, if &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f''}}&amp;nbsp; is sufficiently close to one of its extreme limits, {{frac|4|7}} or {{frac|3|5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the temperament mapping for the intervals of this temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(4 ''f'' − 2)}}&amp;nbsp;.

=====For the intervals of schismic temperament=====
The just intervals of schismic temperament are its octave and perfect fourth and fifth, and its tempered intervals are its major and minor third and sixth. The sizes of these latter intervals, in octaves, are {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, {{math|1 + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''  – ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, and {{math| 1 + ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, respectively. Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of schismic temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' +  ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&amp;nbsp;.

=====For the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament=====
The just intervals of Helmholtzian temperament are its octave, major third and minor sixth, and its tempered intervals are its perfect fourth and fifth, and its minor third and major sixth. The sizes of these latter intervals, in octaves, are {{math|1 + {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} − ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}}}},  {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} }}, and {{math| 1 + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} – ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, respectively. Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ( ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} ) +  ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}&amp;nbsp;.

=====Images of the just consonances under the above temperament mappings=====
Let {{math| ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the temperament mappings for the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament, a regular tuning generated by an octave and a fifth, and schismic and Helmholtzian temperaments respectively, as described above.   The following table lists the images of each of the 5-limit just consonances under these temperament mappings.

===Commas, rank, and relations between consonances===
The purpose of tempering consonances is to allow a greater number of them to be accommodated within the confines of a fixed scale, at the expense of compromising their purity.  In a regular tuning, this manifests itself in the existence of intervals that can be formed from two ''different'' combinations of consonances, even though their corresponding just versions are independent.

====Examples====
In 12-tone equal temperament, an interval comprising 7 octaves can also be expressed as a combination of 12 perfect fifths.  In any regular tuning generated by an octave and a tempered fifth (including 12-tone equal temperament), an interval comprising 4 perfect fifths can be expressed as a combination of 2 octaves plus a major third.  In both schismic and Helmholtzian temperament an interval comprising 5 octaves can be expressed as a combination of 8 perfect fifths plus a major third.

If &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are the temperament mappings defined above, these relations can be written as:
{{centre|{{math|0 {{=}} 12 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 7 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(12 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 7) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 4 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 2 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(4 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 2 − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 4 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 2 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 2 − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 8 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') + ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 5 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(8 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 8 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') + ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 5 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(8 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&amp;nbsp;.}}
That is, these relations correspond to the ditonic comma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mapping of 12-tone equal temperament, the syntonic comma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mappings of any regular tuning generated by an octave and a tempered fifth, and the schisma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mappings of schismic and Helmholtzian temperaments.

====General case====
If some interval of a regular tuning can be formed from two different combinations of its consonances, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, whose corresponding just versions are independent,&lt;ref&gt;For this to be possible, at least one of the consonances &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''c''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; must be tempered.&lt;/ref&gt; there must exist positive whole numbers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''n&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''m&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, with &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; for any {{math|''i''}}, such that

{{center|&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''n&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''m&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;.}}

Subtracting the right side of this equation from the left gives

{{center|&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}&amp;nbsp;,}}

where &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ 0}}&amp;nbsp; for &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ... , ''t''}}&amp;nbsp;.   Such an equation is called a ''"[[Linear function|(linear) relation]]"''.

If &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''}}&amp;nbsp; is the temperament mapping for the regular tuning, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; the just consonances such that   &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''(''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; for &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ... , ''t''}}&amp;nbsp;, the above linear relation can be written as

{{center|&amp;nbsp;{{math| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 {{=}} ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''T''(''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'') &lt;br&gt;
{{=}} ''T''(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&amp;nbsp;.}}

Thus, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, which is a non-zero ''p''-limit interval for some small prime ''p'', is mapped to zero by the temperament mapping &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''}}&amp;nbsp;.  If all the integers &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,}}&amp;nbsp; and  &amp;nbsp;{{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; are reasonably small in magnitude, then because each of the intervals &amp;nbsp;{{math|''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; is equal to, or closely approximated by, the corresponding &amp;nbsp;{{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; will be quite small.  It is referred to as a "''[[comma (music)|comma]]''".

The set of all ''p''-limit intervals &amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''}}&amp;nbsp; such that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''(''h'') {{=}} 0}}&amp;nbsp; is called the "''comma lattice''" of the tuning.&lt;ref&gt;Milne et. al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2008|2008]], p.2).  These authors, however, use this term to refer not to the set of commas itself, but to the isomorphic lattice of ''t''-tuples, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ( ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' )}}&amp;nbsp;, of integers such that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} 0}}&amp;nbsp; &lt;/ref&gt;   The comma lattice of the general regular tuning described above is itself another a regular tuning  whose rank is strictly less than &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t''}}.  It follows from one of the fundamental theorems of [[linear algebra]]&lt;ref&gt;Namely, the [[rank–nullity theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; that the rank of the regular tuning and the rank of its comma lattice must sum to &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t''}}.

=====Examples=====
The regular tuning formed by the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament has rank 1.  Its comma lattice, generated by the syntonic and ditonic commas, has rank 2.

A regular tuning generated by the octave and a tempered perfect fifth whose size in octaves is [[irrational number|irrational]] has rank 2.  Its comma lattice, generated by the syntonic comma, has rank 1.

The regular tuning formed by the intervals of schismic temperament and that formed by the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament both have rank 2.  They both have the same comma lattice, generated by the schisma, of rank 1.

===Finding minimal sets of generators===
If a regular tuning has generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; that satisfy one or more linear relations, then its rank &amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;, say, will be strictly less than &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t''}}&amp;nbsp;.  Although there must then exist a set of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp; generators for the tuning, it may not always be possible to select these from among the unmodified generators in the original set, &amp;nbsp;{{math| { ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; }}}&amp;nbsp;.  In general, some, at least, of the intervals in a minimal set of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp; generators will have to be constructed as combinations of 2 or more of the originals.&lt;ref&gt;The intervals of 12-tone equal temperament, for instance, are generated by its perfect fifth and an octave, but not by either of those two intervals by itself. The equal temperament semitone, which does generate all the intervals of this regular tuning, is a combination of 7 equal-temperament fifths less 4 octaves.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
Consider the regular tuning generated by the octave, just perfect fifth, and a tempered major third of size {{math| ''τ'' {{overset|def|{{=}}}} {{frac|18|5}} − {{frac|28|5}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{frac|46|5}} − {{frac|28|5}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) }} octaves.&lt;ref&gt;This major third, comprising 5{{frac|3|5}} just perfect fourths less 2 octaves, is approximately 2.7 cents sharper than just.&lt;/ref&gt;  A temperament mapping {{math| ''T''}}&amp;nbsp; for this tuning is defined by &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''T''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ({{frac|18|5}} − {{frac|28|5}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + {{frac|18|5}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +  (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − {{frac|28|5}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;.  The generators satisfy the relation &amp;nbsp;{{math| 0 {{=}} 18 − 28 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5 τ}}&amp;nbsp;, corresponding to the comma &amp;nbsp;{{math|  18 − 28 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5 ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, a 5-limit interval of size approximately 13.7 cents.  Although this regular tuning has rank 2, none of its original generators can be expressed as a combination of the other two, so no pair of them can serve as generators for it. The fifth part, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''φ'' {{overset|def|{{=}}}} {{sfrac| 1 − ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''|5}}}}&amp;nbsp;,  of a just perfect fourth, however, can be written as &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''φ'' {{=}} −7 + 11 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 2 ''τ'' }}&amp;nbsp; (a combination of the original generators), and since &amp;nbsp;{{math| 1 {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 5 ''φ''  }}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1 − 5 ''φ''  }}&amp;nbsp;, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''τ'' {{=}} −2 + 28 ''φ'' {{=}} −2 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 18 ''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;, either the octave or the just perfect fifth together with the interval {{math| ''φ''}} constitute a pair of generators for this tuning.&lt;ref&gt;Milne et al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.20]) describe a procedure for obtaining two intervals that will generate all the intervals of a regular tuning generated by three generators satisfying a single linear relation.  When applied to this example, that procedure produces the intervals {{math| {{frac|1|5}}}} (one fifth of an octave) and &amp;nbsp;{{math|{{frac|''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''|5}}}}&amp;nbsp; (one fifth of a just perfect fifth).  While these intervals can indeed be combined together to produce any interval of the tuning, neither of them can be expressed as a combination of whole numbers of copies of the original generators. So, while the tuning generated by these two intervals does include all the intervals of the original, it is a [[Subset#⊂_and_⊃_symbols|''proper'' superset]] of this latter, and not identical to it. &lt;/ref&gt;

====General Case====
Finding a minimal set of generators for a regular tuning with consonances satisfying some linear relations requires, in general, some fairly advanced, but well-known, techniques of linear algebra.  Proofs are omitted from the following outline.&lt;ref&gt;Which is a slightly more detailed version of that given by Newman ([[#CITEREFNewma1997|1997]], pp.376–7).&lt;/ref&gt;

If the generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; of a regular tuning satisfy the linear relations:
{{center|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0  &amp;\ =\ a_{11} g_1 + a_{12} g_2 + \dots + a_{1t} g_t\\
0  &amp;\ =\ a_{21} g_1 + a_{22} g_2 + \dots + a_{2t} g_t\\
   &amp;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \dots \\
0  &amp;\ =\ a_{s1} g_1 + a_{s2} g_2 + \dots + a_{st} g_t 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;,}}

and no others apart from linear combinations of these, then the rank, {{math|''c''}}, say, of the tuning's comma lattice is the rank of the {{math|''s'' × ''t''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp; whose entries are the integers &amp;nbsp;{{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and the rank of the tuning itself is &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;If the relations are independent, then &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp; will be of [[full rank]], and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''c'' {{=}} ''s'' &lt; ''t''}}&amp;nbsp;.  If desired, the elimination of redundant relations can reduce the problem to this case.&lt;/ref&gt;  Let &amp;nbsp;{{math|''S''}}&amp;nbsp; be the [[Smith normal form]] of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; be &amp;nbsp;{{math|''s'' × ''s''}}&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t'' × ''t''}}&amp;nbsp; [[unimodular matrix|unimodular matrices]]&lt;ref&gt;A matrix is unimodular when it is [[invertible matrix|invertible]] and both its own entries and those of its inverse are integers.  The Smith normal form and unimodular matrices &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; relating it to the original matix always exist for matrices having integer entries.  The matrix  {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} will be unique if the original matrix has full rank, but not otherwise. The matrix  {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} will not be unique.&lt;/ref&gt; such that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''S'' {{=}} ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''A U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''W''}}&amp;nbsp; be the &amp;nbsp;{{math| (''t'' − ''c'') × ''t''}}&amp;nbsp; submatrix of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; comprising its last &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp; rows, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''V''}}&amp;nbsp; be the &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' × (''t'' − ''c'')}}&amp;nbsp; submatrix of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; comprising its last &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp; columns,  &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''}}&amp;nbsp; be the &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t'' × 1}}&amp;nbsp; column vector whose entries are &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and let &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''w'' {{=}} ''W g''}}&amp;nbsp;.

Since the entries of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''W''}}&amp;nbsp; are integers, the entries, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''t''– ''c''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''w''}}&amp;nbsp; are intervals in the tuning generated by &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  But since the entries of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''V''}}&amp;nbsp; are also integers, and  &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''g'' {{=}} ''V w''}}&amp;nbsp;, it follows that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''t''– ''c''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; constitute a minimal set of &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp; generators for the tuning.
=====Examples=====
'''a.'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The matrix of the right side of the relation &amp;nbsp;{{math| 0 {{=}} 18 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − 28 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − 5 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, satisfied by the generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} 1, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}}''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} ''τ''}}&amp;nbsp; of the immediately preceding example, is &amp;nbsp;{{tmath| A\,\overset{def}{{{=}}}\, \left(\begin{matrix} 18 &amp; -28 &amp; -5  \end{matrix}\right)}}&amp;nbsp;, which has Smith normal form {{tmath|  \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \end{matrix}\right)}}&amp;nbsp;.  Postmultiplying &amp;nbsp;{{tmath| A }}&amp;nbsp; by either of the two unimodular matrices,

{{centre|{{tmath| \left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp;  1 &amp; 0 \\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; -5 \\ 11 &amp; -2 &amp; 28  \end{matrix}\right)  }}&amp;nbsp; or {{tmath| \left(\begin{matrix} 2 &amp;  1 &amp; 5 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 7 &amp; -2 &amp; 18  \end{matrix}\right)  }}&amp;nbsp;,}}
will reduce it to its Smith normal form:
{{centre|{{tmath|\left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \end{matrix}\right) {{=}}  \left(\begin{matrix} 18 &amp; -28 &amp; -5  \end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp;  1 &amp; 0 \\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; -5 \\ 11 &amp; -2 &amp; 28  \end{matrix}\right) {{=}}  \left(\begin{matrix} 18 &amp; -28 &amp; -5  \end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix} 2 &amp;  1 &amp; 5 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 7 &amp; -2 &amp; 18  \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;.}}
The inverses of these unimodular matrices are:

{{centre|
{{tmath| \left(\begin{matrix} 18 &amp;  -28 &amp; -5 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ -7 &amp; 11 &amp; 2  \end{matrix}\right)  }}&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;{{tmath| \left(\begin{matrix} 18 &amp;  -28 &amp; -5 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ -7 &amp; 11 &amp; 2  \end{matrix}\right)  }}&amp;nbsp;, respectively. }}

Applied to the original generators, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; }}&amp;nbsp;, and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, the first of these produces the pair of generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;{{math|−7 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  + 11 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + 2 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, while the second produces the pair &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;{{math|−7 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  + 11 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + 2 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.


'''b. (Miracle temperament)'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Consider the regular tuning generated by the octave,&amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, temperered perfect fifth, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of size
{{center|{{math|  {{frac|6|19}} + {{frac|12|19}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{frac|6|19}} ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{frac|6|19}} + {{frac|12|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) − {{frac|6|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}&amp;nbsp; octaves,&lt;ref&gt;Approximately 1.7 cents flatter than just.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
tempered major third, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of size {{center|{{math|  {{frac|12|19}} − {{frac|14|19}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + {{frac|7|19}} ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{frac|12|19}} − {{frac|14|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) + {{frac|7|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}&amp;nbsp; octaves,&lt;ref&gt;Approximately 3.3 cents flatter than just.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and two other intervals, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of sizes 
{{center|{{math|  {{frac|17|19}} − {{frac|4|19}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + {{frac|2|19}} ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{frac|17|19}} − {{frac|4|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) + {{frac|2|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}&amp;nbsp;octaves}} and
{{center|{{math|  −{{frac|4|19}} + {{frac|30|19}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{frac|15|19}} ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} −{{frac|4|19}} + {{frac|30|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) − {{frac|15|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}&amp;nbsp; octaves,}} respectively.  These last two intervals are tempered 2.3 cents  and 0.6 cents flatter than a just [[septimal minor seventh]] and a just [[tritone#Eleventh harmonic|undecimal semi-augmented fourth]], with freqency ratios {{math|{{frac|7|4}}}} and {{math|{{frac|11|8}}}}, respectively.

The generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; satisfy the set of relations
{{centre|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0 &amp;\ =\ 3 g_1  - g_2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ - 3 g_4 \\
0 &amp;\ =\ g_1\ \ + g_2\ \ - g_3\   - g_4  - g_5 \\
0 &amp;\ =\ g_1\ - 2 g_2  - 2 g_3  + g_4 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;, }}
which has matrix
{{center|{{tmath| A {{=}} \left(\begin{matrix} 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 \\
                                      1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\
                                      1 &amp; -2 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;}}
Postmultiplying &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp; by the unimodular matrix
{{center|{{tmath| U {{=}} \left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                                      -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\

                                      1 &amp; 0 &amp;  1 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\
                                      -2 &amp; -1 &amp;  -7 &amp; -1 &amp; 15 \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;}}
reduces it to Smith normal form:
{{center|{{tmath| A\,U {{=}} \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                                      0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                                      0 &amp; 0 &amp;  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;.}}
From this it follows that the tuning has rank 2, and its comma lattice rank 3.  The last two rows of the inverse of &amp;nbsp;{{tmath|U}}&amp;nbsp;,

{{center|{{tmath| U^{-1} {{=}} \left(\begin{matrix} 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 \\

                                                    1 &amp; -2 &amp;  -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
                                                    1 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                                           1 &amp; -1 &amp;  -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;,}}
                                           
give the octave, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, and the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{frac|1|19}} + {{frac|2|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) −  {{frac|1|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}&amp;nbsp;octaves as a minimal set of two generators for the tuning.  This last interval is called a "secor", after [[George Secor]], who discovered it, and the regular tuning just described is called "miracle temperament".&lt;ref&gt;Secor ([[#CITEREFSecor1975|1975]], [[#CITEREFSecor1976|1976]], [[#CITEREFSecor2006|2006]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The tuning's tempered fifth comprises 6 secors, and its tempered major third one octave minus 7 secors.   Its minor sixth is thus tempered to 7 secors.

'''''SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Confrontation''''' is a [[Third-person shooter|third person]] [[tactical shooter]] [[video game]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] developed by [[Slant Six Games]]. The game is the fifth title in the ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' series and the first for the PlayStation 3. It was released in North America and Japan in October 2008, and in Europe in March 2009.&lt;ref name="NA release"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B001F7AAES |language=Japanese |title=SOCOM: Confrontation (単品版)(オンライン専用ソフト) |work=[[Amazon.com]] |publisher=Amazon.co.jp |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=320154|title=Euro SOCOM PS3 pushed to "early 2009" |accessdate=2008-11-28 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Eurogamer.net |author=Purchese, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Confrontation'' came packaged with the PlayStation 3 Bluetooth headset or as a standalone game, and also released as a downloadable title from PlayStation Network.&lt;ref name="delayed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/885/885626p1.html |title=SOCOM: Confrontation Delayed |author=Haynes, Jeff |publisher=IGN.com |work=[[IGN]] |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player is able to customize their character, choosing from a list of predefined items.

Online servers were shutdown on January 28, 2014, along with the servers for ''[[SOCOM 4 U.S. Navy SEALs]]'', rendering it permanently unplayable.

==Gameplay==
''Confrontation'' focuses on online play. Teamwork is essential to success in the game, as this phrase says: "Alone I'm Lethal, as a team I Dominate". The player is able to customize their character, choosing from a list of pre-defined items, using mix and match. This includes armour (light, medium and heavy; both leg and torso; for commando and mercenary), camouflage (head, shirts, pants, armour, straps and mask), and weapons attachments (two slots, weapon specific; e.g. front grip and suppressor on the M4A1 assault rifle) .The game features several playable [[special forces]] teams: the [[United States Navy SEALs]], [[United Kingdom|U.K.'s]] [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), [[Germany|Germany's]] [[Kommando Spezialkräfte]] (KSK), [[Spain|Spain's]] [[Unidad de Operaciones Especiales]] (UOE), and [[France|France's]] [[1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment|1er Régiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de Marine]] (1er RPIMa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/03/22/socom-confrontations-special-forces-organizatons-revealed/ |title=SOCOM Confrontation's Special Forces organizations revealed |date=2008-03-22 |author=McElroy, Griffin |work=[[Joystiq]] |publisher=Joystiq.com |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and release==
[[Image:ConfrontationGameplay.jpg|thumb|left|An early screenshot of ''SOCOM: Confrontation'']]
''SOCOM: Confrontation'' was officially announced during [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment America]] (SCEA) Gamers' Day on May 17, 2007, by Scott Steinberg, SCEA's Vice President of Product Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/05/17/sony-announces-socom-confrontation-for-ps3/ |title=Sony announces SOCOM Confrontation for PS3 |publisher=Joystiq.com |work=[[Joystiq]] |date=2007-05-17 |author=Kietzmann, Ludwig |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of the ''SOCOM'' series website, it was announced that the game was scheduled to be released on September 16, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3167113 |title=SOCOM Confrontation Marching Out on September 16 |author=Kollar, Philip |date=2008-03-26 |accessdate=2008-03-26 |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=1UP.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/862/862571p1.html |title=SOCOM Confrontation Release Date Announced |author=Roper, Chris |accessdate=2008-10-16 |date=2008-03-27 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=IGN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, SCEA Director of Development Seth Luisi announced that the game would be delayed one month so they can deliver "the best SOCOM online experience possible."

When ''Confrontation'' was released, the game was missing several features that were claimed on the cover of the box and in the manual. The game received a patch on January 9, 2009, version 1.30, which claimed to fix several issues including frame rate and invisible gun glitch, however some of these issues still remained.  New features that were missing during release including trophy support were included with the patch.  After the patch came out, online players increased by 50% and the number of players per hour increased 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.socom.com/en-us/post/2009/02/State-of-the-Game.aspx |title=State of the Game |author= |accessdate=2009-02-13 |date=2000-02-13 |work=socom.com |publisher=socom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony turned off the servers on January 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-17-sony-signals-end-to-socom-mag-online-support|title=Sony signals end to SOCOM, MAG online support|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=17 July 2013|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PlayStation Home===
Slant Six Games has released a themed [[List of PlayStation Home Game Spaces|space]] dedicated to ''SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation'' in the PlayStation 3's online community-based service, [[PlayStation Home]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/06/17/coming-to-playstation-home-new-socom-space-ghostbusters-apartment-ea-sports-complex-update-more/|title=Coming to PlayStation Home: New SOCOM Space, Ghostbusters Apartment, EA SPORTS Update + More!|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment|SCE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space is called "SOCOM: Tactical Operations Center" (TOC). At this ''SOCOM'' strategy post, users are able to plot the next course of action with their friends by gathering around the "SOCOM Telestrator" tool and coordinating their next assault. Chock full of maps and modes from ''SOCOM: Confrontation'', the Telestrator is a powerful tool that the Home community can use to collaborate, strategize, and enhance their gameplay experience. On top of this, the TOC boasts a regional "SOCOM Leaderboard" that pulls data from the ''SOCOM'' site and updates Career stats (such as all-time ranking, kills, deaths, and kills/deaths ratio) in real-time. There is also a "TOC Terminal" where users can read up on the Crossroads, Urban Wasteland, Quarantine, Fallen, Kasbah, Desert Glory, and Frostfire maps. As of July 16, 2009, users can purchase ''SOCOM'' themed clothing for their avatars from the PlayStation Home shopping complex. This space is the first installment of the two-part ''SOCOM'' Home hub that is the ideal 3D locale for the ''SOCOM'' community to meet up and socialize. This space was released on June 18, 2009, for the North American version of PlayStation Home, on July 2, 2009, for the European version, and on August 27, 2009, for the Japanese version. On April 15, 2010, the awaited second part of the ''SOCOM'' Home hub was released. The "SOCOM: Opposing Force" (OPFOR) Game Space features a 5-Finger Fillet mini-game with leaderboards. The main attraction of the OPFOR Game Space, however, is the ability to assemble an assault weapon. Players who can assemble the assault weapon in 12 seconds will unlock a Golden AK-47 for use in ''SOCOM: Confrontation''. This makes the first Game Space in Home to award items for use in the game the space is based on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/04/14/new-in-playstation-home-socoms-golden-ak-47-monkey-island-space-items-and-gamers-lounge-refresh/|title=New in PlayStation Home: SOCOM’s Golden AK-47, Monkey Island Space &amp; Items, and Gamer’s Lounge Refresh|date=2010-04-14|author=Locust_Star|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''SOCOM: Confrontation'' received generally average to poor reviews as critics cited technical issues, lag, missing features, and only seven maps. Shortly after the release of the game, many complaint posts were made on the official SOCOM forums. A major bug present at the game's release caused many player's systems to crash while either looking for a match or at other various points during gameplay. Several patches have fixed the majority of these problems, but it came far too late.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2618">A '''sequential time''' is one in which the numbers form a normal sequence, such as 1:02:03 4/5/06 (two minutes and three seconds past 1 AM on 4 May 2006 [or April 5, 2006 in the United States] or the same time and date in the "06" year of any other century).  Short sequential times such as 1:23:45 or 12:34:56 appear every day. Larger sequential times rarely appear, such as 12:34:56 7/8/90, or 01:23:45 on 6/7/89. These times can be dependent on the date format being used; the ''month/day'' format will produce different results from the ''day/month'' format.

This term, however, is not limited to simple counting.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Other sequences, such as the decimal numbers of the mathematical constants [[pi|{{pi}}]] ([[Pi Day|3/14]]/1592), [[E (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]] (2/7/1828), and the [[square root of two]] (1/4/1421) are also noted. Number sequences such as the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] (1/1/2358) can also be found in time stamps.

These dates are particularly popular with couples getting married who are seeking unique wedding and anniversary dates. Dates with repeating numbers such as July 7, 2007 "7/7/07" are also popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manchir|first1=Michelle|title=Couples drawn to 12-13-14 wedding date|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-sequential-dates-met-20141211-story.html|accessdate=13 December 2014|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palindromic times can also be observed, e.g. 10:02:10 on 11/01/2001 (two minutes and ten seconds after 10 AM on 11 January 2001 in most of the world) was the first fully [[palindromic]] time sequence of the twenty-first century. The next palindromic time sequence will be at 02:02:10 at 11/01/2020 (two minutes and twenty-one seconds past 2 AM on 11 January 2020 in most of the world).

A sequential time occurred during [[Pi Day]] on 3/14/15 at 9:26:53.58979... following the sequence of pi to all digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://probability.ca/jeff/writing/PiInstant.html |title=Pi Instant |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Jeffrey S. |date=October 2014 |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simply Smiffy''' was a British [[comic strip]] in the UK comic magazine ''[[The Beano]]'', first appearing in issue 2254, dated 28 September 1985, and continuing for a year or so after that. It was drawn by [[Jerry Swaffield]].

A spin-off from [[The Bash Street Kids]], it featured Smiffy (a character from that strip) plus his brother, Normal Norman. With Norman being the [[double act|straight man]] of the two, the humour lay in the fact that Smiffy never managed to get anything right.

An earlier Smiffy spin-off appeared in The Beano in 1971 which featured Smiffy trying out inventions sent in by Beano readers. 

Simply Smiffy returned to The Beano in the Funsize Funnies in #3660 drawn by [[Paul Palmer (comics)|Paul Palmer]].

Another unrelated strip entitled Smiffy appeared in [[The Beezer]] in the 1960s which featured a boy who liked getting dirty. This strip was drawn by [[Bill Ritchie]].

Three decades before the development of radio broadcasting, the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' was the first service to electronically deliver a wide range of spoken and musical programming to a diverse audience. Although its inventor envisioned that the technology could be eventually expanded to serve a national or international audience, the technical limitations of the time ultimately limited its service area to just the city of Budapest.

== Establishment ==
The ''Telefon Hírmondó'' was founded by [[Tivadar Puskás]] (a few reviews translated his name as "Theodore Buschgasch"),&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt; an engineer and inventor who had worked with [[Thomas Edison]].&lt;ref name="ANguyen_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the ever-increasing pace of living, especially in major cities, Puskás recognized that daily newspapers, even with multiple editions, could no longer effectively keep up with developing events. He decided that this problem could be rectified through the introduction of a regularly updated audio news source.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftfrele11elek#page/456/mode/1up "Organisation und Einrichtung einer Telephonzeitung" ] (in German) by Tivadar Puskás, ''Zeitschrift für Elektrotechnik'', 1 October 1893, pages 456-461.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' editorial office was located near [[Astoria (Budapest)|Astoria]], at 6 Magyar Street.&lt;ref name="EKatz"&gt;{{cite web

At this time newspapers published in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] had to be authorized by the government. The contemporary [[press laws]] did not apply to a telephone newspaper, and government officials were wary that the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' could develop into an "important tool of power", as it could potentially be used to quickly spread strategic, political, and social information.&lt;ref name="matav_history"&gt;{{cite web

After two weeks of successful operation, on 2 March 1893 Puskás sent a letter to Béla Lukács, the Hungrarian Minister of Trade, requesting formal authorization to run his "newspaper", under the provisions of the Act No. XXXXI of 1888. Included was a request to be assigned fifty years of exclusive rights for operation within the city of Budapest, although the government was eventually unwilling to approve this portion of the request.&lt;ref name="LGabor"/&gt;

Tividar Puskás died on 16 March 1893, just one month after the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' had been launched. His brother, Albert Puskás, took over responsibility for the service, moved the center of operations to 24 Ersébet street, and resumed talks with the government for the formal operating authorization. Included in these discussions were any fees that should be paid to the government, plus limits on the operation's profits. In addition, because the initial design had subscribers using their existing telephones to call the ''Telefon Hírmondó'', there was a question as to how much the telephone company should be compensated for the use of its lines.

While these negotiations were ongoing, Albert Puskás sold the ''Telefon Hírmondó'', along with the associated patent rights, to a local engineer, István Popper, who, effective 26 September 1894, accepted the authorization conditions put forward by the government authorities.&lt;ref name="LGabor"/&gt; The permission to operate included the provision that the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' staff would write down the news reports in advance and have them signed by both the manager and the announcer, with copies of the pages sent three times a day to the Budapest Royal Prosecutor and the Budapest Police Department, plus the next day to the concerned ministries.&lt;ref name="LGabor"/&gt;

Popper created The Telefonhírmondó [[Joint stock company]], modernized the equipment, and broadened the range of the programmes.&lt;ref name="matav_history"/&gt; In October 1894, the offices were moved to 22 Kerepesi street, with Emile von Szveties acting as the technical director.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also constructed its own one-way telephone network, independent of the local telephone company, in order to provide a continuous service to subscribers.

== Technology ==
In 1892, Puskás patented, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a telephone switchboard that included relay equipment used to simultaneously transmit telephonic sounds to multiple locations, describing his invention as "A new method of organizing and fitting a telephone newspaper".&lt;ref name="EKatz"/&gt; Additional patents were received internationally, including a Canadian grant, issued in 1893, which characterized the invention as a "Telephonic News Dispenser".&lt;ref&gt;[https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=CA&amp;NR=44152A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=5&amp;date=18930905&amp;DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&amp;locale=en_EP# "Telephonic News Dispenser"], Canadian patent  number 44,152 issued to Theodor Puskas, Budapest, Hungary, 5th September, 1893, for a term of 6 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' used telephone lines provided by the local telephone company to distribute its programmes. It later received permission to string its own lines, and, under the guidance of its technical director, Nándor Szmazsenka, constructed a network&lt;ref name="matav_history"/&gt; that divided Budapest into twenty-seven districts. Starting with {{convert|43|mi|km}} of wire, the systems expanded to 372 miles (599&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;!--actually, the 372 is likely an overprecise misconversion of 600 km by Scientific American--&gt; in 1901, and {{convert|1100|mi|km}} in 1907.&lt;ref name="WGFitzGerald_1907"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-seven copper wires ran from microphone receivers in the [[Opera House]] to the central office, where the current would pass through a patented device that increased the sound. A main wire ran to each district, with branch wires to individual houses. The distribution to subscribers was regulated by another patented device.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt;

Vacuum-tube amplification would not be developed until the 1910s, so there were limited means for producing signals strong enough to be heard throughout the system. Therefore, for transmitting the news, announcers with especially loud voices — known as [[stentor]]s — were hired and instructed to speak as forcefully as possible into specially designed double-receivers.

Home installations normally consisted of two earphone telephone receivers, connected to long, flexible wires. A subscriber could listen using both earphones, or, alternately, two persons could listen by each using a single earphone. A loud buzzer, strong enough to be heard throughout a room even when the subscriber's receivers were not currently being listened to, was used to draw attention to important announcements. The American author Thomas Denison, who visited Budapest in 1901, found that transmission of spoken news was "highly satisfactory", but the audio quality for musical programmes, whether vocal or instrumental, "still leaves something to be desired".&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt;

Subscribers received programme listings, reviewing the day's schedule, that could be posted on the wall above their receivers. The "newspaper issue" began with a news bulletin and newspaper article summaries.

Thomas S. Denison wrote in 1901 that the service began transmitting at 10:30 AM, and generally ended at about 10:30 PM, although it ran later in the case of a concert or some other night event.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt; Stock exchange quotations were transmitted from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM to 11:15 AM, 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM, and again in the afternoon hours. Reports of the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrath]] and political news were given at 11:45 AM to 12:00 PM; when the Reichsrath was not in session, this period was filled by fuller reports of general and foreign news. At 1:30 PM and 6:00 PM a brief summary of news was provided. 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM was filled by concerts, varied by literary criticism, sporting events etc. On Sundays there were special items: news from 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM, and a concert from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM. Thursdays featured a concert for children at 6:00 PM.

In addition, special lectures or concerts for children were given once a week, and information for all the principal Hungarian and Austrian horse races was reported as soon as the results were known.

The ''Telefon Hírmondó'' news collection practices closely followed those commonly employed by print newspapers. A reporter would compose a story and submit it to the chief, who would sign it to fix responsibility. A clerk would then carefully copy the text with [[lithography|lithographic]] ink onto long galley slips which were transferred to a lithography stone, to be printed in parallel columns 6&amp;nbsp;inches wide and two feet long (16&amp;nbsp;cm x 60&amp;nbsp;cm). Then, two pressmen would take a number of impressions on a roller-movement hand press, using common printing paper. Each sheet was proofread by an assistant editor, with help of a copyholder. The verified sheet comprised part of the daily programme, and was added to the day's file along with the other sheets. A duplicate was cut up into convenient strips for the reading by the stentors.

Although the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' had much in common with newspaper publications, it had no leading articles or editorials. The editor alone was responsible in case of action against the paper for libel. By 1901, there had been two or three lawsuits against the editor, and he had prevailed in all the cases.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt; The service exchanged reports with the city newspapers, and the editors and managers of the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' received the same usual courtesies extended to the newspapers, such as passes and free tickets.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt;

== Staff ==

In 1901, the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' employed about 180 people during winter and 150 in the summer.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt; The staff consisted of a business manager, an editor-in-chief, four assistant editors, and nine reporters. The only ladies among the staff were those who sang in the concerts. At this time the service employed six stentors in the winter: four for duty, and two for alternates. Due to the effort required to speak loudly into the transmitters, readers took turns of ten minutes each. The stentors had strong and clear voices with distinct articulation to maintain clarity of sound over the telephone lines. In the summer, four stentors sufficed. In cases where only two stentors were on duty, they took turns of half an hour maximum.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt; By 1907, the system had a staff of over two hundred people, including two business managers, two principal editors, six sub-editors, twelve reporters, and eight stentors.&lt;ref name="WGFitzGerald_1907"/&gt;

== Subscribers ==

''Telefon Hírmondó'' began operations in 1893 with 60 subscribers, a total that grew to 700 in 1894, 4915 in 1895,&lt;ref name="EKatz"/&gt; 7629 in 1899,&lt;ref name="matav_history"/&gt; around 6200 in 1901, and 15,000 by 1907.&lt;ref name="WGFitzGerald_1907"/&gt; Some of the notable subscribers included the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph]], the [[Prime Minister]] [[Dezső Bánffy|Baron Banffy]], all the other members of the Hungarian Cabinet, Hungarian author [[Mór Jókai]], and the [[Mayor of Budapest]].&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFColton_1912"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Telefon Hírmondó'' appealed strongly to the more intellectual classes. The principal hotels in the city also subscribed to the service, and their guests were free to use the instrument.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt; The service could also be found in other places, including doctors' waiting rooms, barber shops, cafes, restaurants, and dentists' parlours.&lt;ref name="WGFitzGerald_1907"/&gt;

Thomas S. Denison wrote in the April 1901 issue of ''The World's Work'':

{{cquote|The paper is so well known and has accomplished so much that it appears to be beyond the stage of experiment so far as Budapest is concerned. One strong point in its favor is its early reports. In this respect the paper has a strong hold, for it is able to issue an "extra" at any hour of the day. Moreover, invalids and busy people may get as much news as they want with little effort. Indeed, the plan has so many advantages, that we shall probably soon see it in operation on this side of the ocean, with the improvements that Yankee ingenuity will be sure to devise.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt;}}

==Business model==

In 1901, the expenses of the newspaper ranged between 9000 and 10,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|krones]] per month (a krone was about 42 U.S. cents at that time). The fixed charges (telegrams, salaries, rent etc.) were about 7000 krones a month, and varied with the seasons.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt;

The annual subscription price of the service was 18 krones (the price of 10&amp;nbsp;kg sugar or 20&amp;nbsp;kg coffee in Budapest at that time).&lt;ref name="EKatz"/&gt; A receiver would be put into the subscriber's house at the company's expense. The subscriber was obliged to give security for a year's subscription, one-third of which had to be paid when the equipment was ready for use. The balance had to be paid in two equal installments, at the end of four months and eight months respectively.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt;

Short advertising messages were sandwiched between two interesting news items, so that they would command special attention.&lt;ref name="WGFitzGerald_1907"/&gt; In 1901, advertisers were charged one krone for a twelve-second message.&lt;ref name="TSDenison_WW_1901"/&gt; The system also experimented with coin-operated receivers located in public places, that took 20-[[Fillér]] coins.

In the 1920s, the company was granted the right to establish the first radio [[broadcasting]] station in Budapest, which began operating on 1 December 1925.&lt;ref name="matav_history"/&gt; The combined operations were now known as the ''Magyar Telefon Hirmondó és Rádió''. The services were offered in parallel for some time, both on radio waves and telephone wires. By 1930, ''Telefon Hírmondó'' had started other services, and it had 91079 subscribers.&lt;ref name="matav_history"/&gt; During [[World War II]], the wire network was destroyed, resulting in the cessation of telephone news services.

==Offshoots==

The ''Telefon Hírmondó'''s technology was patented in a number of countries, and in 1910 the rights to its use was licensed for the establishment of the ''[[Araldo Telefonico]]'' (Italian for "Telephone Herald") in [[Rome, Italy]]. By 1914''Araldo Telefonico'' surpassed 1300 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Manley M. Gillam, a former advertising manager of the [[New York Herald]], encountered the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' while touring Hungary, and obtained the American rights. In 1909 he established the [[United States Telephone Herald Company]], which supported associate companies established throughout the United States. Two of these briefly conducted commercial operations: the New Jersey Telephone Herald Company, located in [[Newark, New Jersey]], from 1911 to 1912,&lt;ref name="AFColton_1912"/&gt; and the Oregon Telephone Herald Company, located in [[Portland, Oregon]], during 1912-1913.

==Legacy==

There have been varying opinions whether the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' should be considered the first "broadcasting" operation, in part due to differing definitions of the term, including semantic differences, involving issues such as audience size, geographic coverage, and whether the transmission is by wire or wireless. Another factor is the ongoing evolution of the technologies used for the electronic distribution of news and entertainment, including the introduction of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s, followed by wired systems such as cable TV, and still later by hybrid approaches including audio streaming over the Internet.

A 1929 ''Chicago Daily News'' article that reviewed the history of the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' stated that the service's introduction qualified as "the first broadcasting".&lt;ref&gt;"Budapest Claims First Broadcasting", ''Charleston (West Virginia) Daily Mail'', June 12, 1929, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, reviewing the history of organized distributed audio in general, David L. Woods concluded that "The ''Telephonic Newspaper'' of Budapest marked the first regular 'broadcasting' operation."&lt;ref&gt;"Semantics versus the 'First' Broadcasting Station" by David L. Woods, ''Journal of Broadcasting'', Summer 1967, page 195.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1977 analysis of "broadcasting's oldest stations" by Joseph E. Baudino and John M. Kittross discounted Woods' conclusion, and explicitly eliminated the ''Telefon Hírmondó'' from consideration, explaining that "we prefer to restrict ourselves to ''radio'' broadcasting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trft.org/TRFTpix/CDHKittross.pdf |title="Broadcasting's Oldest Stations: An Examination of Four Claimants" |accessdate=2016-09-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305001831/http://www.trft.org/TRFTpix/CDHKittross.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2017 |df= }}, Joseph E.

Using news, literary and musical pieces that were transmitted through Telefon Hirmondó in 1897, Első Pesti Egyetemi Rádió, a Budapest based university station, for the first time, reconstructed a full "broadcast day". It was transmitted live via telephone from the same room where Telefon Hirmondó operated.&lt;ref name="eper"&gt;{{cite web

'''''The 5th Monkey''''' is a Brazilian-American 1990 [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed and written by [[Eric Rochat]] and starring [[Ben Kingsley]]. The film was based on the novel ''Le Cinquieme Singe'' by Jacques Zibi. [[The Cannon Group]] founder [[Menahem Golan]] produced via his [[21st Century Film Corporation]], following the demise of Cannon.

The original music score was composed by [[Robert O. Ragland]].

==Plot==
Cunda (Kingsley) lives deep in the Brazilian [[rainforest]] and is intent on making enough money so he can marry a widow in his village. However, his trade - capturing snakes for scientists - pays very little money, and he's in direct competition with other suitors.

One day, Cunda is bitten by a [[snake]], and he crawls to the river to recover. While going through the agonizing recovery, he has an hallucination of four chimpanzees sitting in the river. Recovered, he returns home and finds the four chimpanzees waiting for him, and his efforts to shoo them away fail. Knowing that chimpanzees are not native to [[Brazil]], he decides that they are a kind of supernatural gift for him. Believing this, he decides to take them to "the city" to sell them.

The journey isn't easy from the start; he discovers that he can't tie them on a rope and drag them, and the only way is to coax them. They stumble into a gold-panning camp, where Cunda is forced to work in order to pay off an old debt. When one of the monkeys is taken as payment, Cunda must figure how to retrieve the monkey and escape. Later, he, the monkeys and the adults of a village are [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] by mercenaries. Cunda and the monkeys escape, along with a village woman who refuses to leave his side. Arriving at a small town, a confusing sequence results in one of the monkeys disappearing, and Cunda becoming the servant of the local rich woman who has taken it upon herself to take care of the monkeys. Cunda now has to solve these two problems, and deal with the fact of the [[village]] woman's attraction to him plus his growing fondness of the monkeys.

'''The Kliq''' was a backstage group in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]) during the mid-1990s, composed of [[Scott Hall]], [[Kevin Nash]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Triple H]], [[Sean Waltman]], and for a short time [[Justin Credible]]. Several of the men, most notably Michaels, Nash, and Hall, wielded an immense amount of power within the company at the time, which they used to positively influence one another's careers.

In May 1996, The Kliq broke character at a [[House show|live event]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in an unscripted incident referred to as the "Curtain Call", which had far-reaching ramifications for the WWF specifically and the wrestling world as a whole. At a time when professional wrestling organizations worked to maintain [[Kayfabe|the illusion of storylines and characters]], the Curtain Call marked the first time that such high-profile performers had so publicly broken character, forcing the WWF and other wrestling organizations to begin acknowledging the scripted elements of their programming.

The Kliq was also the primary catalyst for two of the most well known [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stables]] in wrestling history: the [[The New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and the WWF/E, and [[D-Generation X]] (DX) in the WWF/E. Of the Kliq, Michaels and Waltman would serve in both groups; Triple H was a member of DX while Nash and Hall performed with the nWo.

== History ==
=== Formation and early history ===
The Kliq was formed in 1994 by real-life best friends Scott Hall (then known as Razor Ramon), Kevin Nash (Diesel), Michael Hickenbottom (Shawn Michaels) and Sean Waltman (1-2-3 Kid). In January 1995, Paul Levesque left WCW and arrived in the WWF as Hunter Hearst Helmsley (Triple H) and became the next member of The Kliq. Each man enjoyed a tremendous amount of popularity with fans, which allotted them a particular degree of control over their own careers. Nash, Hall, and Michaels, then among the company's most popular performers, came up with the idea of forming a backstage alliance, which would potentially allow them to consolidate even more power within the company. [[Bret Hart]], another of the company's top performers at the time, claims in his autobiography ''Hitman'' that he was also asked if he wanted to be part of The Kliq, but declined the offer: "The thing I remember most about that tour was Shawn, Razor, and Nash talking to me in [[Hamburg]] about the idea of forming a clique of top guys who strictly took care of their own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brethart.com/bio/columns/trip-down-memory-lane-saskatoon-regina |title=A trip down memory lane (Saskatoon &amp; Regina) |first=Bret |last=Hart |authorlink=Bret Hart |year=2007 |publisher=BretHart.com |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917002634/http://www.brethart.com/bio/columns/trip-down-memory-lane-saskatoon-regina |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levesque mentioned on the 2013 ''Triple H – Thy Kingdom Come'' DVD that he was recruited to the Kliq by Kevin Nash because he didn't do drugs or alcohol, and thus could serve as the group's  [[designated driver]] after events.

Michaels claims that the name "The Kliq" was originally coined by [[Lex Luger]], due to the closeness of the five friends backstage.&lt;ref name=hbk-p206&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |isbn=1-4165-2645-5|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=November 2006|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, Lex Luger had suggested that [[Davey Boy Smith]] created the name, because the five kept "clicking", referring to how often they talked. At the suggestion of [[Vince Russo]], Michaels began referring to his fans as his "Kliq".&lt;ref name=hbk-p230&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |isbn=1-4165-2645-5|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=November 2006|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels wrote in his 2006 autobiography that he disliked the idea, and that it "was not a huge hit" with the fans.&lt;ref name=hbk-p230/&gt;

In 1995, the men's growing popularity as performers led to the group developing a heavy influence on [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booking]]– the power to schedule matches and decide match outcomes, write storylines, and largely determine the trajectory of other performers' careers.&lt;ref name=sd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/faq/?style=dark&amp;article=shanedouglas|title=FAQ: Shane Douglas|publisher=WrestleView.com|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group used this power to give one another preferential treatment, usually scheduling each other in heavily promoted, high-profile matches, often against one another: During the period of 1994 through 1996 particularly, Ramon had high-profile feuds with 1-2-3 Kid, Diesel, and Michaels, while Diesel and Michaels formed a championship-winning tag-team called [[Two Dudes with Attitudes]].

The group's perceived abuse of power led to animosity amongst other wrestlers, particularly lower-ranking members of the company. In one instance, performer [[Carl Ouellet]], then performing as Jean-Pierre Lafitte, claimed that his scheduled defeat of Diesel-- an event which would have marked an upturn in his own popularity and proven to be a turning point in his career-- was vetoed by Michaels, leading to a backstage confrontation between Ouellet and Michaels.&lt;ref name="SLAM! Interview 2008"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Clevett|title=Ouellet wants another run with WWE|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/07/28/6288341.html|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam! Sports|date=2008-08-06|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match between the two ended in a [[Professional wrestling#Countout|double-countout]] because Lafitte refused to be pinned by Nash.&lt;ref name=ouelett-slamsports&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestling/ouellet.html|title=Pierre Carl Ouellet Profile|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam! Sports|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, the group effectively ended Ouellet's career with the company by scheduling him to repeatedly lose low-profile matches. In his autobiography, Michaels said that "we (The Kliq) [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Burial|buried]] him (Ouellet)." Lafitte left the company soon after the incident; contrary to rumors, Michaels says that WWF Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] did not fire Lafitte.&lt;ref name=hbk-p206/&gt;

=== The MSG "Curtain Call" ===

In April 1996, Nash and Hall signed contracts with [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], the WWF's top competitor, with whom the company was embroiled in a [[Monday Night Wars|bitter rivalry]]. Accounts have differed as to what led to the men's departure: Wrestling commentators have speculated that their contracts were allowed to expire in order to cripple The Kliq's influence in the company,&lt;ref name=vince&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_1_3/ai_74010845|title=When Vince McMahon Wasn't a Genius – management of the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling|publisher=Wrestling Digest|date=June 2001|accessdate=2008-08-15}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; while official WWE media asserts that Nash and Hall were simply offered more money by WCW than the WWF was able to promise them at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''The Monday Night War''. [[WWE Home Video]]. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash and Hall's last contracted match for the WWF took place on May 19, 1996 at [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=moon156&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment|first=Shaun|last=Assael|author2=Mooneyham, Mike |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]]|year=2002|isbn=1-4000-5143-6|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hbk-p226&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |isbn=1-4165-2645-5|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=November 2006|pages=226–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Levesque and Nash were wrestling as [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]]s, while Michaels and Hall were [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]]s.&lt;ref name=moon156/&gt; At the end of the night, Michaels wrestled Nash in a [[Professional wrestling match types#steel Cages|steel cage match]]. Immediately after the match, Ramon entered the ring and hugged Michaels; this was not seen as unusual in-story, as both wrestlers were fan favorites. However, Levesque then entered the ring and hugged Hall, followed by Nash. The four wrestlers then [[group hug]]ged for several seconds before they turned to face the crowd with their arms raised together.&lt;ref name=moon156/&gt;&lt;ref name=hbk-p226/&gt; Waltman, who himself would leave for WCW shortly after the incident, was in [[Drug rehabilitation|drug rehab]] at the time and thus didn't participate.&lt;ref&gt;''Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW'' The Kliq&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hunter Hearst Helmsley in 1996 (2).jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Triple H]] was the sole member of The Kliq punished for the "Curtain Call"]]
Their actions – dubbed the "Curtain Call" – scandalized WWF management. At the time, most major wrestling promotions, the WWF included, prided themselves on maintaining [[kayfabe]] – the illusion that all of the events which transpired in-ring were real and unscripted, and that wrestlers' on-screen rivalries extended outside of the ring. The company had a strict policy of onscreen rivals not breaking character by associating with one another on WWF programming, as a means of maintaining storylines and feuds between wrestlers, which sometimes lasted for years and could unravel in seconds if the two feuding wrestlers were seen associating as friends in public.&lt;ref name=moon157&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment|first=Shaun|last=Assael|author2=Mooneyham, Mike |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]]|year=2002|isbn=1-4000-5143-6|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWF Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] was reported to have initially given his tacit approval for a "farewell" ceremony, but did not realize that it would become so elaborate.&lt;ref name=hbk-p226/&gt; The severity of the incident was further compounded by the revelation that the event-- which was not broadcast on television-- had been filmed by two fans, Mani Mohtadi and Jason Cosmides, who had smuggled a [[camcorder]] past security. Stills from the footage were widely disseminated online and in wrestling magazines at the time, bringing the Curtain Call to a wider audience than if it had not been recorded.

Because Hall and Nash had already confirmed their departure for WCW, they escaped punishment.&lt;ref name=moon157/&gt; Michaels, who was the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] at the time and one of the promotion's biggest drawing performers, could not be punished.&lt;ref name=hbk-p226/&gt; The punishment fell solely on Levesque, who was demoted from being a championship contender to wrestling inexperienced or lesser experienced wrestlers for the next several months.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite video|title=It's Our Time|people=[[Triple H|Levesque, Paul]]; [[Chyna|Laurer, Joanie]]|date=1999-11-23|medium=[[VHS]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002EPGA|accessdate=2008-08-11|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, win the WWF Intercontinental Championship five months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322528 |title=Hunter Hearst Helmsley's first Intercontinental title reign |accessdate=2008-08-07 |publisher=[[WWE]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423094214/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322528 |archivedate=2007-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levesque's unquestioning acceptance of his punishment had the unintended side effect of rehabilitating his image in the eyes of other performers who held a grudge against him for his time with the Kliq: according to [[The Undertaker]] in ''HHH: The Game'' DVD that when Levesque first arrived in the WWF, he was perceived of as arrogant and self-centered, but that by accepting his punishment, he earned legitimate respect.

The incident turned out to have a major impact on the WWF's future. For the first time in modern pro-wrestling history, a major company was forced to acknowledge that its events were scripted; McMahon would later use this to his advantage in the development of several [[metafiction|meta-storylines]], including a skit on the October 6, 1997 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'' in which Michaels and Levesque, both in character, played footage of the Curtain Call incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John |last=Petrie |title=Monday Night Raw: October 6, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |url=http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw100697 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030610164804/http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw100697 |archivedate=June 10, 2003 |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Curtain Call, Levesque had been booked into the finals of the [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996 King of the Ring]] tournament during the following summer, but his place – and the [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that usually went with it – would instead go to [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], igniting his [[Stone Cold Steve Austin#Austin 3:16 (1996–1997)|rise toward superstardom]], an event which ultimately helped the WWF defeat WCW in the [[Monday Night Wars]].&lt;ref name=hbk-p226/&gt;&lt;ref name=moon157/&gt; Levesque's acceptance of his punishment and the respect it earned him resulted in him only suffering short-term repercussions. He would go on to win the following year's [[King of the Ring (1997)|King of the Ring]] tournament and later went on to become a 14-time [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|world champion]], beginning with his WWF Championship victory over [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] the night after [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=hhh-slamsports&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/helmsley.html|title=Hunter Hearst Helmsley – Slam!

Sports|accessdate=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrelated to the Curtain Call aftermath, Levesque would later go on to marry McMahon's daughter, Stephanie, and take a significant role in the day-to-day business dealings of the company.

=== The nWo and D-Generation X ===
{{Main|D-Generation X|The New World Order (professional wrestling)|l2=nWo}}
When Hall and Nash went to WCW, they formed [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]] tag team, as well as the New World Order (nWo) stable alongside [[Hulk Hogan]].&lt;ref name=bischoff-pg210&gt;{{cite book|title=Controversy Creates Cash|first=Eric|last=Bischoff|authorlink=Eric Bischoff|author2=Roberts, Jeremy|isbn=1-4165-2729-X|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=October 2006|pages=210–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than see the breaking of kayfabe as a crisis moment for professional wrestling, the WCW decided to exploit it by introducing their own meta-storyline that incorporated fans' growing awareness of the backstage politics of pro-wrestling: Upon Nash and Hall's arrival, they were implied to still be working for the WWF, staging an "invasion" of the WCW.

When Waltman later jumped to WCW, he also joined the nWo as Syxx, often working closely with the Outsiders and forming the trio known as the Wolfpac. Many fans criticized Kevin Nash for his booking tenure in WCW since it displayed the same self-promoting behavior associated with The Kliq on an even larger scale. Fans often pointed to Nash booking himself to win the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] from the then-undefeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] and the [[Fingerpoke of Doom|subsequent match with Hogan]] as the most grievous of his "offenses". Nash, however, claims that he did not have booking power at the time of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Shoot with Kevin Nash|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=3342|people=[[Kevin Nash|Nash, Kevin]]|medium=[[DVD]]|accessdate=2008-08-18|publisher=RF Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash's innocence claim is disputed in several [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] interviews by various WCW wrestlers from the time who claimed that he, Hogan and several others often refused to put other wrestlers over in order to keep themselves as the main stars.

[[File:X-Pac 111007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Sean Waltman]] was a member of both the nWo and D-Generation X]]
Meanwhile, Michaels and Levesque began to persuade WWF management to let them pair up on screen, but management was hesitant and wanted to keep The Kliq separated on-screen.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; They eventually aligned together in the faction [[D-Generation X]] (DX), with Levesque's "Hunter Hearst Helmsley" fictional persona gradually transformed and re-dubbed Triple H or HHH, and alongside Levesque's then-girlfriend and on-screen female "bodyguard" [[Chyna]].&lt;ref name=time/&gt; [[Rick Rude]] also temporarily joined the group (as a sort of on-screen bodyguard for Michaels), though his membership ended when he signed with WCW after his WWF contract expired in early November 1997.

DX eventually became as influential to the Monday Night Wars as the nWo. DX's antics also went on to help spark [[The Attitude Era]] in the WWF.&lt;ref name=hbk-p252&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |isbn=1-4165-2645-5|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=November 2006|pages=252–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sean Waltman was fired from WCW, he was hired by WWF and joined DX, replacing the injured Michaels.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; The nWo's hand sign, often referred to as the "Wolf Head", was originally used by the Kliq members in the WWF.&lt;ref name=circus&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestling's One Ring Circus|first=Scott|last=Keith|isbn=0-8065-2619-X|publisher=[[Kensington Books|Citadel Press]]|year=2004|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waltman introduced the hand symbol to the nWo, Hall and Nash brought the hand sign with them, and it became widely used by the nWo members and fans worldwide.&lt;ref name=circus/&gt;

On the October 6, 1997 ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', Shawn Michaels alluded to this off-screen connection. After Bret Hart claimed to have destroyed the Kliq and to have "run [Scott Hall and Kevin Nash] outta town", Michaels declared, "The Kliq owns this [professional wrestling] business", and said that it had really undergone "expansion" rather than "destruction". During a brief period in 1998, after Waltman's return to the WWF as X-Pac, in promos the members of D-Generation X made numerous references to their "friends" in the WCW. On the April 27, 1998 ''Raw'' (recorded live in [[Hampton, Virginia]]), DX (by now composed of Triple H, Waltman, [[Billy Gunn]], [[Road Dogg]] and [[Chyna]]) staged a mock "invasion" protest/paramilitary take-over of the nearby [[Norfolk Scope]], where ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' was being held. Triple H, riding in a [[Willys M38|M38]], chanted "[[Moses|Let our people go!]]" through a megaphone during the incident. Waltman called out, "We just wanted to say 'what's up' to our boys Kevin Nash and Scott Hall". DX also led a chant of "WCW sucks" by fans outside the arena who had tickets to the show (some of whom, Triple H alleged, had been given free tickets to ''Nitro'' by WCW in order to boost crowd numbers).

In 2002, after WCW had gone out of business, The nWo was reformed in the WWF with Hall, Nash and Hogan, the group's initial members. Hogan soon left the group after being attacked by Nash and Hall as a result of his turning into a fan favorite at [[WrestleMania X8]]. Other former members, including [[Big Show]] and Waltman, joined the group. Later, Shawn Michaels – after years away from the ring –was introduced by Kevin Nash as the newest member of the nWo, and Michaels promised the rest of the group that he would soon deliver Triple H. After weeks of lobbying for Triple H's services, a backstage promo of The nWo wishing Triple H luck before the match aired. This included 4 members of The Kliq (Shawn, Kevin, Pac and Triple H), as Big Show appeared wishing Triple H good luck as well. The nWo told Triple H to "throw up the hand signal" if he needed any help out there. Shortly thereafter, Nash suffered a torn quadriceps (after returning the same night after time off due to a biceps injury) during a ten-man tag-team match, and the following week Vince McMahon disbanded The nWo. [[Eric Bischoff]] (acting as the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand General Manager) later tried to make Michaels Triple H's manager. This led to a short-lived reformation of DX, as Triple H turned on him the same night, setting off a long and heated [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] that took approximately two years to resolve.&lt;ref name=hbk-p317&gt;{{cite book|title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |isbn=1-4165-2645-5|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=November 2006|pages=317–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Reference only covers from where it says "This led to a......" --&gt; The year after, Nash returned from injury as a fan favorite and sided with Michaels against [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] (Triple H, [[Ric Flair]], [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] and [[Randy Orton]]).

=== Later formations ===
Michaels and Triple H have reformed D-Generation X, first returning together for a six-month stint on the June 12, 2006 edition of Monday Night Raw. They would feud against [[The Spirit Squad]] ([[Kenny Dykstra|Kenny]], [[Johnny Jeter|Johnny]], [[Nick Mitchell|Mitch]], [[Dolph Ziggler|Nicky]], and [[Michael Brendli|Mikey]]), [[Big Show]] and Vince McMahon, and later the team of Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), until Triple H's legitimate knee injury in the beginning of 2007. They would reform again on August 2009 during Shawn Michaels' last year in the WWE. During this year, D-Generation X would capture the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Unified WWE Tag Team Championships]] at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs (2009)|TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs]] against Jericho and Big Show, which would become the start of the first and only title reign for Triple H and Shawn Michaels as a tag team. D-Generation X would later go on to disband in March 2010 (after losing the tag Team titles to Big Show and [[The Miz]]). Michaels would then focus heavily on ending the winning streak of [[The Undertaker]] at WrestleMania, having failed to do so at [[WrestleMania XXV]], and he would put his career on the line for their second WrestleMania encounter at [[WrestleMania XXVI]] which he would go on to lose and therefore end his career.

Hall, Nash and Waltman (then working for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]) would reform the nWo in a stable called [[The New World Order (professional wrestling)#Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010)|The Band]], where Hall and Nash won the [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]], but Hall and Waltman were released shortly after (and Nash's contract would expire later on in the year).

On April 2, 2011, The Kliq, consisting of Nash, Waltman, Triple H and Shawn Michaels, made a special appearance as Shawn Michaels was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] 2011. Scott Hall decided not to attend the Hall of Fame ceremony or other [[WrestleMania XXVII]] festivities due to concerns of remaining sober. Hall has battled many drug and alcohol problems and suffered from various health problems in the past years and credits his friends in The Kliq for helping him through his battles. In 2014, at the conclusion of Scott Hall's Hall of Fame induction, the members of The Kliq joined him onstage and reunited for the 1st time since the curtain call incident. They reunited again in 2015 on an episode of Raw, and then again at Nash's Hall Of Fame induction.

A December 2014 episode of [[WWE Network]] show ''The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW'' focused on The Kliq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/90228/next-nxt-star-expected-to-move-to-main-roster-top-bouts-for-the-rumble-hogan-talks-acceptance-of-gay-community-in-wrestling-new-title-belt-and-lots-more-wwe-news-.html?p=1|title=Next NXT Star Expected to Move to Main Roster, Top Bouts for the Rumble, Hogan talks of acceptance of gay community in wrestling, New Title Belt? and lots more WWE News|publisher=Pro Wrestling Insider|accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other associates ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Although the core group of The Kliq has long been known there have always been rumours, suggestions and unofficial members either within the group or on the fringes looking in. The most consistently mentioned name is that of [[Justin Credible|Peter Polaco]] who at the time of The Kliq's formation was working for WWF as Aldo Montoya and would later go on to gain fame as Justin Credible in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]. He apparently became friends with Scott Hall who offered to mentor him and from there he ended up travelling with the rest of the group until he negotiated his WWF release in 1997. Polaco's association with the group is also lent weight by the fact that upon his return to WWF after the closure of ECW in 2001 he instantly aligned himself on TV with [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] with the two going on to form a short lived stable under the name of [[X-Factor (professional wrestling)|X-Factor]] along with [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] as the group's enforcer.

Another name that has had a long association with The Kliq is that of [[Louie Spicolli]], who was wrestling for the WWF in the early to mid 90's under the name of Rad Radford. Spicolli's friendship with the group, much like Polaco's, descends from Scott Hall taking the youngster under his wing and having him travel with the rest of them on the road. Spicolli left the WWF after only a few months when he was released to deal with issues that he was having with substance abuse at the time. During this time, Spicolli worked for ECW for a number of months, during which time he could be seen using the now infamous "Wolf Head" signal during tapings and matches. In a later interview he denied the association, and asserted that the "Wolf Head" symbol was originally Bret Hart's gesture and The Wolfpac stole it. He said he used the symbol in ECW in order to "take it back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ECW wrestlers talk about the KLIQ |publisher=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_7v8nMGPOQ&amp;feature=related}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1997, Spicolli returned to the spotlight by signing with WCW and was soon placed on screen as the [[Lackey (manservant)|lackey]] of Scott Hall, with the two engaging in a feud with [[Larry Zbyszko]]. However, the feud was never able to finish due to Spicolli's untimely death from a drug overdose at the age of 27. His death was never publicly acknowledged by any member of the group at the time, with only Zbyszko mentioning it on screen.

Prior to her death in 2016, [[Chyna]] had association to the group, not only as an original member of [[D-Generation X]], but also through her relationship with Triple H, along with another long-term relationship with Sean Waltman. Her link to The Kliq was unclear, with the details of her split from Triple H in 2000 never made public. Her relationship to Waltman was notorious for the release of a [[Celebrity sex tape|sextape]] in 2004 and Chyna being arrested for domestic assault in 2005 after a drug-fueled fight. It was thought the pair were no longer on speaking terms after going their separate ways to deal with a number of personal issues, including drug and alcohol addictions, as well as issues with depression. When Triple H was asked in 2015 about inducting Chyna into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], he cited the conflict between her work in the adult industry and WWE's current target audience as a reason it would not happen. However, when both Triple H and his wife [[Stephanie McMahon]] were asked the same question after Chyna died, they were both in favor of inducting her.

[[File:Wolfsgruß Graue Woelfe.jpg|thumb|upright|The "Turkish Wolf" hand gesture used by members of The Kliq]]
Other people in the business have often had their names dropped into the hat but have never said either way whether they consider themselves to be a part of the group. The highest profile of these is probably [[Sid Eudy]], better known as Sycho Sid or Sid Vicious. Another high-profile name is [[Rick Rude]], who was both a member of the original [[D-Generation X]] and the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]]. Rude was involved in an incident in which he appeared on both ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' in the same night, protesting on Nitro about the treatment of [[Bret Hart]] during the [[Montreal Screwjob]] (Rude actually appeared on the live ''Nitro'' show clean shaven and with a mustache an hour before appearing on ''Raw'' (which was taped a week earlier) with a full beard). How this affected his standing in the group is unclear, however it has gone on record that prior to his death Rude was one of the most respected people in the business by members of The Kliq.

[[Konnan]] is said to have enjoyed a very close friendship with both Nash and Hall during his run in WCW and was a member of both the nWo and the Wolfpac. Konnan was also influential in bringing in Sean Waltman to [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] for his run with the company throughout 2007 and 2008, with the two aligning on screen for a while as a part of [[La Legión Extranjera]]. [[Curt Hennig]], who was once a tag team partner of Hall during their days in the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/c/curt-hennig-scott-hall/ Online World of Wrestling – Curt Hennig &amp; Scott Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; is also said to have had a long-running friendship with the group, and spent large amounts of his career working either with or against members of the group in various promotions.

The [[Bullet Club]] stable seen in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Ring of Honor]] pay homage to The Kliq by using the Wolfpac hand symbol, as well as the use of the "2 Sweet" catchphrase and the DX-style crotch chops. Its WWE offshoot, The Club, also uses the Wolfpac hand symbol. Bullet Club members [[Adam Cole]] and [[The Young Bucks]] (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) also created a subgroup named Superkliq.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

The '''Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour''' (also known as the '''Prohibited Tour''') was a comedy tour by American comedian and talk show host [[Conan O'Brien]]. Its title is a reference to the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|2010 ''Tonight Show'' host and timeslot conflict]], which resulted in O'Brien resigning from his position as host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in January 2010. O'Brien reached a settlement with [[NBC]] that barred him from appearing on television until September 2010, but it did not bar him from performing before a live audience in a concert setting. From April through June 2010, O'Brien performed 42 shows in the United States and Canada.

O'Brien announced on March 11, 2010 via his [[Twitter]] account that he would embark on a 30-city live tour beginning April 12. Even with the unconventional marketing campaign of a single Twitter announcement, many locations sold out within hours of the tweet and additional shows were added on to meet demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-03-11/entertainment/chi-100311-conan-obrien-chicago-theatre_1_conan-o-brien-tonight-show-late-night-institution|title=Conan O'Brien coming to Chicago Theatre, tickets sell out immediately|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=March 11, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tour, O'Brien announced that his new show, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', would debut on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in November 2010. A documentary following O'Brien during the tour, ''[[Conan O'Brien Can't Stop]]'', was released in June 2011.

In January 2010, [[late-night talk show]] hosts [[Conan O'Brien]] and [[Jay Leno]] engaged in a public relations conflict over who should host ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Due to low ratings for ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', [[NBC]] announced a schedule change, moving Leno from 10:00 pm to 11:30 pm, and O'Brien from 11:30 pm to 12:00 am. This change resulted in a public outcry and public demonstrations largely in support of O'Brien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/01/future-for-nbcs-the-jay-leno-show-is-up-in-the-air.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Jay Leno may regain 'Tonight Show' perch (Updated) | date=January 7, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="access"&gt;''[[Access Hollywood]]'' article: "[http://www.accesshollywood.com/jay-leno-heading-back-to-late-night-conan-obrien-weighing-options_article_27490 Jay Leno Heading Back To Late Night, Conan O’Brien Weighing Options]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTConanSupport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/business/media/25conan.html|title=O’Brien Undone by His Media-Hopping Fans|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=January 24, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100128033202/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/business/media/25conan.html| archivedate= 28 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytsupport&gt;{{cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/arts/television/14fans.html|title=In Leno vs. O’Brien, Fans Show Allegiance Online|work=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2010|page=C1| accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien indicated that he would quit his show and leave the network if NBC were to implement it, citing the "destruction" of the venerable franchise which had aired at or around 11:30 pm for over 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Citlali on Tue, January 19, 2010 – 14:14 |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/01/13/10/conan-obrien-quit-if-tonight-show-rescheduled |title=Conan O'Brien to quit if 'Tonight Show' rescheduled&amp;nbsp;– 14&amp;nbsp;Jan&amp;nbsp;2010 |publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com |date=January 14, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour differed from his television shows in that there was no desk or celebrity interviews, but presented as more of a variety show than a stand-up routine. Many elements from TV were incorporated into the show, including video bits, musical and comic performers, and cameo appearances by celebrities.

Just hours before the first show of the tour, O'Brien announced that he would host a new show on cable station [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], titled ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', which debuted in November 2010.&lt;ref name="foxnewstbs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="conantbs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/how-the-conan-obrien-tbs-deal-happened/?src=busln|first=Bill |last=Carter|title=How the Conan O’Brien-TBS Deal Happened|date=April 12, 2010|accessdate=April 12, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the announcement of the television series, TBS also announced a one-hour TBS Special, featuring several writers for ''Conan'', as well Watts.&lt;ref name="tbsspecial"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.turner.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=5177 |title=Andy Richter and Conan O’Brien Writers Team Up for One-Hour TBS Special |publisher=Turner Newsroom |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ref improve|date=August 2013}}
"'''The Spanish Inquisition'''" is a series of [[sketch comedy|sketches]] in ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes|Series 2 Episode 2]], first broadcast 22 September 1970, [[parody]]ing the real-life [[Spanish Inquisition]].  This episode is itself entitled "The Spanish Inquisition".  The sketches are notable for their principal [[catchphrase]], "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!", which has become a  frequently-used quote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGNADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT392&amp;lpg=PT392#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=1001 TV Series: You Must Watch Before You Die |author= Paul Condon | publisher=Cassell Illustrated|isbn=9781788400466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoyalAxDItYC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Conspiracy Theories: The Philosophical Debate|editor= David Coady |chapter=Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition!

Keeley |publisher=Routledge; 1 edition |date=28 March 2006|isbn= 978-0754652502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nobody-expects-the-spanish-inquisition |title=Nobody Expects The Spanish Inquisition |work=Know Your Meme }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the sketch uses music from the composition [[Devil's Galop]] by [[Charles Williams (composer)|Charles Williams]]. Rewritten audio versions of the sketches were included on ''[[Another Monty Python Record]]'' in 1971.

==Plot synopsis==
This is a recurring sketch always predicated on an unrelated sketch in which one character mentions that they "didn't expect a Spanish Inquisition!", often in irritation at being questioned by another. The first appearance of the Spanish Inquisition occurs in a drawing room set in "[[Jarrow]], 1912". A mill worker ([[Graham Chapman]]) enters the room and tells a woman sitting on a couch knitting ([[Carol Cleveland]]) that "one of the cross beams has gone out askew on the [[treadle]]". When she says she doesn't know what he's talking about, the mill worker gets defensive and says, "I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition!" Then the Inquisition — consisting of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Ximénez]] ([[Michael Palin]]) and his assistants, Cardinal Biggles ([[Terry Jones]]) (who resembles his namesake [[Biggles]] wearing a leather aviator's helmet and goggles) and Cardinal Fang ([[Terry Gilliam]]) — burst into the room to the sound of a jarring [[sting (music)|musical sting]]. Ximénez shouts, with a particular and high-pitched emphasis on the first word: "NO-body expects the Spanish Inquisition!"

After entering, Ximénez begins listing their weapons ("fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency"), but interrupts himself as he keeps forgetting to mention additional weapons and has to begin his list over again.&lt;ref name="edelman"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SRnDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA332#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Computing the Mind: How the Mind Really Works |author= Shimon Edelman |page= 332 |publisher=Oxford University Press USA |date=25 December 2008|isbn= 978-0195320671 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/monty-python-s-25-funniest-quotes/the-spanish-inquisition/ |title=Monty Python's 25 funniest quotes |work=The Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt; After several attempts, Ximénez states that he will come in again, and herds the Inquisition back off the set. The [[double act|straight man]] mill worker repeats the [[cue (theatrical)|cue line]], the Inquisition bursts back in (complete with jarring chord), and the introduction is tried anew. But Ximénez fails again and tries to get Cardinal Biggles to do the introduction, but Biggles is also unsuccessful.

Ximénez decides to forget the introduction and has Cardinal Fang read out charges of [[heresy]] against the woman. The woman pleads innocent, and the cardinals respond with laughter (as an on-screen caption reads "DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER") and threats (as the on-screen caption changes to "DIABOLICAL ACTING"). Ximénez intends to [[torture]] the woman with "the [[Rack (torture)|rack]]", but Cardinal Biggles instead produces a dish-drying rack. This rack is tied to the woman as Biggles pretends to turn a lever, but it has no effect whatsoever.

The Inquisition returns in a later sketch as an older woman (Marjorie Wilde) shares photographs with another woman (Cleveland), who rips them up as they are handed to her. When the older woman presents a photo of the Spanish Inquisition hiding behind the coal shed, the other woman says, "I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition!" The three cardinals then reappear and take the older woman away to a dungeon.

Biggles tries to torture the woman by poking her repeatedly with soft cushions. When this fails, Ximénez orders Fang to get "the comfy chair", which is brought out and the woman placed in it. Ximénez states that she must stay in the chair "until lunch time with only a cup of coffee at 11", and begins to shout at her to confess – only to have Biggles break down and confess. This frustrates Ximénez, but he cannot complain about it since he is distracted by a cartoon character from the next scene.

At the end of the show, in the "Court Charades" sketch, a judge (Jones) who is also a [[defendant]] in an obscenity trial at the [[Old Bailey]] is casually sentenced by another judge (Chapman) to be [[death by burning|burned at the stake]]. The convicted judge responds, "Blimey, I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition!"  The whole court rises and looks expectantly at the witness entrance door. As the closing credits of the episode begin, the Inquisitors race out of a house and hop on a [[double-decker bus]] to the Old Bailey, all to the tune of "[[Devil's Galop]]". As the Inquisitors ride in the bus, they comment worriedly that they are running out of credits (which are seen on screen) and are panicked that the sketch will soon end. The bus reaches the courthouse and the cardinals charge up the steps of the Old Bailey. They finally burst into the now empty courtroom, only for Ximénez to shout, "NO-body expects the Span-oh, bugger.", as the words "THE END" appear on-screen.

In the ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]'' stage show the sketch ends when Ximénez orders Biggles to "torture" the victim (who is sitting in the comfy chair) by giving her a glass of cold milk from the fridge. When Biggles opens the door, the Man in the Fridge ([[Eric Idle]]) emerges and begins singing the "[[Galaxy Song]]" to the victim, while the Inquisition exit through the fridge.

==Related sketches==
Cardinal Ximénez briefly appears two episodes later ("The [[Buzz Aldrin]] Show") in a [[vox populi|vox pop]], again displaying difficulty counting (in this instance, the kinds of aftershave he uses). Later in that episode during the "Police Constable [[Pan Am]] Sketch", the policeman tells a chemist "one more peep out of you and I'll do you for heresy", with the chemist (played by Palin) responding that he "didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition"; except that instead of the Spanish Inquisition arriving, PC Pan Am (played by [[Graham Chapman]]) simply tells the chemist to shut up.

'''''Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp''''' is a [[Association football|football (soccer)]] [[video game]] developed by Zeebo Interactive Studios in Brazil and released exclusively for the [[Zeebo]] system. The game was introduced in [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]] in June, 2010.&lt;ref name="Terra Mexico"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terra.com.mx/mujer/articulo/910582/Lanzan+nuevo+juego+con+Zeebo+inspirado+en+el+Mundial.htm |title=Lanzan nuevo juego con Zeebo inspirado en el Mundial |publisher=Terra Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is a collection of football-related mini-games, consisting of Juggle, Dribble, Free Kick and Goal Scoring. ''Zeebo F.C. Foot Club'' is the first game in the ''Zeebo Football Club'' (F.C.) series and the first to use the  ''[[Zeeboids]]'' application, allowing players to create custom [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] and participate in online rankings. ''Zeeboids'' was launched alongside ''Foot Camp'' in Brazil and Mexico in June, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zeeboinc.com/blog/post/Zeebo-FC-Foot-Camp-Four-Games-in-One.aspx |title=Zeebo F.C.

Launches Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp Game and Zeeboids Avatar Application |publisher=Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Each of the four mini-games in ''Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp'' emphasizes a particular football skill: juggling (keeping the ball in the air as long as possible using feet, knees and head), dribbling (using footwork to evade defenders), free kicks (beating the goalkeeper with direct free kicks) and scoring (working with teammates to score goals). Players receive a score in each of the four mini-games, plus a combined score for overall performance. Up to eight players can play and compete in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zeeboinc.com/blog/?tag=/foot+camp+and+zeeboids |title=Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp and Zeeboids |publisher=Zeebo Inc. Announcement }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game also includes 20 challenges, 12 of which can be used to unlock special uniforms, while others allow users to access extra content in the game ''Zeebo F.C. Super League'', a forthcoming Zeebo football title to be released in the second half of 2010.&lt;ref name="Terra Mexico"/&gt;

''Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp'' includes basic character customization capabilities. More advanced character customization is provided by the ''Zeeboids'' application, which allows users to create full-fledged avatars for ''Football Club'' games. ''Zeeboids'' has 24 options for customizing the look of the characters and 12 different uniforms. It keeps track of and rewards avatar accomplishments, allows players to upload scores and take part in online rankings and use their avatars on each other's Zeebo systems.&lt;ref name="Terra Mexico"/&gt;

In partnership with Goal.com, Mexican users can access the Goal.com website on the Zeebo, viewing the latest football scores and news.&lt;ref name="Newswire"/&gt;

==Online Tournament in Brazil==
From June 11, 2010, concurrent with the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], Zeebo Brazil held an online "''Foot Camp'' tournament." The top scorers in each of the four mini-games, as well as those with the best overall combined scores, were awarded free Z-Credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.zeebo.com.br/?p=387 |title=Zeebo F.C.
