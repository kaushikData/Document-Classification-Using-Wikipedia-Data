The '''1948 Chatham Cup''' was the 21st annual nationwide knockout [[association football|football]] competition in [[New Zealand]].

The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included [[Eastern Suburbs AFC|Eastern Suburbs]] (Auckland), [[Waterside (Wellington)]], [[Christchurch Technical|Technical Old Boys]] (Christchurch), and [[Roslyn-Wakari]] (Dunedin).

==the 1948 final==
The final was a re-match of the previous years' final, with Technical Old Boys gaining revenge over Waterside for their loss of the previous year. The Waterside team proved disappointing when compared to their team of the previous year, and it was Tech who dominated. Though the Wharfies held the Canterbury side to a 0-0 half-time score, they succumbed in the second half to goals by [[Peter O'Malley (footballer)|Peter O'Malley]] and Cyril Thomas.

[[File:Abdi İpekçi Arena demolition 20180201 (1).jpg|thumb|Demolition of the arena, February 2018]]
'''Abdi İpekçi Arena''', formerly known as '''Abdi İpekçi Sports Complex''', was a multi-purpose [[indoor arena]] located in the [[Zeytinburnu]] district of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], situated just outside the [[Walls of Constantinople|ancient city walls]], in [[Yedikule]]. 

== History ==
Designed in 1979, and opened on 3 June 1989,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbf.org.tr/detay/2018/01/19/abdi-i-pekçi-spor-salonu-basın-bülteni&lt;/ref&gt; after several years of interrupted construction, it is named after the renowned [[Turkish people|Turkish]] journalist [[Abdi İpekçi]]. It was the primary basketball venue in Istanbul for two decades and hosted many (mostly the international) games of Istanbul's four top basketball clubs [[Anadolu Efes S.K.|Anandolu Efes]], [[Fenerbahçe Men's Basketball|Fenerbahçe]], [[Galatasaray S.K. (men's basketball)|Galatasaray]] and [[Beşiktaş J.K. (men's basketball)|Besiktas]], as well as many other sports events and concerts. However, its significance declined after the opening of [[Sinan Erdem Dome]] in 2010, which surpassed Abdi İpekçi Arena as the biggest and most state of the art arena in Istanbul.

=== Closure ===
After the 2016/2017 season, the arena was closed. It got demolished in early 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/sporarena/abdi-ipekci-yikiliyor-40416893|title=Abdi İpekçi yıkılıyor!|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, a basketball training and performance center is to be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.potamanya.com/abdi-ipekci-spor-salonu-efsanesi-yeni-bir-boyut-kazaniyor/|title=- "Abdi İpekçi Spor Salonu" Efsanesi, Yeni Bir Boyut Kazanıyor|date=19 January 2018|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basketball teams [[Anadolu Efes S.K.|Anadolu Efes]] and [[Galatasaray]] are now playing their games at [[Sinan Erdem Dome]] beginning with the 2017/18 season. Galatasaray also plans to move into a newly built own arena in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/euroleague/397567/galatasaray-building-new-arena/|title=Galatasaray building a new arena - Eurohoops|date=8 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenerbahçe already moved into their own [[Ülker Sports and Event Hall|Ülker Sports Arena]] in 2012.

==Facilities==
The [[arena]] has an audience [[seating capacity]] of 12,270. It hosts national and international sports events, such as [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[wrestling]], and [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]], as well as [[concert]]s and [[congress]]es, among other events. The facility contains a multi-faced visual scoreboard, six online-system counters, four locker rooms, two internet rooms, a press room, two multi-purpose offices, VIP rooms, etc. Its parking lot has a capacity of 1,500 cars.

==Events==
The professional basketball teams of [[Galatasaray men's basketball team]] and [[Galatasaray women's basketball team]] play their [[Turkish Basketball Super League|Turkish League]] home matches since the 2009–10 season in the Abdi İpekçi Arena.

Some of the notable events, which took place in the arena are:

[[File:Appeal for a wicket.jpg|thumb|English players appeal for a [[leg before wicket]] in a Test match [[Indian cricket team in England in 2007|against India]], 2007.]]
In the [[sport]] of [[cricket]], an '''appeal''' is the act of a player on the [[Fielding (cricket)|fielding]] team asking an [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]] for a decision regarding whether a [[batsman]] is out or not. According to Law 31 of the [[Laws of Cricket]], an umpire may not rule a batsman out unless the fielding side appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-31-appeals/ |title=Law 31 – Appeals |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On many occasions when a batsman has otherwise technically been out, the fielding team neglects to appeal, so the umpire does not declare them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/18289545/steven-smith-owns-edge-97|title=Smith owns up to edge on 97|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal may be made at any point before the bowler starts their run-up for the next ball. A bowler's appeal combined with the wicket keeper is crucial in umpire's decision.

According to the Laws of Cricket, an appeal is a verbal query, usually in the form of, "How's that?" to an umpire. Since the taking of a [[wicket]] is an important event in the game, members of the fielding team often shout this phrase with great enthusiasm, and it has transmuted into the slightly abbreviated form, "'''Howzat?'''", often with a greatly extended final syllable. Sometimes one or other syllable is omitted entirely, the player emitting an elongated cry of simply "How?" or "Zat?". Most players also raise their arms or point at the umpire as part of the appeal. Some players have established their own trademark appeals as well.{{who|date=June 2018}}

Although technically an appeal is required for the umpire to make a decision, in practice it is often obvious to all that a batsman is out, and the batsman may ''[[walk (cricket)|walk]]'' off the field without waiting for the decision of the umpire. This is invariably the case when a batsman is out bowled or to an obvious catch. However, the batsman is always entitled to stand their ground and wait for a decision from the umpire. In cases where they consider they might not be out, such as a catch taken low near the grass or where it is not clear whether the ball hit the bat, batsmen will not take the walking option. It is then up to the fielding team to appeal for a decision. Sometimes a batsman will walk even when it is not clear to others that they are out, if in their own mind they are certain they were out; this is considered to be the epitome of [[sportsmanship]].

Some decisions, such as [[leg before wicket]], always require an appeal and the umpire's decision, as no batsman will preempt the umpire on what requires fine judgment of several factors. Run-outs and stumpings are usually appealed and decided by an umpire, unless the batsman is clearly out of their ground and obviously out. Appealing differs vastly from [[Sledging (cricket)|sledging]] in the context that appealing is not supposed to be offensive or directly taunting to the other team, and more of a celebration to the appealing team. However, excessive appealing is against ICC's Code of Conduct.

Under the [[ICC Cricket Code of Conduct]], it is considered unsportsmanlike to:
* appeal excessively;
* appeal in an intimidating manner towards an umpire; or
* appeal under the knowledge that the batsman is not out.
Any instances of such behaviour are punishable by fines or match bans, as adjudicated and imposed by the [[match referee]].

The '''Ayr Gold Cup''' is a [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Great Britain open to [[thoroughbred]]s aged three years or older. It is run at [[Ayr Racecourse|Ayr]] over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

==History==
The event was established in 1804, and it was originally held at Ayr's former racecourse at Belleisle. In the early part of its history it was restricted to horses bred and trained in Scotland. It was initially contested over two separate heats of two miles, and was subsequently a single race with a two-mile distance.

The Ayr Gold Cup became a handicap in 1855, and it was shortened to about a mile in 1870. The Belleisle track closed in 1907, and the race was relocated and cut to 6 furlongs in 1908.

The lightest winning weight in the race since it became a sprint is 6&amp;nbsp;st&amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;lb (44&amp;nbsp;kg). This was carried to victory by Marmaduke Jinks in 1936. The heaviest is 10&amp;nbsp;st (63½&amp;nbsp;kg), the burden of Roman Warrior in 1975. The latter horse, trained at Ayr by Nigel Angus, is the most recent winner trained in Scotland.

The field for the Ayr Gold Cup is formed from the highest-weighted horses entered for the race. The maximum number of runners is currently twenty-seven. Those eliminated are now offered the chance to compete in the Ayr Silver Cup, a consolation race introduced in 1992. An event for horses excluded from ''that'' race, the Ayr Bronze Cup, was established in 2009.

[[File:BorchertField 1911.jpg|thumb|220px|Postcard of Athletic Park exterior, postmarked 1911]]
'''Borchert Field''' was a [[baseball park]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], United States.&lt;ref name=goobf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xNcjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9SMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5267%2C4950024 |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |title=Ghosts of Old Borchert Field |last=Levy |first=Sam |date=January 15, 1952 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The home field for several professional baseball clubs from 1888 through 1952, it became obsolete after the construction of [[Milwaukee County Stadium|County Stadium]] in 1953 and was demolished later that year. The site is now covered by [[Interstate 43 in Wisconsin|Interstate 43]].&lt;ref name=gnsr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nGMaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4142%2C3805076 |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |last=Kissinger |first=Meg |title=A dream gone sour |date=March 28, 1986 |page=1, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was built on a rectangular block bounded by North 7th, 8th, Chambers, and Burleigh Streets.&lt;ref name=offct&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lvEdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iCMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6895%2C1759688 |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |title=Borchert Field offered to city |date=December 3, 1951 |page=1, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=knotg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zo5QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lBIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6254%2C2018112 |newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel |title=Knothole gang remembers life around Borchert Field |last=Suycott |first=Caroline G. |date=March 11, 1988 |page=1, part 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home plate was at the south end (Chambers), with the outfield bounded by the outer fence, making fair territory [[Baseball field#Home plate|home-plate]]-shaped, with short fields in left and right and very deep power alleys,&lt;ref name=bwlf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bGoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kCkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6590%2C1821678 |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |last=Wolf |first=Bob |title=Way back then, at old Borchert Field |date=June 23, 1978 |page=8, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a configuration used by a number of ballparks of the era&lt;!--in the late 19th and early 20th centuries--&gt; that were constrained by a narrow block.

The playing field's approximate [[elevation]] was {{convert|690|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]].

==Baseball==
Originally known as '''Athletic Park''', the park opened for baseball in May, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.jsonline.com/sports/century/oct99/century110599.asp 1940-1949&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During winter, it was flooded and served as an [[ice hockey rink]]. The ballfield replaced the [[Wright Street Grounds]]. (Podoll, p.&amp;nbsp;46)

The ballpark operated as the home of the [[Baltimore Orioles#Milwaukee Brewers|Milwaukee Creams]] of the [[Western League (original)|Western League]], later renamed the Brewers. The Creams/Brewers played there through the 1894 season.

The ballfield was also sublet to the [[Milwaukee Brewers (AA)|Milwaukee Brewers]] club of the major league [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] for the latter part of the 1891 season, replacing the disbanded [[Cincinnati Kelly's Killers]]. After the major league American Association merged into the [[National League]] in 1892, the Milwaukee franchise was discontinued.

An independent minor league named the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] formed in 1902, including a new [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]] club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkeonline.com/story.asp?id=1391427 mkeonline.com - Home brewed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, another new minor league club, the Creams, began play in a new version of the [[Western League (1900–1958)|Western League]]. The Creams retained the lease on the Lloyd Street property, so the Brewers re-opened their {{nowrap|1887–1894}} ballpark, initially calling it '''Brewer Field,''' although the name Athletic Park endured until around 1920. After the purchase of the Brewers by Milwaukee capitalist Otto Borchert, the club became known as Borchert Field. Its original seating capacity was 4,800 (Pajot; 2009), but was later expanded to 10,000.

Because Milwaukee was too small to support two ballclubs, the Western League entry folded after 1903. The AA Brewers played for 51 seasons before being displaced by the major league [[Milwaukee Braves (1953–69)|Milwaukee Braves]].

Athletic Park / Brewer Field was officially renamed Borchert Field at the start of the 1928 season in honor of previous owner Otto Borchert,&lt;ref name=goobf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=54 Minor League Baseball: History: Top 100 Teams&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who had died the previous year at a baseball dinner that was being broadcast live on the radio (Podoll, p.&amp;nbsp;218). During the 1920s, the ballpark had been unofficially dubbed "Borchert's Orchard" by the media (Podoll, p.&amp;nbsp;189).

Borchert Field was also home to the [[Milwaukee Bears]], an entry in the [[Negro Leagues]], and the [[Milwaukee Chicks]] of the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]].  The Chicks won a pennant in their only year of operation.

===Bill Veeck===
One of the more colorful times for the stadium occurred during the early 1940s when [[Bill Veeck]] owned the team. The "PT Barnum of Baseball" brought an element of whimsy and marketing to the park, including fan giveaways of livestock, butter and vegetables, and staging morning games for third-shift wartime workers. According to his own autobiography, ''Veeck – As in Wreck'', he claimed to have installed a screen to make the right field target a little more difficult for left-handed pull hitters of the opposing team. The screen was on wheels, so any given day it might be in place or not, depending on the batting strength of the opposing team.

There was no rule against that activity as such, so he got away with it, until one day when he took it to an extreme, rolling it out when the opponents batted, and reeling it back when the Brewers batted. Veeck reported that the league passed a rule against it the very next day. It has been speculated that the story was made up by Veeck; research by two members of the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] revealed no evidence of either a movable fence or any gear (pulleys, etc.) required for it to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowry|first=Phillip|title=Green Cathedrals|year=2005|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-8027-1562-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that same book Veeck wrote: "Borchert Field, an architectural monstrosity, was so constructed that the fans on the first-base side of the grandstand couldn't see the right fielder, which seemed perfectly fair in that the fans on the third-base side couldn't see the left fielder. 'Listen,' I told them. 'This way you'll have to come back twice to see the whole team.'" Veeck's comments referred to the exceptionally high corners, which could theoretically hide the closest outfielder from a given spectator's view at times.

==Football==
The [[Milwaukee Badgers]], who played in the [[National Football League]] from 1922 to 1926, staged their home games at Borchert Field.&lt;ref name=recb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p2YcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=z04EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5215%2C4243436 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Larsen |first=Lloyd |title=Recalling Bears' invasions of Borchert Field long ago |date=August 19, 1960 |page=3, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borchert Field was also the host to the first [[Green Bay Packers]] game held in Milwaukee,&lt;ref name=co13&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wKRQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5CEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6474%2C5553229 |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |title=Crowd of 13,000 to see Giants and Packers here |date=October 1, 1933 |page=2, sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 10–7 loss to the [[1933 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on October 1, [[1933 Green Bay Packers season|1933]].&lt;ref name=gftfd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=waRQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5CEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6535%2C5964372 |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |title=Giants fail to score a first down but beat Packers, 10 to 7 |date=October 2, 1933 |page=6, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pplwl&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T5pQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JhMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4060%2C4036257  |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |title=Packers played long and well in Milwaukee |last=Romell |first=Rick |date=October 13, 1994 |page=5A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Packers played games in Milwaukee at County Stadium starting in [[1953 Green Bay Packers season|1953]] through [[1994 Green Bay Packers season|1994]].&lt;ref name=pplwl/&gt;&lt;ref name=pcitin&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lpgaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Fi0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3071%2C331154 |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |title=Packin' it in |last=Vanden Brook |first=Tom |date=December 16, 1994 |page=A, special section}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Borchert county postcard.jpg|thumb|225px|Postcard advertising the "new home" of the Milwaukee Brewers in 1953]]

Borchert Field was too small to accommodate [[Major League Baseball]]. Milwaukee's city fathers, looking to attract a major league franchise, built [[Milwaukee County Stadium|County Stadium]] to replace Borchert Field. It was intended that the [[Milwaukee Brewers minor league|Brewers]] would play in County Stadium in the 1953 season,&lt;ref name=doabp/&gt; but early that year their parent club, the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]], relocated to Milwaukee, so the final season of baseball at Borchert Field also turned out to be the last season of Brewers minor league baseball. The minor league franchise remained the Braves' top affiliate, moving to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], where it was the next incarnation of the [[Toledo Mud Hens|Mud Hens]] for three seasons, through 1955.

First slated to become a recreation area, the former site of the stadium (and the entire block) is now fully occupied by [[Interstate 43]], Milwaukee's major north-south freeway, just north of exit 74 (Locust Street).

The '''Estádio Presidente Vargas''', nicknamed ''PV'', is a multi-purpose stadium located in [[Fortaleza]], [[Ceará]], [[Brazil]]. It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] and [[American football]] matches and is the home stadium of [[América Football Club (CE)]], [[Fortaleza Esporte Clube|Fortaleza]], [[Ferroviário Atlético Clube]] and [[Associação Esportiva Tiradentes]]. The stadium holds approximately 20,000 people and was built in 1941. The stadium is owned by the Fortaleza City Hall, and it is named after Brazilian president [[Getúlio Vargas]].

The stadium was the largest stadium in Fortaleza until 1973 when the [[Castelão (Ceará)|Castelão]] stadium was inaugurated.

==History==
In 1941, the works on Estádio Presidente Vargas were completed. The inaugural match was played on September 21 of that year, when [[Ferroviário Atlético Clube|Ferroviário]] beat Tranmways of [[Pernambuco]] 1-0. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Ferroviário's Chinês.

==Inauguration==
[[Image:PresidenteVargasCE.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Estádio Presidente Vargas]]
Presidente Vargas Stadium was built in 1941 and was considered a modern facility at the time. The P.V. was walled, had wooden grandstands around (also wood) separating the field from fans and the great wonder, a lawn (until then all fields in the city of strength instead of lawn that had beaten clay was wet before departure ).[2] This stadium was officially opened on September 14 of 1941, but the first match took place a week later, on September 21 with the game Rail 1 x 0 Tramways-PE, Being the first goal of the stadium scored by Chinese coral, 20 minutes for the first time.

==Increased attendance==
The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 38,515, set on May 7, 1989 when [[Ferroviário Atlético Clube|Ferroviário]] and [[Ceará Sporting Club|Ceará]] drew 1-1. But there are records of a paying audience of 41,099 in the game Ceará 0-1 Corinthians Brazilian Championship in 1971 but there is no confirmation that this has been the public official. Currently, due to reforms in the stadium and the strictest safety standards, the ability of PV was reduced to 22,000 spectators.

==Recent structure update==
{{update|section|date=September 2015}}
From September to November 2005, the PV was banned for carrying out a series of improvements. The precarious access steps to the bleachers were demolished and replaced with ramps. There was also the reform of the changing rooms and baths, the adequacy of the system of fire prevention standards of Fire Department. Currently, the PV is closed for security reforms in view of the stadium that, according to prosecutors is structurally compromised, the forecast is to reopen in 2010.

After almost a year later, the stadium was finished and ready to receive games. Nowadays it is the home stadium for Ceara squad in the Serie A. It has also the possibility of becoming a training field for national squads in the 2014 World Cup.

The '''high kick''' is a traditional [[Inuit]] event performed at the [[Arctic Winter Games]], the [[World Eskimo Indian Olympics]] and other traditional events.

==One foot high kick==

The Inuit one-foot high kick is a traditional competition that is similar to the two foot high kick.

In this competition the competitor stands on one foot, jumps in the air and hits a ball or piece of seal such as a [[ringed seal]], which is suspended from a [[gallows]] and then lands on the same foot.

The one foot high kick tests the strength and [[agility]] of a hunter. It was also used to signal a successful hunt in some communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ankn.uaf.edu/Curriculum/NativeGames/games.html One Foot High Kick]&lt;/ref&gt;

A short film made by [[Alethea Arnaquq-Baril]] for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver shows [[Arctic Winter Games]] champion Johnny Issaluk performing a one foot high kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hamilton|first=Mark|title=Inuit High Kick|date=2013-04-22|url=https://vimeo.com/64586456|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two foot high kick==
The two-foot high kick (''akratcheak'') is a traditional [[Inuit]] jumping event that occurs at many [[Arctic sports]] competitions. In the two-foot high kick, athletes must jump using two feet, touch a hanging target with both feet, and land on both feet, maintaining balance.&lt;ref name=weio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weio.org/Webpage/About_WEIO/Games.html |title="Why These Games" |accessdate=2008-04-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109041340/http://www.weio.org/Webpage/About_WEIO/Games.html |archivedate=9 January 2007 |df= }}. ''[[World Eskimo Indian Olympics]]''. Originally accessed 2008-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The event is often considered the most demanding Arctic sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yasc.ca/TraditionalSportsDescription/tabid/67/Default.aspx "Traditional sports descriptions"]. Yukon Aboriginal Sport Circle (2007). Accessed 2008-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has its origin in subsistence [[Aboriginal whaling|whale hunting]]: when a whale was taken, a messenger would run to the village and kick both feet in the air once within eyeshot.&lt;ref name=weio/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Villagers would then know to prepare to harvest the whale.&lt;ref name=weio/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

As of 2007, the men's record in the event was {{convert|2.64|m|abbr=on}}; the women's record was {{convert|1.98|m|abbr=on}} (6 feet 6 inches).&lt;ref name=npr&gt;Block, Melissa.

A '''hogu''' is the [[armor]] worn by practitioners of [[Taekwondo]] during [[sparring]].  Translated into English, ''hogu'' means chest or chest protector. The ''hogu'' has been used in [[World Taekwondo]] sparring since the 1950s and is considered the most important piece of sparring equipment in the Taekwondo practitioner's arsenal.  The ''hogu'' is the most common scoring area in Taekwondo sparring. The ''hogu'' is hit by the heel, the sole and the top of the foot by many kicking techniques like the roundhouse kick or the back kick, and can also be hit with the fist. ''Hogu''s are made by various companies such as Adidas and Dae Do; only certain brands of chest protector are approved by World Taekwondo.  The chest protector is mandatory in World Taekwondo- or Olympic-style competition;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtaekwondo.org/rules/ World Taekwondo competition rules]&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is not used in [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]]-style sparring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itf-information.com/information10a.htm ITF competition rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Iconix acquired electronics brand [[The Sharper Image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hometextilestoday.com/article/544693-Iconix_acquires_The_Sharper_Image_brand.php|title=Iconix acquires The Sharper Image brand - Home Textiles Today|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, [[Nike Inc.]] announced that it had agreed with Iconix Brand Group to sell English brand [[Umbro]] for US$225 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/iconix-brand-buys-nike-s-umbro-soccer-unit-for-225-million-1-.html "Iconix Brand Buys Nike’s Umbro Soccer Unit for $225 Million" at Bloomberg.com], 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition was completed in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashinvest.com/iconix-brand-group-completes-acquisition-umbro-nike-225-million/ "Iconix Brand Group Completes Acquisition of Umbro from Nike for $225 Million", Fashion Invest website], 4 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Iconix acquired [[Lee Cooper]] from [[Sun Capital Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.altassets.net/private-equity-news/by-news-type/deal-news/sun-european-partners-sells-lee-cooper-for-72m.html|title=Sun European Partners sells Lee Cooper for $72m |work=AltAssets Private Equity News|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Iconix acquired control of the '''Buffalo David Bitton''' brand in an effort to expand into higher-end brands. Iconix paid Buffalo International ULC $76.5 million in cash for a 51% stake in the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/04/deals-day-idUKL4N0B43WI20130204|title=Deals of the Day 04/02/13 | author=Reuters UK | publisher=Reuters UK | date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Iconix bought the [[Strawberry Shortcake]] brand from [[American Greetings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/03/strawberry-shortcake-is-new-it-girl-for-iconix/|title=Strawberry Shortcake is new ‘it’ girl for Iconix|first=Claire|last=Atkinson|date=3 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, Iconix and Anthony L&amp;S Athletics LLC acquired North American rights and related intangible assets of [[Pony International|Pony]] from Symphony Holdings LLC with the option to purchase additional markets.

In 2015, several top executives, including founder Neil Cole, resigned following a statement that Iconix was under investigation by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0149-5380| volume = 211| issue = 1| pages = 60–64| last1 = Young| first1 = Vicky M.| last2 = Borcharot| first2 = Debra| title = Iconix What Went Wrong?| journal = WWD: Women's Wear Daily| accessdate = 2017-08-10| date = 2016-01-06| url = http://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/problems-at-iconix-sec-investigation-neil-cole-10304943/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was triggered by Iconix's 2014 financial statements, after which it received a letter from the SEC. Stock prices fell 24% after Iconix confirmed the investigation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/12/28/iconix-confirms-sec-investigation-shares-plunge/77968084/|title=Iconix confirms SEC investigation, shares plunge|last=McCoy|first=Kevin|date=|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indoor golf''' is an umbrella term for all activities in [[golf]] which can be carried out indoors. Venues include indoor [[driving range]]s, [[Golf stroke mechanics#The stroke|chipping]] areas, [[putting green]]s, and machines.

[[File:Indoor golf simulator.JPG|thumb|left|230px|Projector-based golf simulator.]]
A '''golf simulator''' allows golf to be played on a graphically or photographically simulated driving range or golf course, usually in an indoor setting. It is a technical system used by some golfers to continue their sport regardless of weather and time of day in a converted premises.  Simulators have been available since the early 1970s, and systems range in cost from compact units costing well under $200 that work with a computer or [[video game console]], to sophisticated ones costing tens of thousands of dollars. Advanced systems may utilize a dedicated room, hitting screen, projector and other paraphernalia.

Simpler simulators typically do not possess built-in software, but measure the movement of the hand-held sensor and feeds the information to the video game. The information received is then translated into an action of some sort, usually hitting the ball. More advanced simulators often come with their own software, allowing the user to use the system as if they were on a driving range. Relying on a battery of environmental sensors, the software tracks each shot and represents the entire shot, from impact to how the ball bounces visually on screen. In this way, the golfer has a detailed analysis of the entire flight of the ball which can be used for practice or training.

It utilizes a projected landscape, sometimes with natural images. A computer calculates the expected trajectory of the golf ball from data gathered on the swing, and the image of the golf ball flight is then simulated on the screen via a projector. Golf simulators need to present club speed, club path, club face angle at impact, ball speed, ball path, horizontal and vertical launch angle and spin. There are several types of measurement system used in golf simulation to achieve this, such as simulator mats, sonic sound systems, optical sensor arrays, radar and  camera ball tracking systems.

=== Simulator mats ===
Many golf simulator systems use a sensor mat, which is essentially a rectangular mat containing several infrared sensors and microchips that can monitor the speed of the club as it passes the back sensor, the angle of the club and club speed as the ball and club pass the second sensor following impact and the direction of the ball as the club passes the third sensor. Such systems are used by GolfBlaster3D, ProTee United, Dancin' Dogg by Optishot, TruGolf and Unex Golf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golf Simulators Buying Guide|url=http://www.golfwrx.com/67315/golf-simulators-buying-guide/|work=Golf WRX|publisher=Golf Digest|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sonic sound systems ===
A sonic system uses strategically placed microphones around the impact screen. The system measures and compares the intensity of sound that is produced by the ball hitting the screen. Using 3 or more directional microphones and an interface that can measure the sound amplitude of the impact from each microphone, an XY impact position can be determined. This type of measurement system is rarely used in modern simulators.

=== Radar systems ===
A radar sits aside the player to gather launch data. They emmit a microwave that reflects off any moving object which returns to the sensor. The system can then record trajectory, launch angle, speed and direction. Additional physics is applied to these figures to calculate spin, axis and tilt. These types of system can be used indoors or outdoors. They are very useful as launch monitors, and they work very effectively. Several professionals make use of them to analyse their game in real environments. Typical examples are available from [[TrackMan]] and Flightscope.

=== Optical sensor systems ===
This method uses two banks of Infra Red sensors that scan across the bay in both X and Y directions. The ball passes through the first set of sensors and its XY coordinate is captured. The ball then passes another set of sensors and the second XY coordinates are captured again.  The two co-ordinates are then compared to determine the vertical launch angle, ball path and speed. The system is very accurate very expensive to construct as you need hundreds of optical sensors and emitters to catch the coordinates of the ball in both sensor positions. The main disadvantage is that the ball must always pass through both sensors with a fast shot so that there is no downward curve in the ball's trajectory before hitting the screen.That means that chipping and putting will not work too well.

=== Camera Systems ===
Cameras are becoming the norm in golf simulation. In general, one, two, three or four cameras are used that continuously monitor the play area. The downward swing path, impact, club face angle, launch angle and ball speed are all captured by the high speed cameras, normally running at around 100 to 120 frames per second. Camera data is processed using complex physics algorithms to produce a multitude of data such as back spin, side spin, trajectory, club face angle, swing path, loft, distance, carry and roll. 
The, most common types of camera measurement system are Triggered and Continuous. With triggered systems, Images are taken only after the club has passed through a trigger point to activate the camera. With continuous systems, the camera records permanently, and data is processed once impact with the ball is observed. Continuous cameras must be capable of frame rates in excess of 100 frames per second per camera. Such systems are used by Bogolf, Visual Sports, Sports Coach Systems and Full Swing Golf. For both methods, one camera is floor mounted facing the ball trajectory from the side, the other is over head mounted and facing down. ProTee United is using a high speed sensor system to read club head information, special floor sensors for putting and two high speed cameras (one on the floor and one on the ceiling) to pick up ball flight information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ProTee Golf Simulator Features|url=http://protee-united.com/golfsimulator/introduction/|work=ProTee United|publisher=Golf.com|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative method of measuring these two angles is to mount both cameras in the upper left and right corners  of the bay. This is known as stereoscopic image processing.

=== Dimensions ===
The typical dimensions of a golf simulator are approximately {{convert|4|or|5|m}} wide × {{convert|6|meters}} in length and just over {{convert|3|meters}} in height. This allows freedom of movement whilst swinging. This space typically allows for both left- and right-handed players with {{convert|2|meter|adj=on}} backswings and follow throughs.

=== Advantages ===
The principal advantage of a golf simulator is the ability to conveniently play and practice in a controlled ambience. Often this means the ability to play without any pressure, green fees, or tee times; however, the advent of "indoor golf centers", which provide simulators for commercial play, bring many of these competitive and social aspects into the simulated game. For those who live in wintry climes or urban settings, golf simulators offer the ability to play and practice year-round or within the confines of their locale. The space requirements can range from just needing an {{convert|8|ft|adj=on}} ceiling to an entire wall upon which the game's screen is attached. The next important advantage is the player's ability to see each facet of their swing. Many golf simulators measure: angle of attack, angle of the club face, club head speed, spin, club path (inside out or outside in), and more. These measurements help both students and teaching professionals identify exactly what a player needs to know to improve their swing.&lt;ref&gt;https://trugolf.com/news/why-golf-simulator/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanics ===
There are a number of different technologies in use presently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golf Simulators, technology and manufacturers|url=http://www.golf-simulators-buying-guide.com|work=Golf Simulators|publisher=World Golf Links|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principally they either track ball flight or club head motion. Ball flight is typically tracked via [[wavelength]] (infrared), audio, and/or [[laser]] sensors. These instruments serve as a means by which the ball's flight properties are tracked, namely launch angle, ball speed and ball direction.  Club motion is similarly tracked via wavelength sensors or other devices such tethers, cameras, or lasers, which record the speed and direction of the club's head as well as the impact point of the ball on the club's striking surface.  In some cases, based on the location of the sensing devices, it is now possible to capture data on both ball and club for most accurate speed and directional information, and simulated ball flight behavior.

The data collected is extrapolated to provide ball flight trajectory and roll out according to certain calculated relationships to the ball's flight performance per the tracked motion of the ball or club, adding environmental aspects through which the ball is projected, including terrain, wind, rain and other such influences or obstacles.

The way that the information is tracked varies as much as having a wall-sized screen recording ball speed and placement upon impact, to sensors that record the moments before, during and after the impact between the ball and club, in which case, the ball is held by a tether.

=== Accuracy ===
A key attribute of any simulator is accuracy. Ball flight is the primary determinant of a system's accuracy. Speed of the calculations and a predictable projected image of the ball in flight is one measurement of a system's accuracy.  Predictability or the plausibility of prediction is a measure according to known ball flight properties among golf experts.

A ball's flight depends upon many things, including the ball itself, the strike and impact of the club upon the ball, the ball's launch angle, direction, spin rate and [[velocity]], as well as the hitting surface from which the ball is struck and the simulated environment through which the ball virtually flies, suggesting wind, rain, and other environmental aspects that may affect ball flight.  The battle for superiority in this market exists between the technologies utilized to track ball flight or club motion.

==Training facilities ==
[[File:12 Foot Indoor Golf Green.jpg|thumb|175px|12 Foot Indoor Golf Green]]

=== Indoor driving range ===
An indoor driving range can be a low-ceiling structure in which players hit golfballs into a net at close range, or a large high-ceiling [[Air-supported structure|dome]], where players are better able to observe the trajectory of the golfball in flight. Because of the nature of being indoors, these structures provide players with the opportunity to practice regardless of the outside conditions. Teaching professionals and computer/video evaluation tools may also be available at these ranges, as well as specialized areas for [[Golf course#Putting green|putting]], [[Golf stroke mechanics#Chip|chipping]], and [[Hazard (golf)#Bunker|sand shots]].

==Places==
Indoor golf can be found in different areas. Everywhere where there is enough space in order to swing the club, a training area or a golf simulator to be installed.

'''Commercial Applications:'''
[[Country club]]s, hotels &amp; resorts, offices, fitness facilities and [[sports bar]]s are among the many commercial uses of golf simulators. These serve both as entertainment for guests and practice for golfers. An indoor golf center consists of several simulators and a golf practice area, often including indoor driving range, chipping area, putting green, or any combination.

'''Residential Applications:'''
Indoor golf simulators have been gaining popularity in residential applications during recent years. As technology advances bring costs down, many avid golfers have chosen to equip their homes with indoor golf training facilities.

Indoor golf greens have recently enjoyed a drastic increase in overall quality and play-ability while also enjoying significant reduction in cost.

'''Israel Cycling Academy''' (''[[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] team code:'' '''ICA''') is a UCI Pro Continental team founded in 2015 and based in [[Israel]]. It participates in [[UCI Continental Circuits]] races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/team/Cycling_Academy_Team_2015|title=Cycling Academy Team|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was launched in November 2014 by a team with the aim of developing young cyclists, especially from Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gallery: Sagan helps launch first Israeli pro team|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/gallery-sagan-helps-launch-first-israeli-pro-team|accessdate=9 May 2015|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's first ever victory came in the fourth stage of the [[2015 Tour d'Azerbaïdjan]], which was won by [[Daniel Turek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tour d'Azerbaïdjan 2015 – Stage 4|url=http://procyclingstats.com/race/Tour_d_Azerbaidjan_2015_Stage_4_Mingachevir|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2015, the team announced that it added the Israeli Road Racing Champion [[Guy Sagiv]] to its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Twitter: Cycling Academy adds Guy Sagiv|url=https://twitter.com/bikeGEEEEKS/statuses/61662535119668428|work=[[twitter.com]]|date=2 July 2015|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the team participated in a [[Cycling monument]] event for the first time – [[2018 Milan-San Remo]], and in a [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]] event for the first time – [[2018 Giro d'Italia]].

'''Jong Song-ok''' ({{korean|hangul=정성옥|context=north}}; born 18 August 1974) is a female [[long-distance runner]] and [[politician]] from [[North Korea]], who won the world title in the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics - Women's Marathon|women's marathon]] at the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics]] in [[Seville, Spain]]. To date, it is the only medal ever won by a North Korean athlete at the [[World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]].

==Career==
Jong debuted internationally at the [[1995 Military World Games]] where she finished second. She emerged as a new star in a series of North Korean marathoners after having placed third at the [[Beijing Marathon]].{{Sfn|North Korea Handbook|2002|p=493}}

She competed at [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]], finishing 20th in the [[Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics - Women's marathon|women's marathon]].

In 2000, Jong did not participate in either the [[Boston Marathon]] or the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in Sydney]]; South Korean media claimed this was due to the personal instruction of North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://article.joins.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=592158&amp;ctg=00|title=북한 정성옥 보스턴 마라톤 불참|trans-title=North Korea's Jong Song-ok will not join Boston Marathon|work=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|date=2000-03-29|accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idomin.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=12967|title=북한 정성옥, 김정일 지시로 올림픽 불참|trans-title=North Korea's Jong Song-ok did not join Sydney Olympics on instructions of Kim Jong-il|work=Domin Ilbo|date=2001-04-21|accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jong became a delegate to the 10th [[Supreme People's Assembly]] in March 2000.{{Sfn|North Korea Handbook|2002|p=493}}

'''Lingfield Park Racecourse''' (commonly referred to as '''Lingfield''') is a [[horse racing]] course at [[Lingfield, Surrey|Lingfield]] in [[Surrey]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is owned by the [[ARC Racing and Leisure Group]], formerly [[Arena Leisure Plc]].

Lingfield is best known as a winter all-weather [[Flat racing|flat-racing]] course; the track is [[Polytrack]], rather than the usual turf found in the UK. There are only five other all-weather courses in the UK, the others being at [[Southwell Racecourse|Southwell]], [[Kempton Park Racecourse|Kempton]], [[Wolverhampton Racecourse|Wolverhampton]], [[Newcastle Racecourse|Newcastle]], and [[Chelmsford City Racecourse|Chelmsford City]] (formerly Great Leighs Racecourse). Lingfield stages flat racing on turf in the summer and National Hunt races are also run on turf. Owned by a fellow called Martin Pollard.

[[Lingfield railway station|Lingfield Railway Station]] adjoins the course, served by trains from London to East Grinstead via [[Oxted railway station|Oxted]].

==History==
The racecourse is located in a {{convert|450|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate and was opened in 1890 by the [[Prince of Wales]] (later [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]), who also agreed to let Lingfield incorporate the Prince of Wales feathers into its official heading. The course initially held jumps racing only, but in 1894 the [[Jockey Club]] granted permission for flat racing to be held. Racing has been held continuously ever since, with the only exception being during [[World War II]] when the [[War Office]] requisitioned the course. [[Ladbrokes]] sold the course in 1982 and the new owners installed flood defences on the estate to alleviate the flooding that had become a major problem in the years immediately after the war. A golf course was developed and this opened in June 1987. [[Arena Leisure]] purchased the course in 1991, and in 2001 made the decision to replace the Equitrack all-weather surface with [[Polytrack]], opening in November 2001. Other recent developments have been the re-laying of the back straight on the turf course in 2002/2003 and the construction of a £5.5 million grandstand in 2004. In early 2009 the course had another record broken as [[Matsunosuke]] became the highest rated horse to win on the all-weather surface rated 112 or 117 by [[Racing Post]] rating.  This was dubbed as the greatest all-weather horse of all time in the UK.{{By whom|date=April 2013}}

In addition, there's now a [[Marriott hotel]] based on the racecourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lingfield Park Hotel|url=http://www.lingfieldpark.co.uk/hotel/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racecourse is featured in the 1954 film ''[[The Rainbow Jacket]]''.

The '''North-South Cup''' was a short-lived [[Ireland|all-Ireland]] [[association football|football]] tournament. It was played for two seasons in the 1960s and on both occasions won by teams from [[Northern Ireland]].

The 1960-61 competition was played to the semi-final stage, however due to fixture congestion the final had to be held over to the following season.  Similarly the 1961-62 competition could not be finished in time, the first round and part of the second round were played during the season, however the rest was completed during the 1962-63 season.

'''Phnom Penh Crown Football Club''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] club from [[Phnom Penh]], Cambodia. Formerly the team were called Samart United, Hello United, Phnom Penh United and Phnom Penh Empire before establishing their current name, Phnom Penh Crown FC in 2009. The club has won 6 [[Cambodian League]] titles.

==History==

In 2000 Samart United were founded, with sponsorship from Samart Communications. After undergoing a number of name changes over the past decade, this was the forerunner of the Phnom Penh Crown team that exists today.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Joining forces with the Khmer Empire team, another new moniker was adopted, Phnom Penh Empire, for the 2007 season, in which the team finished in third place behind the league champions [[Nagacorp FC|Nagacorp]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A disappointing showing in the 2009 end of season play-offs saw the club, now called Phnom Penh Crown after their latest sponsors Crown Casino, finish in fourth spot, despite ending the regular season in top spot.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2010, Crown captured the Metfone Cambodia League Premier title for the third time, beating Preah Khan Reach 4–3 in the play-off final.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2014 Crown clinched their 5th Championship with a 1–0 win over NagaCorp, losing just two matches in their league campaign.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

They retained their league title in 2015, defeating [[Nagaworld FC|Nagaworld]] in the final on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/cambodchamp.html|title=Cambodia - List of Champions|last=Radek Jelinek|date=2 March 2017|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalries==

Crown's biggest rival in domestic competition has long been [[Nagaworld FC]]. Matches between the two teams was dubbed by fans the "Cambodian El Classico", and for good reasons. It is one of Cambodian football's longest standing feud, between two of the country's undisputed titans. The competition between the teams was once considered the biggest football rivalry in Cambodia, but after Naga's long drought of domestic success and the drastic rise of [[Boeung Ket FC]], Cambodian football found a new rivalry. Even though PPC Vs Naga is still a special match for Crown supporters, PPC Vs Beoungket has become the new staple among Cambodian football rivalries. The match dubbed "Cambodian Classic" often produces intense football and even more intense dramas fueled by emotions and desires to win. It is almost always the most anticipated match of the year (even among neutral fans).

'''Pitch and putt''' is an [[amateur sport]] very similar to [[golf]] but where the hole length is typically up to {{convert|70|m|yd|-1}}.

==Game play==

For international competitions:

* the maximum hole length is {{convert|70|m|yd|-1}};
* the maximum total course length of {{convert|1000|m|yd|-1}};
* players may only use three [[Golf club (equipment)|clubs]], one of which must be a [[Putter (golf)|putter]].

The game is played from raised artificial teeing surfaces using a tee and it has its own handicap system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitch-putt.info/index.php/definition-mainmenu-12|title=Pitch and putt rules|publisher=[[European Pitch and Putt Association]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027233447/http://pitch-putt.info/index.php/definition-mainmenu-12|archivedate=2013-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Comparison with golf ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &amp;nbsp; !! Golf !! Pitch and Putt
|-
| Number of holes per round || 18 || 18
|-
| Combined length of 18 holes || {{convert|6000|to|7500|m|yd|-1}} || {{convert|1000|m|yd|-1}} max
|-
| Maximum distance to hole (from tee)  || n/a || {{convert|70|m|yd|-1}}
|-
| Total par in a round (typical) || 72 || 54
|-
| Type of shots || Driving, pitching/chipping and putting || Pitching/chipping and putting
|-
| Clubs || Complete set || Maximum of three clubs which must include a putter
|-
| Approximate time per course || 4–5 hours || 1.25–1.5 hours
|-
| Land required for developing 18-hole course || {{convert|100|to|150|acre|ha}} for championship course || {{convert|12|to|15|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} for championship course
|}

Apart from the above differences, rules and regulations of the games are similar.

== International associations ==

[[File:Pitch and Putt - geograph.org.uk - 819047.jpg|thumb|left|Pitch and Putt on Bruntsfield links; UK]]
{{also|List of pitch and putt national associations}}

The game was developed mainly in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] since the 1940s but is today a growing sport all over the world. It is organized internationally by the [[European Pitch and Putt Association]] since 1999, by the [[International Pitch and Putt Federation]] since 2006 and by the [[International Pitch and Putt Associations]] since 2009. In all cases pitch and putt has its own handicap system and applies the rules of FIPPA/IPPA with exceptions that are specifically approved in each country.

The [[European Pitch and Putt Association]] (EPPA) was founded at a meeting in Dublin in 1999 by representatives from [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Spain]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitch-putt.info/index.php/history-mainmenu-14|title=History of EPPA|publisher=[[European Pitch and Putt Association|EPPA]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723081840/http://www.pitch-putt.info/index.php/history-mainmenu-14|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[San Marino]], [[Denmark]], [[Andorra]] and [[Germany]] joined the EPPA. The European Pitch and Putt Association stages a biennial [[European Pitch and putt Championship|European Team Championship]].

The [[Federation of International Pitch and Putt Associations]] was created in March 2006 in a meeting in [[Barcelona]] by representatives of 17 pitch and putt associations.  FIPPA members are Ireland, Spain, Norway, Great Britain, Switzerland, Australia, Chile, Andorra, and the United States. Canada, China, and Germany are associated members. The Federation of International Pitch and Putt Associations stages a biennial [[Pitch and Putt World Cup]] and, since 2009, FIPPA the [[Pitch and putt World Strokeplay Championship]].

In 2009, France, Italy, San Marino, and Denmark left FIPPA and EPPA and founded the [[International Pitch and Putt Associations|International Pitch and Putt Association]] (IPPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FIPPA|title=FIPPA Revamped|url=http://www.fippa.net/news_2009_fipparevamped.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601072142/http://www.fippa.net/news_2009_fipparevamped.shtml|archivedate=2009-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Spain and Portugal.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The dimensions and markings of a full-sized playing area are defined in Section 1 of the ''[[Laws of rugby league|Laws of the Game]]''.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"&gt;[[#RLIF-ILG-2004|RLIF, 2004]]: 2&lt;/ref&gt; These Laws are the agreed upon and maintained by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. The playing field is defined as "the area bounded by, but not including, the touch lines and dead ball lines" by Section 2.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p6"&gt;[[#RLIF-ILG-2004|RLIF, 2004]]: 6&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[Football (ball)#Rugby league|ball]] or any player in possession of it makes contact with the touch lines or dead ball lines or the ground beyond them it is deemed to be out of play.

The rugby league field also has markings to denote where restarts, such as scrums, should be placed.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/rules_and_equipment/4216664.stm|publisher= BBC|title= The basics of rugby league|author=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 July 2008 | date=6 September 2005|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qD7OdiJl|archivedate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==
Rugby league is played on a field 112–122 by 68 metres&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt; (122.5–133.4 × 74.3 yards). The longer boundary lines are ''touch lines'', while the shorter boundary lines are ''dead ball lines''.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt; The touch lines and dead ball lines are out of play.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p6"/&gt;

==Field==
Near each end of the field is a ''goal line'',&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt; or try-line; they are 100 metres (109.4 yards) apart.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt; A scoring area called the ''in-goal area'' extends 6–11 metres (6.6–12 yards) from each try-line to each dead ball line.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt;

Most play will occur within the ''field of play'', this "is the area bounded by, but not including, the touch lines and goal lines".&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p5"&gt;[[#RLIF-ILG-2004|RLIF, 2004]]: 5&lt;/ref&gt;

When the team in possession of the ball is attempting to score a [[try]], the goal line is included in the in-goal area, grounding the ball correctly on either is a try.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p12"&gt;[[#RLIF-ILG-2004|RLIF, 2004]]: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

When the team in possession is attempting to return the ball to the field of play from their own in-goal area the goal line is part of the field of play. A team caught with the ball in their own in-goal must restart play with a [[drop kick]] of the ball from between their posts, this usually results in the other team gaining possession.

Between the goal lines, broken lines run parallel to each touch line at 10 and 20 metres from touch.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt; Free kicks are taken 10 metres in from the point where the ball entered touch after being kicked out to gain ground from a penalty.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p5"/&gt; If a scrum is required to restart play and the event that caused it occurred "within 20 metres of a touch line or ten metres of a goal line the scrum shall be brought in twenty metres from the touch line and ten metres from the goal line".&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p32"&gt;[[#RLIF-ILG-2004|RLIF, 2004]]: 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markings===
Lines with distance markers transverse the field every 10 metres perpendicular to the touch lines.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt; The distances ascend from each goal line towards the halfway line, which is marked "50" (similar to a typical [[American football]] field).&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WADeptRS-dimensions"/&gt; These lines, as well as the goal lines, dead ball lines and touch lines are 15 centimetres wide and white in colour,&lt;ref name="WADeptRS-dimensions"/&gt; the only exception being the 40-metre lines, which are usually coloured red to distinguish them for the determination of [[Rugby league gameplay#40-20 kick|40–20 kicks]] in play.

The broken lines 10 metres and 20 metres in from the touch lines are 10 centimetres wide and white in colour.&lt;ref name="WADeptRS-dimensions"/&gt;

The distance markers on the playing field are white with a red outline.&lt;ref name="WADeptRS-dimensions"/&gt; These numbers are 2 metres high.&lt;ref name="WADeptRS-dimensions"/&gt;

===Objects===
On each goal line are two goal posts 5.5 metres apart connected by a cross bar 3 metres from the ground.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt; Each goal post is 16 metres in height (however they can be built higher)&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p2"/&gt; and for the purpose of judging a goal are considered to extend upwards indefinitely.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p3"&gt;[[#RLIF-ILG-2004|RLIF, 2004]]: 3&lt;/ref&gt; The posts and crossbar form an "H" shape. Goal posts supported by only one post below the crossbar are permissible.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p3"/&gt; The bottom two metres of a goal post is recommended to be padded to protect players from injury.&lt;ref name="WADeptRS-dimensions"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dsr.wa.gov.au/index.php?id=969|publisher= Government of Western Australia|title= Dimensions for Rugby League|author=Dept. Recreation and Sport|accessdate=28 July 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qD7DwqQi|archivedate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At professional level, these pads are usually cuboids that encase each post.

A corner post is placed at the points where each touch line meets each goal line.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p4"&gt;[[#RLIF-ILG-2004|RLIF, 2004]]: 4&lt;/ref&gt; The post must consist of non-rigid material and should be at least 1.25 metres in height.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p4"/&gt; The corner posts are ''in touch in-goal'',&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p4"/&gt; that is to say they act in the same way as sidelines and the ball-carrier touching them immediately halts play.

====Rule variation====
During the [[2010 NRL season]], a rule change to the playing field was implemented so that if a player in possession of the ball made contact with the corner post that player would no longer be considered to be [[List of rugby league terms#touch in-goal|touch in-goal]].&lt;ref name="heraldsun-corner-post-02-06-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/finally-nrl-dumps-corner-posts/story-e6frfgbo-1225874669975|title=Finally, NRL dumps corner posts|date=2 June 2010|publisher=heraldsun.com.au|accessdate=25 June 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qlMFRIpj|archivedate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the move argued a series a possible future scenarios made this preventative measure necessary, with [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] chief executive [[Geoff Carr]] stating, "no one has thought of the possibility of using the corner post as a weapon to defuse a try and we want to stop it before they do".&lt;ref name="masters2010-04-14"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Roy|title=Carr wants corner posts out of the field of play |url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/carr-wants-corner-posts-out-of-the-field-of-play-20100413-s7ob.html|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|accessdate=17 August 2010|authorlink=Roy Masters (sport)|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s3LEFdf0 |archivedate=17 August 2010 |date=14 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One scenario was that a defending player might manipulate the corner post to put an attacker out of play.&lt;ref name="masters2010-04-14"/&gt; Another concern cited was that the corner post might be made to make contact with a rolling ball to ensure the defending team gains possession with a [[List of rugby league terms#20 metre restart|20-metre restart]].&lt;ref name="masters2010-04-14"/&gt; Corner posts, which sometimes lean to one side, have no upper height limit set and this led to a fear that corner posts might become "long rubber snakes, biting attackers and sending them into touch", in the words of [[Roy Masters (sport)|Roy Masters]].&lt;ref name="masters2010-04-14"/&gt; Other laws concerning the corner posts remained unchanged.&lt;ref name="nrl-corner-post2010-06-02"&gt;{{cite web|title=NRL changes rules to corner post &amp; player registration|url=http://www.nrl.com/NewsViews/LatestNews/NewsArticle/tabid/10874/newsId/58898/Default.aspx|publisher=''[[National Rugby League]]''|accessdate=17 August 2010|author=NRL|authorlink=National Rugby League|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s3X4YyUq|archivedate=17 August 2010|date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ball that makes contact with the corner post while not in the possession of a player will be deemed to be touch in-goal as before.&lt;ref name="nrl-corner-post2010-06-02"/&gt; There was no attempt to remove the corner posts from the playing field as they are used to promote sponsors and are also a useful aid for players to judge their kicks.&lt;ref name="masters2010-04-14"/&gt; The change was agreed by the NRL Board and approved by the [[Rugby League International Federation|RLIF]] as an experimental rule.&lt;ref name="heraldsun-corner-post-02-06-10"/&gt; Implementation occurred mid-season following feedback from clubs.&lt;ref name="heraldsun-corner-post-02-06-10"/&gt;

==Scoring==
* A try can be scored by grounding the ball on the try-line or in the in-goal area between it and the dead ball line.
* A goal (conversion, penalty or drop goal) is scored when the ball travels above the crossbar and between the posts of the goal which is situated in the middle of the try-line.
* A penalty try is awarded if a player is fouled in the act of scoring a try but doesn't ground the ball. The conversion is taken from in front of the goal posts. 
* An 8-point try is awarded if a player is fouled in the act of scoring a try but still grounds the ball. The conversion kicks are from where the try is scored and in front of the goal posts

'''The Game Headwear''' originated as Neil's Sporting Goods in the 1960s.  Initially started to equip little league and school athletic teams, the company's business greatly increased in the 1970s and 1980s.  Nine stores in the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] cities of [[Albany, Georgia|Albany]], [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], and [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] and the [[Alabama]] cities of [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]] and [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] allowed The Game to become one of the most important sports apparel companies in the [[Southeastern United States]].

==History==

The business grew rapidly during the 1970s and early 80’s until Neil had built a small chain of 9 sporting good stores covering Phenix City, AL; Auburn, AL; Columbus, GA; Albany, GA; and LaGrange, GA. The business grew steadily until he had become one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the southeast.

Neil’s Sport Shops grew into multiple divisions, which included a retail segment, team sales, concessions and military. By expanding his business into multiple lines, Neil began to see the growth potential that the sporting goods market had to offer. By 1984, the business had grown significantly and Neil began searching for something opportunities to expand. He sold his company to the W.C. Bradley Company in Columbus, GA and stayed on as an officer. The separate divisions of Neil’s Sport Shops were eventually sold to other buyers. One of the buyers was Neil’s older brother Bill who bought the concession business and managed the concession sales for the majority of the Southeastern Conference Schools. Neil saw the growth that was happening in the concession sales as well as the retail side of the sporting goods business. He had been overseas and seen the opportunity to import products for his stores and soon decided to import sporting goods apparel on his own to sell to the different colleges.

In 1986, Neil formed The Game and the W.C. Bradley Company agreed to stay involved as a financial partner. The primary focus of The Game was to provide headwear designs for Colleges across the country. This would include everything from the initial design of the caps to the sales force that would call on the individual schools. Neil’s younger brother Phil was an independent salesman for Nike at this time and also agreed to represent The Game. Soon afterwards, Phil helped develop a national sales force for The Game through his contacts with other salesmen throughout the country. Within a matter of months, The Game had its first product designs and a national sales force in place to sell it. All of this happened at a time when the demand for college apparel was about to skyrocket.

The combination of logo designs and headwear was an instant success in the college markets. Designs such as “The Bar“ helped propel the growth of the company not only in the Southeast, but also throughout the country. Students and fans of colleges began to recognize the red, white and blue “G” logo on the back of their caps and started seeking out these products on a regular basis.

A natural progression for The Game was their move from a college only program into the professional sports programs such as Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association. The addition of these properties also propelled the growth of The Game during a time in which college and professional sports saw phenomenal growth. Soon, The Game could be found not only in college bookstores, but also in major league sporting event venues and in major retailers all across the country.

The Game also moved into expanding their apparel line by offering complementary products to the headwear such as sweatshirts, sweatpants, shorts, shirts, etc. All of this growth occurred during the period of 1987 to 1991, which saw The Game go from $0 sales in 1986 and a small warehouse to annual sales of over $80 million and a {{convert|155000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} manufacturing facility.

When Neil originally started The Game in 1986 and brought in the W.C. Bradley Company as his partner, he had a 5-year agreement with them as President of the company. When it came time for him to renew his contract in 1992, he opted to not renew the contract and “slow down” for a while. At this point, The Game was managed by the W.C. Bradley Company and was eventually sold to Russell Athletic in 1993.

As Neil began winding down his responsibilities at The Game, friend and founder of Realtree Outdoor Products, Bill Jordan introduced Neil to Tommy Allison who was the cousin and business manager for NASCAR driver Davey Allison. Davey and Tommy were looking for someone to help them with upgrading their licensed merchandise, which was primarily sold at NASCAR races. Over the next few months, Neil, Tommy, Davey and Bill talked and discussed the many opportunities available within NASCAR. By January 1993, Neil had decided retirement was not for him and formed A-Star promotions. The primary purpose of A-Star was to design, manage and sell all of the merchandise for the Davey Allison / Texaco Havoline racing team. This included everything from apparel to bumper stickers and miscellaneous souvenirs. The combination of Neil’s experience in importing merchandise, Davey’s success and fan following in NASCAR and the business management of Tommy Allison and Bill Jordan proved to be an instant success. When Davey’s merchandise began to show up at the races, other drivers and teams wanted to know where they could also get merchandise. The idea to form a separate company was born.

As business began booming for A-Star, Davey Allison was killed in a helicopter accident at Talladega Superspeedway. Although this ended what began as a strong start for A-Star, it was also the catalyst for forming Kudzu which became the company that began designing, importing and selling headwear and jackets to NASCAR teams just as The Game had done for college and professional sports. For the formation of Kudzu, Neil teamed with Tommy Allison, Neil’s brother Phil and Neil’s son Jeff.

From 1993 through 1998 several key events occurred. First, the W.C. Bradley Company sold The Game to Russell Athletic. This was a period marked by baseball strikes, reorganization of the NFL and many new headwear companies focusing on gaining market share in the college arena. Second, NASCAR experienced its greatest growth years with the addition of new racetracks, drivers becoming household names and most races being covered on national television networks. Kudzu’s business also grew exponentially as the company penetrated the majority of all of the leading NASCAR Winston Cup drivers and teams with their products. This also opened up the ability to work with major corporate sponsors on their apparel programs as well.

Neil still longed to be back in the college market with The Game and his original sales force. He would not have to wait long. In 1998, Neil was contacted by Russell Athletic wanting to know if he would be interested in purchasing The Game. By October 1998, a deal was completed and The Game was back with its original owners once again. Since then, Neil, Tommy, Phil, Jeff and the W.C. Bradley Company have been restoring the brand to the prominence it once enjoyed in the college markets. Today, many of the same representatives that began selling The Game products in 1986 are still selling them today.

In 2008, the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]] signed a contract to outfit all eight of its teams with game and batting practice caps produced by The Game.  These caps feature The Game's logo in team-specific colors.

'''''The Winning Team''''' is a 1952 [[biographical film]] directed by [[Lewis Seiler]]. It is a fictionalized biography of the life of major league pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] (1887–1950) starring [[Ronald Reagan]] as Alexander, [[Doris Day]] as his wife, Aimee, and [[Frank Lovejoy]] as baseball star [[Rogers Hornsby]].

It includes his heroic performance in three games in the [[1926 World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]], where the 7th inning strikeout of [[Tony Lazzeri]] is used as the game-ending, Series-winning pitch.

The film earned an estimated $1.7 million at the North American box office in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;'Top Box-Office Hits of 1952', ''Variety'', January 7, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{too much plot|date=December 2017}}
This movie starts with "Alex" (Ronald Reagan) in his birth home on his parent's farm in Elba, Nebraska.  While standing and speaking with his father a man comes up to them and lets them know that there is an exhibition baseball game between the local farmers and those of a minor league baseball team.  Grover Cleveland Alexander "Alex" runs to where that game is taking place.&lt;br&gt;

The scene switches to where his fiancé Aimee (Doris Day) is talking with her father.  Her father does not have a very good opinion of Alex because he is more interested in baseball than in farming.  He is worried for his daughter's future.
The game between the farmers and the team is a betting place.  Many come to see this game and they know that with Alex pitching they can't lose.  As we watch this game Alex strikes out everyone.  When he wins the game he returns home.&lt;br&gt;

Doris is at home waiting for Alex.  Aimee's father offers to put a down payment on a farm for his daughter.  After a small argument Doris switches to her father's side and promises that Alex will not play baseball.&lt;br&gt;

Now we go forward to a Church meeting where an invited guest was to show film shots of his recent journey to Norway.  As he begins his presentation the first film is upside down and way out of focus.  He begins to speak about that film once it has been fixed to the screen when a noise is heard. It is the sound of a back-firing automobile.  Our peek to outside shows this car drive up to the front door of the chapel.  the driver gets out and opens the door which causes the light from outside to blur out the picture on the screen.  Then the driver announces that he is looking for Alex.  After walking from the back of the chapel to the front and announces his search, he finally sees Alex and asks him to come outside with him.  While they are standing outside the driver asks Alex if he can really pitch like he did at the earlier game whenever or was it a fluke.&lt;br&gt;

The next thing we see is Alex pitching to this driver who we now know is the manager of the team he beat.  Aimee is shown inside and listening to the presentation which is now interrupted by the sound of a ball hitting a glove over and over again.  Alex is offered fifty dollars a month if he will consider playing for his team.  Alex agrees to play and is shown playing baseball with the new team, the Galesburg Boosters.  He sent a baseball card with his picture along with money on a regular basis so he could buy the farm for him and his fiancé.&lt;br&gt;

During one of the games Alex got on base after being walked.  He was warned not to slide as he ran the bases by his coach.  the next pitch to the next batter was hit and Alex ran to second base.  While he ran the second baseman caught the ball to get Alex out and then threw the ball to first base where it hit Alex right in the head.  He woke up three days later in the hospital surrounded by Aimee and his mother.  That ended his 1909 season of baseball.&lt;br&gt;

During the off season between 1909 and 1910 he now has enough money to buy that farm and to marry Aimee.  There is a funny part between a car and a wagon here.  After arriving at the farm he goes out back while his wife is changing and starts chucking mud balls at a fence.  His eyes are out of whack and he sees everything in double.  He hires a catcher to catch for him and he is always just a bit off because of his eyesight.&lt;br&gt;

In 1910 he returns to baseball after he wakes up one morning and his eyes are perfect again.  His record during that year was 29-11 as he now played for the Syracuse Stars in the class B New York State League.  Then he is sold to the Philadelphia Phillies for 750 dollars.&lt;br&gt;

We now turn to what Doris Day is known for.  The scene is a Christmas at the farm where the family is gathered around and Aimee sings.  Now we return to the regularly scheduled movie of baseball.&lt;br&gt;

The first game with the Phillies is the 1911 City Series.  He throws five innings of perfect no hit, no run baseball.  His official Major League baseball debut is on April 15th of that year.  During one game he is facing [[Rogers Hornsby]].  The catcher passes on a tidbit of info that if Hornsby strikes out he will be booted off the team.  Alex tells the catcher what the next pitches will be and Hornsby is able to connect with one of them.&lt;br&gt;

In 1918 Alex spent most of that year in France as a Sergeant with a Field Artillery unit where he was exposed to mustard gas and a shell that exploded near him caused partial hearing loss.  As a result of the shell he developed epileptic seizures.  This didn't help matters because he also suffered from a drinking problem.  He was now back in the states and was still pitching in 1919.&lt;br&gt;
  
He was traded from Philadelphia to Chicago and pitched for the Cubs during the 1920 season where he won the triple crown while pitching.  While playing a Game at Forbes Field his hearing problem returns.  In the sixth inning while on the mound, Alex falls down and his teammates carry him off the field.  It turns out to be an epileptic seizure.&lt;br&gt;

The next scene shows Alex in his doctor's office.  He has just been told that if he wants to live he should probably go back to that farm life he grew up with.  Alex is not hearing of that.  He tells the doctor that he really doesn't want his wife Aimee to know.  &lt;br&gt;

As Alex is walking down the street, he is in front of a speak-easy and, after letting a couple of people in, the doorman  recognizing Alex and invites him in for a drink, "On the house."  He is shown totally inebriated.  As he lays his head down into his arm a customer is seen walking to a telephone booth.  He asks for the sports desk.  When the person on the other end answers the person tells the other end that he knows why Alex fell at the ballgame today.  It is because, "He's a Lush."  The papers are filled with stories of the drinking problems of Alex.
We are now taken to a baseball game where Alex fields a ball and basically throws it away to the first basemen.  He is removed from the game.&lt;br&gt;

Alex is next shown where drinking seems to be his new pastime.  We see him as he stumbles down an alley and then falls as he reaches the end.  he is removed from the cubs and sent to a team called the "House of David."  All this time his wife is trying to find him because she lost track of where he was.&lt;br&gt;

Aimee is finally told where "Alexander the Great" is.  He is now on a main show liner at a circus.  He is touted as the man who can answer all your questions about baseball--and specifically about pitching.  Aimee buys a ticket, but when he comes out from the rear of the tent she hides.  He spews out many facts and figures about his own career and then asks if anyone has any questions.  Aimee leaves without contacting him.&lt;br&gt;

When Aimee does get in touch with him she tells him that she knows of his medical conditions.  He is contacted by his old friend Roger Hornsby, at the bequest of Aimee, and is offered a pitching job with the St. Louis, Cardinals.&lt;br&gt;

We are now taken to the World Series of 1926 when the St. Louis, Cardinals and the New York, Yankees are squaring off.  Alex pitches the second and the sixth games of the series and they win both of them.  At the conclusion of the sixth game Alex and Aimee have a conversation in the tunnel of the stadium.  It is here when she learns that he looks to her and gets his strength while pitching during this season.  He also tells her that she looks tired because he has relied on her so much.&lt;br&gt;

The Cardinals tie up the series at 3-3.  It is now the seventh game.  Aimee is not at the stadium because she is packing their stuff for a vacation that will start as soon as the game is over. Alex is not expected to pitch today at all.  It is a close game.  They are at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis and in the seventh inning the pitcher of record has allowed the bases to be loaded.  Roger Hornsby, player/manager comes in and pulls the pitcher.  He somehow gets a message to the bullpen for Alex to come out and pitch them out of the mess.  When Alex gets to the mound he looks and finds that Aimee is not there.  Aimee is at the street ready to call for a taxi when she reads on the ticker-tape board across the street that her husband has now been called on to pitch.  She has the bell hop at the street to get her a taxi right away so she can get to the stadium.&lt;br&gt;

While she is in traffic Alex is pitching to this batter without her as his rock.  He pitches out of the inning and Aimee arrives at the stadium before the ninth inning.  She sits in her chair and he sees her.  The Cardinals win the series!&lt;br&gt;

==Historical inaccuracy==
In the final baseball scene, Alexander is shown striking out a Yankee batter to end the 1926 World Series.  The actual final out of the 1926 World Series came when Babe Ruth was caught trying to steal second base.
