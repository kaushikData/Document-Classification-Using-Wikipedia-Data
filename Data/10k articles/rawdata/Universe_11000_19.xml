The '''7JP4''' is an early black and white or monochrome [[cathode ray tube]] (also called picture tube and [[kinescope]]). It was a popular type used in late 1940s low cost and small table model [[televisions]]. The 7JP4 has a 7" diameter round screen which was often partially masked. Unlike later [[electromagnet]]ically deflected TV tubes, the 7JP4 is [[electrostatic]]ally deflected like an oscilloscope tube.

== Development ==

[[File:7JP4 Electrostatic Picture Tube Side View (late 1940).jpg|thumbnail|Side View of 7JP4]]
The 7JP4 is part of the 7JPx series of circular face [[cathode ray tubes|electrostatic cathode ray tubes]] (CRT). Originally developed for radar applications as a display device for [[Radar display|radar display A scopes]] around 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=7JP4|title=Tentative Data from Tung Sol Tube Manual|year=1944|publisher=Tung Sol Lamp Works}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War 2 the CRT was adapted for television applications. There are three versions. The 7JP4 (P4 represents the phosphor that glows white and has medium persistence) for television. For oscilloscope applications the 7JP1 was used (P1 phosphor has a green trace and short persistence).  Radar applications the 7JP7 was used (P7 phosphor has a blue-white trace with a long persistence). This CRT was produced by multiple manufacturers ([[RCA]], [[General Electric]], [[Sylvania Electric Products]] and [[Tung-Sol|Tung-sol]]). Except for the type of phosphor used all three are identical in operation and connection. The screen diagonal is 7 inches (17.8&amp;nbsp;cm) for 7JP1 and 7JP4, but only 5.5 inches (14&amp;nbsp;cm) for the 7JP7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=7JP4|title=Sylvania Engineering Data Service|year=1953|publisher=Sylvania Electric Products Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 7JP4 Electrical Characteristics ==
[[File:7JP1, 7JP4 and 7JP7 Pin Out ID and Alignment.jpg|thumbnail|PIN IDENTIFICATION AND ALIGNMENT]]
Some General Electrical Characteristics are shown below. Second Anode + Grid 2 (Pin 9) and Plates (Pin 10 &amp; 11 and Pin 7 &amp; 8) have a maximum value limit of 6000 volts dc. Internal arcing can be expected when this voltage is exceeded. Actual values are typically in the 4000 to 5500 volt range, and some sets were operated as low as 2000 volts dc. Grid 1 (Pin 3) can receive either a Negative Bias or a Positive Bias. Pin-2 is the brightness voltage, and pin-3 is the video signal which rides on top of DC, and pin-2 is a DC Level which varies with the Brightness Control. Some sets are backwards and have pin-3 on ground and video on pin-2 along with brightness adjustment.

== Early Television in the United States ==
[[File:Airline 84GSE3011A Electrostatic TV (1950) using 7JP4 Picture Tube.jpg|thumbnail|Example of a picture from an electrostatic television using a 7JP4. The television is a Montgomery Ward Airline 84GSE3011A (made by Sentinel Radio and Television Corp.)]]
From 1946 to 1951 the 7JP4 was a common CRT (Picture Tube or [[Kinescope]]) used in lower priced televisions sold in the United States. These television were popular for portable carry around and small table top sets. These smaller sets were direct view electrostatic deflection designs. This required an extremely large amount of voltage to produce an image across the full display screen. In 1946, RCA influenced manufacturers (with royalty free circuit designs) to move toward electromagnetic deflection type televisions. Electromagnetic deflection uses varying magnetic fields to produce a full screen image. Horizontal and vertical electromagnets are  placed at the picture tube neck, called the "yoke". This method allowed the image to be viewed on larger screens. The first heavily mass-produced large picture tube to use this newer method of deflection was RCA's 10BP4, introduced in 1946. Soon after electrostatic picture tubes and the television electronic design would be completely replaced.

For a detailed look at US electrostatic TV design  and the 7JP4 [[Kinescope]] from an Australian view (by [https://web.archive.org/web/20100824071339/http://cool386.tripod.com/400tv/400tv.html cablehack]) go to the external link below involving the Wards Airline TV (Sentinel model 400TV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=cablehack|title=Airline 7" Portable TV|url=http://cool386.tripod.com/400tv/400tv.html|publisher=cool386.tripod.com|accessdate=2013-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824071339/http://cool386.tripod.com/400tv/400tv.html|archive-date=2010-08-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration of Dead Technology ==
The interest in the 7JPx series of CRT's is in restoration of dead technology. Dead Technology represent products that are no longer mass-produced or seriously used. The technology used in these designs have reach their highest level or have been replaced by a better technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CNET|title=Larry's Museum of Dead Technology|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19882_3-57337817-250/larrys-museum-of-dead-technology/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eng|first=John|title=John Eng's Dead Tech Rescue|url=https://sites.google.com/site/johnengsdeadtechrescue/|publisher=John Eng|accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration of early US made television sets has spurred interest in the 7JP4. Since this particular model is no longer made, only available ones are from old stock or from television sets that cannot be restored. This makes the price of a working CRT very expensive.

Because it is electrostatically deflected and was obsolete by the mid-1950s, most CRT testers will not test the 7JP4 and thus it is best tested in a working TV set. The Precision CR30, Sencore CR-70 and Jackson 707 are some of the CRT testers that are capable of testing the 7JP4,3KP4 and other electrostatic deflection CRTs. Since the availability of these CRT testers is very limited, the prices for such testers are steep, so many restorers test these CRT's on a working TV set that used electrostatic CRTs. There are many picture tube restoring equipment available for magnetic deflection tubes but there is no way to restore electrostatic tubes. The biggest problem with many picture tubes is the loss of emission or electron production due to contaminated or damaged cathode that surrounds the heater.

'''Angular  Correlation of Electron Positron Annihilation Radiation (ACAR or ACPAR)''' is a technique of solid state physics to investigate the [[electronic structure]] of metals. It uses [[positrons]] which are implanted into a sample and [[annihilation|annihilate]] with the electrons. In the majority of annihilation events, two [[Gamma quantum|gamma quanta]] are created that are, in the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of the electron-positron pair, emitted in exactly opposite directions. In the laboratory frame, there is a small angular deviation from collinearity, which is caused by the [[momentum]] of the electron. Hence, measuring the angular correlation of the annihilation radiation yields information about the momentum distribution of the electrons in the solid.

==Investigation of the electronic structure==

[[File:Fermi surface of Copper measured with 2D ACAR.jpg|thumb|Fermi surface and electron momentum density of Copper in the reduced zone schema measured with 2D ACAR.&lt;ref name=Weber2013&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weber|first=J.

All the macroscopic electronic and magnetic properties of a solid result from its microscopic electronic structure.
In the simple [[free electron model]], the electrons do not interact with each other nor with the atomic cores. The relation between energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{p^2}{2 m}&lt;/math&gt;
with the electron mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, there is an unambiguous connection between electron energy and momentum. Because of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] the electrons fill all the states up to a maximum energy, the so-called [[Fermi energy]]. By the momentum-energy relation, this corresponds to the Fermi momentum &lt;math&gt;p_F&lt;/math&gt;. The border between occupied  and unoccupied momentum states, the [[Fermi surface]], is arguably the most significant feature of the electronic structure and has a strong influence on the solid's properties.&lt;ref name=Dugdale&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugdale|first=S. B.|date=2016-01-01|title=Life on the edge: a beginner’s guide to the Fermi surface|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1402-4896/91/i=5/a=053009|journal=Physica Scripta|language=en|volume=91|issue=5|pages=053009|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/91/5/053009|issn=1402-4896|bibcode=2016PhyS...91e3009D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the free electron model, the Fermi surface is a sphere.

With ACAR it is possible to measure the momentum distribution of the electrons. A measurement on a free electron gas for example would give a positive intensity for momenta &lt;math&gt;p&lt;p_F&lt;/math&gt; and zero intensity for &lt;math&gt;p&gt;p_F&lt;/math&gt;. The Fermi surface itself can easily be identified from such a measurement by the discontinuity at &lt;math&gt;p_F&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Electron momentum density in the extended zone scheme.svg|frame|Example of a 1D electron momentum density  measured by an ACAR measurement. Bands crossing the Fermi level give discontinuities (green) which are superimposed on a continuous distribution from completely filled bands (orange).]]

In reality, there ''is'' interaction between the electrons with each other and the atomic cores of the crystal. This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an [[electronic band structure]] is formed. Measuring the momentum of one electronic state gives a distribution of momenta which are all separated by [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors. Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely filled bands (i.e. on an [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]]) gives a continuous distribution. An ACAR measurement on a metal has discontinuities where bands cross the Fermi level in all [[Brillouin zone]]s in reciprocal space. This discontinuous distribution is superimposed by a continuous distribution from the entirely filled bands. From the discontinuities the Fermi surface can be extracted.

Since positrons that are created by [[beta decay]] possess a longitudinal spin polarization it is possible to investigate the spin-resolved electronic structure of magnetic materials. In this way, contributions from the majority and minority spin channel can be separated and the Fermi surface in the respective spin channels can be measured.&lt;ref name=magAcar&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weber|first=J. A.|date=2015-01-01|title=Spin-Resolved Fermi Surface of the Localized Ferromagnetic Heusler Compound|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.206404|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=115|issue=20|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.206404|bibcode=2015PhRvL.115t6404W|pmid=26613459|page=206404|arxiv=1510.07808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACAR has several advantages and disadvantages compared to other, more well known techniques for the investigation of the electronic structure like [[ARPES]] and [[Quantum oscillations (experimental technique)|quantum oscillation]]: ACAR requires neither low temperatures, high magnetic fields or [[Ultra-high vacuum|UHV]] conditions. Furthermore, it is possible to probe the electronic structure at the surface and in the bulk (&lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; {{val|100|u=[[Nanometer|nm]]}} deep). However, ACAR is reliant on defect free samples as vacancy concentrations of up to {{val|e=-6}} per atom can efficiently trap positrons and distort the measurement.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This sensitivity is used in [[Positron Lifetime Spectroscopy|positron lifetime spectroscopy]] to investigate even very low defect concentrations.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

In an ACAR measurement the angular deviation of many pairs of annihilation radiation is measured. Therefore, the underlying physical observable is often called ‘two photon momentum density’ (TPMD) or &lt;math&gt;\rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;. Quantum mechanically, &lt;math&gt;\rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as the squared absolute value of the [[Fourier transform]] of the multi-particle [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\Psi^{ep}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; of all the electron and the positron in the solid:
:&lt;math&gt; \rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})=\left| \int d\mathbf{r} e^{-i2\pi\mathbf{rp}} \Psi^{ep}(\mathbf{r}) \right|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
As it is not possible to imagine or compute the multi-particle wave function  &lt;math&gt;\Psi^{ep}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;, it is often written as the sum of the single particle wave functions  of the electron &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{\mathbf{k},j}^e(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;th state in the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th band and the positron wave function &lt;math&gt;\Psi^p(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})=\sum_j\sum_{\mathbf{k}=\mathrm{occ.}} \left| \int d\mathbf{r} e^{-i2\pi\mathbf{rp}} \Psi^{e}_{\mathbf{k},j}(\mathbf{r})\Psi^{p}(\mathbf{r}) \sqrt{\gamma(\mathbf{r})} \right|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
The enhancement factor &lt;math&gt;\gamma(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; accounts for the electron-positron correlation.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For simplicity the electron-electron correlation is ignored in this example.&lt;/ref&gt; There exist sophisticated enhancement models to describe the electron-positron correlations,&lt;ref name=Jarlborg1987&gt;{{cite journal|title=Local-density approach for calculation of electron-positron enhancement in transition metals|last=Jarlborg|first=T.|last2=Singh|first2= A. K.|journal=Phys. Rev. B|date= 1987-01-09|page=4660|volume=36|issue=9|bibcode=1987PhRvB..36.4660J|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.36.4660}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the following it will be assumed that &lt;math&gt;\gamma=1&lt;/math&gt;. This approximation is called the independent particle model (IPM).

A very illustrative form of the TPMD can be obtained by the use of the Fourier coefficients for the wave function product &lt;math&gt; \Psi^{e}_{\mathbf{k},j}(\mathbf{r})\Psi^{p}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;C_{\mathbf{G},j}(\mathbf{k})=\int \int d\mathbf{r} e^{-i2\pi\mathbf{r(k+G)}} \Psi^{e}_{\mathbf{k},j}(\mathbf{r})\Psi^{p}(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;
These Fourier coefficients are distributed over all reciprocal vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt;. If one assumes that the overlap of the electron and the positron wave function is constant for the same band &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;,  summing  &lt;math&gt;\rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; over all reciprocal lattice vectors gives a very instructive result:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lock|first=D.

:&lt;math&gt; \Rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{k})=\sum_{\mathbf{G}} \rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{G+k})=\sum_j\sum_{\mathbf{k}=\mathrm{occ.}} \left|C_{\mathbf{G},j}(\mathbf{k})\right|^2=\sum_j A_j \Theta(\mathbf{k}_F-\mathbf{k}) &lt;/math&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;\Theta(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heaviside step function]] and the constant &lt;math&gt;A_j=\sum_\mathbf{G} \left|C_{\mathbf{G},j}(\mathbf{k})\right|^2 &lt;/math&gt; . This means, if &lt;math&gt;\rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; is folded back into the first Brillouin zone, the resulting density is flat except at the Fermi momentum. Therefore, the Fermi surface can be easily identified by looking for this discontinuities in &lt;math&gt;\Rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Experimental details==

[[File:Momentum wiki.svg|frame|When an electron and a positron annihilate, the annihilation radiation conserves the momentum of the initial electron by a Doppler shift and an angular deviation from collinearity.]]

When a positron is implanted into a solid it will quickly lose all its kinetic energy and annihilate with an electron. By this process two gamma quanta with {{val|511|u=keV}} each are created which are in the reference frame of the electron positron pair emitted in exactly anti-parallel directions. In the laboratory frame, however, there is a [[Doppler shift]] from {{val|511|u=keV}} and an angular deviation from collinearity. Although the full momentum information about the momentum of the electron is encoded in the annihilation radiation, due to technical limitations it cannot be fully recovered. Either one measures the [[Doppler broadening]] of the {{val|511|u=keV}} annihilation radiation (DBAR) or the angular correlation of the annihilation radiation (ACAR).

For DBAR a detector with a high energy resolution like a high purity  [[Semiconductor detector|germanium detector]] is needed. Such detectors typically do not resolve the position of absorbed photons. Hence only the longitudinal component of the electron momentum &lt;math&gt;p_\parallel&lt;/math&gt; can be measured. The resulting measurement is a 1D projection of &lt;math&gt;\rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;.

In ACAR position sensitive detectors, [[gamma camera]]s or [[Wire chamber|multi wire proportional chambers]], are used. Such detectors have a position resolution of typically {{val|1|to|3|u=mm}} but an energy resolution which is just good enough to sort out scattered photons or background radiation. As &lt;math&gt;p_\parallel&lt;/math&gt; is discarded, a 2D projection of  &lt;math&gt;\rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; is measured. In order to get a high angular resolution of {{val|1e-3|u=rad}} and better, the detectors have to be set up at distances between {{val|16|to|20|u=m}} from each other. Although it is possible to get even better angular resolutions by placing the detectors further apart, this comes at cost of the counting rate. Already with moderate detector distances, the measurement of one projection of &lt;math&gt;\rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; typically takes weeks.{{refn|group=note|Further details about an ACAR setup can be found in &lt;ref name=Ceeh&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ceeh|first=Hubert|last2=Weber|first2=J. A.|last3=Leitner|first3=Michael|last4=Böni|first4=Peter|last5=Hugenschmidt|first5=Christoph|date=2013-04-01|title=The source-sample stage of the new two-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation spectrometer at Technische Universität München|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/rsi/84/4/10.1063/1.4801454|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=84|issue=4|pages=043905|doi=10.1063/1.4801454|issn=0034-6748|bibcode=2013RScI...84d3905C}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As ACAR measures projections of the TPMD it is necessary to reconstruct  &lt;math&gt;\rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; in order to recover the Fermi surface. For such a reconstruction similar techniques as for X-ray [[computed tomography]] are used. In contrast to a human body, a crystal has many symmetries which can be included into the reconstruction. This makes the procedure more complex but increases the quality of the reconstruction. Another way to evaluate ACAR spectra is by a quantitative comparison with [[ab initio calculations]].&lt;ref name=Ceeh2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ceeh|first=Hubert|first9=Dieter|date=2016-02-16|title=Local electron-electron interaction strength in ferromagnetic nickel determined by spin-polarized positron annihilation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep20898|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep20898|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4754699|pmid=26879249|pages=20898|arxiv=1501.02584|bibcode=2016NatSR...620898C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early years, ACAR was mainly used to investigate the physics of the electron-positron annihilation process. In the 1930s several annihilation mechanism were discussed.&lt;ref name=Fermi&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fermi|first=Enrico|last2=Uhlenbeck|first2=George|date=1933-01-01|title=On the Recombination of Electrons and Positrons|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.44.510.2|journal=Physical Review|volume=44|issue=6|pages=510–511|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.44.510.2|bibcode=1933PhRv...44..510F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Klemperer&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klemperer|first=Otto|date=1934-07-01|title=On the annihilation radiation of the positron|url=http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0305004100012536|journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|volume=30|issue=03|doi=10.1017/s0305004100012536|issn=1469-8064|bibcode=1934PCPS...30..347K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perrin&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrin|first=F.|date=1933|title=Materialisation d'electrons lors du choc de deuxelectrons.

During this time mainly setups with ‘long slit geometry’ were used. They consisted of a positron source and a sample in the center, one fixed detector on one side and a second movable detector on the other side of the sample. Each detector was collimated in such a way that the active area was much smaller in one than in the other dimension (thus ‘long slit’).{{refn|group=note|For a sketch of a long slit setup see for example&lt;ref name=Fujiwara&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fujiwara|first=Kunio|first2=Osamu|last2=Sueoka|date=1966-01-07|journal=JPSJ|title=A Precise Measurement of the Angular Correlation of Annihilation Radiation in Copper Single Crystals|volume=21|page=1947|url=http://jpsj.ipap.jp/link?JPSJ/21/1947/|doi=10.1143/JPSJ.21.1947|bibcode=1966JPSJ...21.1947F}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A measurement with a long slit setup yields a 1D projection of the electron momentum density &lt;math&gt;\rho^{2\gamma}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, this technique is called 1D-ACAR.

The development of two-dimensional [[gamma camera]]s and [[Wire chamber|multi wire proportional chambers]] in the 1970s and early 1980s led to the setting up of the first 2D-ACAR spectrometer.&lt;ref name=Manuel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manuel|first=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3042">{{short description|unwanted secondary product of an item or process}}
A '''by-product''' is a secondary product derived from a manufacturing process or chemical reaction. It is not the primary product or service being produced. In the context of [[Manufacturing|production]], a by-product is the 'output from a joint production process that is minor in quantity and/or [[net realizable value]] (NRV) when compared with the main products'.&lt;ref&gt;Wouters, Mark; Selto, Frank H.; Hilton, Ronald W.; Maher, Michael W. (2012): ''Cost Management: Strategies for Business Decisions'', International Edition, McGraw-Hill, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are deemed to have no influence on reported financial results, by-products do not receive allocations of [[joint cost]]s. By-products also by convention are not inventoried, but the NRV from by-products is typically recognized as 'other income' or as a reduction of [[joint production process]]ing costs when the by-product is produced.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Trade Organization]] (2004): ''United States - Final dumping determination on softwood lumber from Canada'', WT/DS264/AB/R, 11 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A by-product can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste. For example, [[bran]] is a byproduct of the [[mill (grinding)|milling]] of refined [[flour]], sometimes [[compost]]ed or burned for disposal but in other cases used as a nutritious ingredient in [[food]] or [[animal feed|feed]], and [[gasoline]] was once a byproduct of [[oil refinery|oil refining]] that later became a desirable [[commodity]] as [[motor fuel]].

[[International Energy Agency|IEA]] defines "by-product" in the context of [[life-cycle assessment]]: "... main products, co-products (which involve similar revenues to the main product), by-products (which result in smaller revenues), and waste products (which provide little or no revenue)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ieabioenergy-task38.org/systemdefining/biomitre_technical_manual.pdf# |title=BIOMITRE Technical Manual, Horne, R. E. and Matthews, R., November 2004 |access-date=2011-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726171133/http://www.ieabioenergy-task38.org/systemdefining/biomitre_technical_manual.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some chemists treat "by-product" and "side-product" as synonyms in the above sense of a generic secondary (untargeted) product, others find it useful to distinguish the two.  When the two terms are distinguished, "by-product" is used to refer to a product that is not desired but inevitably results from molecular fragments of starting materials and/or reagents that are not incorporated into the desired product, as a consequence of conservation of mass.  In contrast, "side-product" is used to refer to a product that is formed from a competitive process that could, in principle, be suppressed by optimization of reaction conditions.

CDEX has [[Extrinsic semiconductor|p-type]] point-contact [[germanium]] detector surrounded by [[Sodium iodide#Thallium-doped NaI(Tl) scintillators|NaI(Tl) crystals]], similar to the [[CoGeNT]] experiment.  The CDEX-0 prototype was used to develop the current CDEX-1 detector, which has a detector mass of roughly 1&amp;nbsp;kg.  Future plans include scaling to CDEX-10 and CDEX-1T.

CDEX-1 had first low mass results in 2013 and published limits on WIMP masses 6–20&amp;nbsp;[[GeV]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=prd14/&gt;

'''Comgás''' is a Brazilian gas distributor focused on [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]]. It is Brazil's biggest gas distributor, with around 1,6&amp;nbsp;million residential, commercial and industrial customers, as of 2016, who receive gas through about {{convert|14.000|km}} of pipelines. Comgás was founded in 1872. The company had been wholly owned by the São Paulo state-owned power generation utility, ''[[Companhia Energética de São Paulo]]'' until April 1999, when CESP's stake was sold to the British [[BG Group]] and to [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. Comgas sells gas under a 30-year franchise, with a potential for a further 20 years.

Brazilian conglomerate [[Cosan]] owns 61.73% of Comgas's stock, and Shell 17.12%. The remainder is publicly traded on [[BM&amp;F Bovespa]]. Cosan acquired its stake from [[BG Group]] in November 2012 for $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=upstream030512&gt;

[[File:Nor'easter 1969-12-26 weather map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Surface weather analysis]] of the nor'easter, with its track highlighted in red]]

The '''December 1969 nor'easter''' was a strong winter storm that mainly affected the [[Northeastern United States]] and southern [[Quebec]] between December 25 and December 28, 1969. The multi-faceted storm system included a [[tornado]] outbreak, record snow accumulations, a damaging [[ice storm]], and flooding rains.

The storm developed over [[Texas]] by December 25 and advanced eastward, spawning over a dozen tornadoes in [[Louisiana]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]]. Upon reaching the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], the cyclone turned northeastward and intensified into a powerful [[nor'easter]]. On December 26 and 27, the storm's forward movement slowed to a drift, causing very heavy snow over [[Upstate New York]], [[Vermont]], and southern Quebec. Warm onshore winds, caused by a storm track close to the shore, allowed precipitation to change to sleet and rain in central and eastern New England. Where precipitation remained as snow, accumulations reached {{convert|40|in|cm}} or more, crippling travel. Drifts up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} high blocked roadways, isolating some communities and forcing emergency workers to rely on [[snowmobiles]] for transportation. At least 20 fatalities were attributed to the storm in New York and New England.

In central New England, a severe freezing rain event occurred along the boundary between cold air to the west and warmer air to the east. Several inches of [[glaze ice]], accompanied by gale-force winds, caused damage comparable to the aftermath of the [[1938 New England hurricane]]. Throughout the region, the snow and ice—in some cases further weighted by heavy rainfall—caused roofs to cave in. [[Montreal]] received {{convert|27.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow in that city's biggest snowstorm on record at the time; officials blamed the storm for 15 deaths in Quebec. In eastern New England, [[ice jam]]s, poor drainage, and several inches of rain caused flooding that forced people from their homes and submerged roadways. Wind gusts to {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and strong waves battered the coastline.

==Background==
The winter of 1969–1970 continued a long-term [[El Niño]] from the previous winter,&lt;ref name="KU473"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; which featured two significant storms in the Northeastern United States, including the [[February 1969 nor'easter|"Lindsay storm"]] in February.&lt;ref name="NCDC"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|title=The Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS)|date=|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=January 7, 2011|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/nesis.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105064938/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/nesis.php|archivedate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] (NAO) values ranged from weakly negative to weakly positive in the period leading up to the storm, trending more consistently negative in the days surrounding its genesis. NAO values dropped significantly in the wake of the nor'easter, signaling abnormally cold temperatures during January 1970.&lt;ref name="KU473"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Climate Prediction Center|title=Observation of Monthly Mean North Atlantic Oscillation|year=|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=January 7, 2010|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/month_nao_index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; December 1969 was a month of active weather throughout the Northeast, with frequent light to moderate snow events preceding the late-month nor'easter. A significant storm on December 22–23 dropped {{convert|8|to|24|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of snow in eastern New York and northern New England,&lt;ref name="climo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncdc159"/&gt; as well as significant freezing rain in southern and eastern New England. Many of the same areas would be impacted again just days later.&lt;ref name="ncdc156"/&gt;

Before the cyclone's arrival, a {{convert|1033|hPa|inHg|lk=on|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[high-pressure area]] situated north of [[New England]] funneled very cold air into the region; the {{convert|-22|F|C}} air temperature at [[Albany, New York]], on December 25 still holds the record for the city's coldest December temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Northeast Regional Climate Center|title=Minimum 1-day mean min temperature for Albany AP, NY|accessdate=January 9, 2016|url=http://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 25 and 26, extensive [[cold air damming]] and [[frontogenesis]] occurred along the U.S. East Coast. The high-pressure area slowly retreated as the storm approached.&lt;ref name="KU467"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 467&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:December 1969 nor'easter 2.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Map of the developing low-pressure system north of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on December 25]]

==Meteorological history==
The nor'easter originated in a weak area of [[low-pressure area|surface low pressure]] that formed over northern Texas by December 25. It moved generally eastward over the next day as it crossed the [[Deep South]].&lt;ref name="KU469"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; A southerly [[Low level jet|low-level jet]] (a localized wind stream in the lower levels of the atmosphere) developed by midday over [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]], and drifted eastward.&lt;ref name="KU468"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; Precipitation soon blossomed, with heavy snow falling over the [[Appalachian Mountains]] by late on December 25. The low turned toward the northeast by early on December 26 to follow the temperature gradient along the East Coast, at which time the storm underwent the first of two periods of rapid intensification. In 12 hours, barometric pressure fell 12 hPa to {{convert|996|hPa|inHg|abbr=on}} while the nor'easter accelerated from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the coast of [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="KU467"/&gt; This bout of strengthening  occurred as the associated upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] at the 500-millibar level&amp;nbsp;– several miles into the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– assumed a negative tilt from northwest to southeast.&lt;ref name="KU473"/&gt; Heavy precipitation overspread the Mid-Atlantic and New England early on December 26.&lt;ref name="KU467"/&gt;

The low-level jet continued to strengthen and delivered warm air to areas east of the storm center, where precipitation quickly transitioned to rain. The jet ultimately reached extremely high velocities of {{convert|55|m/s|mph|abbr=on}} as it wrapped around the northern side of the low, feeding abundant moisture into areas of heavy precipitation.&lt;ref name="KU473"/&gt; The storm slowed drastically on December 26,&lt;ref name="KU467"/&gt; and over the next 24 hours, it moved very slowly from [[Cape May, New Jersey]], to near [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="climo"/&gt; During this period, exceptionally heavy snow fell over eastern New York, Vermont, and southern Quebec. While located just east of [[Long Island]] on December 27, the nor'easter began its second phase of rapid strengthening that brought central pressure down to {{convert|976|hPa|inHg|abbr=on}}. During this period of intensification, snow propagated around the western side of the system, reaching as far south as Long Island.&lt;ref name="KU467"/&gt;

With a storm track very close to the shore and a retreating high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A [[weather front|frontal boundary]] between the warm Atlantic air and a residual wedge of colder air over the interior served as the focus for a severe [[ice storm]] in central New England.&lt;ref name="KU467"/&gt; Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas.&lt;ref name="ncdc154"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncdc157"/&gt; By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed [[cold-core low]].&lt;ref name="KU473"/&gt; The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.&lt;ref name="KU467"/&gt;

==Impact and aftermath==
[[File:Christmas 1969 nor'easter snowfall map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|United States snowfall map from the [[National Climatic Data Center]]]]

===Southeast U.S. and Mid-Atlantic===
The developing extratropical cyclone spawned 16 known tornadoes and waterspouts in [[Louisiana]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]], becoming the largest [[Christmas Day]] tornado outbreak on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Livingston|title=Christmas Eve and Christmas Day tornado history|date=December 23, 2012|publisher=US Tornadoes|accessdate=January 8, 2016|url=http://www.ustornadoes.com/2012/12/23/christmas-eve-and-christmas-day-tornado-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short-lived [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado touched down in [[Vermillion Parish, Louisiana]], destroying eight homes near [[Kaplan, Louisiana|Kaplan]] and damaging 25 more. One woman was killed and eight were injured, three severely enough to require hospitalization. Another damaging tornado moved through several settlements in southern [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish]] just over two hours later; the tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged multiple other buildings, with one injury reported. The tornado was officially classified an F3,&lt;ref name="ncdc156"&gt;''Storm Data'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; though meteorologist [[Thomas P. Grazulis]] determined it to have caused damage consistent with an F2 rating.&lt;ref name="grazulis502"/&gt; A non-tornadic wind gust destroyed a nearby trailer home.&lt;ref name="ncdc156"&gt;''Storm Data'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, a tornado skipped along a path through [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]] and [[Concordia Parish, Louisiana|Concordia]] parishes, touching down three different times. The F2 tornado damaged about 20 trailer homes in [[Glade, Louisiana|Glade]], and caused further damage near the end of its track.&lt;ref name="grazulis502"&gt;Grazulis, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

A tornado in southern Georgia, about {{convert|9|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Albany, Georgia|Albany]],&lt;ref name="grazulis502"&gt;Grazulis, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; damaged or destroyed several small homes, killed three head of cattle, toppled numerous trees, and injured seven people. Elsewhere in the state, there were isolated reports of hail and damaging thunderstorm winds.&lt;ref name="ncdc155"&gt;''Storm Data'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Several tornadoes in the [[Florida Panhandle]] caused minor to moderate damage to trees and homes, the most destructive of them occurring in [[Quincy, Florida]].&lt;ref name="ncdc154-155"&gt;''Storm Data'', pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; That tornado struck an industrial area and unroofed at least three structures.&lt;ref name="airports"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Snow Piles Quickly in Coast Area|date=December 26, 1969|work=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=March 10, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rEpJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z4QMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=maryland%20snow&amp;pg=665%2C3741045}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tornado in [[Lee, Florida]], destroyed a trailer, damaged farm buildings, and injured one person.&lt;ref name="ncdc154-155"/&gt;

In addition to widespread rain, parts of northern [[South Carolina]] experienced freezing rain that damaged trees and power lines. Freezing rain and sleet fell over the southern [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] of [[North Carolina]], resulting in power outages and dangerous travel conditions.&lt;ref name="ncdc158-159"&gt;''Storm Data'', pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; At least one fatal traffic accident was reported. Heavy snow covered the northwest Piedmont and [[Western North Carolina|Mountain Region]] of the state, accumulating to around {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} at [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=For much of the state, a white Christmas|date=December 26, 1969|newspaper=The Daily Times-News|accessdate=January 9, 2016|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4000987/the_daily_timesnews/}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurring on the heels of another winter storm, this snowfall contributed to depths up to {{convert|2|ft|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} at higher elevations.&lt;ref name="ncdc158-159"/&gt; High winds from the storm left at least 50,000 electric customers in the [[Richmond, Virginia]] region without power. In [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]], strong winds uprooted trees.&lt;ref name="airports"/&gt; Significant snow accumulations occurred throughout the Mid-Atlantic, chiefly away from the coastal plain. Snowfall exceeded {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} in parts of western [[Virginia]], western [[Maryland]], and [[West Virginia]]; [[Washington, D.C.]] received {{convert|12.1|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow.&lt;ref name="KU467"/&gt;

===Northeast U.S.===
The cyclone was rated by meteorology researchers [[Paul Kocin|Kocin]] and Uccellini (2004) as a high-end Category 3 on the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale, equating to a "major" winter storm.&lt;ref name="KU467"/&gt; However, more recent data from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] classifies the nor'easter as a low-end "crippling" Category 4.&lt;ref name="NCDC"/&gt; By December 30, at least 20 deaths in New York and New England had been attributed to the storm, largely from traffic accidents and physical exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Albany"/&gt;

Areas of northeastern [[Pennsylvania]], eastern New York, and Vermont received snowfall in excess of {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}}, including {{convert|29.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} at [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], {{convert|26.4|in|cm|abbr=on}} at [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and {{convert|21.9|in|cm|abbr=on}} at [[Binghamton, New York]].&lt;ref name="KU467"/&gt; Accumulations locally exceeded {{convert|40|in|cm|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="aly"/&gt; with {{convert|45|in|cm|abbr=on}} measured at [[Waitsfield, Vermont]] and {{convert|48|in|cm|abbr=on}} in the small village of [[East Wallingford, Vermont]].&lt;ref name="ncdc159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="48in"&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Wintry blast buries much of New England|date=December 29, 1969|newspaper=The El Dorado Times|accessdate=January 10, 2015|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4014995/the_el_dorado_times/}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm remains one of the greatest on record in cities like Albany and Burlington, and contributed to high monthly snowfall totals; in Albany, December 1969 stands as the snowiest documented month, with {{convert|57.5|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="aly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burlington, Vermont top 20 greatest snowstorms|publisher=National Weather Service Burlington, Vermont|accessdate=January 10, 2015|url=http://www.weather.gov/media/btv/climo/extremes/top20snow.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the region, the weight of the snow, combined with [[Beaufort scale|gale-force]] winds, collapsed roofs and brought down power lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|title=New England Clogged by 2-Day Snow|date=December 28, 1969|work=The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=January 7, 2011|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/631921492.html?dids=631921492:631921492&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+28%2C+1969&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=NEW+ENGLAND+CLOGGED+BY+2-DAY+SNOW&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winds blew snow from this and previous storms into drifts as high as {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}},&lt;ref name="Vermont"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux|title=Climate Variability and Socioeconomic Consequences of Vermont's Natural Hazards: A Historical Perspective|year=2002|publisher=Vermont Historical Society|accessdate=January 7, 2010|url=http://www.vthistory.org/journal/70/vt701_204.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725172833/http://www.vthistory.org/journal/70/vt701_204.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; blocking roads and leaving some communities isolated.&lt;ref name="Albany"/&gt; In some areas, travel was only possible with snowmobiles, which were used by emergency workers to deliver emergency supplies as needed.

Governor [[Deane C.

The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer.&lt;ref name="Albany"/&gt; One person died in [[Saxtons River, Vermont|Saxtons River]].&lt;ref name="ncdc159"/&gt; With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk.&lt;ref name="ncdc157"&gt;''Storm Data'', p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vermont"/&gt; In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually.&lt;ref name="Albany"/&gt; One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.&lt;ref name="ncdc157"&gt;''Storm Data'', p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The influx of warm, moist air over a wedge of cold air near the surface resulted in a severe ice storm across central and northern New England, most notably in the upper [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River Valley]]. [[Glaze ice]] thicker than {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}}, and reportedly up to {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick in Vermont, built up on trees and power lines, wreaking "unbelievable" havoc.&lt;ref name="ncdc159"/&gt; In the hardest-hit areas, damage from the ice storm was comparable to that caused by the [[1938 New England hurricane]].&lt;ref name="ncdc157"/&gt; The combined load of snow and ice caused significant damage to many residential and industrial buildings, with several factory and warehouse roofs collapsing.&lt;ref name="ncdc159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ice"/&gt; Livestock were killed in multiple rural building collapses throughout the area.&lt;ref name="ncdc159"/&gt; Southern Maine endured its second damaging ice storm in a week, with many of the same communities losing power on both occasion.&lt;ref name="ncdc156"/&gt; Precipitation also transitioned to freezing rain and sleet across interior [[Connecticut]], where the dangerous conditions induced numerous traffic accidents.&lt;ref name="ncdc154"&gt;''Storm Data'', p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the abnormally cold temperatures in the wake of the storm, the glaze persisted for up to six weeks, much longer than the typical three days for ice storms in New England.&lt;ref name="ice"&gt;{{cite journal|author=S.

The changeover to heavy rain in southern and eastern New England swelled frozen rivers, creating ice jams which induced severe flooding. Flooding of roadways and homes was compounded by drainage issues from the dense snowcover.&lt;ref name="ncdc156"/&gt; Rising floodwaters forced hundreds of families to leave their homes in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. Up to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain fell in the [[Boston]] region, where thousands of homes were inundated. Rivers had begun to recede by December 29 after cresting well above flood stage.&lt;ref name="Modesto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press|title=Vermont Declared a Disaster Area|date=December 29, 1969|work=The Meriden Journal|accessdate=January 7, 2011|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rcZHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PP8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=803,8248600&amp;dq=vermont+ice-storm&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain fell over [[Rhode Island]] after {{convert|6|to|11|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, with widespread flooding reported in multiple towns. Frequent automobile accidents and large traffic jams were reported in the state.&lt;ref name="ncdc159"&gt;''Storm Data'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Winds were strongest in [[Cape Cod|Cape Cod, Massachusetts]], where gusts peaked near {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The gales were particularly damaging to trees laden with snow and ice. The heavy rainfall in eastern Massachusetts added tremendous weigh to the snow that had already fallen, causing roof collapses and making it difficult to clear the snow. In southeastern New Hampshire, the strong winds toppled trees and blew out windows in [[Hampton Beach, New Hampshire|Hampton Beach]].&lt;ref name="ncdc157"/&gt; Although the coastal plain of New England avoided the heaviest snow accumulations, pounding surf and strong winds battered piers, boats, and other coastal installations, while low-lying areas experienced [[storm surge]] flooding.&lt;ref name="ncdc156-157"&gt;''Storm Data'', pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
The storm dropped up to {{convert|30|in|cm|abbr=on|round=5}} of snow in southern [[Quebec]], where wind gusts up to {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} damaged buildings and brought down power lines.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt; Over a period of 60 hours, {{convert|27.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow fell at [[Montreal]] in what was then the city's heaviest snowfall on record.

Decynium-22 has been shown to block the uptake of [[1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium]] (MPP) via the [[OCT3]] transporter in rat [[astrocytes]].&lt;ref name="pmid12485400"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Inazu M, Takeda H, Matsumiya T | title=Expression and functional characterization of the extraneuronal monoamine transporter in normal human astrocytes. | journal=J Neurochem | year= 2003 | volume= 84 | issue= 1 | pages= 43–52 | doi= 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2003.01566.x| pmc= | pmid=12485400  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorescence==
Decynium-22 emits a low [[fluorescence]] yield (around 0.001), and in its monomeric form is a weakly fluorescent. However, aggregated decynium-22 emits a strong [[Superradiance|superradiant]] emission with a maximum near 570–580&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;Stiel H, Daehne S, Teuchner K.

J Physical Chem A. 2000;104:9670–9674.&lt;/ref&gt; 480&amp;nbsp;nm light falls near a short wavelength peak of the [[excitation spectrum]] of these aggregates. Decynium-22 fluorescence caused by aggregation can be observed in astrocytes.&lt;ref name="pmid23875515" /&gt;

==Schizophrenia and depression==
Decynium-22 has recently been investigated for its role in increasing [[extracellular]] [[serotonin]] in the brain in neuropharmacology research. The transportation of the neurotransmitter serotonin is often disrupted in psychiatric disorders characterized by social impairment, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Serotonin is primarily taken up by the [[5-HT transporter]] (SERT), although it is also taken up by auxiliary transporters, known as "uptake 2", which include OCT and PMAT.

The most commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), which act by blocking the high affinity SERT. A proposed explanation for the limited efficacy of SSRIs is the presence of the low affinity transporters OCT and PMAT, which limit the ability of SSRIs to increase [[extracellular]] serotonin. Decynium-22 blocked serotonin uptake via these auxiliary transporters, and when used in conjunction with SSRIs, decynium-22 enhanced the effects of SSRIs to inhibit serotonin clearance.&lt;ref name="pmid23785165"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Horton RE, Apple DM, Owens WA, Baganz NL, Cano S, Mitchell NC | title=Decynium-22 enhances SSRI-induced antidepressant-like effects in mice: uncovering novel targets to treat depression. | journal=J Neurosci | year= 2013 | volume= 33 | issue= 25 | pages= 10534–43 | pmid=23785165 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5687-11.2013 | pmc=3685842 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar effect was seen in SERT [[knock-out mice]], which resulted in an improvement of social behavior.&lt;ref name="pmid6860"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Loginova LG, Iakovleva MB, Golovina IG, Bogdanova TI | title=[Yeast cell wall-dissolving enzymes of the thermotolerant actinomycete Thermoactinomyces vulgaris]. | journal=Mikrobiologiia | year= 1976 | volume= 45 | issue= 2 | pages= 291–7 | doi= | pmc= | pmid=6860  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When OCT3 was knocked out in mice, however, decynium-22 was ineffectual, indicating that the anti-depressant effects of decynium-22 are dependent upon its blockage of the OCT3.&lt;ref name="pmid23785165" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2828">'''&lt;big&gt;Ecosystem respiration&lt;/big&gt;''' &lt;small&gt;is the operation in which the organisms within a specified ecosystem use the process of respiration to convert organic carbon to carbon dioxide. While the amount of respiration is varied upon the type of ecosystem and the community abundance, the mechanism occurs in both aquatic and terrestrial environments.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Ecosystem respiration''' is the sum of all [[cellular respiration|respiration]] occurring by the living organisms in a specific [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yvon-Durocher|first=Gabriel|last2=Caffrey|first2=Jane M.|last3=Cescatti|first3=Alessandro|last4=Dossena|first4=Matteo|last5=Giorgio|first5=Paul del|last6=Gasol|first6=Josep M.|last7=Montoya|first7=José M.|last8=Pumpanen|first8=Jukka|last9=Staehr|first9=Peter A.|date=2012-06-20|title=Reconciling the temperature dependence of respiration across timescales and ecosystem types|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11205|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=487|issue=7408|pages=472–476|doi=10.1038/nature11205|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ecosystem respiration is typically measured in the natural environment, such as a forest or grassland field, rather than in the laboratory.  Ecosystem respiration is the production portion of [[carbon dioxide]] in an ecosystem's [[carbon flux]], while [[photosynthesis]] typically accounts for the majority of the ecosystem's carbon consumption.

'''&lt;big&gt;How ecosystem respiration works and its importance:&lt;/big&gt;'''

&lt;small&gt;Ecosystem respiration happens when a cell takes glucose and oxygen and uses it to produce carbon dioxide, energy, and water. This transaction is important not only for the benefit of the cells, but for the carbon dioxide output provided, which is key in the process of photosynthesis. Without respiration, actions necessary to life, such as metabolic processes and photosynthesis, would cease&lt;/small&gt;

'''Expanded polyethylene''' (aka '''EPE foam''') refers to foams made from [[polyethylene]]. Typically it is made from expanded pellets ('EPE bead') made with use of a [[blowing agent]], followed by expansion into a mold in a steam chest - the process is similar to that used to make [[expanded polystyrene foam]].

==Properties==
EPE foams are low density, semi-rigid, [[closed cell foam]] that are generally somewhere in [[stiffness]]/compliance between [[Expanded polystyrene]] and [[Polyurethane]]. Production of EPE foams is similar to that of expanded polystyrene, but starting with PE beads.{{sfn|Rosato|Rosato|Rosato|2004|p=359}} Typical densities are {{convert|29|to|120|kg/m3|abbr=on}} with the lower figure being common.{{sfn|Rosato|Rosato|Rosato|2004|p=359}} Densities as low as {{convert|14|kg/m3|abbr=on}} can be produced.{{sfn|Spalding|Chatterjee|2017|p=639}}

Base polymer for EPE foams range from [[Low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE) to [[High-density polyethylene]] (HDPE).{{sfn|Spalding|Chatterjee|2017|p=639}}

===Co-polymers===
Expanded polyethylene copolymers (EPC) are also known - such as 50:50 (weight) materials with [[polystyrene]]. Though other properties are intermediate between the two bases, toughness for the copolymer exceeds either, with good tensile and puncture resistance. It is particularly applicable for re-usable products.{{sfn|Rosato|Rosato|Rosato|2004|p=359}}

==Production==
EPE foams were first manufactured in the 1970s.{{sfn|Spalding|Chatterjee|2017|p=639}}

Production of the PE beads is usually by extrusion, followed by chopping, producing a 'pellet'.{{sfn|Spalding|Chatterjee|2017|loc=Fig. 21.2 p.643; pp.650-652}} [[Autoclave]] expansion is the most common route the bead foam.{{sfn|Spalding|Chatterjee|2017|p=640}} Butane or pentane is often used as a [[blowing agent]] (before 1992 CFCs may have been used). Depending on the specific process uses the beads may be [[cross-linked]] either by electron beam irradiation (see [[Electron beam processing]]), or by the addition of a chemical agent such as [[Dicumyl peroxide]].{{sfn|Spalding|Chatterjee|2017|loc=Fig. 21.2 p.643; pp.650-652}}

An alternate route (JSP Process) to the beads uses [[carbon dioxide]] as a blowing agent which is impregenated into the pellets in an autoclave at a temperature close to the plastic's crystalline melting point. The pellets are foamed by "flashing" into the (lower pressure) atmosphere to expand.{{sfn|Spalding|Chatterjee|2017|pp=651-2}}

Finally molding is done by [[steam chest compression molding]]; usually the low pressure variant of the process is used, though the high pressure variant may be used for HDPE based EPE foams.{{sfn|Spalding|Chatterjee|2017|pp=645-6}}

==Uses ==
Polyethylene bead foams (including) EPE can be used to replace both [[polystyrene foam]], and both rigid and flexible [[polyurethane]]. Uses include cushioning applications, and impact absorption applications including packaging.{{sfn|Spalding|Chatterjee|2017|p=640}}

Consumption of [[polyethylene]] for PE foam was estimated at 114x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; kg in 2001. The majority was used for non-crosslinked foams, but crosslinked PE foams represented a significant (~ one third) fraction of demand. Use in protective packaging represented the largest use sector for such foams.{{sfn|Mills|2003|p=34}}

The '''Fermi level'''  [[chemical potential]] for electrons (or [[electrochemical potential]] for electrons) of a body is the [[thermodynamic work]] required to add one electron to the body. It is a [[thermodynamic]] quantity usually denoted by ''µ'' or ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Solid State Physics, 7th Edition|last1=Kittel|first1=Charles|publisher=Wiley|year=&lt;!--replace this comment with the publication year--&gt;|authorlink1=Charles Kittel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
for brevity. The Fermi level does not include the work required to remove the electron from wherever it came from.
A precise understanding of the Fermi level—how it relates to [[electronic band structure]] in determining electronic properties, how it relates to the voltage and [[electrical current|flow of charge]] in an electronic circuit—is essential to an understanding of solid-state physics.

In [[band structure]] theory, used in [[solid state physics]] to analyze the energy levels in a solid, the Fermi level can be considered to be a hypothetical energy level of an electron, such that at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] this energy level would have a ''50% probability of being occupied at any given time''.
The position of the Fermi level with the relation to the band energy levels is a crucial factor in determining electrical properties.
The Fermi level does not necessarily correspond to an actual energy level (in an insulator the Fermi level lies in the [[band gap]]), nor does it require the existence of a band structure.
Nonetheless, the Fermi level is a precisely defined thermodynamic quantity, and differences in Fermi level can be measured simply with a [[voltmeter]].

==Voltage measurement==

[[File:Old Volt Meter pic3.JPG|thumb|A [[voltmeter]] measures differences in Fermi level divided by [[electron charge]].]]

Sometimes it is said that electric currents are driven by differences in [[electrostatic potential]] ([[Galvani potential]]), but this is not exactly true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00542-5|title=What does a voltmeter measure?|journal=Solid State Ionics|volume=95|issue=3–4|pages=327–328|year=1997|last1=Riess|first1=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a counterexample, multi-material devices such as [[p–n junction]]s contain internal electrostatic potential differences at equilibrium, yet without any accompanying net current; if a voltmeter is attached to the junction, one simply measures zero volts.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |title=Fundamentals of Solid-State Electronics
 |last1=Sah |first1=Chih-Tang |authorlink1=

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Clearly, the electrostatic potential is not the only factor influencing the flow of charge in a material—[[Pauli repulsion]], carrier concentration gradients, electromagnetic induction, and thermal effects also play an important role.

In fact, the quantity called ''voltage'' as measured in an electronic circuit has a simple relationship to the chemical potential for electrons (Fermi level).
When the leads of a [[voltmeter]] are attached to two points in a circuit, the displayed voltage is a measure of the ''total'' work transferred when a unit charge is allowed to move from one point to the other.
If a simple wire is connected between two points of differing voltage (forming a [[short circuit]]), current will flow from positive to negative voltage, converting the available work into heat.

The Fermi level of a body expresses the work required to add an electron to it, or equally the work obtained by removing an electron.
Therefore, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, the observed difference in voltage between two points, ''A'' and ''B'', in an electronic circuit is exactly related to the corresponding chemical potential difference, ''µ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''µ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, in Fermi level by the formula&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{A} - V_\mathrm{B} = \frac{\mu_\mathrm{A} - \mu_\mathrm{B}}{-e} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''−e'' is the [[electron charge]].

From the above discussion it can be seen that electrons will move from a body of high ''µ'' (low voltage) to low ''µ'' (high voltage) if a simple path is provided.
This flow of electrons will cause the lower ''µ'' to increase (due to charging or other repulsion effects) and likewise cause the higher ''µ'' to decrease.
Eventually, ''µ'' will settle down to the same value in both bodies.
This leads to an important fact regarding the equilibrium (off) state of an electronic circuit:
:''An electronic circuit in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] will have a constant Fermi level throughout its connected parts.''{{According to whom|date=May 2017}}

This also means that the voltage (measured with a voltmeter) between any two points will be zero, at equilibrium.
Note that [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] here requires that the circuit be internally connected and not contain any batteries or other power sources, nor any variations in temperature.

==Band structure of solids==

{{Band structure filling diagram}}
[[File:Fermi.gif|thumb|250px|left|Fermi-Dirac distribution &lt;math&gt;f(\epsilon) \ &lt;/math&gt; vs. energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \ &lt;/math&gt;, with ''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.55&amp;nbsp;eV and for various temperatures in the range 50K&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''T''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;375K.]]
In the [[band theory]] of solids, electrons are considered to occupy a series of bands composed of single-particle energy eigenstates each labelled by ''ϵ''. Although this single particle picture is an approximation, it greatly simplifies the understanding of electronic behaviour and it generally provides correct results when applied correctly.

The [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution]], &lt;math&gt;f(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, gives the probability that (at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]) a state having energy ''ϵ'' is occupied by an electron:&lt;ref name=Kittel1980&gt;{{cite book | last = Kittel | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Kittel |author2=[[Herbert Kroemer]]  | title = Thermal Physics (2nd Edition) | publisher = W. H. Freeman | date = 1980-01-15 | location = | page = 357 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c0R79nyOoNMC&amp;pg=PA357| doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7167-1088-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f(\epsilon) = \frac{1}{e^{(\epsilon - \mu)/kT} + 1} &lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''T'' is the [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] and ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]. If there is a state at the Fermi level (''ϵ'' = ''µ''), then this state will have a 50% chance of being occupied. The distribution is plotted in the left figure. The closer ''f'' is to 1, the higher chance this state is occupied. The closer ''f'' is to 0, the higher chance this state is empty.

The location of ''µ'' within a material's band structure is important in determining the electrical behaviour of the material.
* In an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]], ''µ'' lies within a large [[band gap]], far away from any states that are able to carry current.
* In a metal, [[semimetal]] or degenerate semiconductor, ''µ'' lies within a delocalized band. A large number of states nearby ''µ'' are thermally active and readily carry current.
* In an intrinsic or lightly doped semiconductor, ''µ'' is close enough to a band edge that there are a dilute number of thermally excited carriers residing near that band edge.

In semiconductors and semimetals the position of ''µ'' relative to the band structure can usually be controlled to a significant degree by doping or gating. These controls do not change ''µ'' which is fixed by the electrodes, but rather they cause the entire band structure to shift up and down (sometimes also changing the band structure's shape). For further information about the Fermi levels of semiconductors, see (for example) Sze.&lt;ref&gt;

===Local conduction band referencing, internal chemical potential and the parameter ''ζ''===

If the symbol ''ℰ'' is used to denote an electron energy level measured relative to the energy of the edge of its enclosing band, ''ϵ''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, then in general we have ''ℰ'' =  ''ϵ'' – ''ϵ''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. We can define a parameter ''ζ''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | author=Sommerfeld, Arnold
 | title= Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics
 | publisher=Academic Press
 | year=1964
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that references the Fermi level with respect to the band edge:
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \mu - \epsilon_{\rm C}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the Fermi–Dirac distribution function can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathcal{E}) = \frac{1}{e^{(\mathcal{E} - \zeta)/kT} + 1}. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[electronic band structure|band theory]] of metals was initially developed by Sommerfeld, from 1927 onwards, who paid great attention to the underlying thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Confusingly, in some contexts the band-referenced quantity ''ζ'' may be called the ''Fermi level'', ''chemical potential'', or ''electrochemical potential'', leading to ambiguity with the globally-referenced Fermi level.
In this article, the terms ''conduction-band referenced Fermi level'' or ''internal chemical potential'' are used to refer to ''ζ''.

[[File:HEMT-band structure scheme-en.svg|thumb|270px|Example of variations in conduction band edge ''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; in a [[band diagram]] of GaAs/AlGaAs [[heterojunction]]-based [[high-electron-mobility transistor]].]]

''ζ'' is directly related to the number of active charge carriers as well as their typical kinetic energy, and hence it is directly involved in determining the local properties of the material (such as [[electrical conductivity]]).
For this reason it is common to focus on the value of ''ζ'' when concentrating on the properties of electrons in a single, homogeneous conductive material.
By analogy to the energy states of a free electron, the ''ℰ'' of a state is the [[kinetic energy]] of that state and ''ϵ''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is its [[potential energy]]. With this in mind, the parameter, ''ζ'', could also be labelled the ''Fermi kinetic energy''.

Unlike ''µ'', the parameter, ''ζ'', is not a constant at equilibrium, but rather varies from location to location in a material due to variations in ''ϵ''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, which is determined by  factors such as material quality and impurities/dopants.
Near the surface of a semiconductor or semimetal, ''ζ'' can be strongly controlled by externally applied electric fields, as is done in a [[field effect transistor]]. In a multi-band material, ''ζ'' may even take on multiple values in a single location.
For example, in a piece of aluminum metal there are two conduction bands crossing the Fermi level (even more bands in other materials);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~tschoy/r2d2/Fermi/Fermi.html |title=3D Fermi Surface Site |publisher=Phys.ufl.edu |date=1998-05-27 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; each band has a different edge energy, ''ϵ''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, and a different ''ζ''.

The value of ''ζ'' at [[absolute zero|zero temperature]] is widely known as the [[Fermi energy]], sometimes written ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Confusingly (again), the name ''Fermi energy'' sometimes is used to refer to ''ζ'' at non-zero temperature.

==Temperature out of equilibrium==
{{see also|Quasi-Fermi level}}
The Fermi level, ''μ'', and temperature, ''T'', are well defined constants for a solid-state device in thermodynamic equilibrium situation, such as when it is sitting on the shelf doing nothing. When the device is brought out of equilibrium and put into use, then strictly speaking the Fermi level and temperature are no longer well defined. Fortunately, it is often possible to define a quasi-Fermi level and quasi-temperature for a given location, that accurately describe the occupation of states in terms of a thermal distribution. The device is said to be in ''quasi-equilibrium'' when and where such a description is possible.

The quasi-equilibrium approach allows one to build a simple picture of some non-equilibrium effects as the [[electrical conductivity]] of a piece of metal (as resulting from a gradient of ''μ'') or its [[thermal conductivity]] (as resulting from a gradient in ''T''). The quasi-''μ'' and quasi-''T'' can vary (or not exist at all) in any non-equilibrium situation, such as:
*If the system contains a chemical imbalance (as in a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]).
*If the system is exposed to changing electromagnetic fields (as in [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, and [[transformer]]s).
*Under illumination from a light-source with a different temperature, such as the sun (as in [[solar cell]]s),
*When the temperature is not constant within the device (as in [[thermocouple]]s),
*When the device has been altered, but has not had enough time to re-equilibrate (as in [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] or [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]] substances).

In some situations, such as immediately after a material experiences a high-energy laser pulse, the electron distribution cannot be described by any thermal distribution.
One cannot define the quasi-Fermi level or quasi-temperature in this case; the electrons are simply said to be ''non-thermalized''. In less dramatic situations, such as in a solar cell under constant illumination, a quasi-equilibrium description may be possible but requiring the assignment of distinct values of ''μ'' and ''T'' to different bands (conduction band vs. valence band). Even then, the values of ''μ'' and ''T'' may jump discontinuously across a material interface (e.g., [[p–n junction]]) when a current is being driven, and be ill-defined at the interface itself.

==Technicalities==

===Terminology problems===

The term, ''Fermi level'', is mainly used in discussing the solid state physics of electrons in [[semiconductor]]s, and a precise usage of this term is necessary to describe [[band diagram]]s in devices comprising different materials with different levels of doping.
In these contexts, however, one may also see Fermi level used imprecisely to refer to the ''band-referenced Fermi level'', ''µ''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''ϵ''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, called ''ζ'' above.
It is common to see scientists and engineers refer to "controlling", "[[Fermi level pinning|pinning]]", or "tuning" the Fermi level inside a conductor, when they are in fact describing changes in ''ϵ''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; due to [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or the [[field effect (semiconductor)|field effect]].
In fact, [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] guarantees that the Fermi level in a conductor is ''always'' fixed to be exactly equal to the Fermi level of the electrodes; only the band structure (not the Fermi level) can be changed by doping or the field effect (see also [[band diagram]]).
A [[Electrochemical potential#Conflicting terminologies|similar ambiguity]] exists between the terms, ''[[chemical potential]]'' and ''[[electrochemical potential]]''.

It is also important to note that Fermi ''level'' is not necessarily the same thing as [[Fermi energy|Fermi ''energy'']].
In the wider context of quantum mechanics, the term [[Fermi energy]] usually refers to ''the maximum kinetic energy of a fermion in an idealized non-interacting, disorder free, zero temperature [[Fermi gas]]''.
This concept is very theoretical (there is no such thing as a non-interacting Fermi gas, and zero temperature is impossible to achieve). However, it finds some use in approximately describing [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, [[atomic nuclei]], and electrons in a [[metal]].
On the other hand, in the fields of semiconductor physics and engineering, ''Fermi energy'' often is used to refer to the Fermi level described in this article.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0rf9_2ckeYC&amp;pg=PA49 |title=Electronics (fundamentals And Applications)|author= D. Chattopadhyay|isbn=978-81-224-1780-7|year=2006}} and {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmg13dHPKg8C&amp;pg=PA113| title=Semiconductor Physics and Applications|author=  Balkanski and Wallis|isbn=978-0-19-851740-5|date=2000-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fermi level referencing and the location of zero Fermi level===

Much like the choice of origin in a coordinate system, the zero point of energy can be defined arbitrarily. Observable phenomena only depend on energy differences.
When comparing distinct bodies, however, it is important that they all be consistent in their choice of the location of zero energy, or else nonsensical results will be obtained.
It can therefore be helpful to explicitly name a common point to ensure that different components are in agreement.
On the other hand, if a reference point is inherently ambiguous (such as "the vacuum", see below) it will instead cause more problems.

A practical and well-justified choice of common point is a bulky, physical conductor, such as the [[electrical ground]] or earth.
Such a conductor can be considered to be in a good thermodynamic equilibrium and so its ''µ'' is well defined.
It provides a reservoir of charge, so that large numbers of electrons may be added or removed without incurring charging effects.
It also has the advantage of being accessible, so that the Fermi level of any other object can be measured simply with a voltmeter.

====Why it is not advisable to use "the energy in vacuum" as a reference zero====

[[File:Work function mismatch gold aluminum.svg|thumb|300 px|When the two metals depicted here are in thermodynamic equilibrium as shown (equal Fermi levels E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;), the vacuum [[electrostatic potential]] ''ϕ'' is not flat due to a difference in [[work function]].]]

In principle, one might consider using the state of a stationary electron in the vacuum as a reference point for energies.
This approach is not advisable unless one is careful to define exactly where ''the vacuum'' is.&lt;ref&gt;Technically, it is possible to consider the vacuum to be an insulator and in fact its Fermi level is defined if its surroundings are in equilibrium. Typically however the Fermi level is two to five electron volts ''below'' the vacuum electrostatic potential energy, depending on the [[work function]] of the nearby vacuum wall material. Only at high temperatures will the equilibrium vacuum be populated with a significant number of electrons (this is the basis of [[thermionic emission]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is that not all points in the vacuum are equivalent.

At thermodynamic equilibrium, it is typical for electrical potential differences of order 1 V to exist in the vacuum ([[Volta potential]]s).
The source of this vacuum potential variation is the variation in [[work function]] between the different conducting materials exposed to vacuum.
Just outside a conductor, the electrostatic potential depends sensitively on the material, as well as which surface is selected (its crystal orientation, contamination, and other details).

The parameter that gives the best approximation to universality is the Earth-referenced Fermi level suggested above. This also has the advantage that it can be measured with a voltmeter.

===Discrete charging effects in small systems===
In cases where the "charging effects" due to a single electron are non-negligible, the above definitions should be clarified. For example, consider a [[capacitor]] made of two identical parallel-plates. If the capacitor is uncharged, the Fermi level is the same on both sides, so one might think that it should take no energy to move an electron from one plate to the other. But when the electron has been moved, the capacitor has become (slightly) charged, so this does take a slight amount of energy. In a normal capacitor, this is negligible, but in a [[nanotechnology|nano-scale]] capacitor it can be more important.

In this case one must be precise about the thermodynamic definition of the chemical potential as well as the state of the device: is it electrically isolated, or is it connected to an electrode?
{{unordered list
|1= When the body is able to exchange electrons and energy with an electrode (reservoir), it is described by the [[grand canonical ensemble]].  The value of chemical potential {{math|''µ''}} can be said to be fixed by the electrode, and the number of electrons {{math|''N''}} on the body may fluctuate. In this case, the chemical potential of a body is the infinitesimal amount of work needed to increase the ''average'' number of electrons by an infinitesimal amount (even though the number of electrons at any time is an integer, the average number varies continuously.): 
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(\left\langle N \right\rangle,T) = \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \left\langle N \right\rangle}\right)_T,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''F''(''N'', ''T'')}} is the [[Helmholtz free energy|free energy]] function of the grand canonical ensemble.
|2= If the number of electrons in the body is fixed (but the body is still thermally connected to a heat bath), then it is in the [[canonical ensemble]]. We can define a "chemical potential" in this case literally as the work required to add one electron to a body that already has exactly {{math|''N''}} electrons,&lt;ref&gt;

where {{math|''F''(''N'', ''T'')}} is the free energy function of the canonical ensemble, or alternatively as the work obtained by removing an electron from that body,
:&lt;math&gt;\mu''(N, T) = F(N, T) - F(N - 1, T) = \mu'(N - 1, T).&lt;/math&gt;
}}

These chemical potentials are not equivalent, {{math|''µ'' ≠ ''µ&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ≠ ''µ&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''}}, except in the [[thermodynamic limit]].
The distinction is important in small systems such as those showing [[Coulomb blockade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beenakker | first1 = C. W.

The parameter, {{math|''µ''}}, (i.e., in the case where the number of electrons is allowed to fluctuate) remains exactly related to the voltmeter voltage, even in small systems.
To be precise, then, the Fermi level is defined not by a deterministic charging event by one electron charge, but rather a statistical charging event by an infinitesimal fraction of an electron.

'''Joseph Anthony Tainter''' (born December 8, 1949) is an American [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and historian.

==Biography==
Tainter studied anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley and [[Northwestern University]], where he received his Ph.D. in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainabilityintl.com/biographies/josephtainter Tainter's curriculum vitae at Sustainability International website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620211958/http://sustainabilityintl.com/biographies/josephtainter |date=2011-06-20 }}; [http://www.cnr.usu.edu/htm/facstaff/memberID=837 Utah State University: Dr Tainter's homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409062830/http://www.cnr.usu.edu/htm/facstaff/memberID%3D837 |date=2010-04-09 }}: accessed 30 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012}} he holds a professorship in the Department of Environment and Society at [[Utah State University]]. His previous positions include Project Leader of Cultural Heritage Research, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station, Albuquerque, New Mexico and Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of New Mexico]].

Tainter has written and edited many articles and monographs. His arguably best-known work, ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' (1988), examines the collapse of [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Chacoan]] civilizations,&lt;ref&gt;He brought together a multidisciplinary group to examine the Chaco culture in [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3631693 ''Evolving Complexity and Environmental Risk in the Prehistoric Southwest''] (Santa Fe Institute Proceedings '''24'''), edited with Bonnie Bagley Tainter, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
and of the [[Western Roman Empire]], in terms of [[network theory]], [[energy economics]] and [[Complex systems|complexity theory]].  Tainter argues that sustainability or collapse of societies follow from the success or failure of problem-solving institutions&lt;ref name=Tainter200&gt;{{citation |date=September 2000 |author=Tainter, Joseph A |title=Problem Solving: Complexity, History, Sustainability |journal=[[Population &amp; Environment]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=3–41 |url=http://www.fraw.org.uk/files/economics/tainter_2000.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215143142/http://www.fraw.org.uk/files/economics/tainter_2000.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that societies collapse when their investments in social complexity and their "energy subsidies" reach a point of [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]]. He recognizes collapse when a society involuntarily sheds a significant portion of its complexity.

With Tadeusz Patzek, he is author of "Drilling Down: The Gulf Oil Debacle and Our Energy Dilemma", published in 2011.

Joseph Tainter is married to Bonnie Bagley and they have one child, Emmet Bagley Tainter.

== Social complexity ==
According to Tainter's ''Collapse of Complex Societies'', societies become more complex as they try to solve problems.  Social complexity can be recognized by numerous differentiated and specialised social and economic roles and many mechanisms through which they are coordinated, and by reliance on symbolic and abstract communication, and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production.  Such complexity requires a substantial "energy" subsidy (meaning the consumption of resources, or other forms of wealth).

When a society confronts a "problem," such as a shortage of energy, or difficulty in gaining access to it, it tends to create new layers of [[bureaucracy]], [[infrastructure]], or social class to address the challenge. Tainter, who first (ch. 1) identifies seventeen examples of rapid collapse of societies, applies his model to three case studies: The [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Maya civilization]], and the [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco culture]].

For example, as Roman agricultural output slowly declined and population increased, per-capita energy availability dropped.  The Romans "solved" this problem by conquering their neighbours to appropriate their energy surpluses (in concrete forms, as metals, grain, slaves, etc.).  However, as the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] grew, the cost of maintaining communications, garrisons, civil government, etc. grew with it.  Eventually, this cost grew so great that any new challenges such as invasions and crop failures could not be solved by the acquisition of more territory.

Intense, authoritarian efforts to maintain cohesion by [[Domitian]] and [[Constantine the Great]] only led to an ever greater strain on the population. The empire was split into two halves, of which the western soon fragmented into smaller units. The eastern half, being wealthier, was able to survive longer, and did not collapse but instead succumbed slowly and piecemeal, because unlike the western empire it had powerful neighbors able to take advantage of its weakness.

It is often assumed that the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the western Roman Empire]] was a catastrophe for everyone involved.  Tainter points out that it can be seen as a very rational preference of individuals at the time, many of whom were actually better off. Tainter notes that in the west, local populations in many cases greeted the barbarians as liberators.

==Diminishing returns==
Tainter begins by categorizing and examining the often inconsistent explanations that have been offered for collapse in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;"In the collapse of states Tainter has found a big gap in the literature," observed E. L. Jones, reviewing ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' in ''The Economic History Review'' n.s. '''42'''.4 (November 1989:634)&lt;/ref&gt; In Tainter's view, while invasions, crop failures, disease or [[environmental degradation]] may be the ''apparent'' causes of societal collapse, the ultimate cause is an economic one, inherent in the structure of society rather than in external shocks which may batter them:  ''diminishing returns on investments in [[social complexity]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;This aspect was criticized as "unconvincingly dire glosses on production costs in the world today" (E. L. Jones in ''The Economic History Review'', New Series, '''42'''.4 (November 1989:634).&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Tainter musters modern statistics to show that marginal returns on investments in energy ([[Energy returned on energy invested|EROEI]]), education and technological innovation are diminishing today.  The globalised modern world is subject to many of the same stresses that brought older societies to ruin.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, Tainter is not entirely apocalyptic:  "When some new input to an economic system is brought on line, whether a technical innovation or an energy subsidy, it will often have the potential at least temporarily to raise marginal productivity" (p.&amp;nbsp;124).  Thus, barring continual conquest of your neighbors (which is always subject to diminishing returns), innovation that increases productivity is – in the long run – the only way out of the dilemma of declining marginal returns on added investments in complexity.

And, in his final chapters, Tainter discusses why modern societies may not be able to choose to collapse: because surrounding them are other complex societies which will in some way absorb a collapsed region or prevent a general collapse; the Mayan and Chaocan regions had no powerful complex neighbors and so could collapse for centuries or millennia, as could the Western Roman Empire - but the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], bordered as it was by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]/[[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] Empire, did not have the option of devolving into simpler smaller entities.

His paper ''[[Complexity, Problem Solving, and Sustainable Societies]]'' (1996) focuses on the energy cost of problem solving, and the energy-complexity relation in manmade systems.

[[File:Lasertechnik06.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|A laser beam used for [[laser welding|welding]].]]
[[File:Lasers.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Red (660 &amp; 635&amp;nbsp;nm), green (532 &amp; 520&amp;nbsp;nm) and blue-violet (445 &amp; 405&amp;nbsp;nm) lasers]]

A '''laser''' is a device that emits [[light]] through a process of [[optical amplification]] based on the [[stimulated emission]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. The term "laser" originated as an [[acronym]] for "'''light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation'''".&lt;ref name="Gould1959"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 15, 2008|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/laser|title=laser |publisher=[[Reference.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first laser was built in 1960 by [[Theodore H. Maiman]] at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]], based on theoretical work by [[Charles Hard Townes]] and [[Arthur Leonard Schawlow]].

A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light [[coherence (physics)|''coherently'']]. [[Spatial coherence]] allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as [[laser cutting]] and [[Photolithography#Light sources|lithography]]. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances ([[collimated light|collimation]]), enabling applications such as [[laser pointer]]s and [[lidar]]. Lasers can also have high [[temporal coherence]], which allows them to emit light with a very narrow [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]], i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Alternatively, temporal  coherence can be used to produce pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a [[femtosecond]] ("[[ultrashort pulse]]s").

Lasers are used in [[optical disk drive]]s, [[laser printer]]s, [[barcode scanner]]s, [[DNA sequencer|DNA sequencing instruments]], [[fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic]] and [[free-space optical communication]], [[laser surgery]] and skin treatments, cutting and [[laser welding|welding]] materials, military and [[law enforcement]] devices for marking targets and [[Laser rangefinder#Military|measuring range]] and speed, and in [[laser lighting display]]s for entertainment.

== Fundamentals ==
[[File:Four Lasers Over Paranal.jpg|thumb|Modern telescopes use laser technologies to compensate for the blurring effect of the [[Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Lasers Over Paranal|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1618a/|website=www.eso.org|publisher=European Southern Observatory|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Lasers are distinguished from other light sources by their [[coherence (physics)|coherence]]. Spatial coherence is typically expressed through the output being a narrow beam, which is [[Gaussian beam|diffraction-limited]]. Laser beams can be focused to very tiny spots, achieving a very high [[irradiance]], or they can have very low divergence in order to concentrate their power at a great distance. Temporal (or longitudinal) coherence implies a [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] wave at a single frequency, whose phase is correlated over a relatively great distance (the [[coherence length]]) along the beam.&lt;ref&gt;''Conceptual physics'', Paul Hewitt, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A beam produced by a thermal or other incoherent light source has an instantaneous amplitude and [[phase (waves)|phase]] that vary randomly with respect to time and position, thus having a short coherence length.

Lasers are characterized according to their [[wavelength]] in a vacuum. Most "single wavelength" lasers actually produce radiation in several ''modes'' with slightly different wavelengths. Although temporal coherence implies monochromaticity, there are lasers that emit a broad spectrum of light or emit different wavelengths of light simultaneously. Some lasers are not single spatial mode and have light beams that [[Beam divergence|diverge]] more than is required by the [[diffraction limit]]. All such devices are classified as "lasers" based on their method of producing light, i.e., stimulated emission. Lasers are employed where light of the required spatial or temporal coherence can not be produced using simpler technologies.

=== Terminology ===
[[File:Laser play.jpg|thumb|Laser beams in fog, reflected on a car windshield]]
The word ''laser'' started as an [[acronym]] for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation". In this usage, the term "light" includes electromagnetic radiation of any frequency, not only [[visible light]], hence the terms ''infrared laser'', ''ultraviolet laser'', ''[[X-ray laser]]'' and ''[[gamma-ray laser]]''. Because the microwave predecessor of the laser, the [[maser]], was developed first, devices of this sort operating at microwave and [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]] are referred to as "masers" rather than "microwave lasers" or "radio lasers". In the early technical literature, especially at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]], the laser was called an '''optical maser'''; this term is now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A laser that produces light by itself is technically an optical oscillator rather than an [[optical amplifier]] as suggested by the acronym. It has been humorously noted that the acronym LOSER, for "light oscillation by stimulated emission of radiation", would have been more correct.&lt;ref name="Biographical Memoirs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chu |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Chu |author2=Townes, Charles |authorlink2=Charles Hard Townes  |editor=Edward P.

The [[back-formation|back-formed]] verb ''to lase'' is frequently used in the field, meaning "to produce laser light,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lase |title=lase |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in reference to the gain medium of a laser; when a laser is operating it is said to be "lasing." Further use of the words ''laser'' and ''maser'' in an extended sense, not referring to laser technology or devices, can be seen in usages such as ''[[astrophysical maser]]'' and ''[[atom laser]]''.

{{Main|Laser construction}}
A laser consists of a [[Active laser medium|gain medium]], a mechanism to energize it, and something to provide optical [[feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Anthony E. |last=Siegman |year=1986 |title=Lasers |publisher=University Science Books |isbn= 978-0935702118 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gain medium is a material with properties that allow it to [[optical amplifier|amplify]] light by way of stimulated emission. Light of a specific wavelength that passes through the gain medium is amplified (increases in power).

For the gain medium to amplify light, it needs to be supplied with energy in a process called [[laser pumping|pumping]]. The energy is typically supplied as an electric current or as light at a different wavelength. Pump light may be provided by a [[Xenon flash lamp|flash lamp]] or by another laser.

The most common type of laser uses feedback from an [[optical cavity]]—a pair of mirrors on either end of the gain medium. Light bounces back and forth between the mirrors, passing through the gain medium and being amplified each time. Typically one of the two mirrors, the [[output coupler]], is partially transparent. Some of the light escapes through this mirror. Depending on the design of the cavity (whether the mirrors are flat or [[curved mirror|curved]]), the light coming out of the laser may spread out or form a narrow [[light beam|beam]]. In analogy to [[electronic oscillator]]s, this device is sometimes called a ''laser oscillator''.

Most practical lasers contain additional elements that affect properties of the emitted light, such as the polarization,  wavelength, and shape of the beam.

[[Electron]]s and how they interact with [[electromagnetic field]]s are important in our understanding of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].

=== Stimulated emission ===
{{Main|Stimulated emission}}
In the [[Classical electromagnetism|classical view]], the energy of an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus is larger for orbits further from the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an [[atom]]. However, quantum mechanical effects force electrons to take on discrete positions in [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]]. Thus, electrons are found in specific energy levels of an atom, two of which are shown below:

[[File:Stimulated Emission.svg|frameless|center|upright=2.5]]

When an electron absorbs energy either from light ([[photon]]s) or heat ([[phonon]]s), it receives that incident quantum of energy. But transitions are only allowed in between discrete energy levels such as the two shown above.
This leads to [[emission line]]s and [[Spectral line|absorption lines]].

When an electron is [[Excited state|excited]] from a lower to a higher energy level, it will not stay that way forever.
An electron in an excited state may decay to a lower energy state which is not occupied, according to a particular time constant characterizing that transition. When such an electron decays without external influence, emitting a photon, that is called "[[spontaneous emission]]". The phase associated with the photon that is emitted is random. A material with many atoms in such an excited state may thus result in [[radiation]] which is very spectrally limited (centered around one [[wavelength]] of light), but the individual photons would have no common phase relationship and would emanate in random directions. This is the mechanism of [[fluorescence]] and [[thermal emission]].

An external electromagnetic field at a frequency associated with a transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts like a small electric [[dipole]], and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the atom entering this transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is enhanced beyond that due to spontaneous emission. Such a transition to the higher state is called [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], and it destroys an incident photon (the photon's energy goes into powering the increased energy of the higher state). A transition from the higher to a lower energy state, however, produces an additional photon; this is the process of '''stimulated emission'''.

=== Gain medium and cavity ===
[[File:Laser DSC09088.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|A [[helium–neon laser]] demonstration at the [[Kastler-Brossel Laboratory]] at [[Paris VI|Univ. Paris 6]]. The pink-orange glow running through the center of the tube is from the electric discharge which produces incoherent light, just as in a neon tube. This glowing plasma is excited and then acts as the [[active laser medium|gain medium]] through which the internal beam passes, as it is reflected between the two mirrors. Laser output through the front mirror can be seen to produce a tiny (about 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) intense spot on the screen, to the right. Although it is a deep and pure red color, spots of laser light are so intense that cameras are typically overexposed and distort their color.]]
[[File:Helium neon laser spectrum.svg|thumb|upright|Spectrum of a helium neon laser illustrating its very high spectral purity (limited by the measuring apparatus). The 0.002&amp;nbsp;nm bandwidth of the lasing medium is well over 10,000 times narrower than the spectral width of a light-emitting diode (whose spectrum is shown '''[[:File:Red-YellowGreen-Blue LED spectra.png|here]]''' for comparison), with the bandwidth of a single longitudinal mode being much narrower still.]]

The gain medium is put into an [[excited state]] by an external source of energy. In most lasers this medium consists of a population of atoms which have been excited into such a state by means of an outside light source, or an electrical field which supplies energy for atoms to absorb and be transformed into their excited states.

The gain medium of a laser is normally a material of controlled purity, size, concentration, and shape, which amplifies the beam by the process of stimulated emission described above. This material can be of any [[state of matter|state]]: gas, liquid, solid, or [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The gain medium absorbs pump energy, which raises some electrons into higher-energy ("[[excited state|excited]]") [[quantum state]]s. Particles can interact with light by either absorbing or emitting photons. Emission can be spontaneous or stimulated. In the latter case, the photon is emitted in the same direction as the light that is passing by. When the number of particles in one excited state exceeds the number of particles in some lower-energy state, [[population inversion]] is achieved and the amount of stimulated emission due to light that passes through is larger than the amount of absorption. Hence, the light is amplified. By itself, this makes an [[optical amplifier]]. When an optical amplifier is placed inside a resonant optical cavity, one obtains a laser oscillator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Anthony E. |last=Siegman |year=1986 |title=Lasers |publisher=University Science Books |isbn= 978-0935702118 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few situations it is possible to obtain lasing with only a single pass of EM radiation through the gain medium, and this produces a laser beam without any need for a resonant or reflective cavity (see for example [[nitrogen laser]]).&lt;ref name="Light and Its Uses, Nitrogen Laser"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, reflection in a resonant cavity is usually required for a laser, but is not absolutely necessary.

The optical [[resonator]] is sometimes referred to as an "optical cavity", but this is a misnomer: lasers use open resonators as opposed to the literal cavity that would be employed at microwave frequencies in a [[maser]].
The resonator typically consists of two mirrors between which a coherent beam of light travels in both directions, reflecting back on itself so that an average photon will pass through the gain medium repeatedly before it is emitted from the output aperture or lost to diffraction or absorption.
If the gain (amplification) in the medium is larger than the resonator losses, then the power of the recirculating light can rise [[exponential growth|exponentially]]. But each stimulated emission event returns an atom from its excited state to the ground state, reducing the gain of the medium. With increasing beam power the net gain (gain minus loss) reduces to unity and the gain medium is said to be saturated. In a continuous wave (CW) laser, the balance of pump power against gain saturation and cavity losses produces an equilibrium value of the laser power inside the cavity; this equilibrium determines the operating point of the laser. If the applied pump power is too small, the gain will never be sufficient to overcome the cavity losses, and laser light will not be produced. The minimum pump power needed to begin laser action is called the ''[[lasing threshold]]''. The gain medium will amplify any photons passing through it, regardless of direction; but only the photons in a [[spatial mode]] supported by the resonator will pass more than once through the medium and receive substantial amplification.

=== The light emitted ===
In most lasers, lasing begins with stimulated emission amplifying random spontaneously emitted photons present in the gain medium. Stimulated emission produces light that matches the input signal in wavelength, [[phase (waves)|phase]], and polarization. This, combined with the filtering effect of the optical resonator gives laser light its characteristic coherence, and may give it uniform polarization and monochromaticity, depending on the resonator's design.  Some lasers use a separate [[injection seeder]] to start the process off with a beam that is already highly coherent. This can produce beams with a narrower spectrum than would otherwise be possible.

Many lasers produce a beam that can be approximated as a [[Gaussian beam]]; such beams have the minimum divergence possible for a given beam diameter. Some lasers, particularly high-power ones, produce multimode beams, with the [[transverse mode]]s often approximated using [[Hermite polynomials|Hermite]]–[[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] or [[Laguerre polynomials|Laguerre]]-Gaussian functions. Some high power lasers use a flat-topped profile known as a "[[tophat beam]]". Unstable laser resonators (not used in most lasers) produce fractal-shaped beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karman | first1 = G.P. | last2 = McDonald | first2 = G.S. | last3 = New | first3 = G.H.C. | last4 = Woerdman | first4 = J.P. | title = Laser Optics: Fractal modes in unstable resonators | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6758/abs/402138a0.html| journal = Nature | volume = 402 | issue = 6758| page = 138 | doi=10.1038/45960| bibcode = 1999Natur.402..138K | date = November 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized optical systems can produce more complex beam geometries, such as [[Bessel beam]]s and [[optical vortex]]es.

Near the "waist" (or [[focus (optics)|focal region]]) of a laser beam, it is highly ''[[collimated light|collimated]]'': the wavefronts are planar, normal to the direction of propagation, with no [[beam divergence]] at that point. However, due to [[diffraction]], that can only remain true well within the [[Rayleigh range]]. The beam of a single transverse mode (gaussian beam) laser eventually diverges at an angle which varies inversely with the beam diameter, as required by [[diffraction]] theory. Thus, the "pencil beam" directly generated by a common [[helium–neon laser]] would spread out to a size of perhaps 500 kilometers when shone on the Moon (from the distance of the earth). On the other hand, the light from a [[semiconductor laser]] typically exits the tiny crystal with a large divergence: up to 50°. However even such a divergent beam can be transformed into a similarly collimated beam by means of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] system, as is always included, for instance, in a [[laser pointer]] whose light originates from a [[laser diode]]. That is possible due to the light being of a single spatial mode. This unique property of laser light, [[spatial coherence]], cannot be replicated using standard light sources (except by discarding most of the light) as can be appreciated by comparing the beam from a flashlight (torch) or spotlight to that of almost any laser.

A [[laser beam profiler]] is used to measure the intensity profile, width, and divergence of laser beams.

[[Diffuse reflection]] of a laser beam from a matte surface produces a [[speckle pattern]] with interesting properties.

=== Quantum vs. classical emission processes ===
The mechanism of producing radiation in a laser relies on [[stimulated emission]], where energy is extracted from a transition in an atom or molecule. This is a quantum phenomenon discovered by [[Einstein]] who derived the relationship between the [[Spontaneous emission#Rate of spontaneous emission|A coefficient]] describing spontaneous emission and the [[Stimulated emission#Mathematical model|B coefficient]] which applies to absorption and stimulated emission. However, in the case of the [[free electron laser]], atomic energy levels are not involved; it appears that the operation of this rather exotic device can be explained without reference to [[quantum mechanics]].

== Continuous and pulsed modes of operation ==
[[File:Moon clementine lidar.jpg|thumb|[[Lidar]] measurements of lunar topography made by [[Clementine (spacecraft)|Clementine]] mission.]]
[[File:Laserlink hss46.jpg|thumb|Laserlink [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point to point]] optical wireless network]]
[[File:MESSENGER - MLA.jpg|thumb|upright|Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) of the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft]]
A laser can be classified as operating in either continuous or pulsed mode, depending on whether the power output is essentially continuous over time or whether its output takes the form of pulses of light on one or another time scale. Of course even a laser whose output is normally continuous can be intentionally turned on and off at some rate in order to create pulses of light. When the modulation rate is on time scales much slower than the [[Q factor#Optical systems|cavity lifetime]] and the time period over which energy can be stored in the lasing medium or pumping mechanism, then it is still classified as a "modulated" or "pulsed" continuous wave laser. Most laser diodes used in communication systems fall in that category.

=== Continuous wave operation ===
Some applications of lasers depend on a beam whose output power is constant over time. Such a laser is known as ''[[continuous wave]]'' (''CW''). Many types of lasers can be made to operate in continuous wave mode to satisfy such an application. Many of these lasers actually lase in several longitudinal modes at the same time, and beats between the slightly different optical frequencies of those oscillations will, in fact, produce amplitude variations on time scales shorter than the round-trip time (the reciprocal of the [[Free spectral range#Fabry–Pérot interferometer|frequency spacing]] between modes), typically a few nanoseconds or less. In most cases, these lasers are still termed "continuous wave" as their output power is steady when averaged over any longer time periods, with the very high-frequency power variations having little or no impact in the intended application. (However, the term is not applied to [[Mode-locking|mode-locked]] lasers, where the ''intention'' is to create very short pulses at the rate of the round-trip time.)

For continuous wave operation, it is required for the population inversion of the gain medium to be continually replenished by a steady pump source. In some lasing media, this is impossible. In some other lasers, it would require pumping the laser at a very high continuous power level which would be impractical or destroy the laser by producing excessive heat. Such lasers cannot be run in CW mode.

=== Pulsed operation ===
Pulsed operation of lasers refers to any laser not classified as continuous wave, so that the optical power appears in pulses of some duration at some repetition rate. This encompasses a wide range of technologies addressing a number of different motivations. Some lasers are pulsed simply because they cannot be run in [[#Continuous wave operation|continuous]] mode.

In other cases, the application requires the production of pulses having as large an energy as possible. Since the pulse energy is equal to the average power divided by the repetition rate, this goal can sometimes be satisfied by lowering the rate of pulses so that more energy can be built up in between pulses. In [[laser ablation]], for example, a small volume of material at the surface of a work piece can be evaporated if it is heated in a very short time, while supplying the energy gradually would allow for the heat to be absorbed into the bulk of the piece, never attaining a sufficiently high temperature at a particular point.

Other applications rely on the peak pulse power (rather than the energy in the pulse), especially in order to obtain [[nonlinear optical]] effects. For a given pulse energy, this requires creating pulses of the shortest possible duration utilizing techniques such as [[Q-switching]].

The optical bandwidth of a pulse cannot be narrower than the reciprocal of the pulse width. In the case of extremely short pulses, that implies lasing over a considerable bandwidth, quite contrary to the very narrow bandwidths typical of CW lasers. The lasing medium in some ''dye lasers'' and ''vibronic solid-state lasers'' produces optical gain over a wide bandwidth, making a laser possible which can thus generate pulses of light as short as a few [[femtoseconds]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; s).

==== Q-switching ====
{{Main|Q-switching}}

In a Q-switched laser, the population inversion is allowed to build up by introducing loss inside the resonator which exceeds the gain of the medium; this can also be described as a reduction of the quality factor or 'Q' of the cavity. Then, after the pump energy stored in the laser medium has approached the maximum possible level, the introduced loss mechanism (often an electro- or acousto-optical element) is rapidly removed (or that occurs by itself in a passive device), allowing lasing to begin which rapidly obtains the stored energy in the gain medium. This results in a short pulse incorporating that energy, and thus a high peak power.

==== Mode-locking ====
{{Main|Mode-locking}}
A mode-locked laser is capable of emitting extremely short pulses on the order of tens of [[picosecond]]s down to less than 10 [[femtoseconds]]. These pulses will repeat at the round trip time, that is, the time that it takes light to complete one round trip between the mirrors comprising the resonator. Due to the [[Fourier uncertainty principle|Fourier limit]] (also known as energy-time [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty]]), a pulse of such short temporal length has a spectrum spread over a considerable bandwidth. Thus such a gain medium must have a gain bandwidth sufficiently broad to amplify those frequencies. An example of a suitable material is [[titanium]]-doped, artificially grown [[sapphire]] ([[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]]) which has a very wide gain bandwidth and can thus produce pulses of only a few femtoseconds duration.

Such mode-locked lasers are a most versatile tool for researching processes occurring on extremely short time scales (known as femtosecond physics, [[femtosecond chemistry]] and [[ultrafast science]]), for maximizing the effect of [[nonlinear optics|nonlinearity]] in optical materials (e.g. in [[second-harmonic generation]], [[parametric down-conversion]], [[optical parametric oscillator]]s and the like). Due to the large peak power and the ability to generate phase-stabilized trains of ultrafast laser pulses, mode-locking ultrafast lasers underpin precision metrology and spectroscopy applications.&lt;ref name="nwpl"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15521|title=Long-term mutual phase locking of picosecond pulse pairs generated by a semiconductor nanowire laser|first1=B.|last1=Mayer|first2=A.|last2=Regler|first3=S.|last3=Sterzl|first4=T.|last4=Stettner|first5=G.|last5=Koblmüller|first6=M.|last6=Kaniber|first7=B.|last7=Lingnau|first8=K.|last8=Lüdge|first9=J.J.|last9=Finley|date=May 23, 2017|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15521|doi=10.1038/ncomms15521|pmid=28534489|pmc=5457509|arxiv=1603.02169|bibcode=2017NatCo...815521M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pulsed pumping ====
Another method of achieving pulsed laser operation is to pump the laser material with a source that is itself pulsed, either through electronic charging in the case of flash lamps, or another laser which is already pulsed. Pulsed pumping was historically used with dye lasers where the inverted population lifetime of a dye molecule was so short that a high energy, fast pump was needed. The way to overcome this problem was to charge up large [[capacitors]] which are then switched to discharge through flashlamps, producing an intense flash. Pulsed pumping is also required for three-level lasers in which the lower energy level rapidly becomes highly populated preventing further lasing until those atoms relax to the ground state. These lasers, such as the excimer laser and the copper vapor laser, can never be operated in CW mode.

=== Foundations ===
In 1917, [[Albert Einstein]] established the theoretical foundations for the laser and the [[maser]] in the paper ''Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung'' (On the Quantum Theory of Radiation) via a re-derivation of [[Max Planck]]'s law of radiation, conceptually based upon probability coefficients ([[Einstein coefficients]]) for the absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref name=Einstein1917&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A|title=Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|year=1917|volume=18|pages=121–128|bibcode = 1917PhyZ...18..121E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, [[Rudolf W. Ladenburg]] confirmed the existence of the phenomena of stimulated emission and negative absorption.&lt;ref name="Steen, W. M 1998"&gt;Steen, W.M. "Laser Materials Processing", 2nd Ed. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Valentin A. Fabrikant predicted the use of stimulated emission to amplify "short" waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwold.unimib.it/ateneo/presentazione/direzione_ammva/prevenzione_protezione/Semin_sicur_laser.ppt |title=Il rischio da laser: cosa è e come affrontarlo; analisi di un problema non così lontano da noi |trans-title=The risk from laser: what it is and what it is like facing it; analysis of a problem which is thus not far away from us |series=Programma Corso di Formazione Obbligatorio |year=2004 |first=Dimitri |last=Batani |format=Powerpoint presentation |accessdate=January 1, 2007 |website=wwwold.unimib.it |publisher=University of Milano-Bicocca |language=it |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614115935/http://wwwold.unimib.it/ateneo/presentazione/direzione_ammva/prevenzione_protezione/Semin_sicur_laser.ppt |archivedate=June 14, 2007 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, [[Willis E.

=== Maser ===
{{Main|Maser}}
[[File:Aleksandr Prokhorov.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov|Aleksandr Prokhorov]]]]
In 1951, [[Joseph Weber]] submitted a paper on using stimulated emissions to make a microwave amplifier to the June 1952 Institute of Radio Engineers Vacuum Tube Research Conference at [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4941 | title=American Institute of Physics Oral History Interview with Joseph Weber| date=2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this presentation, [[RCA]] asked Weber to give a seminar on this idea, and [[Charles Hard Townes]] asked him for a copy of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bertolotti | first = Mario | year = 2015 | title      = Masers and Lasers, Second Edition: An Historical Approach | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 89–91 | isbn =  978-1482217803 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4i_OBgAAQBAJ | accessdate = March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Charles Hard Townes and graduate students James P. Gordon and Herbert J. Zeiger produced the first microwave amplifier, a device operating on similar principles to the laser, but amplifying [[microwave]] radiation rather than infrared or visible radiation. Townes's maser was incapable of continuous output.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, [[Nikolay Basov]] and [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov|Aleksandr Prokhorov]] were independently working on the [[Quantum harmonic oscillator|quantum oscillator]] and solved the problem of continuous-output systems by using more than two energy levels. These gain media could release [[stimulated emission]]s between an excited state and a lower excited state, not the ground state, facilitating the maintenance of a [[population inversion]]. In 1955, Prokhorov and Basov suggested optical pumping of a multi-level system as a method for obtaining the population inversion, later a main method of laser pumping.

Townes reports that several eminent physicists—among them [[Niels Bohr]], [[John von Neumann]], and [[Llewellyn Thomas]]—argued the maser violated Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] and hence could not work. Others such as [[Isidor Rabi]] and [[Polykarp Kusch]] expected that it would be impractical and not worth the effort.&lt;ref&gt;Townes, Charles H. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrbD41GGeJYC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=%22niels+bohr%22+rabi+kusch+von+neumann+laser&amp;source=web&amp;ots=0_A7OuramT&amp;sig=4R4yTmk6SmJTN8mZaiOMzgg-LO4 ''How the Laser Happened: Adventures of a Scientist''], [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|978–0195122688}}, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 Charles H. Townes, Nikolay Basov, and Aleksandr Prokhorov shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], "for fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics, which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser–laser principle".

In 1957, [[Charles Hard Townes]] and [[Arthur Leonard Schawlow]], then at [[Bell Labs]], began a serious study of the infrared laser. As ideas developed, they abandoned [[infrared]] radiation to instead concentrate upon [[visible light]]. The concept originally was called an "optical maser". In 1958, Bell Labs filed a patent application for their proposed optical maser; and Schawlow and Townes submitted a manuscript of their theoretical calculations to the ''[[Physical Review]]'', published that year in Volume 112, Issue No. 6.

[[File:Gould notebook 001.jpg|thumb|right|'''LASER notebook:''' First page of the notebook wherein [[Gordon Gould]] coined the LASER acronym, and described the elements for constructing the device.]]&lt;!--FAIR USE of Gould notebook 001.jpg: see image description page at File:Gould notebook 001.jpg for rationale --&gt;

Simultaneously, at [[Columbia University]], graduate student [[Gordon Gould]] was working on a [[doctoral thesis]] about the energy levels of excited [[thallium]]. When Gould and Townes met, they spoke of radiation [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]], as a general subject; afterwards, in November 1957, Gould noted his ideas for a "laser", including using an open [[resonator]] (later an essential laser-device component). Moreover, in 1958, Prokhorov independently proposed using an open resonator, the first published appearance (in the USSR) of this idea. Elsewhere, in the U.S., Schawlow and Townes had agreed to an open-resonator laser design – apparently unaware of Prokhorov's publications and Gould's unpublished laser work.

At a conference in 1959, Gordon Gould published the term LASER in the paper ''The LASER, Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation''.&lt;ref name="Gould1959"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first= R. Gordon |authorlink=Gordon Gould |year=1959 |chapter=The LASER, Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation |editor= Franken, P.A. |editor2=Sands R.H.

Gould's notes included possible applications for a laser, such as [[Spectroscopy|spectrometry]], [[interferometry]], [[radar]], and [[nuclear fusion]]. He continued developing the idea, and filed a [[patent application]] in April 1959. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] denied his application, and awarded a patent to [[Bell Labs]], in 1960. That provoked a twenty-eight-year [[lawsuit]], featuring scientific prestige and money as the stakes. Gould won his first minor patent in 1977, yet it was not until 1987 that he won the first significant patent lawsuit victory, when a Federal judge ordered the U.S. Patent Office to issue patents to Gould for the optically pumped and the [[gas discharge]] laser devices. The question of just how to assign credit for inventing the laser remains unresolved by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Lisa Bromberg, ''The Laser in America, 1950–1970'' (1991), pp. 74–77 [http://www.aip.org/history/exhibits/laser/sections/whoinvented.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 1960, [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H. Maiman]] operated the first functioning laser &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maiman |first=T.

Townes|Townes]], at [[Columbia University]], [[Arthur L. Schawlow|Arthur Schawlow]], at [[Bell Labs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hecht |first=Jeff |year=2005 |title=Beam: The Race to Make the Laser |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195142105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gould, at the TRG (Technical Research Group) company. Maiman's functional laser used a solid-state [[flashlamp]]-pumped synthetic [[ruby]] [[crystal]] to produce red laser light, at 694 nanometers wavelength; however, the device only was capable of pulsed operation, because of its three-level pumping design scheme. Later that year, the [[Iran]]ian physicist [[Ali Javan]], and [[William R. Bennett, Jr.|William R. Bennett]], and [[Donald R. Herriott|Donald Herriott]], constructed the first [[gas laser]], using [[helium]] and [[neon]] that was capable of continuous operation in the infrared (U.S. Patent 3,149,290); later, Javan received the [[Albert Einstein Award]] in 1993. Basov and Javan proposed the semiconductor [[laser diode]] concept. In 1962, [[Robert N. Hall]] demonstrated the first ''laser diode'' device, which was made of [[gallium arsenide]] and emitted in the near-[[infrared]] band of the spectrum at 850&amp;nbsp;nm. Later that year, [[Nick Holonyak]], Jr. demonstrated the first semiconductor laser with a visible emission. This first semiconductor laser could only be used in pulsed-beam operation, and when cooled to [[liquid nitrogen]] temperatures (77&amp;nbsp;K). In 1970, [[Zhores Ivanovich Alferov|Zhores Alferov]], in the USSR, and Izuo Hayashi and Morton Panish of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] also independently developed room-temperature, continual-operation diode lasers, using the [[heterojunction]] structure.

=== Recent innovations ===

[[File:History of laser intensity.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Graph showing the history of maximum laser pulse intensity throughout the past 40 years.]]

Since the early period of laser history, laser research has produced a variety of improved and specialized laser types, optimized for different performance goals, including:
* new wavelength bands
* maximum average output power
* maximum peak pulse [[energy]]
* maximum peak pulse [[power (physics)|power]]
* minimum output pulse duration
* minimum linewidth
* maximum power efficiency
* minimum cost
and this research continues to this day.

In 2017, researchers at [[Delft University of Technology|TU Delft]] demonstrated an [[Josephson effect#The AC Josephson effect|AC Josephson junction]] microwave laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Researchers demonstrate new type of laser |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-03-laser.html |website=Phys.org |accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the laser operates in the superconducting regime, it is more stable than other semiconductor-based lasers.

=== Gas lasers ===
{{Main|Gas laser}}
Following the invention of the HeNe gas laser, many other gas discharges have been found to amplify light coherently.
Gas lasers using many different gases have been built and used for many purposes. The [[helium–neon laser]] (HeNe) is able to operate at a number of different wavelengths, however the vast majority are engineered to lase at 633&amp;nbsp;nm; these relatively low cost but highly coherent lasers are extremely common in optical research and educational laboratories. Commercial [[Carbon dioxide laser|carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) lasers]] can emit many hundreds of watts in a single spatial mode which can be concentrated into a tiny spot. This emission is in the thermal infrared at 10.6&amp;nbsp;µm; such lasers are regularly used in industry for cutting and welding. The efficiency of a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser is unusually high: over 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phy.davidson.edu/stuhome/jimn/co2/pages/CO2Main.htm|last=Nolen|first=Jim|title=The Carbon Dioxide Laser|publisher=Davidson Physics|accessdate=17 August 2014|author2=Derek Verno }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ion laser|Argon-ion]] lasers can operate at a number of lasing transitions between 351 and 528.7&amp;nbsp;nm. Depending on the optical design one or more of these transitions can be lasing simultaneously; the most commonly used lines are 458&amp;nbsp;nm, 488&amp;nbsp;nm and 514.5&amp;nbsp;nm. A nitrogen [[TEA laser|transverse electrical discharge in gas at atmospheric pressure]] (TEA) laser is an inexpensive gas laser, often home-built by hobbyists, which produces rather incoherent UV light at 337.1&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Chemical lasers ====
[[Chemical laser]]s are powered by a chemical reaction permitting a large amount of energy to be released quickly. Such very high power lasers are especially of interest to the military, however continuous wave chemical lasers at very high power levels, fed by streams of gasses, have been developed and have some industrial applications. As examples, in the [[hydrogen fluoride laser]] (2700–2900&amp;nbsp;nm) and the [[deuterium fluoride laser]] (3800&amp;nbsp;nm) the reaction is the combination of hydrogen or deuterium gas with combustion products of [[ethylene]] in [[nitrogen trifluoride]].

==== Excimer lasers ====
[[Excimer laser]]s are a special sort of gas laser powered by an electric discharge in which the lasing medium is an [[excimer]], or more precisely an [[exciplex]] in existing designs. These are molecules which can only exist with one atom in an [[excited state|excited electronic state]]. Once the molecule transfers its excitation energy to a photon,  its atoms are no longer bound to each other and the molecule disintegrates. This drastically reduces the population of the lower energy state thus greatly facilitating a population inversion. Excimers currently used are all [[:Category:Noble gas compounds|noble gas compounds]]; noble gasses are chemically inert and can only form compounds while in an excited state. Excimer lasers typically operate at [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths with major applications including semiconductor [[photolithography]] and [[LASIK]] eye surgery. Commonly used excimer molecules include ArF (emission at 193&amp;nbsp;nm), KrCl (222&amp;nbsp;nm), KrF (248&amp;nbsp;nm), XeCl (308&amp;nbsp;nm), and XeF (351&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first=D. | last=Schuocker | year=1998
 | title=Handbook of the Eurolaser Academy
 | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-0412819100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The molecular [[fluorine]] laser,  emitting at 157&amp;nbsp;nm in the vacuum ultraviolet is sometimes referred to as an excimer laser, however this appears to be a misnomer inasmuch as F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a stable compound.

=== Solid-state lasers ===
[[File:Starfield Optical Range - sodium laser.jpg|thumb|A 50 W [[Frequency addition source of optical radiation|FASOR]], based on a Nd:YAG laser, used at the [[Starfire Optical Range]].]]
[[Solid-state laser]]s use a crystalline or glass rod which is "doped" with ions that provide the required energy states. For example, the first working laser was a [[ruby laser]], made from [[ruby]] ([[chromium]]-doped [[corundum]]). The [[population inversion]] is actually maintained in the dopant. These materials are pumped optically using a shorter wavelength than the lasing wavelength, often from a flashtube or from another laser. The usage of the term "solid-state" in laser physics is narrower than in typical use. Semiconductor lasers (laser diodes) are typically ''not'' referred to as solid-state lasers.

[[Neodymium]] is a common dopant in various solid-state laser crystals, including [[yttrium orthovanadate]] ([[Neodymium-doped yttrium orthovanadate|Nd:YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[yttrium lithium fluoride]] ([[Nd:YLF]]) and [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] ([[Nd:YAG]]). All these lasers can produce high powers in the [[infrared]] spectrum at 1064&amp;nbsp;nm. They are used for cutting, welding and marking of metals and other materials, and also in [[spectroscopy]] and for pumping [[dye laser]]s. These lasers are also commonly [[Second-harmonic generation|frequency doubled]], [[Third harmonic generation|tripled]] or quadrupled to produce 532&amp;nbsp;nm (green, visible), 355&amp;nbsp;nm and 266&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Ultraviolet|UV]]) beams, respectively. Frequency-doubled [[diode-pumped solid-state]] (DPSS) lasers are used to make bright green laser pointers.

[[Ytterbium]], [[holmium]], [[thulium]], and [[erbium]] are other common "dopants" in solid-state lasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tygEGtu1b7MC&amp;q=%C2%A0Ytterbium,+holmium,+thulium,+and+erbium+are+other+common+%22dopants%22+in+solid-state+lasers&amp;dq=%C2%A0Ytterbium,+holmium,+thulium,+and+erbium+are+other+common+%22dopants%22+in+solid-state+lasers|title=Handbook of Optics, Third Edition Volume V: Atmospheric Optics, Modulators, Fiber Optics, X-Ray and Neutron Optics|last=Bass|first=Michael|last2=DeCusatis|first2=Casimer|last3=Enoch|first3=Jay|last4=Lakshminarayanan|first4=Vasudevan|last5=Li|first5=Guifang|last6=MacDonald|first6=Carolyn|last7=Mahajan|first7=Virendra|last8=Stryland|first8=Eric Van|date=2009-11-13|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0071633147|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ytterbium is used in crystals such as Yb:YAG, Yb:KGW, Yb:KYW, Yb:SYS, Yb:BOYS, Yb:CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, typically operating around 1020–1050&amp;nbsp;nm. They are potentially very efficient and high powered due to a small quantum defect. Extremely high powers in ultrashort pulses can be achieved with Yb:YAG. [[Holmium]]-doped YAG crystals emit at 2097&amp;nbsp;nm and form an efficient laser operating at [[infrared]] wavelengths strongly absorbed by water-bearing tissues. The Ho-YAG is usually operated in a pulsed mode, and passed through optical fiber surgical devices to resurface joints, remove rot from teeth, vaporize cancers, and pulverize kidney and gall stones.

[[Titanium]]-doped [[sapphire]] ([[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]]) produces a highly [[tunable laser|tunable]] [[infrared]] laser, commonly used for [[spectroscopy]]. It is also notable for use as a mode-locked laser producing [[ultrashort pulse]]s of extremely high peak power.

Thermal limitations in solid-state lasers arise from unconverted pump power that heats the medium. This heat, when coupled with a high thermo-optic coefficient (d''n''/d''T'') can cause thermal lensing and reduce the quantum efficiency. Diode-pumped thin [[disk laser]]s overcome these issues by having a gain medium that is much thinner than the diameter of the pump beam. This allows for a more uniform temperature in the material. Thin disk lasers have been shown to produce beams of up to one kilowatt.&lt;ref&gt;C. Stewen, M. Larionov, and A. Giesen, "Yb:YAG thin disk laser with 1 kW output power", in OSA Trends in Optics and Photonics, Advanced Solid-State Lasers, H. Injeyan, U. Keller, and C. Marshall, ed. (Optical Society of America, Washington, D.C., 2000) pp. 35–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fiber lasers ===
{{Main|Fiber laser}}

Solid-state lasers or laser amplifiers where the light is guided due to the [[total internal reflection]] in a single mode [[optical fiber]] are instead called [[fiber laser]]s. Guiding of light allows extremely long gain regions providing good cooling conditions; fibers have high surface area to volume ratio which allows efficient cooling. In addition, the fiber's waveguiding properties tend to reduce thermal distortion of the beam. [[Erbium]] and [[ytterbium]] ions are common active species in such lasers.

Quite often, the fiber laser is designed as a [[double-clad fiber]]. This type of fiber consists of a fiber core, an inner cladding and an outer cladding. The index of the three concentric layers is chosen so that the fiber core acts as a single-mode fiber for the laser emission while the outer cladding acts as a highly multimode core for the pump laser. This lets the pump propagate a large amount of power into and through the active inner core region, while still having a high numerical aperture (NA) to have easy launching conditions.

Pump light can be used more efficiently by creating a [[fiber disk laser]], or a stack of such lasers.

Fiber lasers have a fundamental limit in that the intensity of the light in the fiber cannot be so high that optical nonlinearities induced by the local electric field strength can become dominant and prevent laser operation and/or lead to the material destruction of the fiber. This effect is called [[photodarkening]]. In bulk laser materials, the cooling is not so efficient, and it is difficult to separate the effects of photodarkening from the thermal effects, but the experiments in fibers show that the photodarkening can be attributed to the formation of long-living [[color center]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

=== Photonic crystal lasers ===
Photonic crystal lasers are lasers based on nano-structures that provide the mode confinement and the [[Density of states|density of optical states]] (DOS) structure required for the feedback to take place.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} They are typical micrometer-sized{{dubious|date=November 2010}} and tunable on the bands of the photonic crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ultraviolet photonic crystal laser |first=X. |last=Wu |volume=85 |issue=17 |date=October 25, 2004|journal=Applied Physics Letters |doi=10.1063/1.1808888|arxiv = physics/0406005 |bibcode = 2004ApPhL..85.3657W |page=3657 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

=== Semiconductor lasers ===
{{Main|Semiconductor lasers}}
[[File:Diode laser.jpg|thumb|A 5.6 mm 'closed can' commercial laser diode, probably from a [[CD player|CD]] or [[DVD player]]]]
Semiconductor lasers are [[diode]]s which are electrically pumped. Recombination of electrons and holes created by the applied current introduces optical gain. Reflection from the ends of the crystal form an optical resonator, although the resonator can be external to the semiconductor in some designs.

Commercial [[laser diode]]s emit at wavelengths from 375&amp;nbsp;nm to 3500&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanel-photonics.com/laser_diode_market.html |title=Laser Diode Market |publisher=Hanel Photonics |accessdate=Sep 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low to medium power laser diodes are used in [[laser pointer]]s, [[laser printer]]s and CD/DVD players. Laser diodes are also frequently used to optically [[laser pumping|pump]] other lasers with high efficiency. The highest power industrial laser diodes, with power up to 20&amp;nbsp;kW, are used in industry for cutting and welding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.industrial-lasers.com/articles/print/volume-29/issue-3/features/high-power-direct-diode-lasers-for-cutting-and-welding.html|title=High-power direct-diode lasers for cutting and welding|website=www.industrial-lasers.com|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; External-cavity semiconductor lasers have a semiconductor active medium in a larger cavity. These devices can generate high power outputs with good beam quality, wavelength-tunable narrow-[[linewidth]] radiation, or ultrashort laser pulses.

In 2012, [[Nichia]] and [[OSRAM]] developed and manufactured commercial high-power green laser diodes (515/520&amp;nbsp;nm), which compete with traditional diode-pumped solid-state lasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichia.co.jp/en/product/laser.html|title=LASER Diode|work=nichia.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osram-os.com/osram_os/en/products/product-catalog/laser-diodes/visible-laser/green-laser/index.jsp|title=Green Laser|date=August 19, 2015|work=osram-os.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers ([[VCSEL]]s) are semiconductor lasers whose emission direction is perpendicular to the surface of the wafer. VCSEL devices typically have a more circular output beam than conventional laser diodes. As of 2005, only 850&amp;nbsp;nm VCSELs are widely available, with 1300&amp;nbsp;nm VCSELs beginning to be commercialized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lfw.pennnet.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?ARTICLE_ID=243400&amp;p=12 |title=Picolight ships first 4-Gbit/s 1310-nm VCSEL transceivers |work=Laser Focus World Online |date=December 9, 2005 |accessdate=May 27, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313161940/http://lfw.pennnet.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?ARTICLE_ID=243400&amp;p=12 |archivedate=March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1550&amp;nbsp;nm devices an area of research. [[VECSEL]]s are external-cavity VCSELs. [[Quantum cascade laser]]s are semiconductor lasers that have an active transition between energy ''sub-bands'' of an electron in a structure containing several [[quantum well]]s.

The development of a [[silicon]] laser is important in the field of [[optical computing]]. Silicon is the material of choice for [[integrated circuits]], and so electronic and [[silicon photonic]] components (such as [[optical interconnect]]s) could be fabricated on the same chip. Unfortunately, silicon is a difficult lasing material to deal with, since it has certain properties which block lasing. However, recently teams have produced silicon lasers through methods such as fabricating the lasing material from silicon and other semiconductor materials, such as [[indium(III) phosphide]] or [[gallium(III) arsenide]], materials which allow coherent light to be produced from silicon. These are called [[hybrid silicon laser]]. Recent developments have also shown the use of monolithically integrated [[nanowire lasers]] directly on silicon for optical interconnects, paving the way for chip level applications.&lt;ref name="nwls"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Monolithically Integrated High-β Nanowire Lasers on Silicon|first1=B.|last1=Mayer|first2=L.|last2=Janker|first3=B.|last3=Loitsch|first4=J.|last4=Treu|first5=T.|last5=Kostenbader|first6=S.|last6=Lichtmannecker|first7=T.|last7=Reichert|first8=S.|last8=Morkötter|first9=M.|last9=Kaniber|first10=G.|last10=Abstreiter|first11=C.|last11=Gies|first12=G.|last12=Koblmüller|first13=J.J.|last13=Finley|date=January 13, 2016|journal=Nano Letters|volume=16|issue=1|pages=152–156|doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b03404|pmid = 26618638|bibcode=2016NanoL..16..152M}}&lt;/ref&gt; These heterostructure nanowire lasers capable of optical interconnects in silicon are also capable of emitting pairs of phase-locked picosecond pulses with a repetition frequency up to 200 GHz, allowing for on-chip optical signal processing.&lt;ref name="nwpl"/&gt; Another type is a [[Raman laser]], which takes advantage of [[Raman scattering]] to produce a laser from materials such as silicon.

[[Lasing without inversion|Lasing without maintaining the medium excited into a population inversion]] was demonstrated in 1992 in [[sodium]] gas and again in 1995 in [[rubidium]] gas by various international teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1464-4266/2/3/201/pdf/1464-4266_2_3_201.pdf |subscription=yes |title=Lasing without inversion |year=2000 |last1=Mompart |first1=J. |last2=Corbalán |first2=R. |journal=J.

Scully |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was accomplished by using an external maser to induce "optical transparency" in the medium by introducing and destructively interfering the ground electron transitions between two paths, so that the likelihood for the ground electrons to absorb any energy has been cancelled.

=== Dye lasers ===
[[File:Coherent 899 dye laser.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a table-top dye laser based on [[Rhodamine 6G]] ]]
[[Dye laser]]s use an organic dye as the gain medium. The wide gain spectrum of available dyes, or mixtures of dyes, allows these lasers to be highly tunable, or to produce very short-duration pulses ([[on the order of]] a few [[femtosecond]]s). Although these [[tunable laser]]s are mainly known in their liquid form, researchers have also demonstrated narrow-linewidth tunable emission in dispersive oscillator configurations incorporating solid-state dye gain media.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. J. Duarte]], [http://www.tunablelaseroptics.com/ ''Tunable Laser Optics'', 2nd Edition (CRC, New York, 2015)].&lt;/ref&gt; In their most prevalent form these [[solid state dye lasers]] use dye-doped polymers as laser media.

=== Free-electron lasers ===
[[File:FELIX.jpg|thumb|The free-electron laser ''FELIX'' at the FOM Institute for Plasma Physics Rijnhuizen, [[Nieuwegein]]]]
[[Free-electron laser]]s, or FELs, generate coherent, high power radiation that is widely tunable, currently ranging in wavelength from microwaves through [[terahertz radiation]] and infrared to the visible spectrum, to soft X-rays. They have the widest frequency range of any laser type. While FEL beams share the same optical traits as other lasers, such as coherent radiation, FEL operation is quite different. Unlike gas, liquid, or solid-state lasers, which rely on bound atomic or molecular states, FELs use a relativistic electron beam as the lasing medium, hence the term ''free-electron''.

=== Exotic media ===
The pursuit of a high-quantum-energy laser using transitions between [[Nuclear isomer|isomeric states]] of an [[atomic nucleus]] has been the subject of wide-ranging academic research since the early 1970s.  Much of this is summarized in three review articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=G.C.|last2=Solem|first2=J.C.|last3=Gol'danskii|first3=V.

[[Fiber-optic communication]] using lasers is a key technology in modern communications, allowing services such as the [[Internet]].

The first use of lasers in the daily lives of the general population was the supermarket [[barcode scanner]], introduced in 1974. The [[laserdisc]] player, introduced in 1978, was the first successful consumer product to include a laser but the compact disc player was the first laser-equipped device to become common, beginning in 1982 followed shortly by [[laser printer]]s.

===In medicine===
{{main|Laser medicine|Lasers in cancer treatment}}
Lasers have many uses in medicine, including [[laser surgery]] (particularly [[Laser eye surgery|eye surgery]]), laser healing, [[kidney stone]] treatment, [[Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy|ophthalmoscopy]], and cosmetic skin treatments such as [[acne]] treatment, [[cellulite]] and [[striae]] reduction, and [[Laser hair removal|hair removal]].

Lasers are used to treat [[cancer]] by shrinking or destroying [[Neoplasm|tumors]] or precancerous growths. They are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers that are on the surface of the body or the lining of internal organs. They are used to treat basal cell skin cancer and the very early stages of others like [[cervical cancer|cervical]], [[penile cancer|penile]], [[vaginal cancer|vaginal]], [[vulvar cancer|vulvar]], and [[non-small cell lung cancer]]. Laser therapy is often combined with other treatments, such as [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]], or [[radiation therapy]]. [[Laser ablation|Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy]] (LITT), or interstitial laser [[Laser coagulation|photocoagulation]], uses lasers to treat some cancers using hyperthermia, which uses heat to shrink tumors by damaging or killing cancer cells. Lasers are more precise than traditional surgery methods and cause less damage, pain, [[bleeding]], swelling, and scarring. A disadvantage is that surgeons must have specialized training. It may be more expensive than other treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000905.htm|title=Laser therapy for cancer: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|last=|first=|date=|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIHlaser"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/surgery/lasers-fact-sheet|title=Lasers in Cancer Treatment|last=|first=|date=13 September 2011|website=|publisher=National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 December 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As weapons ===
[[File:THEL-ACTD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The US-Israeli [[Tactical High Energy Laser|Tactical High Energy weapon]] has been used to shoot down rockets and artillery shells.]]

Many types of laser can potentially be used as incapacitating weapons, through their ability to produce temporary or permanent vision loss when aimed at the eyes. The degree, character, and duration of vision impairment caused by eye exposure to laser light varies with the power of the laser, the wavelength(s), the collimation of the beam, the exact orientation of the beam, and the duration of exposure. Lasers of even a fraction of a watt in power can produce immediate, permanent vision loss under certain conditions, making such lasers potential non-lethal but incapacitating weapons. The extreme handicap that laser-induced blindness represents makes the use of lasers even as [[non-lethal weapon]]s morally controversial, and weapons designed to cause permanent blindness have been banned by the [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons]]. Weapons designed to cause temporary blindness, known as [[Dazzler (weapon)|dazzlers]], are used by military and sometimes law enforcement organizations. Incidents of pilots being exposed to lasers while flying have prompted aviation authorities to implement special procedures to deal with such hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7990013.stm |work=BBC News | title=Police fight back on laser threat | date=April 8, 2009 | accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Lasers and aviation safety]] for more on this topic.

Laser weapons capable of directly damaging or destroying a target in combat are still in the experimental stage. The general idea of laser-beam weaponry is to hit a target with a train of brief pulses of light. The rapid evaporation and expansion of the surface causes shockwaves that damage the target.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The power needed to project a high-powered laser beam of this kind is beyond the limit of current mobile power technology, thus favoring chemically powered [[gas dynamic laser]]s. Example experimental systems include [[MIRACL]] and the [[Tactical High Energy Laser]].

[[File:YAL-1A Airborne Laser unstowed crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Boeing YAL-1. The laser system is mounted in a turret attached to the aircraft nose]]
Throughout the 2000s, the [[United States Air Force]] worked on the [[Boeing YAL-1]], an airborne laser mounted in a Boeing 747. It was intended to be used to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles over enemy territory. In March 2009, [[Northrop Grumman]] claimed that its engineers in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] had successfully built and tested an electrically powered solid state laser capable of producing a 100-kilowatt beam, powerful enough to destroy an airplane. According to Brian Strickland, manager for the [[United States Army]]'s Joint High Power Solid State Laser program, an electrically powered laser is capable of being mounted in an aircraft, ship, or other vehicle because it requires much less space for its supporting equipment than a chemical laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Pae |last= Peter |title=Northrop Advance Brings Era Of The Laser Gun Closer |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 19, 2009 |page= B2 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/19/business/fi-laser19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the source of such a large electrical power in a mobile application remained unclear. Ultimately, the project was deemed to be infeasible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csis.org/blog/missile-defense-umbrella |title=Missile Defense Umbrella? |publisher=[[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111093235/http://csis.org/blog/missile-defense-umbrella |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2010/02/airforce_budget_022610w/ |title=Schwartz: Get those AF boots off the ground |publisher=airforcetimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hodge |first=Nathan |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704570104576124173372065568 |title=Pentagon Loses War To Zap Airborne Laser From Budget |publisher= ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' |date= February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was cancelled in December 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Lights Out For The Airborne Laser |first=Amy |last=Butler |magazine= Aviation Week |date=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Boeing YAL-1 prototype being stored and eventually dismantled.

The [[United States Navy]] is developing a laser weapon referred to as the [[Laser Weapon System]] or LaWS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy's New Laser Weapon Blasts Bad Guys From Air, Sea|author=Luis Martinez|url=https://news.yahoo.com/navys-laser-weapon-blasts-bad-215808231.html|newspaper=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=9 Apr 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hobbies ===
In recent years, some hobbyists have taken interests in lasers. Lasers used by hobbyists are generally of class IIIa or IIIb (see [[#Safety|Safety]]), although some have made their own class IV types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerlabs.org/laser.htm PowerLabs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; LASER!] Sam Barros June 21, 2006. Retrieved January 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared to other hobbyists, laser hobbyists are far less common, due to the cost and potential dangers involved. Due to the cost of lasers, some hobbyists use inexpensive means to obtain lasers, such as salvaging laser diodes from broken DVD players (red), [[Blu-ray]] players (violet), or even higher power laser diodes from CD or [[DVD burner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephanie |last=Maks |url=http://planetstephanie.net/dvd-laser/ |title=Howto: Make a DVD burner into a high-powered laser |work=Transmissions from Planet Stephanie |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbyists also have been taking surplus pulsed lasers from retired military applications and modifying them for pulsed [[holography]]. Pulsed Ruby and pulsed YAG lasers have been used.

=== Examples by power ===
[[File:Lying down on the VLT platform.jpg|thumb|upright|Laser application in astronomical [[adaptive optics]] imaging]]
Different applications need lasers with different output powers. Lasers that produce a continuous beam or a series of short pulses can be compared on the basis of their average power. Lasers that produce pulses can also be characterized based on the ''peak'' power of each pulse. The peak power of a pulsed laser is many [[orders of magnitude]] greater than its average power. The average output power is always less than the power consumed.

{{Main|Laser safety}}
Even the first laser was recognized as being potentially dangerous. [[Theodore Maiman]] characterized the first laser as having a power of one "Gillette" as it could burn through one [[Global Gillette|Gillette]] [[razor]] blade. Today, it is accepted that even low-power lasers with only a few milliwatts of output power can be hazardous to human eyesight when the beam hits the eye directly or after reflection from a shiny surface. At wavelengths which the [[cornea]] and the lens can focus well, the coherence and low divergence of laser light means that it can be focused by the [[human eye|eye]] into an extremely small spot on the [[retina]], resulting in localized burning and permanent damage in seconds or even less time.

Lasers are usually labeled with a safety class number, which identifies how dangerous the laser is:
* Class 1 is inherently safe, usually because the light is contained in an enclosure, for example in CD players.
* Class 2 is safe during normal use; the [[blink reflex]] of the eye will prevent damage. Usually up to 1&amp;nbsp;mW power, for example laser pointers.
* Class 3R (formerly IIIa) lasers are usually up to 5&amp;nbsp;mW and involve a small risk of eye damage within the time of the blink reflex. Staring into such a beam for several seconds is likely to cause damage to a spot on the retina.
* Class 3B can cause immediate eye damage upon exposure.
* Class 4 lasers can burn skin, and in some cases, even scattered light can cause eye and/or skin damage. Many industrial and scientific lasers are in this class.
The indicated powers are for visible-light, continuous-wave lasers. For pulsed lasers and invisible wavelengths, other power limits apply. People working with class 3B and class 4 lasers can protect their eyes with safety goggles which are designed to absorb light of a particular wavelength.

Infrared lasers with wavelengths longer than about 1.4 micrometers are often referred to as "eye-safe", because the cornea tends to absorb light at these wavelengths, protecting the retina from damage. The label "eye-safe" can be misleading, however, as it applies only to relatively low power continuous wave beams; a high power or [[Q-switched]] laser at these wavelengths can burn the cornea, causing severe eye damage, and even moderate power lasers can injure the eye.

Lasers can be a hazard to both civil and miliatary aviation, due to the potential to temporarily distract or blind pilots. See [[Lasers and aviation safety]] for more on this topic.

The '''Lauca Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] currently being constructed on the [[Cuanza River]] in [[Angola]]. It is situated on the borders of [[Cuanza Norte Province|Cuanza Norte]], [[Cuanza Sul Province|Cuanza Sul]] and [[Malanje Province]]s. Construction began in 2012. The first generator of the 2,069.5 MW power station was commissioned on August 4th 2017, when the power plant was officially inaugurated by President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PR inaugura barragem de Laúca|url=http://www.portaldeangola.com/2017/08/pr-inaugura-barragem-de-lauca/|accessdate=6 August 2017|publisher=portaldeangola|date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam and power station will cost US$4.3 billion, funded in part by the Government of Brazil. When complete, it will be the largest power station in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lauca dam, in Angola, starts producing energy in 2017|url=http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2015/10/30/lauca-dam-in-angola-starts-producing-energy-in-2017/|accessdate=20 June 2016|publisher=Macau Hub|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Convert|132|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[roller-compacted concrete]] dam will withhold a reservoir of {{Convert|5482000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}. The reservoir will supply two [[hydroelectric]] power stations, a main and an ancillary. The main will contain six 334 MW [[Francis turbine]]-generators and the ancillary a single 65.5 MW Francis unit. The ancillary power station will operate most often, to maintain a minimum {{Convert|60|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}} ecological flow of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LAÚCA HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT|url=http://www.coba.pt/pdf/Ingles/Producao_Transport%20Energia/Hydropower%20generation.pdf|publisher=COBA|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Long-lived fission products''' (LLFPs) are radioactive materials with a long [[half-life]] (more than 200,000 years) produced by [[nuclear fission]] of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]].

==Evolution of radioactivity in nuclear waste==
[[Nuclear fission]] produces [[fission products]], as well as [[actinide]]s from [[nuclear fuel]] nuclei that capture neutrons but fail to fission, and [[activation products]] from [[neutron activation]] of reactor or environmental materials.

===Short-term===
The high short-term [[radioactivity]] of [[spent nuclear fuel]] is primarily from fission products with short [[half-life]].
The radioactivity in the fission product mixture is mostly short-lived isotopes such as [[Iodine-131|&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I]] and &lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;Ba, after about four months &lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt;Ce, &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Zr/&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Nb and &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr take the largest share, while after about two or three years the largest share is taken by &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Ce/&lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Pr, &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Ru/&lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Rh and &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Pm.
Note that in the case of a release of radioactivity from a power reactor or used fuel, only some elements are released. As a result, the isotopic signature of the radioactivity is very different from an open air nuclear detonation where all the fission products are dispersed.

===Medium-lived fission products===
{{Medium-lived fission products}}After several years of cooling, most radioactivity is from the fission products [[caesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]], which are each produced in about 6% of fissions, and have half-lives of about 30 years. Other fission products with similar half-lives have much lower [[fission product yield]]s, lower [[decay energy]], and several (&lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, &lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, &lt;sup&gt;113m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd) are also quickly destroyed by [[neutron capture]] while still in the reactor, so are not responsible for more than a tiny fraction of the radiation production at any time. Therefore, in the period from several years to several hundred years after use, radioactivity of spent fuel can be modeled simply as [[exponential decay]] of the &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr. These are sometimes known as medium-lived fission products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nuclear Wastes: Technologies for Separations and Transmutation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRI7Cx2D4e4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22medium-lived+fission+products%22#PPA25,M1 | isbn=978-0-309-05226-9 | year=1996 | publisher=National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nuclear Alchemy Gamble: An Assessment of Transmutation as a Nuclear Waste Management Strategy|url=http://www.ieer.org/reports/transm/hisham.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krypton-85]], the 3rd most active MLFP, is a [[noble gas]] which is allowed to escape during current [[nuclear reprocessing]]; however, its inertness means that it does not concentrate in the environment, but diffuses to a uniform low concentration in the atmosphere. Spent fuel in the U.S. and some other countries is not likely to be reprocessed until decades after use, and by that time most of the &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Kr will have decayed.
{{clear}}

===Actinides===
{{Actinidesvsfissionproducts}}
After &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr have decayed to low levels, the bulk of radioactivity from spent fuel come not from fission products but [[actinides]], notably [[plutonium-239]] (half-life 24&amp;nbsp;[[kiloannus|ka]]), [[plutonium-240]] (6.56&amp;nbsp;ka), [[americium-241]] (432&amp;nbsp;years), [[americium-243]] (7.37&amp;nbsp;ka), [[curium]]-245 (8.50&amp;nbsp;ka), and curium-246 (4.73&amp;nbsp;ka). These can be recovered by [[nuclear reprocessing]] (either before or after most &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr decay) and fissioned, offering the possibility of greatly reducing waste radioactivity in the time scale of about 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years. &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu is usable as fuel in existing [[thermal reactor]]s, but some [[minor actinides]] like &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, as well as the non-[[fissile]] and less-[[fertile material|fertile]] isotope [[plutonium-242]], are better destroyed in [[fast reactor]]s, accelerator-driven [[subcritical reactor]]s, or [[fusion reactor]]s.

===Long-lived fission products===
On scales greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years, fission products, chiefly &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc, again represent a significant proportion of the remaining, though lower radioactivity, along with longer-lived actinides like [[neptunium-237]] and [[plutonium-242]], if those have not been destroyed.

The most abundant long-lived fission products have total [[decay energy]] around 100-300&amp;nbsp;keV, only part of which appears in the beta particle; the rest is lost to a [[neutrino]] that has no effect. In contrast, actinides undergo multiple [[alpha decay]]s, each with decay energy around 4-5&amp;nbsp;MeV.

Only seven fission products have long half-lives, and these are much longer than 30 years, in the range of 200,000 to 16 million years. These are known as long-lived fission products (LLFP). Two or three have relatively high yields of about 6%, while the rest appear at much lower yields. (This list of seven excludes isotopes with very slow decay and half-lives longer than the age of the universe, which are effectively stable and already found in nature; as well as a few nuclides like [[technetium]]-98 and [[samarium]]-146 that are "shadowed" from [[beta decay]] and can only occur as direct fission products, not as beta decay products of more neutron-rich initial fission products. The shadowed fission products have yields on the order of one millionth as much as iodine-129.)

==The 7 long-lived fission products==
{{Long-lived fission products}}
The first three have similar half-lives, between 200 thousand and 300 thousand years; the last four have longer half-lives, in the low millions of years.
#[[Technetium-99]] produces the largest amount of LLFP radioactivity. It emits [[beta particles]] of low to medium energy but no [[gamma ray]]s, so has little hazard on external exposure, but only if ingested. However, technetium's chemistry allows it to form [[anion]]s (pertechnetate, TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) that are relatively mobile in the environment. Tons of technetium-99 have been released into the ocean.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}
#[[Tin-126]] has a large [[decay energy]] (due to its following short [[half-life]] [[decay product]]) and is the only LLFP that emits energetic [[gamma radiation]], which is an external exposure hazard. However, this isotope is produced in very small quantities in fission by [[thermal neutrons]], so the energy per unit time from &lt;sup&gt;126&lt;/sup&gt;Sn is only about 5% as much as from &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc for U-235 fission, or 20% as much for 65% U-235+35% Pu-239. [[Fast fission]] may produce higher yields. [[Tin]] is an inert metal with little mobility in the environment, helping to limit health risks from its radiation.
#[[Selenium-79]] is produced at low yields and emits only weak radiation. Its decay energy per unit time should be only about 0.2% that of Tc-99.
#[[Zirconium-93]] is produced at a relatively high yield of about 6%, but its decay is 7.5 times slower than Tc-99, and its decay energy is only 30% as great; therefore its energy production is initially only 4% as great as Tc-99, though this fraction will increase as the Tc-99 decays. &lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Zr does produce gamma radiation, but of a very low energy, and [[zirconium]] is relatively inert in the environment.
#[[Caesium-135]]'s predecessor [[xenon-135]] is produced at a high rate of over 6% of fissions, but is an extremely potent absorber of thermal neutrons ([[neutron poison]]), so that most of it is transmuted to almost-stable xenon-136 before it can decay to caesium-135. If 90% of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is destroyed, then the remaining &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs's decay energy per unit time is initially only about 1% as great as that of the &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc. In a fast reactor, less of the Xe-135 may be destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;[[Cs-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] is the only [[alkaline]] or [[electropositive]] LLFP; in contrast, the main medium-lived fission products and the minor actinides other than neptunium are all alkaline and tend to stay together during reprocessing; with many reprocessing techniques such as salt solution or salt volatilization, &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs will also stay with this group, although some techniques such as high-temperature volatilization can separate it. Often the alkaline wastes are [[vitrified]] to form [[high level waste]], which will include the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs.&lt;br /&gt;Fission caesium contains not only &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs but also stable but neutron-absorbing &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs (which wastes neutrons and forms [[Cs-134|&lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] which is radioactive with a half-life of 2 years) as well as the common fission product [[Cs-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] which does not absorb neutrons but is highly radioactive, making handling more hazardous and complicated; for all these reasons, transmutation disposal of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs would be more difficult.
#[[Palladium-107]] has a very long half-life, a low yield (though the yield for plutonium fission is higher than the yield from [[uranium-235]] fission), and very weak radiation. Its initial contribution to LLFP radiation should be only about one part in 10000 for &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U fission, or 2000 for 65% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U+35% &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. Palladium is a [[noble metal]] and extremely inert.
#[[Iodine-129]] has the longest [[half-life]], 15.7 million years, and due to its higher half life, lower fission fraction and decay energy it produces only about 1% the intensity of radioactivity as &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc. However, radioactive [[iodine]] is a disproportionate biohazard because the [[thyroid gland]] concentrates iodine. &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I has a half-life nearly a [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] times as long as its more hazardous sister isotope &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I; therefore, with a shorter half-life and a higher decay energy, &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I is approximately a billion times more radioactive than the longer-lived &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I.

==LLFP radioactivity compared==
In total, the other six LLFPs, in thermal reactor spent fuel, initially release only a bit more than 10% as much energy per unit time as Tc-99 for U-235 fission, or 25% as much for 65% U-235+35% Pu-239. About 1000 years after fuel use, radioactivity from the medium-lived fission products Cs-137 and Sr-90 drops below the level of radioactivity from Tc-99 or LLFPs in general. (Actinides, if not removed, will be emitting more radioactivity than either at this point.) By about 1 million years, Tc-99 radioactivity will have declined below that of Zr-93, though immobility of the latter means it is probably still a lesser hazard. By about 3 million years, Zr-93 decay energy will have declined below that of I-129.

[[Nuclear transmutation]] is under consideration as a disposal method, primarily for Tc-99 and I-129 as these both represent the greatest biohazards and have the greatest [[neutron capture]] [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]]s, although transmutation is still slow compared to fission of actinides in a reactor. Transmutation has also been considered for Cs-135, but is almost certainly not worthwhile for the other LLFPs.

The term '''magnetic structure''' of a material pertains to the ordered arrangement of magnetic spins, typically within an ordered [[crystallographic lattice]]. Its study is a branch of [[solid-state physics]].

==Magnetic structures==
Most solid materials are non-magnetic, that is, they do not display a magnetic structure. Due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], each state is occupied by electrons of opposing spins, so that the charge density is compensated everywhere and the spin degree of freedom is trivial. Still, such materials typically do show a weak magnetic behaviour, e.g. due to Pauli [[paramagnetism]] or Langevin or Landau [[diamagnetism]]. 

The more interesting case is when the material's electron spontaneously break above-mentioned symmetry. For [[ferromagnetism]] in the ground state, there is a common spin quantization axis and a global excess of electrons of a given spin quantum number, there are more electrons pointing in one direction than in the other, giving a macroscopic magnetization (typically, the majority electrons are chosen to point up). In the most simple (collinear) cases of [[antiferromagnetism]], there is still a common quantization axis, but the electronic spins are pointing alternatingly up and down, leading again to cancellation of the macroscopic magnetization. However, specifically in the case of [[frustration]] of the interactions, the resulting structures can become much more complicated, with inherently three-dimensional orientations of the local spins. Finally, [[ferrimagnetism]] as prototypically displayed by [[magnetite]] is in some sense an intermediate case: here the magnetization is globally uncompensated as in ferromagnetism, but the local magnetization points in different directions. 

The above discussion pertains to the ground state structure. Of course, finite temperatures lead to excitations of the spin configuration. Here two extreme points of view can be contrasted: in the Stoner picture of magnetism (also called itinerant magnetism), the electronic states are delocalized, and their mean-field interaction leads to the symmetry breaking. In this view, with increasing temperature the local magnetization would thus decrease homogeneously, as single delocalized electrons are moved from the up- to the down-channel. On the other hand, in the local-moment case the electronic states are localized to specific atoms, giving atomic spins, which interact only over a short range and typically are analyzed with the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg model]]. Here, finite temperatures lead to a deviation of the atomic spins' orientations from the ideal configuration, thus for a ferromagnet also decreasing the macroscopic magnetization.

==Techniques to study them==
Such ordering can be studied by observing the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature and/or the size of the applied magnetic field, but a truly three-dimensional picture of the arrangement of the spins is best obtained by means of [[neutron diffraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Neutron diffraction of magnetic materials / Yu. A. Izyumov, V.E. Naish, and R.P. Ozerov ; translated from Russian by Joachim Büchner. New York : Consultants Bureau, c1991.{{ISBN|030611030X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.anl.gov/Xray_Science_Division/Powder_Diffraction_Crystallography/2006ACNSmagnetGSAS/YBAFEOexampleMovie/YBAFEOexample.html A demonstration by Brian Toby]&lt;/ref&gt; Neutrons are primarily scattered by the nuclei of the atoms in the structure. At a temperature above the ordering point of the magnetic moments, where the material behaves as a paramagnetic one, neutron diffraction will therefore give a picture of the crystallographic structure only. Below the ordering point, e.g. the [[Néel temperature]] of an [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]] or the [[Curie temperature|Curie-point]] of a ferromagnet the neutrons will also experience scattering from the magnetic moments because they themselves possess spin. The intensities of the [[Bragg reflection]]s will therefore change. In fact in some cases entirely new Bragg-reflections will occur if the unit cell of the ordering is larger than that of the crystallographic structure. This is a form of [[superstructure (condensed matter)|superstructure]] formation. Thus the symmetry of the total structure may well differ from the crystallographic substructure. It needs to be described by one of the 1651 magnetic (Shubnikov) groups rather than one of the non-magnetic [[space groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Shoon K.|title=Group theoretical methods and applications to molecules and crystals|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=9780521640626|page=428|edition=digitally print. 1. paperback version}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ordinary X-ray diffraction is 'blind' to the arrangement of the spins, it has become possible to use a special form of X-ray diffraction to study magnetic structure. If a wavelength is selected that is close to an [[absorption edge]] of one of elements contained in the materials the scattering becomes anomalous and this component to the scattering is (somewhat) sensitive to the non-spherical shape of the outer electrons of an atom with an unpaired spin. This means that this type of [[anomalous X-ray scattering|anomalous X-ray diffraction]] does contain information of the desired type.

==Magnetic structure of the chemical elements==
Only three elements are [[ferromagnetic]] at room temperature and pressure: [[iron]], [[cobalt]], and [[nickel]]. This is because their [[Curie temperature]], Tc, is higher than room temperature (Tc &gt; 298K). There are also elements which are paramagnetic at room temperature, but become ferromagnetic at low temperatures, including [[Dysprosium]], [[Erbium]], [[Holmium]], [[Terbium]], and [[Thulium]]. There is also antiferromagnetic ordering, which becomes disorderd above the [[Néel temperature]]. Those elements which become [[superconductors]] exhibit [[superdiamagnetism]] below a critical temperature.

'''''Man-Thing''''' is a 2005 [[Australian-American]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Brett Leonard]] and featuring the [[Marvel Comics]] [[swamp creature]] [[Man-Thing]] created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Roy Thomas]], and [[Gerry Conway]]. The plot is based on a storyline by [[Steve Gerber]], who wrote the best-known series of ''Man-Thing'' comics.
Agents of an oil tycoon vanish while exploring a swamp marked for drilling. The local sheriff investigates and faces a [[Seminole]] legend come to life: Man-Thing, a shambling swamp-monster.
 
The film appeared on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] in 2005 under the [[Syfy#Syfy Original Films|Sci Fi Pictures]] label. It starred [[Matthew Le Nevez]], [[Rachael Taylor]], and [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]. The film was released theatrically in a handful of International markets. The film was a [[box office bomb]] grossing only $1 million and received generally negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
At Dark Waters, a Native American sacred land containing an enigmatic swamp spirit, a teenager is murdered by a plant-like monster. The following day, young replacement sheriff Kyle Williams reaches Bywater and meets with deputy sheriff Fraser, who tells him the previous sheriff is among 47 missing persons since oil tycoon Fred Schist bought the ancient tribal lands from shaman and [[Seminole]] chieftain Ted Sallis, the first to disappear. Schist claimed Sallis had sold the lands legally and then escaped with the money. Schist then asked the sheriff for help: Local protestors opposed his perfectly legal activities, and [[mestizo]] scoundrel Renee Laroque was sabotaging his facilities. Williams investigates this while trying to find an explanation for the missing people, some of which were found brutally murdered with plants growing from inside their bodies. Photographer Mike Ploog and shaman Pete Horn tell Williams local legends about the guardian spirit, suggesting that it could be real.

As sabotage and murder continue, Williams investigates the swamp with Fraser and finds the previous sheriff's corpse. Medical examiner Val Mayerik admits that the previous sheriff had ordered him to file the deaths as alligator attacks, even if Mayerik believed otherwise.

Williams and Fraser try to track Laroque, who lives in the swamp, by using a canoe. At the same time, Schist sends the Thibadeux brothers, local thugs, to track and murder Laroque. The monster in the swamp finds the Thibadeux and kills them. Williams is ensnared by Laroque, who admits having helped Schist buy the lands. Laroque claims that Sallis was opposed to the sale; Laroque insists that the guardian spirit would keep on murdering until Schist stops desecrating the sacred swamp. Fraser tries to help Laroque, but the Man-Thing timely appears and murders Fraser; Laroque knocks Williams down and escapes. Williams wakes up and finds Ploog, who has blurry pictures of the monster; the sheriff seizes the photographs and forbids Ploog to come back to the swamp.

The following day, Williams interviews Horn and Schist, with the help of schoolteacher Teri Richards' help. Williams starts having romantic feelings for Richards. Horn goes to the swamp and tries to stop the Man-Thing with prayers and sacrificing his own life. The monster kills Horn, but is not otherwise affected by his efforts. That night, Mayerik autopsies the old sheriff and finds a bullet. He tries to tell Williams, but he is back at the swamp, unreachable. Mayerik tells Richards, and she goes to the swamp to tell Williams. Meanwhile, Ploog had returned to the swamp, trying to get a picture of the monster. Instead he startles Fred Schist, who was in the swamp to murder Laroque. Schist shoots and kills Ploog. Soon afterward, Laroque ambushes and defeats Schist's son and minion Jake.

Williams finds Ploog's corpse and reasons that Schist murdered Ploog. He then meets Richards, who tells him about Mayerik's autopsy. Williams concludes that Schist is guilty of several murders, trying to incriminate Laroque simply to avoid punishment. According to Schist's confession to Laroque, he murdered Sallis and buried him in Dark Waters. Due to the magic embedded in the soil, Sallis returned as the Man-Thing. Richards reveals that she can guide Williams to Laroque's lair, but the Man-Thing starts chasing them. He chases them to the drilling tower at Dark Waters. In the tower, Schist is leveling his weapon at Laroque in an attempt to prevent Laroque from blowing it away with dynamite. Laroque nonetheless tries to detonate his bomb and is shot and wounded by Schist; Schist then wounds Williams.

However, the Man-Thing arrives and brutally murders Schist by filling his body with oil. The Man-Thing then moves toward Williams and Richards. Laroque sacrifices himself shouting at the monster and blowing the bomb. The monster survives the flames, but then is absorbed back to the land.

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

===Development===
In 2000, [[Marvel Entertainment]] entered into a joint venture agreement with [[Artisan Entertainment]] to turn at least 15 Marvel superhero franchises into live-action films, television series, direct-to-video films and internet projects. These franchises included an adaptation of Man-Thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|title=Artisan deal a real Marvel|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/artisan-deal-a-real-marvel-1117781709/|accessdate=May 10, 2016|work=Variety|agency=Deadline Hollywood|date=May 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plans to make a film about Man-Thing were first announced in 2001.&lt;ref name=schroeder2006&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.lonely.geek.nz/mtmovie.html | first=Darren |last= Schroeder | publisher= Lonely.Geek.nz | title=Movie Things &gt; ''Man-Thing'' |accessdate= March 3, 2015| year=2006| archivedate= January 21, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121084525/http://www.lonely.geek.nz/fording_the_mainstream/man-thing/movie-thing.html | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was variously considered for a [[direct-to-video]] release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/83141-man-thing-probably-going-straight-to-video |title=Man-Thing Probably Going Straight-to-Video |publisher=Superherohype.com |date=September 5, 2003 |accessdate= July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afma.com/afm/exh_sche_title.asp?StartName=M |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020221095509/http://www.afma.com/AFM/exh_sche_title.asp?StartName=M |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 21, 2002 |publisher=[[American Film Market]] |date=November 3–10, 2004 |title=Screening Schedule by Title &gt; ''Machuca'' to ''Oyster Farmer'' |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of [[Bryan Singer]]'s ''[[X-Men (2000 film)|X-Men]]'' (2000), [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'' (2000) and [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002) the film was moved to a theatrical release to exploit on the success of superheroes.&lt;ref name="thegeektwins.com"&gt;http://www.thegeektwins.com/2015/02/who-owns-man-thing-movie-rights-now.html#.V-8G_ev3aK1/ Who Owns the Man-Thing Movie Rights Now?, October 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
On October 27, 2003 it was reported that [[Artisan Entertainment]], which had partnered with [[Marvel Enterprises]] in production [[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]] and Man-Thing films, was being purchase by [[Lionsgate Films]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.superherohype.com/features/83599-the-punisher-man-thing-studio-bought-by-lions-gate&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2004, the film production and distribution company [[Lionsgate]] merged with Artisan Entertainment and received the film rights to [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Man-Thing]] and the [[Punisher]].&lt;ref name="thegeektwins.com"/&gt; In January 2004, producer [[Avi Arad]] said Man-Thing was more of a departure from the original comic than were Marvel's other film character in that it was a [[horror film]] with a menacing central character.&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt; On April 2004, the film had been completed, with the finished print received and waiting to be tested with audiences, after which an exact release date would be determined. The film was [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rated R]] for violence, grisly images, language and some sexuality by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA).&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt;

The film had a production budget of $30 million.&lt;ref name =B/&gt; Avi Arad, then CEO of [[Marvel Studios]], admitted it was a mistake not keeping tabs on the production, as it was being filmed so far away in [[Australia]]. He stated "The one hiccup we had was the one project we didn't micromanage. We were not going to the Outback, there was so much going on. We will never do that again. We should never have trusted anybody that far away without our supervision. Thankfully it was a small movie and not a disaster. If we were there and on top of it, it would have been a[n] amazing movie. I look at the {horror} genre, and I think 'Sh--, I can't believe this'. We've learned our lesson."&lt;ref name =B/&gt;

===Filming===
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
''Man-Thing'' was shot completely on location in [[Sydney, Australia]]. Shooting locations included [[Wisemans Ferry, New South Wales|Wisemans Ferry]], Serenity Cove Studios at [[Kurnell, New South Wales|Kurnell]] for exterior swamp scenes and [[Homebush Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.superherohype.com/news/83205-man-thing-set-locations-revealed&lt;/ref&gt; The principle photography for ''Man-Thing'' concluded in 2003.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Effects===
[[Marvel Studios]] producer [[Avi Arad]] said "the lead character in the Man-Thing movie would be a combination of prosthetics and computer-generated effects.&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt;
From the outset, Man-Thing was intended to be a prosthetic, CG-enhanced creature", Arad told The Continuum during a visit to Marvel Studios So there was a great deal of R&amp;D.... There's positional stuff happening on location, on the set, but at the same time the stuff you don't currently see in camera was always engineered to be enhanced by digital effects. So when you see the movie, hopefully the line is pretty blurry. It's not an all-CG creature.&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt;

===Design===
Special effects makeup was by the Make-Up Effects Group of [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt;
The Man-Thing was built as a full-size creature suit, portrayed by [[Conan Stevens|Mark Stevens]], a 7'1" (216&amp;nbsp;cm) [[Australian people|Australian]] actor, ex-wrestler and stuntman.&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt;

Although no full-digital Man-Thing model was made due to budgetary constraints, the suit was combined with digital moving branches and tendrils for certain sequences, also well as digital augmentation for the eyes.&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt;

==Music==
The band AzUR (DOG Productions' Wayne and Luke, joined with Bec And Freddie) recorded the song The ''Man-Thing Lives Again'' that played over the end credits of the film. It was supposed to be released as a promotional video, but since the film was in a constant state of flux (financial, script, etc...) and was not going to go to theatres (as intended), the music video was pulled for lack of budget. Marvel did not want to leak advance images of the set and creature costume before the film's eventual release.One of the band members has worked on the footage and uploaded a remix on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt;

The US release date was set for [[Halloween]] (October 31) 2004,&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt; but when [[Marvel Enterprises]] released its second quarter financial report, ''Man-Thing'' was included in the 2005 line-up with a release date to be decided. Reportedly, the film was so bad that the test audience walked out before it was finished. So, Marvel put it back on video in the United States, since it would not be bankable in a domestic release. The film was released it internationally in places like [[Russia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ''Man-Thing'' was released on April 30, 2005, as a "Sci-Fi Original" on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]].&lt;ref name=schroeder2006 /&gt;

The character's film rights, along with the other Marvel characters whose film rights were previously acquired by Artisan Entertainment, have reverted to Marvel.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Mayapuri''' is a locality in [[West Delhi]]. It used to be a major hub of small scale industries, but following recent government sanctions, most of the [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] industries moved out. The place is now a combination of residential flats (DDA and private), light metal factories and automobile service stations.

The area is mostly residential now, with major localities built by the [[Delhi Development Authority]] (DDA). These include Hari Enclave, Vikrant Enclave, MIG Flats and Maya Enclave. There are some major landmarks in this area like the Food Corporation of India, Metal Forging, [[New Era Public School]] and Din Dayal Upadhyay Hospital.

Vatika Apartments, MIG Flats, is a DDA Colony that was completed and allotted to owners in 1977. There are approximately 432 flats in this society, with A, B, C, D and E streets. Most of B, C and E street have privately held apartments. D Street belongs to the Government of India and the current tenants are serving officers of the Govt. of India. A Street also has governmental holding in several apartments, and these belong to the Customs and Excise Wing of the GoI. Vatika Apartments is a mid-premium gated locality and has its own Mother Dairy (Milk Supply booth) and a Local Shopping Centre.

Mayapuri is served by three malls of Rajouri Garden - City Square Mall, TDI Mall and West Gate Mall, and by the upmarket Pacific Mall in Tagore Garden/Subhash Nagar.  All these malls are within 3–4&amp;nbsp;km of Mayapuri.

Mayapuri is approximately 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]] and [[New Delhi Railway Station]], and about 14&amp;nbsp;km from the Domestic Airport Terminal. It has a Maruti Showroom and workshop, and workshops of Hyundai and Honda as well at a close distance.

Mayapuri is also one of the major bus terminals for the [[Delhi Transport Corporation]] (DTC). Delhi Metro's Rajouri Garden and Subhash Nagar stations are close by. The petrol pumps at Beriwala Bagh, Police Station and Subhash Nagar are within easy reach. Several schools are in close proximity as are several banks like UCO Bank, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, ICIC Bank, HDFC Bank and many more.

Park Plaza, Iris Hometel and Signature Grand are the three premium hotels in Mayapuri. They are situated in Hari Nagar, but that is just as good as Mayapuri. These are about 1&amp;nbsp;km from Vatika Apartments, Mayapuri.

==Mayapuri radiological accident==

In April 2010, the locality of Mayapuri was affected by a serious radiological accident.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/world/asia/24india.html |title= Scrap metal radiation raises concerns in India |date=23 April 2010 |first=Jim |last=Yardley |newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= 20 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[AECL]] Gammacell 220 research [[Irradiation|irradiator]] owned by [[Delhi University]] since 1968, but unused since 1985, was sold at auction to a scrap metal dealer in Mayapuri on 26 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerb.gov.in/t/prsrel/p2942010.pdf [[AERB]] press release. 29 April 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/Source-of-Mayapuri-radiation-traced-to-Delhi-Univ-chemistry-lab/Article1-536847.aspx {{deadlink|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-04-28/delhi/28137834_1_scrap-dealers-delhi-university-s-chemistry-department-cobalt-60 Origin of Cobalt-60 traced to Delhi University]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[orphan source]] arrived at a [[scrap yard]] in Mayapuri during March, where it was dismantled by workers unaware of the hazardous nature of the device. The [[cobalt-60]] source was cut into eleven pieces. The smallest of the fragments was taken by [[Ajay Jain]] who kept it in his wallet, two fragments were moved to a nearby shop, while the remaining eight remained in the scrap yard. All of the sources were recovered by mid-April and transported to the [[Narora Atomic Power Station]], where it was claimed that all radioactive material originally contained within the device was accounted for. The material remains in the custody of the [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|Department of Atomic Energy]]&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerb.gov.in/t/prsrel/p1852010.pdf [[AERB]] press release. 18 May 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerb.gov.in/t/prsrel/p0552010.pdf [[AERB]] press release. 5 May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-05-05/delhi/28291040_1_mayapuri-scrap-cobalt-60-narora-atomic-power Radiation response team recovers all Cobalt-60 source from Mayapuri]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight people were hospitalised in AIIMS as a result of radiation exposure, where one later died. The event was rated level 4 out of 7 on the [[International Nuclear Events Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/2010INDA1.html Robert Johnston, Mayapuri orphaned source]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metal recycling activities==

One of the main business at Mayapuri is the recycling of metal scraps and sale of salvage vehicle parts. It is, arguably, the biggest market for used automotive and industrial spare parts in India. Many traders from all over India come here to sell or purchase old auto parts. Many small workshops specialised in different metals are active in the Mayapuri area. The safety of the [[scrap yard]]s became a concern after the radiological accident which occurred in April 2010. The area is not equipped with radiation detectors or portics, despite being a common practice in steel recycling factories in the US and in most of the European countries. The presence of toxic [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s and of harmful chemicals in the waste generated by these activities presents a direct menace for the health of several thousands of people living in the area.

==Major landmarks==

* [[New Era Public School]] - Popular School

''' Melting-point depression''' is the phenomenon of reduction of the [[melting point]] of a material with reduction of its size. This phenomenon is very prominent in [[nanotechnology|nanoscale materials]], which melt at temperatures hundreds of degrees lower than bulk materials.

==Introduction==

The melting temperature of a [[bulk material]] is not dependent on its size. However, as the dimensions of a material decrease towards the atomic scale, the melting temperature scales with the material dimensions. The decrease in melting temperature can be on the order of tens to hundreds of degrees for metals with [[nanometer]] dimensions.&lt;ref name="Jiang"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Jiang |author2=N.

Melting-point depression is most evident in [[nanowire]]s, [[Carbon nanotube|nanotube]]s and [[nanoparticle]]s, which all melt at lower temperatures than bulk amounts of the same material. Changes in melting point occur because nanoscale materials have a much larger [[surface-to-volume ratio]] than bulk materials, drastically altering their [[thermodynamic]] and thermal properties.

This article focuses on nanoparticles because researchers have compiled a large amount of size-dependent melting data for near spherical nanoparticles.&lt;ref name="Jiang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopeandia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Takagi"/&gt; Nanoparticles are easiest to study due their ease of fabrication and simplified conditions for theoretical modeling. The melting temperature of a nanoparticle decreases sharply as the particle reaches critical diameter, usually &lt; 50&amp;nbsp;nm for common engineering metals.&lt;ref name="Jiang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lai"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S.

Melting point depression is a very important issue for applications involving nanoparticles, as it decreases the functional range of the solid phase. Nanoparticles are currently used or proposed for prominent roles in [[catalyst]], [[sensor]], medicinal, optical, magnetic, thermal, electronic, and alternative energy applications.&lt;ref name="Wildgoose"&gt;{{cite journal |author = G. G. Wildgoose, C. E. Banks and R. G. Compton |journal = Small |volume = 2 |title= Metal Nanoparticles and Related Materials Supported on Carbon Nanotubes: Methods and Applications| pages = 182–93 |year = 2005|doi= 10.1002/smll.200500324 |pmid = 17193018 |issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanoparticles must be in the solid state to function at elevated temperatures in several of these applications.

==Measurement techniques==

Two techniques allow measurement of the melting point of nanoparticle. The electron beam of a [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) can be used to melt nanoparticles.&lt;ref name="Takagi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. L. Allen |author2=R. A. Bayles |author3=W. W. Giles |author4=W. A. Jesser |journal = Thin Solid Films |volume = 144 |issue=2 |page = 297 |year = 1986| title = Small particle melting of pure metals| doi= 10.1016/0040-6090(86)90422-0|bibcode = 1986TSF...144..297A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The melting temperature is estimated from the beam intensity, while changes in the diffraction conditions to indicate phase transition from solid to liquid. This method allows direct viewing of nanoparticles as they melt, making it possible to test and characterize samples with a wider distribution of particle sizes. The TEM limits the pressure range at which melting point depression can be tested.

More recently, researchers developed nano[[calorimeter]]s that directly measure the [[enthalpy]] and melting temperature of nanoparticles.&lt;ref name="Lai"/&gt; Nanocalorimeters provide the same data as bulk calorimeters, however additional calculations must account for the presence of the substrate supporting the particles. A narrow size distribution of nanoparticles is required since the procedure does not allow users to view the sample during the melting process. There is no way to characterize the exact size of melted particles during experiment.

==History==

Melting point depression was predicted in 1909 by Pawlow.
&lt;ref&gt;P. Pawlow. Z. Phys. Chemie, 65(1):545, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;
Takagi first observed melting point depression of several types of metal nanoparticles in 1954.&lt;ref name="Takagi"/&gt; A variable intensity electron beam from a [[transmission electron microscope]] melted metal nanoparticles in early experiments. [[Diffraction pattern]]s changed from characteristic crystalline patterns to liquid patterns as the small particles melted, allowing Takagi to estimate the melting temperature from the electron beam energy.

==Physics==

Nanoparticles have a much greater surface to volume ratio than bulk materials. The increased surface to volume ratio means surface atoms have a much greater effect on chemical and physical properties of a nanoparticle. Surface [[atom]]s bind in the solid phase with less cohesive energy because they have fewer neighboring atoms in close proximity compared to atoms in the bulk of the solid. Each [[chemical bond]] an atom shares with a neighboring atom provides cohesive energy, so atoms with fewer bonds and neighboring atoms have lower cohesive energy. The average cohesive energy per atom of a nanoparticle has been theoretically calculated as a function of particle size according to Equation 1.&lt;ref name="Qi"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=W. H. Qi  |author2=M. P. Wang  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal = J. Mater. Sci. Lett. | volume = 21 |issue=22  |page = 1743 |title = Size effect on the cohesive energy of nanoparticle| year =2002|doi= 10.1023/A:1020904317133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E = E_B(1-\frac{d}{D})&lt;/math&gt;

Where: D = nanoparticle size&lt;br /&gt;
::d = atomic size
::E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = cohesive energy of bulk

As Equation 1 shows, the effective cohesive energy of a nanoparticle approaches that of the bulk material as the material extends beyond atomic size range (D&gt;&gt;d).

Atoms located at or near the surface of the nanoparticle have reduced cohesive energy due to a reduced number of cohesive bonds. An atom experiences an attractive force with all nearby atoms according to the [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. The Lennard-Jones pair-potential shown in Figure 2 models the cohesive energy between atoms as a function of separation distance.

[[Image:Lennard-Jones.jpg|thumb|right|700px|Figure 2. A Lennard-Jones potential energy curve. The model shows the interactive energy between 2 atoms at a normalized distance, d/d&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where d&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=atomic diameter. The interaction energy is attractive where the curve is negative, and the magnitude of the energy represents the cohesive energy between a pair of atoms. Note that the attractive potential extends over a long range beyond the length of a chemical bond, so atoms experience cohesive energy with atoms further than their nearest neighbors.]]

The cohesive energy of an atom is directly related to the thermal energy required to free the atom from the solid. According to '''Lindemann’s criterion''', the melting temperature of a material is proportional to its cohesive energy, a&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;=Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Nanda"&gt;{{cite journal| author =K. K. Nanda, S. N. Sahu and S. N. Behera |journal = Phys. Rev. A |volume = 66 |page = 013208 |title = Liquid-drop model for the size-dependent melting of low-dimensional systems| year =2002|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.66.013208 |bibcode = 2002PhRvA..66a3208N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since atoms near the surface have fewer bonds and reduced cohesive energy, they require less energy to free from the solid phase. Melting point depression of high surface to volume ratio materials results from this effect. For the same reason, surfaces of bulk materials can melt at lower temperatures than the bulk material.&lt;ref name="Frenken"&gt;{{cite journal| author =J. W. M. Frenken and J. F. van der Veen | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume = 54| issue =2 |pages = 134–137 | year =1985|title = Observation of Surface Melting| doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.54.134 | pmid=10031263 | bibcode=1985PhRvL..54..134F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical size-dependent melting point of a material can be calculated through classical thermodynamic analysis. The result is the [[Gibbs–Thomson equation]] shown in Equation 2.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_M(d) = T_{MB}(1-\frac{4\sigma\,_{sl}}{H_f\rho\,_sd})&lt;/math&gt;

Where:	T&lt;sub&gt;MB&lt;/sub&gt; = Bulk Melting temperature&lt;br /&gt;
::σ&lt;sub&gt;sl&lt;/sub&gt; = solid–liquid interface energy
::H&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = Bulk heat of fusion
::ρ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = density of solid
::d = particle diameter

A normalized Gibbs–Thomson Equation for gold nanoparticles is plotted in Figure 1, and the shape of the curve is in general agreement with those obtained through experiment.&lt;ref name="Buffat"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P. H. Buffat  |author2=J. P. Borrel  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Phys. Rev. A | volume = 13 |issue=6  | page = 2287 | year = 1976|title = Size effect on the melting temperature of gold particles| doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.13.2287 | bibcode=1976PhRvA..13.2287B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semiconductor/covalent nanoparticles==

Equation 2 gives the general relation between the melting point of a metal nanoparticle and its diameter. However, recent work indicates the melting point of [[semiconductor]] and covalently bonded nanoparticles may have a different dependence on particle size.&lt;ref name="Farrell"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H. H. Farrell  |author2=C. D. Van Sicien  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal =Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B |volume = 25 |issue=4  | page = 1441 |year =2007| title = Binding energy, vapor pressure, and melting point of semiconductor nanoparticles | doi= 10.1116/1.2748415|bibcode = 2007JVSTB..25.1441F |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1236098/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The covalent character of the bonds changes the melting physics of these materials. Researchers have demonstrated that Equation 3 more accurately models melting point depression in covalently bonded materials.&lt;ref name="Farrell"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_M(d)=T_{MB}(1-(\frac{c}{d})^2)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where:	T&lt;sub&gt;MB&lt;/sub&gt;=Bulk Melting temperature&lt;br /&gt;
::c=materials constant
::d=particle diameter

Equation 3 indicates that melting point depression is less pronounced in covalent nanoparticles due to the quadratic nature of particle size dependence in the melting Equation.

==Proposed mechanisms==

The specific melting process for nanoparticles is currently unknown. The scientific community currently accepts several mechanisms as possible models of nanoparticle melting.&lt;ref name="Farrell"/&gt; Each of the corresponding models effectively match experimental data for melting of nanoparticles. Three of the four models detailed below derive the melting temperature in a similar form using different approaches based on classical thermodynamics.

===Liquid drop model===

The liquid drop model (LDM) assumes that an entire nanoparticle transitions from solid to liquid at a single temperature.&lt;ref name="Nanda"/&gt; This feature distinguishes the model, as the other models predict melting of the nanoparticle surface prior to the bulk atoms. If the LDM is true, a solid nanoparticle should function over a greater temperature range than other models predict. The LDM assumes that the surface atoms of a nanoparticle dominate the properties of all atoms in the particle. The cohesive energy of the particle is identical for all atoms in the nanoparticle.

The LDM represents the binding energy of a nanoparticles as function of the free energies of the volume and surface.&lt;ref name="Nanda"/&gt; Equation 4 gives the normalized, size dependent melting temperature of a material according to the liquid-drop model.

&lt;math&gt;T_M(d)=\frac{4T_{MB}}{H_fd}\left(\sigma\,_{sv}-\sigma\,_{lv}\left(\frac{\rho\,_s}{\rho\,_l}\right)^{2/3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where: σ&lt;sub&gt;sv&lt;/sub&gt;=solid-vapor interface energy&lt;br /&gt;
::σ&lt;sub&gt;lv&lt;/sub&gt;=liquid-vapor interface energy
::H&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;=Bulk heat of fusion
::ρ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;=density of solid
::ρ&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;=density of liquid
::d=diameter of nanoparticle

===Liquid shell nucleation model===

The '''liquid shell nucleation model''' (LSN) predicts that a surface layer of atoms melts prior to the bulk of the particle.&lt;ref name="Sakai"&gt;{{cite journal| author =H. Sakai | journal = Surf. Sci. | volume = 351 | page = 285 | year = 1996| title = Surface-induced melting of small particles | doi= 10.1016/0039-6028(95)01263-X |bibcode = 1996SurSc.351..285S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The melting temperature of a nanoparticle is a function of its radius of curvature according to the LSN. Large nanoparticles melt at greater temperatures as a result of their larger radius of curvature.

The model calculates melting conditions as a function of two competing order parameters using Landau potentials. One order parameter represents a solid nanoparticle, while the other represents the liquid phase. Each of the order parameters is a function of particle radius.

The parabolic [[Landau potential]]s for the liquid and solid phases are calculated at a given temperature, with the lesser Landau a potential assumed to be the equilibrium state at any point in the particle. In the temperature range of surface melting, the results show that the Landau curve of the ordered state is favored near the center of the particle while the Landau curve of the disordered state is smaller near the surface of the particle.

The Landau curves intersect at a specific radius from the center of the particle. The distinct intersection of the potentials means the LSN predicts a sharp, unmoving interface between the solid and liquid phases at a given temperature. The exact thickness of the liquid layer at a given temperature is the equilibrium point between the competing Landau potentials.

Equation 5 gives the condition at which an entire nanoparticle melts according to the LSN model.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C. Q. Sun |author2=Y. Wang |author3=B. K. Tay |author4=S. Li |author5=H. Huang |author6=Y. B. Zhang | journal = J. Phys. Chem. B | volume = 106 |issue=41 | page = 10701 |year = 2002| title = Correlation between the Melting Point of a Nanosolid and the Cohesive Energy of a Surface Atom | doi= 10.1021/jp025868l}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_M(d)=\frac{4T_{MB}}{H_fd}(\frac{\sigma\,_{sv}}{1-\frac{d_0}{d}}-\sigma\,_{lv}(1-\frac{\rho\,_s}{\rho\,_l}))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where: d&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=atomic diameter

===Liquid nucleation and growth model===

The '''liquid nucleation and growth model''' (LNG) treats nanoparticle melting as a surface initiated process.&lt;ref name="Size"&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Q. Sun | title = Size dependence of nanostructures: impact or bond order deficiency | url = http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ECQSun/rtf/PSSC-size.pdf| journal = Progress in solid state chemistry | volume =35 | pages = 1–159 |year =2007|doi= 10.1016/j.progsolidstchem.2006.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface melts initially, and the liquid-solid interface quickly advances through the entire nanoparticle. The LNG defines melting conditions through the Gibbs-Duhem relations, yielding a melting temperature function dependent on the interfacial energies between the solid and liquid phases, volumes and surface areas of each phase, and size of the nanoparticle. The model calculations show that the liquid phase forms at lower temperatures for smaller nanoparticles. Once the liquid phase forms, the free energy conditions quickly change and favor melting. Equation 6 gives the melting conditions for a spherical nanoparticle according to the LNG model.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_M(d)=\frac{2T_{MB}}{H_fd}(\sigma\,_{sl}-\sigma\,_{lv}3(\sigma\,_{sv}-\sigma\,_{lv}\frac{\rho\,_s}{\rho\,_l}))&lt;/math&gt;

===Bond-order-length-strength (BOLS) model===

The '''bond-order-length-strength''' (BOLS) model employs an atomistic approach to explain melting point depression.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; The model focuses on the cohesive energy of individual atoms rather than a classical thermodynamic approach. The BOLS model calculates the melting temperature for individual atoms from the sum of their cohesive bonds. As a result, the BOLS predicts the surface layers of a nanoparticle melt at lower temperatures than the bulk of the nanoparticle.

The BOLS mechanism states that if one bond breaks the remaining neighbouring ones become shorter and stronger. The cohesive energy, or the sum of bond energy, of the less coordinated atoms determines the thermal stability including melting, evaporating and other phase transition. The lowered CN changes the equilibrium bond length between atoms near the surface of the nanoparticle. The bonds relax towards equilibrium lengths, increasing the cohesive energy per bond between atoms, independent of the exact form of the specific [[interatomic potential]]. However, the integrated cohesive energy for surface atoms is much lower than bulk atoms due to the reduced coordination number and overall decrease in cohesive energy.

Using a core–shell configuration, the melting point depression of nanoparticles is dominated by the outermost two atomic layers yet atoms in the core interior remain their bulk nature.

The BOLS model and the core–shell structure have been applied to other size dependency of nanostructures such as the mechanical strength, chemical and thermal stability, lattice dynamics (optical and acoustic phonons), Photon emission and absorption, electronic colevel shift and [[work function]] modulation, magnetism at various temperatures, and dielectrics due to electron polarization etc. Reproduction of experimental observations in the above-mentioned size dependency has been realized. Quantitative information such as the energy level of an isolated atom and the vibration frequency of individual dimer has been obtained by matching the BOLS predictions to the measured size dependency.&lt;ref name="Size"/&gt;

==Particle shape==

Nanoparticle shape impacts the melting point of a nanoparticle. Facets, edges and deviations from a perfect sphere all change the magnitude of melting point depression.&lt;ref name="Nanda"/&gt; These shape changes affect the surface to volume ratio, which affects the cohesive energy and thermal properties of a nanostructure. Equation 7 gives a general shape corrected formula for the theoretical melting point of a nanoparticle based on its size and shape.&lt;ref name="Nanda"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_M(d)=T_{MB}(1-\frac{c}{zd})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where: c=materials constant&lt;br /&gt;
::z=shape parameter of particle

The shape parameter is 1 for sphere and 3/2 for a very long wire, indicating that melting-point depression is suppressed in nanowires compared to nanoparticles. Past experimental data show that nanoscale tin platelets melt within a narrow range of 10 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C of the bulk melting temperature.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; The melting point depression of these platelets was suppressed compared to spherical tin nanoparticles.&lt;ref name="Lai"/&gt;

==Substrate==

Several nanoparticle melting simulations theorize that the supporting substrate affects the extent of melting-point depression of a nanoparticle.&lt;ref name="Jiang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Couchman"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P. R. Couchman  |author2=W. A. Jesser  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Nature | volume = 269 | page = 481 | year = 1977| title =Thermodynamic theory of size dependence of melting temperature in metals | doi= 10.1038/269481a0 | issue=5628|bibcode = 1977Natur.269..481C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These models account for energetic interactions between the substrate materials. A free nanoparticle, as many theoretical models assume, has a different melting temperature (usually lower) than a supported particle due to the absence cohesive energy between the nanoparticle and substrate. However, measurement of the properties of a freestanding nanoparticle remains impossible, so the extent of the interactions cannot be verified through experiment. Ultimately, substrates currently support nanoparticles for all nanoparticle applications, so substrate/nanoparticle interactions are always present and must impact melting point depression.

==Solubility==

Within the size–pressure approximation, which considers the stress induced by the surface tension and the curvature of the particle, it was shown that the size of the particle affects the composition and temperature of a eutectic point (Fe-C&lt;ref name="Jiang"/&gt;) the solubility of C in Fe&lt;ref name="Harutyunyan"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R.

Reduced solubility can affect the catalytic properties of nanoparticles. In fact it has been shown that size-induced instability of Fe-C mixtures represents the thermodynamic limit for the thinnest nanotube that can be grown from Fe nanocatalysts.&lt;ref name="Harutyunyan"/&gt;

Like ESR, μSR is useful for the analysis of chemical transformations and the structure of compounds with novel or potentially valuable electronic properties. Muonium is usually studied by [[muon spin rotation]], in which the Mu atom's spin precesses in a [[magnetic field]] applied transverse to the muon spin direction (since muons are typically produced in a [[Spin polarization|spin-polarized]] state from the decay of [[pion]]s), and by [[Avoided crossing|avoided level crossing]] (ALC), which is also called [[Resonance|level crossing resonance]] (LCR).&lt;ref name="Brewer" /&gt;  The latter employs a magnetic field applied longitudinally to the polarization direction, and monitors the relaxation of muon spins caused by "flip/flop" transitions with other magnetic nuclei.

Because the muon is a [[lepton]], the atomic energy levels of muonium can be calculated with great precision from [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), unlike in the case of hydrogen, where the precision is limited by uncertainties related to the internal structure of the [[proton]].  For this reason, muonium is an ideal system for studying bound-state QED and also for searching for physics beyond the [[standard model]].&lt;ref name="Jungmann"&gt;

== Nomenclature ==

Normally in the nomenclature of particle physics, an atom composed of a positively charged particle bound to an electron is named after the positive particle with "-ium" appended, in this case "muium".  The suffix "-onium" is mostly used for [[bound state]]s of a particle with its own antiparticle.  The exotic atom consisting of a muon and an antimuon is known as "[[true muonium]]".  It is yet to be observed, but it may have been generated in the collision of electron and positron beams.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''My Life in Dog Years''''' is a non-fiction book for children written by the American author [[Gary Paulsen]], together with his wife, Ruth Wright Paulsen. It was published first by Delacorte Press in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Blasingame, James. Gary Paulsen. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-313-33532-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains a chapter about each different dog in his life. As he goes through each chapter, he delves into the personality of each dog as companions and not just animals.

It begins with Cookie, a dog which rescued him from a fall through the ice while dog sled racing he Cookie was helped by the other sled dogs gary had. This was ironic since the dog was sick before. How would he have saved him? It next considers Snowball, a dog he owned in the Philippines at age 7 (his first) who was killed in a military truck accident. It then discusses Ike, dog that became attached to him during a hunting trip. Ike continues to accompany him for about a year, but then disappears. Paulsen later discovers that Ike's owner had to leave him when he went to the war. When he returned with an injury, Ike returned to him.
 
Dirk, next, is a dog that adopted him during his adolescence, and served as a protector during a difficult period. While working on a farm, he met Rex, a rough collie, whom he considered one of the smartest dogs he ever knew after observing his activities for a day. He later adopted an exceptionally large Great Dane, Caesar (pronounced See-Zer) who was easily excited, but a gentle giant that loved hot dogs.

The author later became a dog sled racer.&lt;ref&gt;Deveraux, Elizabeth. "Gary Paulsen: A Taste for Adventure and an Obsessive Work Ethic Are This Versatile Writer's Hallmarks." ''Publishers Weekly'' 241, 13 (March 28, 1994): 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchholz, Rachel. "My Life's Work: Author." Boys' Life 85, 12 (December 1995): 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, he traded one of his best dogs for Quincy, who was later to save his wife from a bear despite being only nine inches tall. The last chapter is about his current dog at the time, Josh. It is clear that Josh is one of the author's favorite dogs, as he has the most to write about him. At the time the book was written, Josh was about 20 years old.  Josh was known as the smartest dog in the world.

[[Image:US nuclear weapons yield-to-weight comparison.svg|right|thumb|350px|[[Log–log plot]] comparing the yield (in kilotons) and mass (in kilograms) of various nuclear weapons developed by the United States.]]&lt;!--The file is supposed to have ALL nuclear weapons developed by the US, but it contains only about 60 whereas the data file on which it is supposedly based gives these data for 83. In total that data file has 113 weapons, but for 30 of them it doesn't give the weight and yield.--&gt;

The explosive '''yield of a nuclear weapon''' is the amount of [[energy]] released when that particular [[nuclear weapon]] [[Effects of nuclear explosions|is detonated]], usually expressed as a [[TNT equivalent]] (the standardized equivalent [[mass]] of [[trinitrotoluene]] which, if detonated, would produce the same energy discharge), either in kilotons (kt—thousands of tons of TNT), in megatons (Mt—millions of tons of TNT), or sometimes in [[terajoule]]s (TJ).  An explosive yield of one terajoule is 0.239 kt of TNT. Because the accuracy of any measurement of the energy released by TNT has always been problematic, the conventional definition is that one kiloton of TNT is held simply to be equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[calorie]]s.

The yield-to-weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The practical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons ([[thermonuclear weapon]]s) has been estimated to six megatons of TNT per metric ton of bomb mass (25&amp;nbsp;TJ/kg). Yields of 5.2 megatons/ton and higher have been reported for large weapons constructed for single-warhead use in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/B41.html The B-41 Bomb]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the smaller warheads needed to achieve the increased net damage efficiency (bomb damage/bomb mass) of [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|multiple warhead systems]] have resulted in decreases in the yield/mass ratio for single modern warheads.

As a comparison, the blast yield of the [[GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]] is 0.011&amp;nbsp;kt, and that of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], using a truck-based fertilizer bomb, was 0.002&amp;nbsp;kt. Most [[List of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions|artificial non-nuclear explosions]] are considerably smaller than even what are considered to be very small nuclear weapons.

===Yield limits===
The yield-to-weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. According to nuclear-weapons designer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]], the practical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons is about 6 megatons of TNT per metric ton (25&amp;nbsp;TJ/kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/B41.html|title=The B-41 (Mk-41) Bomb|author=Carey Sublette}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2017}} The "Taylor limit" is not derived from [[first principles]], and weapons with yields as high as 9.5 megatons per metric ton have been theorized. &lt;ref name="Cozzani"&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.ieri.be/fr/publications/ierinews/2011/juillet/fission-fusion-and-staging|title=FISSION, FUSION AND STAGING: A bird's view at the core concepts of nuclear weapon design and the curious ideas about it|author=Franco Cozzani|date=July 26, 2011|publisher=[[IERI]]|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest achieved values are somewhat lower, and the value tends to be lower for smaller, lighter weapons, of the sort that are emphasized in today's arsenals, designed for efficient MIRV use, or delivery by cruise missile systems.

*The 25 Mt yield option reported for the [[B41 nuclear bomb|B41]] would give it a yield-to-weight ratio of 5.1 megatons of TNT per metric ton. While this would require a far greater efficiency than any other current U.S. weapon (at least 40% efficiency in a fusion fuel of lithium deuteride), this was apparently attainable, probably by the use of higher than normal [[isotopes of lithium|Lithium-6]] enrichment in the [[lithium deuteride]] fusion fuel. This results in the [[B41 nuclear bomb|B41]] still retaining the record for the highest [[Power density|yield-to-weight]] weapon ever designed.&lt;ref name="Cozzani" /&gt;

*The [[W56]] demonstrated a yield-to-weight ratio of 4.96 kt per kg of device mass, and very close to the predicted 5.1 kt/kg achievable in the highest yield to weight weapon ever built, the 25 megaton B41. Unlike the B41, which was never proof tested at full yield, the W56 demonstrated its efficiency in the XW-56X2 Bluestone shot of [[Operation Dominic]] in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Dominic.html&lt;/ref&gt; thus, from information available in the public domain, the W56 may hold the distinction of demonstrating the highest efficiency in a nuclear weapon to date.
*In 1963 DOE declassified statements that the U.S. had the technological capability of deploying a 35&amp;nbsp;Mt warhead on the Titan II, or a 50-60&amp;nbsp;Mt gravity bomb on B-52s. Neither weapon was pursued, but either would require yield-to-weight ratios superior to a 25&amp;nbsp;Mt Mk-41. This may have been achievable by utilizing the same design as the [[B41 nuclear bomb|B41]] but with the addition of a [[U-235|HEU]] tamper{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, in place of the cheaper but lower [[energy density]] [[Uranium-238|U-238]] tamper which is the most commonly used tamper material in [[Teller-Ulam]] thermonuclear weapons.
*For current smaller US weapons, yield is 600 to 2200 kilotons of TNT per metric ton. By comparison, for the very small tactical devices such as the Davy Crockett it was 0.4 to 40 kilotons of TNT per metric ton. For historical comparison, for Little Boy the yield was only 4 kilotons of TNT per metric ton, and for the largest [[Tsar Bomba]], the yield was 2 megatons of TNT per metric ton (deliberately reduced from about twice as much yield for the same weapon, so there is little doubt that this bomb as designed was capable of 4 megatons per ton yield).
*The largest '''pure-fission''' bomb ever constructed, [[Ivy King]], had a 500 kiloton yield,&lt;ref name=nwa-bomb-list&gt;{{cite web |title=Complete List of All U.S. Nuclear Weapons |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html#MK-18 |website=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org |accessdate=August 29, 2014 |date=October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is probably in the range of the upper limit on such designs.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Fusion boosting could likely raise the efficiency of such a weapon significantly, but eventually all fission-based weapons have an upper yield limit due to the difficulties of dealing with large critical masses. (The UK's [[Orange Herald]] was a very large boosted fission bomb, with a yield of 750 kilotons.) However, there is no known upper yield limit for a fusion bomb.

Large single warheads are seldom a part of today's arsenals, since smaller [[MIRV]] warheads, spread out over a pancake-shaped destructive area, are far more destructive for a given total yield, or unit of payload mass. This effect results from the fact that destructive power of a single warhead on land scales approximately only as the cube root of its yield, due to blast "wasted" over a roughly hemispherical blast volume while the strategic target is distributed over a circular land area with limited height and depth. This effect more than makes up for the lessened yield/mass efficiency encountered if ballistic missile warheads are individually scaled down from the maximal size that could be carried by a single-warhead missile.

==Calculating yields and controversy==
{{see also|Fermi problem}}
Yields of [[nuclear explosion]]s can be very hard to calculate, even using numbers as rough as in the kiloton or megaton range (much less down to the resolution of individual [[terajoule]]s). Even under very controlled conditions, precise yields can be very hard to determine, and for less controlled conditions the margins of error can be quite large. For fission devices, the most precise yield value is found from "[[radiochemistry|radiochemical]]/Fallout analysis"; that is, measuring the quantity of [[fission product]]s generated, in much the same way as the [[chemical yield]] in chemical reaction products can be measured after a [[chemical reaction]]. The radiochemical analysis method was pioneered by [[Herbert L. Anderson]].

[[Enrico Fermi]] famously made a (very) rough calculation of the yield of the [[Trinity test]] by dropping small pieces of paper in the air and measuring how far they were moved by the [[blast wave]] of the explosion; that is, he found the [[Overpressure|blast pressure]] at his distance from the detonation in [[pounds per square inch]], using the deviation of the papers' fall away from the vertical as a crude [[barograph|blast gauge/barograph]], and then with pressure ''X'' in psi, at distance ''Y'', in miles figures, he extrapolated backwards to estimate the yield of the Trinity device, which he found was about 10 [[kiloton]] of blast energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abqjournal.com/trinity/trinity1.htm Article featuring Jack Aeby talking about his photograph]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=674–677}}

Fermi later recalled that:{{quote|I was stationed at the Base Camp at Trinity in a position about ten miles[16 km] from the site of the explosion...About 40 seconds after the explosion the air blast reached me. I tried to estimate its strength by dropping from about six feet small pieces of paper before, during, and after the passage of the blast wave. Since, at the time, there was no wind I could observe very distinctly and actually measure the displacement of the pieces of paper that were in the process of falling while the blast was passing. The shift was about 2 1/2 meters, which, at the time, I estimated to correspond to the blast that would be produced by ten thousand tons of T.N.T.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130302233056/http://www2.vo.lu/homepages/geko/atom/report.htm My Observations During the Explosion at Trinity on July 16, 1945 E. Fermi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dannen.com/decision/fermi.html |title=Trinity Test, July 16, 1945, Eyewitness Accounts - Enrico Fermi |accessdate=November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weapons-2-2005&gt;{{cite web|title=Eyewitnesses to Trinity|url=http://www.lanl.gov/science/weapons_journal/wj_pubs/11nwj2-05.pdf|website=Nuclear Weapons Journal, Issue 2 2005|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=18 February 2014|page=45|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[surface area]] (A) and volume (V) of a sphere are:
&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

The blast wave however was likely assumed to grow out as the surface area of the approximately hemispheric near [[surface burst]] blast wave of the Trinity gadget.
The paper is moved 2.5 meters by the wave - so the effect of the Trinity device is to displace a hemispherical shell of air of volume 2.5&amp;nbsp;m &amp;times; 2&amp;pi;(14&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Multiply by 1&amp;nbsp;atm to get energy of {{val|3|e=14|u=J}} ~ 80 kT TN.{{quantify|date=May 2015}}

[[Image:Trinity Test Fireball 25ms.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Picture of the blast, captured by [[Berlyn Brixner]] were used by G.I. Taylor to estimate the yield of the device during the [[Trinity test]]]]

A good approximation of the yield of the Trinity test device was obtained in 1950 from simple [[dimensional analysis]] as well as an estimation of the heat capacity for very hot air, by the British physicist [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I. Taylor]]. Taylor had initially done this highly classified work in mid-1941, and published a paper which included an analysis of the Trinity data fireball when the Trinity photograph data was declassified in 1950 (after the USSR had exploded its own version of this bomb).

Taylor noted that the [[radius]] ''R'' of the blast should initially depend only on the energy ''E'' of the explosion, the time ''t'' after the detonation, and the density ρ of the air. [[Buckingham π theorem|The only equation]] having compatible dimensions that can be constructed from these quantities is:

&lt;math&gt;R=S\left( {\frac{{E{t}}^{2}}{\rho}} \right)^{\frac {1} {5}}&lt;/math&gt;

Here S is a dimensionless constant having a value approximately equal to 1, since it is low order function of the [[heat capacity ratio]] or adiabatic index 

&lt;math&gt;\gamma={C_P\over C_V}&lt;/math&gt;

which is approximately 1 for all conditions.

Using the picture of the Trinity test shown here (which had been publicly released by the U.S. government and published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine), using successive frames of the explosion, Taylor found that R&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a constant in a given nuclear blast (especially between 0.38 ms after the shock wave has formed, and 1.93 ms before significant energy is lost by thermal radiation). Furthermore, he estimated a value for S numerically at 1.

Thus, with ''t'' = 0.025 s and the blast radius was 140 metres, and taking ''ρ'' to be 1&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (the measured value at Trinity on the day of the test, as opposed to sea level values of approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and solving for ''E'', Taylor obtained that the yield was about 22 kilotons of TNT (90&amp;nbsp;TJ). This does not take into account the fact that the energy should only be about half this value for a hemispherical blast, but this very simple argument did agree to within 10% with the official value of the bomb's yield in 1950, which was {{convert|20|ktonTNT}} (See G. I. Taylor, ''Proc. Roy. Soc. London A'' '''200''', pp.&amp;nbsp;235–247 (1950).)

A good approximation to Taylor's constant S for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; below about 2 is:

&lt;math&gt;S=\Biggl({75(\gamma-1)\over\ 8\pi}\Biggr)^{\frac{1}{5}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://glasstone.blogspot.com/2006/03/analytical-mathematics-for-physical.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the [[heat capacity ratio]] here is between the 1.67 of fully dissociated air molecules and the lower value for very hot diatomic air (1.2), and under conditions of an atomic fireball is (coincidentally) close to the S.T.P. (standard) gamma for room temperature air, which is 1.4. This gives the value of Taylor's '''S''' constant to be 1.036 for the adiabatic hypershock region where the constant R&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; condition holds.

As it relates to fundamental dimensional analysis, if one expresses all the variables in terms of mass, M, length, L, and time, T :&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140701221514/http://applet-magic.com/fireball.htm San José State University ''The Expansion of the Fireball of an Explosion'' Thayer Watkins]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E=[{M}.{L^2}.{T^{-2}}]&lt;/math&gt;

(think of the expression for kinetic energy, &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{mv^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\rho=[{M}\cdot{L^{-3}}]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t=[T]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r=[L]&lt;/math&gt;

and then derive an expression for, say, E, in terms of the other variables, by finding values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in the general relation

&lt;math&gt;E={\rho^\alpha}\cdot{t^\beta}\cdot{r^\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

such that the left- and right-hand sides are dimensionally balanced in terms of M, L, and T (i.e., each dimension has the same exponent on both sides).

===Other methods and controversy===
Where these data are not available, as in a number of cases, precise yields have been in dispute, especially when they are tied to questions of politics. The weapons used in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], for example, were highly individual and very idiosyncratic designs, and gauging their yield retrospectively has been quite difficult. The Hiroshima bomb, "[[Little Boy]]", is estimated to have been between {{convert|12|and|18|ktTNT}} (a 20% margin of error), while the Nagasaki bomb, "[[Fat Man]]", is estimated to be between {{convert|18|and|23|ktTNT}} (a 10% margin of error). Such apparently small changes in values can be important when trying to use the data from these bombings as reflective of how other bombs would behave in combat, and also result in differing assessments of how many "Hiroshima bombs" other weapons are equivalent to (for example, the [[Ivy Mike]] hydrogen bomb was equivalent to either 867 or 578 Hiroshima weapons — a rhetorically quite substantial difference — depending on whether one uses the high or low figure for the calculation). Other disputed yields have included the massive [[Tsar Bomba]], whose yield was claimed between being "only" {{convert|50|MtTNT}} or at a maximum of {{convert|57|MtTNT}} by differing political figures, either as a way for hyping the power of the bomb or as an attempt to undercut it.

{{distinguish|text=the [[p-value|''p''-value]]}}

'''P-factor''', also known as asymmetric blade effect and asymmetric disc effect, is an [[aerodynamic]] phenomenon experienced by a moving [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]],&lt;ref name="Jepperson3-49"&gt;(Willits 3-49)&lt;/ref&gt; that is responsible for the asymmetrical relocation of the propeller's center of [[thrust]] when an aircraft is at a high [[angle of attack]]. This shift in the location of the center of thrust will exert a yawing moment on the aircraft, causing it to [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] slightly to one side. A rudder input is required to counteract the yawing tendency.

== Causes ==
When an aircraft is in straight and level flight at cruise speed, the propeller disc is perpendicular to the relative airflow. Each of the propeller blades will contact the air at the same angle and speed and thus the thrust produced is evenly centered across the propeller. As the aircraft's angle of attack increases and the propeller disc rotates toward the horizontal, the airflow will meet the propeller disc at an increasing angle. The propeller blades moving down and forward (for clockwise rotation, from the one o'clock to the six o'clock position when viewed from the front) will have a greater relative wind angle of attack and therefore will produce greater thrust, while propeller blades moving up and back (from the seven o'clock through 12 o'clock position) will have a decreased relative wind angle of attack and therefore decreased thrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stowell|first=Rich|title=Emergency Maneuver Training|year=1996|publisher=Rich Stowell Consulting|isbn=1-879425-92-0|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This asymmetry displaces the center of thrust of the propeller disc towards the blade with increased thrust. In an aircraft with two or more propeller engines, P-Factor is what determines which engine is the [[critical engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Airplane Flying Handbook FAA-H-8083-3|year=1999|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|pages=14-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tilted propeller.png|thumb|Change of forces at increasing Angle of Attack|thumb|P-factor, change of relative speed and thrust of up- and down going propeller blades at increasing angle of attack]]

P-Factor is sometimes erroneously explained with the word "bite", as in "the descending blade has a bigger bite, or angle of attack, than the ascending blade". This faulty explanation does not take into account the forward motion of the blades as aircraft's angle of attack increases. In order to better understand this concept, imagine a propeller aircraft moving forward with a 90° angle of attack (vertical). This situation is identical to what a helicopter experiences, but a helicopter can reduce or increase the angle of attack of individual blades of the rotor (decreasing the angle of attack on the advancing blade, while increasing the angle of attack on the retreating blade) in order to keep the lift of the rotor disc balanced. Because the force of the air on the blades moving forwards through the arc is greater, they will produce more thrust than the blades that move backwards. If the blades of the rotor were unable to independently change their angle of attack there would be a constant backwards rolling motion due to the increased lift on the side of the rotor disc with the advancing blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rotorcraft Flying Handbook|year=2000|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|isbn=1-56027-404-2|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a fixed-wing aircraft, there is usually no way to adjust the angle of attack of the individual blades of the propellers, therefore the pilot must contend with P-Factor and use the rudder to counteract the shift of thrust.

== Effects ==
'''Single engine propeller aircraft'''

(As viewed by the pilot), the aircraft has a tendency to yaw to the left if using a clockwise turning propeller (right hand), and to the right with a counter-clockwise turning propeller (left hand). The clockwise turning propeller is by far the most common. The effect is most noticeable during the climb phase after take off&lt;ref name="Ramskill"&gt;(Ramskill)&lt;/ref&gt; and in flight conditions with high power and high angle of attack.&lt;ref name="Jepperson3-49"/&gt;

'''Multi engine propeller aircraft (clockwise rotation)'''

As with single engined aircraft, situations where the aircraft is at high power and has a high angle of attack (such as take off) will cause a slight, but noticeable yawing motion. The engine with the down-moving blades towards the wingtip produces more yaw and roll than the other engine, because the moment (arm) of that engine's thrust about the aircraft center of gravity is greater.  Thus, the engine with down-moving blades towards the fuselage will be "[[critical engine|critical]]", because its failure and the associated reliance on the other engine will require a larger rudder deflection by the pilot to maintain straight flight than if the other engine had failed. For most aircraft (which have clockwise rotating propellers), this is the left engine.

With engines rotating in the same direction the P-factor will affect [[V speeds#vmc|V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;]]'s, the [[minimum control speeds]] of the aircraft in asymmetric powered flight. The published V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;'s are determined while the critical engine is inoperative. The actual V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;'s after failure of any other engine is lower, safer, provided the pilot is aware of the limitations that apply with [[minimum control speeds]].
[[File:criticalengine1.jpg|frame|none|Fig. 1. The operating right-hand engine will produce a more severe yawing moment towards the dead engine, thus making the failure of the left-hand engine critical]]

At low speed flight with the left engine failed, the off-centre thrust produced by the right engine creates a larger yawing moment to left than the opposite case. The left engine in this scenario is the [[critical engine]], namely the engine whose failure brings about the more adverse result. In the case of using [[Counter-rotating propellers|counter-rotating engines]] (i.e., not rotating in the same direction) the P-factor is not considered in determining the critical engine (the engines are equally critical).

The asymmetric blade effect is dependent on thrust, and is proportional to forward velocity (specifically CAS) and, while generally insignificant during the initial ground roll for tail-wheel aircraft, will give a pronounced nose-left tendency during the later stages of the ground roll, particularly if the thrust axis is kept inclined to the flight path vector (i.e. tail-wheel in contact with runway). If a high angle of attack is used during the rotation (or indeed straight and level flight with high power and high angle of attack), then the effect can also be apparent. The effect is not so apparent during the landing, flare and rollout, given the relatively low power setting (propeller RPM). However, should the throttle be suddenly advanced with the tail-wheel in contact with the runway, then anticipation of this nose-left tendency is prudent.

The '''Petroleum Act 1998''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].


==Provisions==
===Part I Petroleum (sections 1 to 9)===
Section 4 has further clauses on licence provisions.&lt;ref name=1998c17s4 /&gt; Section 50 of the [[Infrastructure Act 2015]] appended this section. It defines 'associated [[hydraulic fracturing]]' as more than 1,000 cubic metres of fluid per stage, or more than 10,000 cubic metres of fluid in total. In addition, conditions were attached that mean no fracking can take place at a depth shallower than 1,000 meters, and that soil and air monitoring must be put in place. The regulations state that "The associated hydraulic fracturing will not take place within protected [[groundwater]] source areas".&lt;ref name=2015c7s50 /&gt; 'Protected groundwater source area' does not appear to be defined.&lt;ref name=dentons/&gt;

'''Potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate''', also known as '''Rochelle salt''', is a [[double salt]] of [[tartaric acid]] first prepared (in about 1675) by an [[pharmacy|apothecary]], [[Pierre Seignette]], of [[La Rochelle]], [[France]]. Potassium sodium [[tartaric acid|tartrate]] and [[monopotassium phosphate]] were the first materials discovered to exhibit [[piezoelectricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ferroelectricity: The Foundation of a Field from Form to Function |first=R.E. |last=Newnham  |author2=Cross, L. Eric |journal=MRS Bulletin |volume=30 |date=November 2005 |pages=845–846 |doi=10.1557/mrs2005.272}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property led to its extensive use in "crystal" [[Phonograph|gramophone]] (phono) pick-ups, microphones and earpieces during the post-World War II consumer electronics boom of the mid-20th Century. Such [[transducer]]s had an exceptionally high output with typical pick-up cartridge outputs as much as 2 volts or more. Rochelle salt is [[deliquescent]] so any transducers based on the material deteriorated if stored in damp conditions.

It has been used medicinally as a [[laxative]]. It has also been used in the process of [[silvering]] mirrors. It is an ingredient of [[Fehling's solution]] (reagent for reducing sugars). It is used in [[electroplating]], in [[electronics]] and [[piezoelectricity]], and as a [[combustion accelerator]] in [[cigarette paper]] (similar to an [[oxidizer]] in [[pyrotechnics]]).&lt;ref name="ullmann" /&gt;

In organic synthesis, it is used in aqueous workups to break up [[emulsion]]s, particularly for reactions in which an aluminium-based [[hydride]] [[reagent]] was used.&lt;ref&gt;Fieser, L. F.; Fieser, M., ''Reagents for Organic Synthesis''; Vol.1; Wiley: New York; 1967, p. 983&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium Potassium tartrate is also important in the food industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://tartaric.com/rochelle-salt/| title = Rochelle Salt applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common precipitant in [[protein crystallography]] and is also an ingredient in the [[Biuret reagent]] which is used to measure [[protein]] concentration. This ingredient maintains [[cupric]] ions in solution at an alkaline pH.

==Preparation==
[[Image:Rochellesalt.jpg|thumb|left|Large Rochelle salt crystal grown aboard [[Skylab]]]]

The starting material is [[cream of tartar|tartar]] with a minimum [[tartaric acid]] content 68 %. This is first dissolved in water or in the [[mother liquor]] of a previous batch. It is then saponified with hot [[caustic soda]] to pH 8, decolorized with [[activated charcoal]], and chemically purified before being filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to 42 [[Baumé scale|°Bé]] at 100 °C, and passed to granulators in which Seignette's salt crystallizes on slow cooling. The salt is separated from the mother liquor by centrifugation, accompanied by washing of the granules, and is dried in a rotary furnace and sieved before packaging. Commercially marketed grain sizes range from 2000 μm to &lt; 250 μm (powder).&lt;ref name="ullmann" /&gt;

Larger crystals of Rochelle salt have been grown under conditions of reduced gravity and convection on board [[Skylab]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://history.nasa.gov/SP-401/ch16.htm| title = SP-401 Skylab, Classroom in Space| accessdate = 2009-06-06| publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piezoelectricity==

In 1824, Sir David Brewster demonstrated [[piezoelectric]] effects using Rochelle salts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.ist.utl.pt/rschwarz/rschwarzgroup_files/Ferroelectrics_files/A%20Short%20History%20of%20Ferroelectricity.pdf|title=A Short History of Ferroelectricity |publisher=Talari.com |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to him naming the effect [[pyroelectricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dkQEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA208| pages = 208–215 | first = David | last = Brewster | title = Observations of the pyro-electricity of minerals |journal = The Edinburgh Journal of Science | volume = 1 | year =  1824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:12 04 2003 repo.jpg|thumb|Pulk or ahkio pulled by a skier]]
A '''pulk''' (from [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''pulkka'')&lt;ref&gt;Called ''pulka'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''pulk'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], ''bulki'' in [[Northern Sami language|Northern Sami]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] short, low-slung small [[toboggan]] used in sport or for transport, pulled by a [[dog]] or a [[skiing|skier]], or in [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]] pulled by [[reindeer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/reindeer/Reindeer/reindeer_main.html The Sámi and their reindeer] – University of Texas at Austin&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sled can be used to carry supplies such as a [[tent]] or food, or transport a child or other person. In [[Norway]], pulks are often used by families with small children on skiing trips (small children being pulled by the parents). In [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]], pulks are often used, mostly by children, as a winter toy for going downhill. Pulks are nowadays made of plastic, which makes them inexpensive.

A larger pulk, designed for transporting larger amounts of goods, is called ''ahkio'' {{IPA|[ɑhkio]}} in Finnish. This word is also used by the US Army for a human-drawn snow sled.

A [[supersonic]] [[airfoil]] is a cross-section geometry designed to generate [[Lift (force)|lift]] efficiently at supersonic speeds. The need for such a design arises when an aircraft is required to operate consistently in the supersonic flight regime.

[[Supersonic]] airfoils generally have a thin section formed of either angled planes or opposed arcs (called "double wedge airfoils" and "biconvex airfoils" respectively), with very sharp leading and trailing edges. The sharp edges prevent the formation of a detached bow shock in front of the airfoil as it moves through the air.&lt;ref name=Courant&gt;Courant &amp; Friedrichs. ''Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves''. Pages 357:366. Vol I.New York: Inter science Publishers, inc, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; This shape is in contrast to [[Subsonic flight|subsonic]] airfoils, which often have rounded leading edges to reduce [[flow separation]] over a wide range of [[angle of attack]].&lt;ref&gt;Zucker, Robert &amp; Biblarz, Oscar. ''Fundamentals of Gas Dynamics'', pages 226:229. Second Edition.{{ISBN|0-471-05967-6}} John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A rounded edge would behave as a blunt body in supersonic flight and thus would form a bow shock, which greatly increases [[wave drag]]. The airfoils' thickness, camber, and angle of attack are varied to achieve a design that will cause a slight deviation in the direction of the surrounding airflow.&lt;ref name=Bertin&gt;Bertin, John &amp; Smith, Michael. ''Aerodynamics for Engineers''. Third Edition. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-576356-8}}. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since a round leading edge decreases an airfoil's susceptibility to flow separation, a sharp leading edge implies that the airfoil will be more sensitive to changes in angle of attack. Therefore, to increase lift at lower speeds, aircraft that employ supersonic airfoils also use [[high-lift device]]s such as leading edge and trailing edge flaps.

==Lift and drag==
At [[supersonic]] conditions, [[aircraft]] [[Drag (physics)|drag]] is originated due to:
* Skin-friction drag due to [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]]
* The [[wave drag]] due to the thickness (or volume) or zero-lift wave drag
* Drag due to lift
Therefore, the Drag coefficient on a supersonic airfoil is described by the following expression:

'''C'''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'''=''' '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;D,friction&lt;/sub&gt;'''+''' '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;D,thickness&lt;/sub&gt;'''+''' '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;D,lift&lt;/sub&gt;

Experimental data allow us to reduce this expression to:

'''C'''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'''=''' '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;D,O&lt;/sub&gt; '''+''' '''KC'''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
Where '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;DO&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;(D,friction&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''C'''&lt;sub&gt; D,thickness&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''k''' for supersonic flow is a function of the Mach number.&lt;ref name=Bertin/&gt; The skin-friction component is derived from the presence of a [[viscous]] boundary layer which is infinitely close to the surface of the [[aircraft]] body. At the boundary wall, the normal component of [[velocity]] is zero; therefore an [[infinitesimal]] area exists where there is no [[slip (aerodynamic)|slip]]. The zero-lift [[wave drag]] component can be obtained based on the [[supersonic]] area rule which tells us that the wave-drag of an [[aircraft]] in a [[steady state|steady]] [[supersonic]] flow is identical to the [[average]] of a series of equivalent bodies of revolution. The bodies of revolution are defined by the cuts through the [[aircraft]] made by the [[tangent]] to the fore [[Mach number|Mach]] cone from a distant point of the aircraft at an azimuthal angle. This average is over all [[azimuthal]] angles.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhull, John. "Supersonic Aerodynamics: Lift and Drag". University of Colorado. ''Paper presented at the RTO AVT course on Fluid Dynamics Research on Supersonic Aircraft''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Drag (physics)|drag]] due-to lift component is calculated using lift-analysis programs.  The [[wing]] design and the lift-analysis programs are separate lifting-surfaces methods that solve the direct or inverse problem of design and lift analysis.

==Supersonic wing design==
Years of research and experience with the unusual conditions of [[supersonic]] [[fluid dynamics|flow]] have led to some interesting conclusions about airfoil design. Considering a rectangular wing, the pressure at a point P with coordinates (x,y) on the wing is defined only by the [[pressure]] disturbances originated at points within the upstream Mach cone emanating from point P.&lt;ref name=Bertin/&gt; As result, the wing tips modify the flow within their own rearward Mach cones. The remaining area of the wing does not suffer any modification by the tips and can be analyzed with two-dimensional theory. For an arbitrary [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]] the supersonic [[leading]] and [[wikt:trailing|trailing]] are those portions of the wing edge where the components of the [[freestream]] velocity normal to the edge are supersonic. Similarly the [[Subsonic flight|subsonic]] leading and trailing are those portions of the wing edge where the components of the free stream velocity normal to the edge are subsonic.

[[Delta wings]] have supersonic leading and trailing edges; in contrast arrow wings have a subsonic leading edge and a supersonic trailing edge.

'''T.E.D.D.''' (Tornado Electrical Discharge Detection) is a public project to gather and publish [[Radio frequency|RF (Radio Frequency)]] signals produced by tornadoes to help create additional warning and research instrumentation.

==Theory==
T.E.D.D. is based on the theory that all [[tornado]]es, strong or weak, create a RF (Radio Frequency) footprint or "signature". These RF signatures are believed to be created during the formation and life cycle of a tornado, due to tiny and mass amounts of electrical discharges taking place within the funnel.

Although the exact origin of RF emissions from a tornado remains uncertain, there are several credible scientific sources and publications citing evidence of their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John R. Leeman|author2=E.D. Schmitter|title=Electric signals generated by tornados|journal=[[Atmospheric Research]]|volume=92|issue=2|pages=277–9|date=April 2009|doi=10.1016/j.atmosres.2008.10.029|bibcode=2009AtmRe..92..277L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory explains that the formation of electrical discharges occur when negatively charged condensation from a severe thunderstorm is drawn down within the tornado's funnel, where it then meets positive charges from the ground. When these opposite charges meet, electrical potential is released along with RF emissions that can be detected using tuned equipment.

Currently, research is being conducted by T.E.D.D. and others to gather more information on this phenomenon.

'''''Tamizhuku En Ondrai Azhuthavum''''' (''{{lang-en|Dial 1 for Tamil}}''; also referred to as '''''TEOA''''') is a 2015 [[Tamil language|Tamil-language]] [[thriller film]] written and directed by Ramprakash Rayappa. Produced by V. Chandran, the film stars [[Nakul (actor)|Nakul]], [[Attakathi Dinesh]], [[Bindu Madhavi]] and [[Aishwarya Dutta]]. The film received positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
A deadly bomb will be activated if a computer geek restores a part of Chennai city's mobile networks, which are down due to a solar flare. Four people are linked to each other on a deadly mission.

Mukil ([[Dinesh Ravi]]) falls in love with Simi ([[Bindu Madhavi]]), who is stuck in a pit hole with an 80-tonne gigantic 'Vaasthu' rock under suspension which is ready to fall on her at any time. The only way that Simi can escape from this danger is if her text message reaches Mukil.

In the meantime, there is a hyperactive science geek Vasanth ([[Nakul (actor)|Nakul]]), who is on a mission to activate a dead mobile network signal. then there is a call taxi driver Raja ([[Sathish]]), whose car has a remotely operated bomb planted in it by a terrorist outfit waiting to destroy the city once the phone lines are restored. Does the city escape destruction from the bomb and what happens with the four main characters forms the rest of the story.

==Critical reception==
M. Suganth of [[The Times of India]]'s gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, "Ramprakash Rayappa sets up his story effectively and keeps us on the edge of our seats for the most parts. The manner in which he handles this multi-strand narrative without making it chaotic deserves appreciation. The success lies in how he makes each of these sub-plots interesting", going on to call it a "solid debut film".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie-reviews/Tamizhukku-En-1-Ai-Azhuthavum/movie-review/46317335.cms|title = Tamizhukku En 1-Ai Azhuthavum Movie Review|date = 20 February 2015|accessdate = 4 April 2015|website = |publisher = [[The Times of India]]|last = M|first = Suganth}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indo-Asian News Service]], while giving the same rating and also describing it as a "solid [[social thriller]]", wrote, "(the) details, though minute, make the director stand out from his contemporaries. The writing is fresh and it’s evident from the way the director manages to make the parallelly running stories converge at the end...It’s probably the first Tamil film where a perfect balance is struck between science, romance and comedy interspersed with some fresh thrills".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/regional/tamiluku-en-ondrai-azhuthavum-movie-review-social-thriller-with-great-comedy/99/|title = Social thriller with great comedy|date = |accessdate = 4 April 2015|website = indianexpress.com|publisher = [[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New Indian Express]] wrote, "The deftness and confidence with which the director moves his narration belies the fact that this is his debut venture. The screenplay is engaging, with the characters well-fleshed out, and there is an element of suspense with humour laced throughout...One of the better scripts to appear in recent times, ''Thamizhuku Enn Ondrai Azhuthavum'' has a lot of positives going for it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/Well-crafted-a-Better-Script-in-Recent-Times/2015/02/21/article2678565.ece|title = Well-crafted, a Better Script in Recent Times|date = 21 February 2015|accessdate = 4 April 2015|website = |publisher = [[The New Indian Express]]|last = Mannath|first = Malini}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sify]] wrote, "The director has done his paper work with sheer perfection and packaged this out-of-the-box concept in a fairly engaging manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sify.com/movies/tamizhukku-en-ondrai-azhuthavum-review-tamil-pcynaJcgejacf.html|title = Tamizhukku En Ondrai Azhuthavum Review|date = |accessdate = 4 April 2015|website = |publisher = Sify|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baradwaj Rangan]] wrote, "It doesn’t say much about a movie when we walk into a thriller and walk out of what’s mostly a comedy – but with so many laughs, why complain?", further adding that "first-time director Ramprakash Rayappa at least has the right ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/thamizhukku-enn-ondrai-azhuthavum-movie-review/article6919465.ece|title = Less thriller, more comedy, but some big laughs|date = 21 February 2015|accessdate = 4 April 2015|website = |publisher = [[The Hindu]]|last = Rangan|first = Baradwaj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Rediff]] gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, "Director Ramprakash has come up with a good idea, but the performance is poor, the romance seems forced, there are too many coincidences and a lame, predictable climax. This spoils what could have been a racy and exciting thriller".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/review-tamiluku-en-ondrai-aluthavum-is-not-exciting/20150220.htm|title = Tamiluku En Ondrai Aluthavum is not exciting|date = 20 February 2015|accessdate = 4 April 2015|website = |publisher = Rediff|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Steam House''''' ({{lang-fr|La maison à vapeur}}) is an 1880 [[Jules Verne]] novel recounting the travels of a group of British colonists in the [[British Raj|Raj]] in a wheeled house pulled by a [[steam engine|steam-powered]] mechanical elephant. Verne uses the mechanical house as a plot device to have the reader travel in nineteenth-century India. The descriptions are interspersed with historical information and social commentary.

The book takes place in the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] against British rule, with the passions and traumas aroused still very much alive among Indians and British alike. An alternate title by which the book was known - "The End of Nana Sahib" - refers to the appearance in the book of the historical figure&amp;mdash;Rebel leader [[Nana Sahib]]&amp;mdash;who disappeared after the crushing of the rebellion, his ultimate fate unknown.  Verne offers a fictional explanation to his disappearance.

== Plot ==

=== Part 1 ===
In summer 1866, in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[British Raj|British colonial]] government announces bounty on the head of [[Nana Sahib]], who is supposed to be hiding in that presidency. Nana Sahib, disguised as a sage stalks and kill the man who claims to know face of Nana Sahib. Nana Sahib escapes from Aurangabad same night and taking his brother Bala Rao and followers, hidden in [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora]] caves respectively, retreats to [[Vindhya Range|Vindhiyanchal]] mountains to hide from colonial forces.

Nana Sahib, along with his brother and followers hides in various small fortresses called ''Pals,'' and mostly inside ''Pal of Tandil.'' His brother Bala Rao, who is extremely similar to Nana sahib in physical appearance, inquires about the inhabitants of fortress and learns from locals that none except local outlaws, insurgents and a mad woman knows about the place. The mad woman is known as Rowing Flame as she carries a burning torch and roams the wilderness in valley of Narmada. The locals respect the mysterious lady and feed and cloth her. From this hiding place, Nana Sahib launches an [[Resistance movement|underground movement]] and secretly visit local chieftains for persuading them for a rising.

Meanwhile, in Calcutta, a group of Europeans is planning for a voyage through India. The group consist of Banks, a railroad engineer, Maucler, the French adventurer and narrator for most part of the story, Captain Hood; a hunter craving for his ''half century'' of tigers, retired Colonel [[Sir]] Edward Munro, whose motive behind joining this expedition is to find and kill Nana Sahib to avenge his Wife, who supposedly died in the [[Cawnpore Massacre|Cawnpore massacre]]. Servants accompanying them are Sergaent McNeil, Munro's faithful servant. Fox is the faithful servant of Captain Hood and fellow hunter, who has killed 37 tigers. Monsieur Parazard; a [[Negro]] cook of French origins, Storr, a British Engine driver, Kilouth; an [[Adivasi]] coal shover and Gotimi; the faithful Gurkha servant of Colonel Munro.

Banks, the Engineer introduces the machine he invented, a [[Steam engine|Steam powered]] mechanical elephant, which pulls two comfortable carriages having all the comforts of a 19th-century house. The machine, can ''walk'' across land and float across rivers using embedded [[Paddle wheel|Peddle wheels]]. The steam elephant is named as Behemoth and together with two carriages, it is called the Steam House. First carriage is used by the gentlemen while the other is reserved for servants. They start from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], and travelling around the French town of [[Chandannagar]], and [[Bardhaman|Burdawan]], [[Patna]] and Chitra, reach [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], where they visit various Hindu and Buddhist temples and bathing [[Ghat]]. On the way to [[Banaras]] are interrupted by Hindu fanatics who consider the Steam House to be chariot of their deity. Banks frightens them away by directing steam exhaust at them. In Banaras, Banks and Maucler notice a man spying on them but resolve not to tell Colonel. From Banaras,they travel to [[Allahabad]], where they learn that Nana sahib has been declared dead after an skirmish in the defiles of [[Satpura Range|Satpuda]]. Colonel Munro is shocked by this news, as he wanted to take revenge himself. After Munro's request, they decides to pass through [[Kanpur]], where an emotional Colonel visits his old house and the well which is supposedly the grave of Mrs Munro and other victims of the massacre. The group decides to journey towards norther forest and pass the [[Monsoon of South Asia|Monsoon]] season there, hunting wild animals. In the way to Terai, they defeat 3 elephants of an arrogant [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] Prince in a competition with Behemoth. Near [[Terai]], they are caught in a violent thunderstorm and Gautami narrowly survives after being thunderstruck. The man who was spying on Steam House meets Nana in [[Bhopal]] and informs him of further plans of inhabitants of Steam House. Nana orders his faithful follower Kalagni to infiltrate Steam House and lure them near Nana Sahib's hiding place. While returning to their hiding place, Near the Pal of Tandil, they are ambushed by British forces, who were directed unwittingly by the madwoman Rowing Flame. A body matching the description of Nana Sahib is found and he is declared dead by the British authorities.

=== Part 2 ===
The inhabitants of Steam House camp on a plateau in Terai. During a hunting expedition, they rescue Mathias Van Guitt, an [[Animal trapping|Animal purveyor]] from his own trap. They visit [[kraal]] of Van Guitt, where Colonel Munro is saved from a poisonous snake by one of Van Guitt's servant, Kalagni. The Steam House dwellers frequently visit the kraal and invite Van Guitt to the Steam House. Van Guitt try to capture animals, while inhabitants of Steam House hunt animals. One night when they are visiting Kraal,when [[Tiger]]s and other [[Predation|Predatory animals]] attack the kraal. Protagonists narrowly escape death as many Indian servants are killed. The buffaloes are either killed by animals or driven away into jungle. Consequently, Van Guitt ask protagonists to drag his caravan of cages to nearest railway station, After reaching station and loading his cargo, Van Guitt and protagonists part their ways. Protagonists employ Kalagni as guide and servants and head for Bobay through [[Central India]]. During journey through jungles they encounter a herd of monkeys and a grain transport caravan. Kalagni meet an old acquaintance in the caravan and chat mysteriously with him. On their way to [[Jabalpur]] in the jungle, they are cornered and attacked by a herd of elephants which results in loss of second carriage. To escape from the herd, Banks drives Steam House into lake ''Puturia''. All the food and provision is lost with second carriage and after sometime, the fuel is exhausted, resulting in Steam House floating in the middle of the lake. Kalagni volunteers to swim to shore and fetch help. Colonel Munro, suspecting him, sends his faithful servant Gautami with him. Both swim to shore while the steam House slowly drift in the fog. As soon as they reach the shore, Kalagni meets a follower of Nana, Nassim and tries to attack Goumi, who swiftly escape. With morning breeze, the Steam House drifts towards bank. as protagonists land, they are attacked by a group of men led by Kalagni and Nassim attack and kidnap Colonel Munro, leaving others bonded with ropes. Colonel Munro is taken to an abandoned fort, where Nana Sahib shows up and reveals the reality of the news of his death.The dead person who was identified as Nana Sahib was actually his look alike brother Balao Rao. Due to their physical similarity, the British authorities mistook Balao Rao as Nana Sahib. Nana Sahib proclaims death for Colonel Munro To avenge death of his brother, members of the royal family of last [[Mughal emperors|Mughal emperor]] [[Bahadur Shah II]] and other victims of British suppuration of [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].  Colonel Munro is tied on the mouth of a large cannon to, to be blown at sunrise. Nana leaves for a meeting in nearby village. Near dawn, Munro is rescued by Goumi, who had hid himself inside the cannon after running away from Lake Puturia and overhearing plans of rebels. As they are escaping, they encounter Rowing Flame. Colonel Munro recognizes her as his wife Lady Munro, but she being lost her sanity, doesn't recognize him and refuses to go with him and sparks from her torch causes the canon to go off. Munro and Goumi escape with Lady Munro while the people in the fort are confused. But soon they are spotted by Kalagni and his men and encounter Nana Sahib on his way back to fort. Goumi and Munro quickly overpowers Nana and his assistant. As they are being chased by the men led by Kalagni, they are rescued by other protagonists  riding on Behemoth. They take Nana sahib as prisoner and as they are chased through jungle. Capt Hood and Sgt. McNeil shoot down many of adversaries, including Kalagni. As they near towards a military outpost, Banks supercharges the boiler and protagonists escape the Behemoth, leaving bounded Nana Sahib inside the machine. As the men approach the machine, the boiler bursts, leaving everyone near it dead' although Nana's body is not found. Protagonists are rescued by the stationed regiment as rest of the insurgents fled to inner country. They head for [[Mumbai]] via railway and than to Calcutta. In care of Colonel Munro, Lady Munro regains her sanity and memory. When Munro tell Hood that about not being able to achieve his target of killing 50 tigers, Hood replies that Kalagni was his 50th tiger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3811">A '''transient astronomical event''', often shortened by [[astronomer]]s to a '''transient''', is an [[astronomical object]] or [[celestial event|phenomenon]] whose duration may be from seconds to days, weeks, or even several years. This is in contrast to the timescale of the millions or billions of years during which the [[galaxies]] and their component [[star]]s in our [[universe]] have evolved. Singularly, the term is used for violent [[deep-sky object|deep-sky]] events, such as [[supernova]]e, [[nova]]e, [[dwarf nova]] outbursts, [[gamma-ray burst]]s, and [[tidal disruption event]]s, as well as [[gravitational microlensing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=Brian |title=Optical Transient Surveys |journal=[[Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union]] |date=20 April 2012 |volume=7 |issue=S285 |pages=9–10 |doi=10.1017/S1743921312000129}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[transit (astronomy)|transits]] and [[eclipse]]s. These events are part of the broader topic of [[time domain astronomy]].

==History==
Before the invention of [[telescope]]s, events such as these that were visible to the [[naked eye]], from within or near the [[Milky Way]] Galaxy, were very rare, and sometimes hundreds of years apart. However, such events were recorded in antiquity, such as the [[SN 1054|supernova in 1054]] observed by Chinese, Japanese and Arab astronomers, and the event in 1572 known as "[[SN 1572|Tycho's Supernova]]" after [[Tycho Brahe]], who studied it until it faded after two years.&lt;ref name="Crawford, 2014"&gt;[http://www.Gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-transient-universe Lecture by Prof. Carolin Crawford, 2014,  “The Transient Universe”]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though telescopes made it possible to see more distant events, their small fields of view – typically less than 1 [[square degree]] – meant that the chances of looking in the right place at the right time were low. [[Schmidt camera]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and other [[astrograph]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s with wide field were invented in the 20th century, but mostly used to survey the unchanging heavens.

As the interest in transients has intensified&lt;ref name="Crawford, 2014" /&gt; because study of them helps [[astrophysicist]]s to understand the mechanisms which produced our universe, telescopes with larger fields of view are coming into use. These, such as the [[Palomar Transient Factory]], the spacecraft [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] and the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]], are able to spot many more such occurrences. The ability of modern instruments to observe in [[wavelength]]s invisible to the [[human eye]] ([[radio waves]], [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]) increases the amount of information that may be obtained when a transient is studied. The proposed [[ULTRASAT]] satellite will observe a field of more than 200 square degrees continuously in the ultraviolet range. This wavelength is particularly important for detecting supernovae within minutes of their occurrence.

[[File:Timber Framing Circular Saw.jpg|thumb|right|This worker wears ear defenders and a dust mask while the circular saw has a guard]]

Lack of thorough training on the specific system of safety and health signs and signals plays the pivotal role in furnishing the accidents in the woodworking sector. The established contacts with managers from SMEs and companies in Wood Industry also confirmed the current needs for this particular training. SMEs, in particular, have fewer resources to put complex systems of worker protection in place and tend to be more affected by the negative impact of health and safety problems.

Woodworking machines, wood dust, fire and explosion, noise, vibrations, manual handling operations in Wood Industry, hazardous and chemical substances, slips and trips are some of the biggest concerns.

Federal regulators are drawing up new standards for handling industrial and wood dust following a series of fires and explosions related to combustible dust. The [[Wood Machinery Manufacturers of America]]'s Industrial Dust Task Force has been following the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] on the new rules since October 2009. The goal is to ensure that companies follow proper dust collection procedures.

[[Wood Machinery Manufacturers of America]] (WMMA)  fully supports efforts to protect workers against the dangers of combustible dust. However, the organization is encouraging OSHA to avoid creating new economic hardships for woodworking companies and small manufacturers. Their observation says that if the companies find it difficult to meet the regulations, then it will be impossible to achieve the goal which is to protect the workers.

Art Sipple, State of Nevada Safety Consultation &amp; Training Section Supervisor, OSHA asserts flammable dust being the biggest threat to the industry. Not only sawdust which in and of itself poses a fire hazard, but the generation of fine dust particles creates an even bigger hazard. Organic dust particles are highly flammable and under favorable conditions, highly explosive. In addition, some forms of wood release toxic materials when being cut; Western Red Cedar is one example. Another issue is rotating equipment. Guarding is a major issue with all rotating machinery.

Sipple says that the regulations are important as they not only ensure the safety of the employees, it further saves extra expenses related to the injuries and illness. He says: “Controls for any industry are practical. The lack of controls causes injuries and illnesses that cost companies a lot of money, not only through insurance claims with workers compensation insurance, but through lost time and production. Generally, $1 spent on controls and safe work practices save employers $3 or more by preventing problems. For a company to run on high performance and high demand, it has to control injuries and illnesses or the company will not be competitive and lose market shares.”

Recent [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) accident statistics shows that accidents involving contact with the dangerous parts of machinery or the material being machined accounted for approximately one quarter of all of the fatal injuries recorded in the woodworking industry, and approximately half of all major injury accidents.

The risks associated with the use of woodworking machinery are high since they rely on high-speed sharp cutters to do the job and in many cases, these are necessarily exposed to enable the machining process to take place. Additionally, many machines are still hand-fed; woodworking is probably the main industry where the hands of the operator are constantly exposed to danger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8610">'''WREN''' is a major non-profit organization registered in the United Kingdom with charitable status and affiliated to [[UNESCO]], the Deputy Director General of which is its honorary President. It has a Governing Council, an Executive Committee and a Director General. It maintains links with many United Nations, governmental and non-governmental organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrenuk.co.uk/index.html WREN Official Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1992 during the second World Renewable Energy Congress in Reading, UK, WREN is one of the most effective organizations in supporting and enhancing the utilisation and implementation of [[renewable energy]] sources that are both environmentally safe and economically sustainable. This is done through a worldwide network of agencies, laboratories, institutions, companies and individuals, all working together towards the international diffusion of renewable energy technologies and applications. Representing most countries in the world, it aims to promote the communication and technical education of scientists, engineers, technicians and managers in this field and to address itself to the energy needs of both developing and developed countries.

Over two billion dollars have now been allocated to projects dealing with renewable energy and the environment by the [[World Solar Summit]] and [[World Solar Decade]] along with the [[World Bank]].

==Global Activities of WREC/WREN==

The global activities of the World Renewable Energy Congress / Network encompass:

*International congresses (World Renewable Energy Congress, WREC)
*Regional meetings
*Workshops on renewable energy topics
*Competitions and awards promoting renewable energy
*Journal publication "Renewable Energy"
*Scientific publications
*Targeted books and annual magazine
*Newsletter

===Mission statement===

''With the accelerated approach of the global climate-change point-of-no-return the need to address the pivotal role of renewable energy in the formation of coping strategies, rather than prevention, is more crucial than ever. Sustainability, green buildings, and the development of the large-scale [[renewable energy industry]] must be at the top of all development, economic, financial and political agendas. The time for action has arrived. Prevention and questioning how and why we face this great challenge is a luxury we can no longer indulge. We welcome the establishment of the long overdue International Renewable Energy Agency which we hope will work side-by-side with similar intergovernmental agencies striving for the adoption of renewable energies.

The major event organised by WREC/WREN is the biennial congress, normally held during the summer of every even year. The congresses are mostly run and organised by the WREC headquarters which are in [[Brighton]], UK. All members of WREC/WREN are entitled to bid to host the Congress. The WREC/WREN Council meets and decides the location based on: availability of local funding and sponsorship; ease of travel to the location; extent of host government and institutional support; benefits to the local country. All local organisation and services must be provided by the host country.

The first three congresses were held in the UK ([[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]), followed by a move to [[Denver]] (United States) and then to [[Florence]] (Italy). In the year 2000 the congress returned to the UK (Brighton) with every effort being made to ensure that this event enhanced the recognition of Renewable Energies in the new millennium. In 2002 the congress took place in [[Cologne]] (Germany) and 2004 once more in Denver (USA). In 2006 the congress was held in Florence (Italy) and in 2008 in [[Glasgow]] (UK). The next congresses will be in [[Abu Dhabi]] ([[UAE]]) in 2010 and in Denver (USA) in 2012 respectively.

==Purpose of WREC==

At no time in modern history has energy played a more crucial role in the development and well being of nations than at present. The source and nature of energy, the security of supply and the equity of distribution, the environmental impact of its supply and utilization, are all crucial matters to be addressed by suppliers, consumers, governments, industry, academia, and financial institutions.

The World Renewable Energy Congress (WREC), a major recognised forum for networking between these sectors, addresses these issues through regular meetings and exhibitions, bringing together representatives of all those involved in the supply, distribution, consumption and development of energy sources which are benign, sustainable, accessible and economically viable. WREC enables policy makers, [[researchers]], [[manufacturers]], [[economists]], [[financiers]], [[sociologists]], environmentalists and others to present their views in Plenary and Technical Sessions and to participate in discussions, both formal and informal, thus facilitating the transfer of knowledge between nations, institutions, disciplines and individuals.

==WREC Renewable Energy Awards==

The WREC Renewable Energy Awards were established in 1998, during the 5th edition of the WREC Congress in Florence as a way to recognize outstanding achievement and vision in the global renewable energy sector.

The WREC Renewable Energy Awards aim at highlighting the worldwide best-implemented policies, projects and research in the following topics:
*[[Fuel Cells]] and [[Hydrogen]]
*[[Low-energy house|Low Energy Architecture]]
*[[Solar Energy]]
*[[Wind power|Wind Technology]]
*[[Biomass]]
*[[Sustainable Transport]]
*[[Green Energy]] [[Business]]

==WREC/WREN Aims and Objectives==

'''Yakov Isidorovich Perelman''' ({{lang-ru|Яков Исидорович Перельман}}; December 4, 1882 – March 16, 1942) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science writer and author of many [[popular science]] books, including ''Physics Can Be Fun'' and ''Mathematics Can Be Fun'' (both translated from [[Russian language|Russian]] into English).

Perelman was born in 1882 in the town of [[Białystok]], [[Congress Poland]]. He obtained the Diploma in Forestry from the [[Imperial Forestry Institute (Russia)|Imperial Forestry Institute]] (Now Saint Petersburg State Forest Technical University) in [[Saint Petersburg]], in 1909. He was influenced by [[Ernst Mach]] and probably the Russian Machist [[Alexander Bogdanov]] in his pedagogical approach to popularising science.&lt;ref&gt;Siemsen, H. (2010) 'Mach’s Science Education, the PISA Study and Czech Science Education' in: Ernst Mach – Fyzika – Filosofie – Vzdělávání. Vol. 1 Brno: Masarykova Univerzita, 2010, pp. 255–265, DOI: 10.5817/CZ.MUNI.M210-4808-2011-255.&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of "Physics for Entertainment", Perelman set out to produce other books, in which he showed himself to be an imaginative populariser of science. Especially popular were ''"Arithmetic for entertainment", "Mechanics for entertainment", "Geometry for Entertainment", "Astronomy for entertainment", "Lively Mathematics", " Physics Everywhere", and "Tricks and Amusements".

His famous books on [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] were translated into various languages by the erstwhile [[Soviet Union]].

The scientist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] thought highly of Perelman's talents and creative genius, writing of him in the preface of ''Interplanetary Journeys'': "The author has long been known by his popular, witty and quite scientific works on physics, astronomy and mathematics, which are, moreover written in a marvelous language and are very readable."

Perelman has also authored a number of textbooks and articles in Soviet popular science magazines.

In addition to his educational and scientific writings, he also worked as an editor of science magazines, including ''Nature and People'' and ''In the Workshop of Nature''.

Perelman died from starvation in 1942, during the German [[Siege of Leningrad]]. The siege started at 9 September 1941 and lasted 872 days, until 
27 January 1944. The Siege of Leningrad was one of the longest, most destructive sieges of a major city in modern history and one of the costliest in terms of casualties (1,117,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-t.ru/ri/ms/dz10.htm Доктор занимательных наук. Книги. Наука и техника&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

His older brother Yosif was a writer who published under the pseudonym [[Osip Dymov (writer)|Osip Dymov]]. He is not related to the Russian mathematician [[Grigori Perelman]], who was born in 1966 to a different Yakov Perelman. However, Grigori Perelman told The New Yorker that his father gave him ''Physics for Entertainment'', and it inspired his interest in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite news | last = Nasar  | first = Sylvia  |author2=Gruber, David   | title = Manifold Destiny: A legendary problem and the battle over who solved it.  | work = [[The New Yorker]]  | date = 21 August 2006  | url = http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060828fa_fact2  | accessdate = 2006-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also written several books on interplanetary travel (''Interplanetary Journeys, On a Rocket to Stars, and World Expanses'')

==''Physics for Entertainment''==
In 1913, Russian bookshops began carrying ''Physics for Entertainment''.  The educationalist's new book attracted young readers seeking answers to scientific questions.

''Physics for Entertainment'' had a unique layout as well as an instructive style.  In the preface (11th ed.) Perelman wrote: "The main objective of ''Physics for entertainment'' is to arouse the activity of scientific imagination, to teach the reader to think in the spirit of the science of physics and to create in his mind a wide variety of associations of physical knowledge with the widely differing facts of life, with all that he normally comes into contact with."

In the foreword, Perelman describes the contents as “conundrums, brain-teasers, entertaining anecdotes, and unexpected comparisons,” adding, “I have quoted extensively from [[Jules Verne]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Mark Twain]] and other writers, because, besides providing entertainment, the fantastic experiments these writers describe may well serve as instructive illustrations at physics classes.”  The 13th edition (1936) would be the last published during the author's lifetime.  Among the book's notable topics was the idea of a perpetual machine: a hypothetical machine which could run incessantly performing useful work.  The author discusses perpetual motion, highlighting many attempts to build such a machine, and explains why they failed.  Other topics included how to jump from a moving car, and why, “according to the law of buoyancy, we would never drown in the [[Dead Sea]].”

[[Randall Munroe]], the creator of the web comic [[xkcd]] and author of his own popular science books, wrote: 
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book is a series of a few hundred examples, no more than one or two pages each, asking a question that illustrates some idea in basic physics.

It’s neat to see what has and hasn’t changed in the last century or so.  Many of the examples he uses seem to be straight out of a modern high school physics textbook, while others were totally new to me.  And some of the answers to the questions he poses seem obvious, but others made me stop and think. [This] diagram ... shows a design for a fountain with no pump — it took me a while to get why it works.... Later in the book, he explains the physics of that drinking bird toy.
	
It’s written in a fun, engaging, conversational style, as if he’s in the room chatting with you about these neat ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[blog.xkcd.com/2009/10/02/physics-for-entertainment/ Physics for Entertainment] Posted on 2009-10-02 by randallpmunro, xkcd: The blag of the webcomic&lt;/ref&gt;
