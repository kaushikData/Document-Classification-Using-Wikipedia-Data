In [[Transportation planning|transport planning]] accessibility refers to a measure of the ease of reaching (and interacting with) destinations&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or activities distributed in space&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=El-Geneidy|first=Ahmed|last2=Levinson|first2=David|date=2006-05-01|title=Access to Destinations: Development of Accessibility Measures|url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/638|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Ying|last2=Miller|first2=Harvey|last3=Stempihar|first3=Jeff|last4=Zhou|first4=Xuesong|date=2017-10-01|title=Green accessibility: Estimating the environmental costs of network-time prisms for sustainable transportation planning|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966692317300686|journal=Journal of Transport Geography|language=en|volume=64|pages=109–119|doi=10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.08.008|issn=0966-6923|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, e.g. around a city or country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrew|first=Owen,|last2=Brendan|first2=Murphy,|date=2018|title=Access Across America: Transit 2017|url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/199920|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Owen|first=Andrew|title=Developing a Comprehensive U.S. Transit Accessibility Database|date=2016-10-08|work=Springer Geography|pages=279–290|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-40902-3_16|isbn=9783319409009|last2=Levinson|first2=David M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Accessibility is generally associated with a place (or places) of origin. A place with "high accessibility" is one from which many destinations can be reached, or destinations can be reached with relative ease. "Low accessibility" implies that relatively few destinations can be reached for a given amount of time/effort/cost or that reaching destinations is more difficult or costly from that place.   

The concept can also be defined in the other direction, and we can speak of a place having accessibility ''from'' some set of surrounding places. For example, one could measure the accessibility of a store to customers as well as the accessibility of a potential customer to some set of stores. 

In [[time geography]], accessibility has also been defined as "person based" rather than "place based", were one would consider a person's access to some type of amenity through the course of their day as they move through space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Miller|first=Harvey J.|date=2005-12-06|pages=63–89|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|language=en|doi=10.1108/9780080460550-004|isbn=9780080446783|title=Access to Destinations|chapter=Place-Based Versus People-Based Accessibility}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person might live in a [[food desert]] but have easy access to a grocery store from their place of work.

Accessibility is often calculated separately for different modes of transport&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iacono|first=Michael|last2=Krizek|first2=Kevin|last3=El-Gemeidy|first3=Ahmed|date=2010-01-01|title=Measuring non-motorized accessibility: issues, alternatives, and execution|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966692309000210|journal=Journal of Transport Geography|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=133–140|doi=10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2009.02.002|issn=0966-6923|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.558.6960}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Mathematical definition ==
In general, accessibility &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;
A_i = \sum_j {W_j } \times f\left( {C_{ij} } \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; = index of origin locations
* &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; = index of destination locations
* &lt;math&gt;W_j&lt;/math&gt; = a set of weights associated with destinations e.g. the number of jobs in a [[traffic analysis zone]]
* &lt;math&gt;C_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is a cost of travel from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and 
* &lt;math&gt;f\left( {C_{ij} } \right)&lt;/math&gt; is function on the travel cost that assigns weight to observations&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrew|first=Owen,|last2=Brendan|first2=Murphy,|date=2018|title=Access Across America: Transit 2017 Methodology|url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/199921|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Cost metrics ===
Travel cost metrics (&lt;math&gt;C_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; in the equation above) can take a variety of forms such as:
*[[Euclidean distance|Euclidean Distance]]
* Network distance
* Travel time&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farber|first=Steven|last2=Fu|first2=Liwei|date=2017-03-01|title=Dynamic public transit accessibility using travel time cubes: Comparing the effects of infrastructure (dis)investments over time|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516302861|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|language=en|volume=62|pages=30–40|doi=10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.10.005|issn=0198-9715|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monetary cost or fare&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-01|title=The cost of equity: Assessing transit accessibility and social disparity using total travel cost|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856416305924|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|language=en|volume=91|pages=302–316|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2016.07.003|issn=0965-8564|last1=El-Geneidy|first1=Ahmed|last2=Levinson|first2=David|last3=Diab|first3=Ehab|last4=Boisjoly|first4=Genevieve|last5=Verbich|first5=David|last6=Loong|first6=Charis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Comfort or ease of travel
Cost metrics may also be defined using any combination of these or other metrics. For a non-motorized [[mode of transport]], such as [[walking]] or [[cycling]], the generalized travel cost may include additional factors such as [[safety]] or [[gradient]]. The essential idea is to define a function that describes the ease of travelling from any origin &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to any destination &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.  

=== Impedance functions ===
The function on the travel cost &lt;math&gt;f\left( {C_{ij} } \right)&lt;/math&gt; determines how accessible a destination is based on the travel cost associated with reaching that destination. Two common impedance functions are "cumulative opportunities" and a [[Negative exponential distribution|negative exponential]] function. Cumulative opportunities&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Jeff |last2=Farber |first2=Steven |date=2018 |doi=10.31235/osf.io/pvrd9 |url=https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pvrd9/ |accessdate=13 October 2018 |title=Generating measures of access to employment for Canada's eight largest urban regions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is a binary function&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fayyaz S.|first=S. Kiavash|last2=Liu|first2=Xiaoyue Cathy|last3=Zhang|first3=Guohui|date=2017-10-05|title=An efficient General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) enabled algorithm for dynamic transit accessibility analysis|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=12|issue=10|pages=e0185333|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0185333|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5628824|pmid=28981544}}&lt;/ref&gt; yielding 1 if an opportunity can be reached within some threshold and 0 otherwise. It is defined as: 

&lt;math&gt;
f(C_{ij}) = 
\begin{cases} 
1~~\text{if} &amp; C_{ij} \leq \theta \\
0~~\text{if} &amp; C_{ij} &gt; \theta
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the threshold parameter.

A negative exponential&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; impedance function can be defined as:

&lt;math&gt;
f(C_{ij}) = e^{ -\beta C_{ij} }
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter defining how quickly the function decays with distance.

== Relation to land use ==
Accessibility has long been associated with landuse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Walter G.|date=1959|title=How Accessibility Shapes Land Use|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Planners|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=73–76|doi=10.1080/01944365908978307|issn=0002-8991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-06-01|title=Accessibility evaluation of land-use and transport strategies: review and research directions|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966692303000607|journal=Journal of Transport Geography|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=127–140|doi=10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2003.10.005|issn=0966-6923|last1=Geurs|first1=Karst T.|last2=Van Wee|first2=Bert}}&lt;/ref&gt;; as accessibility increases in a given place, the utility of developing the land increases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iacono|first=Michael|last2=Levinson|first2=David|date=2017-02-01|title=Accessibility dynamics and location premia: Do land values follow accessibility changes?|journal=Urban Studies|language=en|volume=54|issue=2|pages=364–381|doi=10.1177/0042098015595012|issn=0042-0980|citeseerx=10.1.1.226.4890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This association is often used in integrated transport and landuse forecasting models.  
== In practice == 

[[Transport for London]] utilize a calculated approach known as [[Public Transport Accessibility Level]] (PTAL) that uses the distance from any point to the nearest public transport stops, and service frequency at those stops, to assess the accessibility of a site to public transport services.

There are three ways in spatial planning to improve accessibility and they are respectively mobility, connectivity and proximity. They are considered the means to the end which is accessibility.

The '''Arms Control and Disarmament Act of 1961''', 22 U.S.C. § 2551, was created to establish a governing body for the control and reduction of [[Weapon of mass destruction|apocalyptic armaments]] with regards to protect a world from the burdens of [[Weapon|armaments]] and the scourge of war. The Act provided an important aspect for the Kennedy Administration's [[foreign policy]] which was coherent with the United States [[national security]] policy.

The H.R. 9118 [[legislation]] was passed by the United States 87th Congressional session and signed by the [[Timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy|35th President of the United States]] John F. Kennedy on September 26, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=8353 |title=John F.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The Arms Control and Disarmament Act established the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] (ACDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=8214 |title=John F. Kennedy: "Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Proposing the Establishment of a United States Disarmament Agency," June 29, 1961 |author1=Peters,Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. federal organization developed the formulation and implementation of the United States [[arms control]] and [[disarmament]] policy. The agency provided information and recommendations with regards to U.S. economic, foreign, and national security policies to executive and legislative officials of the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=58983 |title=John F. Kennedy: "Executive Order 11044 - Interagency Coordination of Arms Control and Disarmament Matters," August 20, 1962 |author1=Peters,Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act established several core functions for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency;
* Conduct, coordinate, and support the research of the formulation for the arms control and disarmament policy.
* Management and preparation of the United States participation in international negotiations for the arms control and disarmament [[Peacebuilding|peace process]].
* Coordination and [[dissemination]] of United States public information concerning arms control and disarmament policy.
* Operation and preparation, as appropriate, for the United States participation in control systems of domestic and international arms control and disarmament activities.

==History==

===Early history===
Arri was founded in Munich, Germany in 1917 by August Arnold and Robert Richter as '''Arnold &amp; Richter Cine Technik'''. The abbreviation ''Arri'' was derived from the initial two letters of the founders' surnames, ''Ar''nold and ''Ri''chter.&lt;ref name=cnbc&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/03/arri-group.html| title=ARRI Group| date=November 3, 2014| publisher=CNBC| access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=calk&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.calkovsky.com/about-arriflex/| title=About Arriflex| publisher=Calkovsky Cinema Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Arnold and Richter developed their first film camera, the small and portable Kinarri 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2673654661.html|title=Bridging past and present|last=Leitner|first=David|date=1 October 2010|work=Filmmaker {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Arri introduced the world's first reflex mirror shutter in the [[Arriflex 35]] camera, an invention of longtime engineer [[Erich Kästner (camera designer)|Erich Kästner]]. This technology employs a rotating mirror that allows a continuous motor to operate the camera while providing [[parallax]]-free reflex viewing to the operator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1493109381.html|title=90 years of precision|last=Birchard|first=Robert|date=1 June 2008|work=American Cinematographer {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ability to focus the image by eye through the viewfinder, much like an [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] camera for still photography. The reflex design was subsequently used in almost every professional motion picture film camera and is still used in the Arri Alexa Studio digital camera. The first Hollywood film to employ an Arriflex was the 1947 Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall film ''[[Dark Passage]]'' in 1947. Over the years, more than 17,000 Arriflex 35s were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Chronicle of a Camera: The Arriflex 35 in North America, 1945-1972| author=Norris Pope| publisher=University Press of Mississippi| date=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was recognized with two Scientific and Technical Academy Awards in 1966 and 1982.

In 1952, Arri introduced the Arriflex 16ST, the first professional 16mm camera with a reflex viewing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Ellis,|last2=Nick|first2=Hall,|date=2018-04-11|title=ADAPT|url=https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v2|journal=figshare|language=en-US|doi=10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=calk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cinematechnic.com/resources/arri_16s| title=Camera Profile - ARRIFLEX 16S Series| publisher=Cinema Technic| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyfa&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nyfa.edu/film-school-blog/the-history-of-16-mm-film-and-the-arriflex-16-s-camera/| title=The History of 16 MM Film and the Arriflex 16 S Camera| publisher=New York Film Academy| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965,  a [[Sound blimp|self-blimped]] 16mm camera was released: the Arriflex 16BL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cinematechnic.com/resources/arri_16bl| title=Camera Profiles - Arriflex 16BL| publisher=CinemaTechnic| access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arriflex 35BL followed in 1972 as a lightweight, quiet alternative to the rather heavy and cumbersome blimped cameras of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cinematechnic.com/resources/arri_35bl| title=Camera Profiles - ARRI ARRIFLEX 35BL Series| publisher=Cinema Technic| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1972, Arri pioneered the development of daylight luminaires with the Arrisonne 2000 W.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The [[Arriflex 16SR]], launched in 1975, featured a redesigned viewfinder with a through-the-lens light meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cinematechnic.com/resources/arri_16sr| title=Camera Profiles - Arri 16SR series| publisher=Cinema Technic| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arriflex 765, a 65mm camera, was released in 1989, partly in response to the growing industry demand for 70mm release prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2013/arri765/index.htm| title=Interview With Otto Blaschek| author=Alexander Felsenberg| date=1989| publisher=In 70mm| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–2009===
The [[Arriflex 535]] camera was released in 1990, followed by the Arriflex 535B and the Arriflex 16SR 3 in 1992. The [[Arriflex 435]] was released in 1994.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cinematographers.nl/CAMERAS2.html| title=Modern Motion Picture Cameras| publisher=IEC| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cbadoc.be/images/manuals/ARRI16SR3_manual.pdf| title=Instruction Manual| publisher=CBADOC| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arri partnered with [[Carl Zeiss AG]] in order to develop and manufacture advanced lenses for the motion picture industry. In 1998, Arri released the Ultra Prime lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cinematechnic.com/optics/arri_zeiss_ultra_primes| title=Lens Profiles - Arri Zeiss Ultra Prime Lenses| publisher=Cinema Technic| access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the [[Arrilaser]], a postproduction film recorder, began in 1997 and it was released for beta testing in 1998.&lt;ref name=cow&gt;{{cite web| url=https://library.creativecow.net/kaufman_debra/SciTech_Award_ARRILASER/1| title=The Academy Award of Merit goes to... the ARRILASER Film Recorder| author=Debra Kaufman| publisher=Creative Cow| access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://variety.com/1998/digital/news/digital-domain-tests-new-laser-recorder-1117489673/| title=Digital Domain tests new laser recorder| author=Eric J. Olson| date=December 22, 1998| publisher=Variety| access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Arri purchased the company [[Moviecam]] and developed [[Arricam]], a 35mm camera platform. In 2003, Arri developed its first digital camera, the Arriflex D-20,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.broadcaststore.com/store/model_detail.cfm?id=805105| title=ARRI D-20| publisher=Broadcast Store| access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later evolved into the [[Arriflex D-21|D-21]]. The camera used a 35mm [[CMOS]] sensor (instead of [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) and allowed cinematographers to utilize standard 35mm lenses. This technology was further developed and improved for the [[Arri Alexa]] camera.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Arri revealed its Arriscan prototype during IBC 2003. The 16mm/35mm film scanner worked alongside the Arrilaser to support the increasingly popular digital intermediate route through postproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/news-articles/arriscan-arrive-summer-2004/414876| title=Arriscan To Arrive Summer 2004| date=February 14, 2012| publisher=Creative Planet| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Arriscan became a widely used tool for film restoration work and was recognized with a Scientific and Engineering Academy Award in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1467768275528| title=2009 (82nd)| publisher=Oscars Awards Database| access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arri released the Master Prime lenses in 2005, designed for a super-fast aperture of T1.3 without breathing and distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://library.creativecow.net/kaufman_debra/Sci-Tech-Zeiss/1| title=The SciTech Award Goes to...

The Arrilaser 2 was released in 2009, with new client-server architecture and speeds twice as fast as the original model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.postmagazine.com/Press-Center/Daily-News/2009/ARRI-DELIVERS-ARRILASER-2-FILM-RECORDER.aspx| title=Arri delivers Arrilaser 2 film recorder| date=July 1, 2009| publisher=Post Magazine| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Arrilaser was recognized with an Academy Award of Merit.&lt;ref name=cow/&gt;

===2010–present===
In 2010, the [[Arri Alexa]] camera was released. The camera had the ability to compress 1080p footage to ProRes [[QuickTime]] formats and allowed direct-to-edit workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/04/07/arris-alexa-busts-out-native-prores-recording-plans-for-red-sm/| title=ARRI's ALEXA busts out native ProRes recording, plans for RED smiting| author=Chad Mumm| date=April 7, 2010| publisher=Engadget| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, models were added to the range including the Alexa Plus, Alexa Studio and Alexa M, which was designed to get the camera closer to the action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/45733-unusual-camera-moves-with-the-alexa-m/#.V217lJMrJTY| title=Unusual Camera Moves With the Alexa M| author=Michael Murie| date=May 16, 2012| publisher=Film Maker Magazine| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alexa Plus 4:3, like the Alexa Studio, allowed the full area of the sensor to be used with anamorphic lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2012/04/arri-debuts-alexa-plus-43/| title=ARRI Announces ALEXA Plus 4:3| author=Bryant Frazer| date=April 26, 2012| publisher=Studio Daily| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16mm Arriflex 416 camera and Ultra Prime 16 lenses were used in the filming of the 2010 film, ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theasc.com/ac_magazine/December2010/BlackSwan/page1.php| title=Danse Macabre| publisher=The American Society of Cinematographers| author=Stephen Pizzello| access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arri announced a strategic partnership with Zeiss and Fujinon in 2010 to create new lenses that incorporated enhanced electronic lens data transfer in order to simplify visual effects workflows in postproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://plsn.com/on-the-move/5604-arri-zeiss-and-fujinon-announce-partnership.html| title=ARRI, Zeiss and Fujinon Announce Partnership| date=April 14, 2010| publisher=PLSN| access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.definitionmagazine.com/journal/2010/4/19/three-major-lens-manufacturers-announce-partnership.html| title=Three Major Lens Manufacturers Announce Partnership| date=April 19, 2010| publisher=Definition Magazine| access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arri/Fujinon Alura Zooms were released that same year, while the Arri/Zeiss Master Anamorphic lens series was released in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2010/04/arrifujinon-alura-the-next-generation-of-zooms/| title=Arri/Fujinon Alura: The Net Generation of Zooms| date=April 12, 2010| publisher=Studio Daily| access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cinematechnic.com/optics/arri_zeiss_master_anamorphic| title=CinemaTechnic Lens Profiles - ARRI Zeiss Master Anamorphic Lenses| publisher=Cinema Technic| access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austin Cartridge Company''' was an Austin Powder Company subsidiary manufacturing cartridge [[ammunition]] for [[small arms]]. The company made [[shotgun shell]]s and [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] cartridges from 1895 until purchased by [[Western Cartridge Company]] in 1907.

==History==
Austin Powder Company was founded in 1833 by brothers Daniel, Alvin, Lorenzo, Henry, and Linus Austin of [[Wilmington, Vermont]]. After exploring the market for [[gunpowder]] on the [[American frontier|western frontier]], they built and operated a gunpowder mill at Old Forge on the [[Cuyahoga River]] near [[Akron, Ohio]]. Early production was largely used as blasting powder for [[coal mining]] but some was sold as sporting rifle powder. In 1884 the company became the exclusive supplier of gunpowder for shotgun shells manufactured by Chamberlain Cartridge Company.&lt;ref name=rfb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/10/Austin-Powder-Company.html|title=History of Austin Powder Company|publisher=Reference for Business|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin Powder Company built the [[company town]] of [[Glenwillow, Ohio]] in 1892, and established the Austin Cartridge Company there in 1895 manufacturing ''Crack Shot'', ''Club Sporting'', and ''Champion Ducking'' shotgun shells.&lt;ref name=rfb/&gt; The Union Cap and Chemical Company was formed in 1900 as a joint venture of Austin Cartridge Company and Western Cartridge Company to manufacture [[blasting cap]]s, [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|primers]], and .22 and .32 caliber rimfire cartridges. The Union Cap and Chemical Company trademark was a [[Maltese cross]] and a UCC [[headstamp]] appeared on the rimfire cartridges.&lt;ref name=cce&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldammo.com/november03.htm |title=Those elusive Maltese cross boxes |last= |first= |website=The Cartridge Collector's Exchange |publisher= |accessdate=14 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first .22 rimfire cartridges manufactured by Western Cartridge Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://22box-id.com/Dunn/Western.pdf |title=.22 Boxes of the U.S.A. |last=Dunn |first=Tony |website= |publisher=Roger E. Huegel |accessdate=14 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin Cartridge Company was sold to Western Cartridge Company in 1907 as Austin Powder Company reorganized to focus on production of blasting [[explosive]]s.&lt;ref name=rfb/&gt; Western Cartridge Company used the Maltese cross trade mark until replacing it with a diamond trade mark during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=cce/&gt;

An '''azimuth compass''' (or '''azimuthal''' compass) is a nautical instrument used to measure the magnetic [[azimuth]], the angle of the arc on the horizon between the direction of the sun or some other celestial object and the magnetic north. This can be compared to the true azimuth obtained by astronomical observation to determine the [[magnetic declination]], the amount by which the reading of a ship's compass must be adjusted to obtain an accurate reading. Azimuth compasses were important in the period before development of the reliable chronometers needed to determine a vessel's exact position from astronomical observations.
{{TOC limit|2}}
==Theory==
[[Image:Azimuth-Altitude schematic.svg|thumb|The azimuth is the angle formed between a reference direction (North) and a line from the observer to a point of interest projected on the same plane as the reference direction]]
In navigation, the true [[azimuth]] of a heavenly body is the arc of the horizon between the point where a vertical plane containing the observer and the heavenly body intersects the horizon and the direction of [[true north]]. The magnetic azimuth is the arc between the point on the horizon below the heavenly body and the direction of magnetic north.{{sfn|Harris|1875|p=152}}

When the latitude and date are known, the bearing of the sun at sunrise or sunset relative to true north can be readily determined.{{sfn|Turner|1980|p=34}}
If the sun is observed at some time between sunrise and sunset, its altitude must also be recorded to calculate the true azimuth.
The true azimuth may be compared to the magnetic azimuth to find the magnetic declination, the angle between the direction that the compass indicates as north and the true north direction.{{sfn|Bowditch|Bowditch|1841|p=158}}

==Compass designs==

An azimuth compass is a magnetic [[compass]] where the circumference of the card is divided into 360 degrees.
It has  two sights, diametrically opposite each other, through which the sun, planet or star is viewed. 
The sun is typically observed when the sun's center is about one solar diameter above the horizon.{{sfn|Baharie|1844|p=161}}{{efn|When the lowest part of the sun is slightly more than half of the sun's diameter above the horizon, the center of the sun will in fact lie almost on the horizon. This is due to the [[refraction]] of the sun's rays by the atmosphere.{{sfn|Norie|Coleman|1852|p=209}} }}
Typically the compass will have a stop in the side of the box, which the observer pushes when the sun is lined up in the sights. This fixes the compass card, from which the magnetic azimuth  or amplitude can be read.{{sfn|Bowditch|Bowditch|1841|p=158}}{{efn|The magnetic amplitude refers to the arc from the object's projection on the horizon to the magnetic east or west.{{sfn|Harris|1875|p=365}} }}

The sights may consist of two vanes, one with a narrow slit and the other with a wider slit bisected by a thread. The observer looks towards the sun, seen through a dark glass, lining up the thread and the narrow slit on the center of the sun. Another arrangement has a vertical bar on one vane and a slit bisected by a thread on the other. 
The instrument is aligned with the sun when the shadow of the thread falls on the vertical bar.{{sfn|Bowditch|Bowditch|1841|p=158}}
Yet another design has a magnifying glass on one vane that focuses the rays of the sun on the opposite vane.{{sfn|Norie|Coleman|1852|p=220}}

Meridional azimuth compasses included a universal equatorial sundial.
By setting the date and latitude, the true north and the magnetic variation could be read from the instrument without the need for calculation.{{sfn|Falconer|2006|p=27}}
With the iron vessels introduced in the 19th century the azimuth compass would be mounted on a pedestal at a neutral point where the readings would not be affected by magnetism of the vessel.{{sfn|Jenkins|1869|p=6}}

==Applications==

Early navigators in the northern hemisphere could calculate latitude relatively easily when the night sky was clear by observing the elevation of [[Polaris]], a star that is very close to the north [[celestial pole]].
However, calculating longitude was impossible until [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]]s that could keep time accurately throughout a long voyage were developed.
In 1688 King [[Philip III of Spain]] (1578–1621) offered a large reward to anyone who could find a practical solution to determining longitude.{{sfn|Findlen|2004|p=232}}

A novel approach, apparently originating with the Jesuit missionary [[Christoforo Borri]], was to create charts that mapped points of equal magnetic declination.{{efn|Magnetic declination is the angle between true north, the direction of the pole star, and magnetic north as indicated by a magnetic compass.}} With an accurate reading of the latitude and the magnetic declination the navigator could determine their longitude using the chart.{{sfn|Findlen|2004|p=233}}
A drawback to this approach is that magnetic variations change over time, so the charts would need constant revision.{{sfn|Findlen|2004|p=237}}

The azimuth compass still had great value in letting the master of a ship determine how far the magnetic compass varied from true north, so he could set a more accurate course while following a line of constant latitude or using [[dead reckoning]] to navigate.
In 1795 a British First Rate ship would have up to eight compasses, of which one was an improved steering compass. This azimuth compass may have been specialized for the purpose of measuring magnetic variation through taking readings from stars, and used to determine the accuracy of the other compasses.{{sfn|Lavery|1987|p=25}}

==Instruments==
[[Image:Boussole marine.png|thumb|right|An example of an azimuth compass. The visors of unequal height allow sighting of objects above the horizon.]]
An azimuthal compass was described in 1736, but the inventor was not named.{{sfn|Falconer|2006|p=27}}
Azimuth compasses were sometimes large, with a brass case mounted in gimbals containing the rose, and sights on top of the case.
Walter Hayes, Richard Glynne and [[Benjamin Ayres (instrument maker)|Benjamin Ayres]] (died c. 1775) made accurate large azimuth compasses.{{sfn|Turner|1980|p=34}}
[[Henry Gregory (instrument maker)|Henry Gregory]] (1744–1782) had an establishment known as "The Azimuth Compass" in [[Leadenhall Street]], London.{{sfn|Bot. of Henry Gregory... Bodleian Library}}
He supplied an azimuth compass designed by [[Gowin Knight]] to [[Joseph Banks]] for the voyage of [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']] commanded by Captain [[James Cook]] in 1772.{{sfn|Carter|1988|p=319}}
The instrument cost ₤80.0.0.{{sfn|Carter|1988|p=551}}

On 6 February 1808 the American sealer ''Topaz'', commanded by Captain [[Mayhew Folger]], arrived at [[Pitcairn Island]] to take on fresh water. There he found thirty five survivors of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] led by [[John Adams (mutineer)|John Adams]], who gave Folger the [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'''s]] azimuth compass and chronometer.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=9}}

[[Image:Benzene Toluene and ortho-,meta-,and para-xylene.svg|frame|Structural diagrams of the BTX hydrocarbons.]]
In the [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]] and [[petrochemical]] industries, the initialism '''BTX''' refers to mixtures of [[benzene]], [[toluene]], and the three [[Xylene|xylene isomers]], all of which are [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s. The xylene isomers are distinguished by the designations ''ortho''&amp;thinsp;– (or ''o''&amp;thinsp;–), ''meta''&amp;thinsp;– (or ''m''&amp;thinsp;–), and ''para''&amp;thinsp;– (or ''p''&amp;thinsp;–) as indicated in the adjacent diagram. If [[ethylbenzene]] is included, the mixture is sometimes referred to as '''BTEX'''.

The BTX aromatics are very important petrochemical materials. Global consumption of benzene, estimated at more than 40,000,000 tons in 2010, showed an unprecedented growth of more than 3,000,000 tons from the level seen in 2009. Likewise, the para-xylene consumption showed unprecedented growth in 2010, growing by 2,800,000 tons, a full ten percent growth from 2009.&lt;ref name=Chem-Systems-2010&gt;[http://www.chemsystems.com/about/cs/news/items/PPE%20PCMD%20Aromatics%202011.cfm The Future of Benzene and Para-Xylene after Unprecedented Growth In 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005185308/http://www.chemsystems.com/about/cs/news/items/PPE%20PCMD%20Aromatics%202011.cfm |date=2011-10-05 }}.

Benzene, toluene, and xylenes can be made by various processes. However, most BTX production is based on the recovery of aromatics derived from the [[catalytic reforming]] of [[Petroleum naphtha|naphtha]] in a [[Petroleum refining processes|petroleum refinery]].&lt;ref name=Chem-Systems/&gt;&lt;ref name=IEA-Book&gt;International Energy Agency (2006).[https://books.google.com/books?id=s0spIzYtrCAC&amp;pg=PA414&amp;lpg=PA414&amp;dq=Benzene+toluene+xylene+production&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ttMkz7Hl5x&amp;sig=_01oioDJ3HXTVmXXnpA8bPdzf94&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wYFjT4uVIJCFsALapc2cCw&amp;ved=0CIUBEOgBMAw4UA#v=onepage&amp;q=Benzene%20toluene%20xylene%20production&amp;f=false ''Energy Technology Perspectives'']. 1st Edition. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Page 414. {{ISBN|08070-1556-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalytic reforming usually utilizes a feedstock naphtha that contains non-aromatic [[hydrocarbon]]s with 6 to 11 or 12 [[carbon]] [[atom]]s and typically produces a '''''reformate''''' product containing C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylenes) as well as [[Alkane|paraffin]]s and heavier aromatics containing 9 to 11 or 12 carbon atoms.

Another process for producing BTX aromatics involves the [[steam cracking]] of hydrocarbons which typically produces a [[Petroleum naphtha#Cracked naphthas|cracked naphtha]] product commonly referred to as '''''[[pyrolysis gasoline]]''''', '''''[[pyrolysis gas]]''''' or '''''[[pygas]]'''''.  The pyrolysis gasoline typically consists of C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; aromatics, heavier aromatics containing 9 to 11 or 12 carbon atoms, and non-aromatic [[cyclic hydrocarbon]]s ([[naphthenes]]) containing 6 or more carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=Chem-Systems/&gt;&lt;ref name=IEA-Book/&gt;

The adjacent table compares the BTX content of pyrolysis gasoline produced at standard cracking severity or at medium cracking severity with the BTX content of catalytic reformate produced by either a continuous catalytic regenerative (CCR) reformer or by a semi-regenerative catalytic reformer. About 70 percent of the global production of benzene is by extraction from either reformate or pyrolysis gasoline.&lt;ref name=Chem-Systems/&gt;

The BTX aromatics can be extracted from catalytic reformate or from pyrolysis gasoline by many different methods. Most of those methods, but not all, involve the use of a [[solvent]] either for [[liquid-liquid extraction]] or [[extractive distillation]]. Many different solvents are suitable, including [[sulfolane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), [[furfural]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[tetraethylene glycol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[dimethylsulfoxide]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;OS), and [[N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;NO).

Below is a schematic flow diagram of one method, involving extractive distillation, for extraction of the BTX aromatics from a catalytic reformate:&lt;ref name=BTX-Chain/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:BTX-ReformateExtraction.png|center|frame|Schematic flow diagram for the extraction of BTX aromatics from a catalytic reformate.]]

==Petrochemicals produced from BTX==

There are a very large number of petrochemicals produced from the BTX aromatics. The following diagram shows the chains leading from the BTX components to some of the petrochemicals that can be produced from those components:&lt;ref name=BTX-Chain/&gt;

[[Image:Halogenmetalldampflampe.jpg|thumb|A [[metal halide lamp]] with a bipin cap]]
A '''bipin''' or '''bi-pin''', (sometimes referred to as two-pin, bipin cap or bipin socket), is a type of [[light socket|lamp fitting]].  They are included in the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard "IEC 60061 Lamp caps and holders together with gauges for the control of interchangeability and safety". They are used on many small [[incandescent light bulb]]s (especially [[halogen lamp]]s), and for starters on some types of [[fluorescent light]]s.

Some sockets have pins placed closer together, preventing the low-power bulbs they use from being replaced by bulbs that are too high [[Electric power|power]], which may generate excessive heat and possibly cause a fire.  These are sometimes called "mini-bipin".  Where the terminals of the lamp are bent back onto the sides of the base of the bulb, this forms a [[wedge base]], often used in small bulbs for [[automotive lighting]].

The bi-pin base was invented by [[Reginald Fessenden]] for the [[1893 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]].  After [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] won the [[contract]] to wire and illuminate the first electrified fair with [[alternating current|AC]] instead of arch-rival [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[direct current|DC]], Edison and his [[General Electric]] company refused to allow his [[patent]]ed [[Edison screw]]-base bulbs to be used.  Westinghouse overcame this by developing the bi-pin base for use at the fair.&lt;ref&gt;*{{US patent|543280}}, incandescent electric lamp&lt;/ref&gt;

The suffix after the G indicates the pin spread; the G dates to the use of Glass for the original bulbs.  GU usually also indicates that the lamp provides a mechanism for physical support by the [[luminaire]]: in some cases, each pin has a short section of larger diameter at the end (sometimes described as a "peg" rather than a "pin"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/28/led-lights-information |title=Converting to LED lights: everything you need to know |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 March 2014  |author=Simon Brammer |accessdate= 20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the socket allows the bulb to lock into place by [[Twist-locking connector|twisting it]]; in others, the base of the lamp has a groove which can be held by a spring or clip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osram.com/osram_com/Tools_%26_Services/Training_%26_Knowledge/FAQ/General_Lighting/Halogen_lamps/index.html#answ61 |title=index |publisher=Osram.com |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429065219/http://www.osram.com/osram_com/Tools_%26_Services/Training_%26_Knowledge/FAQ/General_Lighting/Halogen_lamps/index.html#answ61 |archivedate=April 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[lowercase]] "q" at the end of the designation indicates that it is a quad-pin base, with two bi-pin pairs.  These are used with [[compact fluorescent]] tubes that plug into a [[light fixture]] that has a permanent ballast.

There are also double-ended halogen and fluorescent tubes with one pin at each end, and high-output fluorescents with recessed or shrouded contacts, which are not covered here.

[[Electrospray]]
[[Electrospray ionization]]

'''Bio-[[electrospray]]ing''' is a new technology that enables the deposition of living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] on various targets with a resolution that depends on cell size and not on the jetting phenomenon. It is envisioned that "unhealthy cells would draw a different charge at the needle from healthy ones, and could be identified by the [[mass spectrometer]]", with tremendous implications in the health care industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suwan N Jayasinghe | title=Direct cell engineering reaches the jet age | journal=Materials Today | volume=10 | issue=6 | pages=60 | year=2007 | doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70159-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early versions of bio-electrosprays were employed in several areas of research, most notably self-assembly of carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suwan N Jayasinghe | title=An advanced jet-based approach to processing nanotubes | journal=Physica E | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=17–26 | year=2006 | doi=10.1016/j.physe.2005.08.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suwan N Jayasinghe | title=A novel technique for forming self-assembled nanotube structures | journal=Fullerenes, nanotubes, and carbon nanostructures | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=67–81 | year=2006 | doi=10.1080/15363830500538524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the self-assembly mechanism is not clear yet, "elucidating electrosprays as a competing nanofabrication route for forming self-assemblies with a wide range of nanomaterials in the nanoscale for top-down based bottom-up assembly of structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suwan N Jayasinghe | title=Self-assembled nanostructures via electrospraying | journal=Physica E | volume=33 | issue=2 | pages=398–406 | year=2006 | doi=10.1016/j.physe.2006.04.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future research may reveal important interactions between migrating cells and self-assembled nanostructures. ''Such nano-assemblies formed by means of this top-down approach could be explored as a bottom-up methodology for encouraging cell migration to those architectures for forming cell patterns to nano-electronics, which are a few examples, respectively.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suwan N Jayasinghe | title=Electrospray self-assembly: An emerging jet-based route for directly forming nanoscaled structures | journal=Physica E | volume=40 | issue=9 | pages=2911–2915 | year=2008 | doi=10.1016/j.physe.2008.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 1''' ('''CBERS-1'''), also known as '''Ziyuan I-01''' or '''Ziyuan 1A''', is a [[remote sensing]] satellite which was operated as part of the [[China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program]]me between the [[China National Space Administration]] and [[Brazil]]'s [[National Institute for Space Research]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; The first CBERS satellite to fly, it was launched by China in 1999.&lt;ref name="launchlog"/&gt;

CBERS-1 was a {{convert|1450|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft built by the [[China Academy of Space Technology]] and based on the [[Phoenix-Eye 1]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; The spacecraft was powered by a single solar array, providing 1,100&amp;nbsp;watts of electricity for the satellite's systems.&lt;ref name="EOP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/description_cbers1_2_2b.php|title=CBERS-1, 2 and 2B Description|publisher=INPE|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument suite aboard the CBERS-1 spacecraft consisted of three systems: the Wide Field Imager (WFI) produced visible-light to near-infrared images with a resolution of {{convert|260|m}} and a swath width of {{convert|890|km}}; a high-resolution CCD camera was used for multispectral imaging at a resolution of {{convert|20|m}} with a swath width of {{convert|113|km}}; the third instrument, the Infrared Multispectral Scanner (IMS), had a resolution of {{convert|80|m}} and a swath width of {{convert|120|km}}.&lt;ref name="cameras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/cameras_cbers1_2_2b.php|title=CBERS-1, 2 and 2B Cameras|publisher=INPE|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Long March 4B|Chang Zheng 4B]] carrier rocket, operated by the [[China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology]], was used to launch CBERS-1. The launch took place at 03:15 UTC on 14 October 1999, using [[Taiyuan Launch Complex 7|Launch Complex 7]] at the [[Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center|Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre]].&lt;ref name="launchlog"/&gt; The satellite was successfully placed into a [[sun-synchronous orbit]].

CBERS-1 was decommissioned in September 2003, almost four years after launch.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt; The derelict satellite remains in orbit; as of 30 November 2013 it is in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|779|km|mi}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|785|km|mi}}, 98.34&amp;nbsp;degrees inclination and a [[orbital period|period]] of 100.35&amp;nbsp;minutes. The orbit has a [[semimajor axis]] of {{convert|7153.45|km|mi}}, and [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.0004025.&lt;ref name="n2yo"/&gt;

[[File:Cobalt Qube 3 Front.jpg|thumb|[[Cobalt Qube]] 3 - a computer [[server appliance]] (2002, discontinued)]]

A '''computer appliance''' is a [[computer]] with software or [[firmware]] that is specifically designed to provide a specific computing resource. Such devices became known as ''appliances'' because of the similarity in role or management to a [[home appliance]], which are generally ''closed and sealed'', and are not serviceable by the user or owner. The hardware and software are delivered as an integrated product and may even be pre-configured before delivery to a customer, to provide a turn-key solution for a particular application. Unlike general purpose [[computer]]s, appliances are generally not designed to allow the customers to change the software and the underlying [[operating system]], or to flexibly reconfigure the hardware.

Another form of appliance is the [[virtual appliance]], which has similar functionality to a dedicated hardware appliance, but is distributed as a software [[virtual machine]] image for a hypervisor-equipped device.

==Overview==
Traditionally, [[software applications]] run on top of a general-purpose [[operating system]], which uses the hardware resources of the computer (primarily memory, disk storage, processing power, and networking bandwidth) to meet the computing needs of the user. The main issue with the traditional model is related to complexity. It is complex to integrate the operating system and applications with a hardware platform, and complex to support it afterwards.

By tightly constraining the variations of the hardware and software, the appliance becomes easily deployable, and can be used without nearly as wide (or deep) IT knowledge. Additionally, when problems and errors appear, the supporting staff very rarely needs to explore them deeply to understand the matter thoroughly. The staff needs merely training on the appliance management software to be able to resolve most of problems.

In all forms of the computer appliance model, customers benefit from easy operations. The appliance has exactly one combination of hardware and operating system and application software, which has been pre-installed at the factory. This prevents customers from needing to perform complex integration work, and dramatically simplifies troubleshooting. In fact, this "turnkey operation" characteristic is the driving benefit that customers seek when purchasing appliances.

To be considered an appliance, the (hardware) device needs to be integrated with software, and both are supplied as a package.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} This distinguishes appliances from "home grown" solutions, or solutions requiring complex implementations by integrators or [[Value-added reseller]]s (VARs).

The appliance approach helps to [[wikt:decouple|decouple]] the various systems and applications, for example in the data center. Once a resource is decoupled, in theory it can be also centralized to become shared among many systems, centrally managed and optimized, all without requiring changes to any other system.

==Tradeoffs of the computer appliance approach==
The major{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} disadvantage of deploying a computer appliance is that since they are designed to supply a specific resource, they most often include a customized operating system running over specialized hardware, neither of which are likely to be compatible with the other systems previously deployed. Customers lose flexibility.

On the other hand, a proprietary embedded operating system, or operating system within an application, can make the appliance much more secure from common cyber attacks. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Types of appliances==
The variety of computer appliances reflects the wide range of computing resources they provide to applications.  Some examples:
;Storage appliances: provide massive amounts of storage and additional higher level functionality (ex: [[Disk mirroring]] and [[Data striping]]) for multiple attached systems using the transparent local [[storage area networks computer]] paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.networkworld.com/topics/sans.html SAN Data Center]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502092915/http://www.networkworld.com/topics/sans.html |date=2005-05-02 }}''- Network World&lt;/ref&gt;
;Network appliances: are general purpose [[Router (computing)|router]]s&lt;ref&gt;''[http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/routers/g/bldef_router.htm Routers]''- About.com&lt;/ref&gt; which provide [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] protection, [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS), [[message oriented middleware|messaging]], access to specialized networking protocols (like the [[ebXML]] Message Service) and bandwidth [[multiplexing]] for the multiple systems they front-end.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/47861/network-appliance Definition of:network appliance]''- Pcmag.com&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Backup appliance]]s and [[Backup and Disaster Recovery appliance]]s: computer appliances that are integrated backup software and backup targets, sometimes with hypervisors to support local DR of protected servers. They are often a gateway to a full DRaaS solution.
;[[Firewall (computing)|Firewall-]] and [[Security appliance]]s: computer appliances that are designed to protect computer networks from unwanted traffic.
;IIoT and MES Gateway appliances: Computer appliances that are designed to translate data bidirectionally between control systems and enterprise systems.  Proprietary, embedded, firmware applications running on the appliance use point-to-point connections to translate data between field devices in their native [[automation protocol]]s and [[Manufacturing execution system|MES]] systems through their [[API]]s, [[ODBC]], or [[REST]]ful interfaces.
;[[Anti-spam appliances]]: for [[e-mail spam]]
;[[Software appliance]]s: a software application that might be combined with [[just enough operating system]] (JeOS) for it to run on industry standard hardware or in a virtual machine. In essence, the software distribution or the firmware that is running a computer appliance.
;[[Virtual appliance|Virtual machine appliances]]: consist of a "hypervisor style" embedded operating system running on appliance hardware. The hypervisor layer is matched to the hardware of the appliance, and cannot be varied by the customer, but the customer may load other operating systems and applications onto the appliance in the form of virtual machines.

==Consumer appliances==
Aside from its deployment within data centers, many computer appliances are directly used by the general public. These include:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

*[[Residential gateway]]
*[[Network-attached storage]] (NAS)
*[[Video game console]]

==Appliances in industrial automation==
The world of [[industrial automation]] has been rich in appliances.  These appliances have been hardened to withstand temperature and vibration extremes.  These appliances are also highly configurable, enabling customization to meet a wide variety of applications.  The key benefits of an appliance in automation are:
# '''Reduced [[downtime]]''' - a failed appliance is typically replaced with a COTS "[[commercial off-the-shelf]]" replacement and its task is quickly and easily reloaded from a backup.
# '''Highly scalable''' - appliances are typically targeted solutions for an area of a plant or process.  As the requirements change, scalability is achieved through the installation of another appliance.  Automation concepts are easily replicated throughout the enterprise by standardizing on appliances to perform the needed tasks, as opposed to the development of custom automation schemes for each task.
# '''Low TCO ([[total cost of ownership]])''' - appliances are developed, tested and supported by automation product vendors and undergo a much broader level of quality testing than custom designed automation solutions.  The use of appliances in automation reduce the level of testing needed in each individual application.
# '''Reduced design time''' - appliances perform specific functions and although they are highly configurable, they are typically self documenting.  This enables appliance based solutions to be transferred from engineer to engineer with minimal need for training and documentation.

Types of automation appliances:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
# '''PLC (programmable logic controller)''' - [[Programmable logic controller]]s are appliances that are typically used for discrete control and offer a wide range of Input and Output options.  They are configured through standardized programming languages such as IEC-1131.
# '''SLC (single loop controller)''' - [[PID controller|Single loop controllers]] are appliances that monitor an input variable and effect change on a control output (manipulated variable) to hold the input variable to a setpoint.
# '''PAC (programmable automation controller)''' - Programmable automation controllers are appliances that embody properties of both PLCs and SLCs enabling the integration of both analog and discrete control.
# '''Universal gateway''' - A [[universal gateway]] appliance has the ability to communicate with a variety of devices through their respective [[communication protocol]]s, and will affect data transactions between them.  This in increasingly important as manufacturing strives to improve agility, quality, production rates, production costs and reduce downtime through enhanced M2M ([[machine to machine]]) communications.
# '''EATMs (Enterprise Appliance Transaction Modules)''' - Enterprise appliance transaction modules are appliances that affect data transactions from plant floor automation systems to enterprise business systems.  They communicate to plant floor equipment through various vendor automation protocols, and communicate to business systems through database communication protocols such as JMS ([[Java Message Service]]) and SQL ([[SQL|Structured Query Language]]).

==Internal structure==
{{original research|section|date=September 2011}}
There are several [[design patterns]] adopted by computer appliance vendors, a few of which are shown below.  Since the whole concept of an appliance rests on keeping such implementation details away from the end user, it is difficult to match these patterns to specific appliances, particularly since they can and do change without affecting external capabilities or performance.
# '''Special chip'''  - the vendor builds an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]], without any separate "software" or operating system.  The appliance has a limited interface, usually terminal console or web-based, to allow some basic configuration by the IT staff.  The manufacturer often provides some way of accessing deeper configuration mechanisms. [[Azul Systems]]' Vega 3 Java Compute Appliance is an example; special hardware modifications to the chip enable Java application scaling.
# '''Special software kernel'''  - the vendor uses or creates a general-purpose computer, and designs a new operating system that integrates the application into the operating system. [[Cisco Systems|Cisco's]] [[Cisco IOS|IOS]] is an example; the Unix-like operating system has firewall functions and network/firewall configuration commands built into it. Sometimes, the device is also sealed, so the consumer has no access to reinstall the operating system or replace it with another operating system. The consumer may also be restricted to a small group of configuration commands, while the more detailed and lower level functions of the operating system are only available to the vendor. The more this "locked down" approach is carried out, the closer this type of device comes to appearing like an ASIC device.
# '''Specialized application'''  - off-the-shelf computers and operating systems are used, but the user interface and "box" are designed so the user cannot access anything on the computer, except for the application interface that the vendor has created. Since the underlying computing architecture is locked down and essentially invisible, it becomes difficult to discern that the device really functions on top of general purpose hardware and operating systems. Linux, and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] to a lesser degree, has become the operating system of choice for this type of appliance. Recently the term [[software appliance]] has also been used to describe such a pre-packaged, black-box combination.
# '''Virtual appliance''' - here the hardware itself has disappeared entirely and become a so-called [[virtual appliance]] (also known as a virtual software appliance) using any one of a number of [[virtual machine]] technologies. Within this virtual machine is essentially the same stack of software plus the operating system as in the "specialized application" alternative.

Sometimes, these techniques are mixed. For example, a [[Virtual Private Network|VPN]] appliance might contain a limited access software firewall running on Linux, with an encryption ASIC to speed up VPN access.

Some computer appliances use [[solid state storage]], while others use a hard drive to load an operating system. Again, the two methods might be mixed—an ASIC print server might allow an optional hard drive for job queueing, or a Linux-based device may encode Linux in [[firmware]], so that a hard drive is not needed to load the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Smith, Bob |author2=Hardin, John A |author3=Phillips, Graham |author4=Pierce, Bill | title=Linux Appliance Design: A Hands-On Guide to Building Linux Appliances | date= | publisher=No Starch Press | location= | isbn=1-59327-140-9 | pages=xvii | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVu0ax6C3uIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22network+appliance%22+date:2003-2009&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=QE5mXmjxjbgmQtw11DsRYlnewnE#PPR17,M1  | accessdate=2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DataSplice''', LLC is a [[mobile software]] company headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado and offers [[mobile applications]] which extend [[enterprise systems]], including packaged software for [[Enterprise Asset Management]] (EAM) and [[computerized maintenance management system]]s (CMMS). The software provides an interface from these systems to handhelds, [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s and mobile computers. It may also be used on a desktop system as a unified/simplified interface for multiple systems.
[[File:DataSplice Architecture.gif|thumb|DataSplice Architecture]]

The software offered is a mobile [[middleware]], with an emphasis on [[IBM]]'s Maximo EAM system. Its primary client base is focused on utilities, gas/oil, defense, aerospace and other markets which utilizes field service management systems which require tracking, asset management and regulatory accountability.

DataSplice does not use a proprietary software platform, but rather utilizes the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI) of Microsoft.NET framework’s [[ADO.NET]], which allows for connectivity to different database systems such as [[MySQL]] and [[Oracle database|Oracle]]. The [[extensible]] system consists of three components, including a remote client (for handheld and/or desktop use), a server which communicates with the primary EAM, and an administration client for configuring the system.

==History==
Originally known as Optimization Resources, which was founded in 1991, DataSplice was spun off as both a company and product in 2001. The original management and development staff continue to be engaged in daily operations. DataSplice is a privately held company.

==Products==
The product's main emphasis is providing a simplified mobile interface into IBM Maximo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Solutions Directory |url=http://www-304.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?solution=37287&amp;lc=en&amp;stateCd=P&amp;page=2&amp;print=true |work=IBM - DataSplice Mobile Integration |publisher=IBM |accessdate=28 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927100759/http://www-304.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?solution=37287&amp;lc=en&amp;stateCd=P&amp;page=2&amp;print=true |archivedate=27 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The product consists of three components: Remote Client, Administration Client and the Server. The primary modules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DataSplice Mobile Computing Solutions: Inventory and Work Orders |url=http://www.fieldtechnologiesonline.com/article.mvc/DataSplice-Mobile-Computing-Solutions-Invento-0001 |work=Field Technologies Online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216181518/http://fieldtechnologiesonline.com/article.mvc/DataSplice-Mobile-Computing-Solutions-Invento-0001 |archivedate=2010-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are Inventory, Work Orders, Inspections, Condition Monitoring and Asset Management.

The product's remote client, is [[HTML5 in mobile devices|HTML5]] compliant, and as such is platform agnostic. Supported systems include iOS (iPad), Android (Droid), and Windows Mobile and 8 (Surface, Phone and Desktop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile Workers Demanding Technology Options|url=http://www.prlog.org/12016455-mobile-field-workers-demanding-technology-options.html|publisher=PRLOG|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The remote client is also able to utilize bar code scanners, mobile printers, and RFID readers.

In 2010, DataSplice introduced InspecTMI, a field inspections and operator rounds mobile collection system geared toward highly regulated inspection scenarios, such as substations, power generation, and safety inspections.

[[File:VFPt cylindrical magnet thumb.svg|thumb|Magnetic Field of a simple dipole bar magnet]]
A '''dipole magnet''' is a [[magnet]] in which opposite poles (''i.e.'', North and South poles) are on opposite sides of the magnet.  The simplest example of a dipole magnet is a ''bar magnet''.

==Dipole magnets in accelerators==
[[File:Hetdipole.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dipole magnet from the [[Advanced Photon Source]]]]
[[File:Aust.-Synchrotron,-Storage-Ring-Magnets,-14.06.2007.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The larger yellow [[electromagnet]] shown here is a dipole magnet used to bend the [[electron beam]] and produce [[synchrotron radiation]] at the [[Australian Synchrotron]]]]
In [[particle accelerator]]s, a  '''dipole magnet''' is the [[electromagnet]] used to create a homogeneous [[magnetic field]] over some distance. Particle motion in that field will be circular in a plane perpendicular to the field and [[collinear]] to the direction of particle motion and free in the direction orthogonal to it.
Thus, a particle injected into a dipole magnet will travel on a circular or [[Helix|helical]] trajectory. By adding several dipole sections on the same plane, the bending radial effect of the beam increases.

In [[accelerator physics]], dipole magnets are used to realize ''bends'' in the design trajectory (or 'orbit') of the particles, as in circular accelerators. Other uses include:
* Injection of particles into the accelerator
* Ejection of particles from the accelerator
* Correction of [[orbit]] errors
* Production of [[synchrotron radiation]]

==Other uses==
Other uses of dipole magnets include isotope mass measurement in [[mass spectrometry]], and particle momentum measurement in [[particle physics]].

Such magnets are also used in traditional televisions, which contain a [[cathode ray tube]], which is essentially a small [[particle accelerator]]. Their magnets are called ''deflecting coils''. The magnets move a single spot on the screen of the TV tube in a controlled way all over the screen.

'''E-procurement''' ('''electronic [[procurement]]''', sometimes also known as '''supplier exchange''') is the [[business-to-business]] or [[business-to-consumer]] or [[business-to-government]] purchase and sale of [[Good (accounting)|supplies]], [[construction#Procurement|work]], and [[Service (economics)|services]] through the [[Internet]] as well as other information and networking systems, such as [[electronic data interchange]] and [[enterprise resource planning]].

The e-procurement value chain consists of indent management, e-Informing, e-Tendering, e-Auctioning, vendor management, catalogue management, Purchase Order Integration, Order Status, Ship Notice, [[e-invoicing]], [[e-payment]], and contract management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete Procure to Pay Cycle|url=http://blog.procurify.com/2013/04/03/the-complete-procure-to-pay-cycle/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indent management is the workflow involved in the preparation of tenders. This part of the value chain is optional, with individual procuring departments defining their indenting process. In works procurement, administrative approval and technical sanction are obtained in electronic format. In goods procurement, indent generation activity is done online. The end result of the stage is taken as inputs for issuing the NIT.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Elements of e-procurement include [[request for information]], [[request for proposal]], [[request for quotation]], RFx (the previous three together), and [[eRFx]] (software for managing RFx projects).

== History ==
It was first used by [[IBM]] in the year 2000, when the company launched its ''Replenishment Management System and Method'', created by Mexican engineer Daniel Delfín, who was then the procurement director at IBM's largest production plant, and Alberto Wario, an IT programmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-11-14|others=Daniel Arturo Delfin Farias, Ruben Alberto Wario Romo, International Business Machines Corp|title=Replenishment management system and method|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7711612}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was designed to solve IBM's complex procurement process for the plant in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]], the largest IBM laptop producing plant in the World, with a production value of 1.6 billion dollars a year. Three years after the system was implemented, the production of the plant grew to 3.6 billion dollars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://expansion.mx/expansion/2011/09/14/compras-inteligentes|title=Expansión Magazine. Compras Inteligentes.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which, the company used the system in Germany, and later sold using licenses to other companies around the World.

== In the public sector ==
{{main|Public eProcurement}}
[https://www.prm360.com/ E-procurement] in the public sector is emerging internationally. Hence, initiatives have been implemented in [[Ukraine]], [[India]], [[Singapore]], [[Estonia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Australia]], [[European Union]].

Public sector organizations use e-procurement for contracts to achieve benefits such as increased efficiency and cost savings (faster and cheaper) in government procurement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government procurement news from FutureGov|url=http://www.futuregov.asia/articles/2011/feb/24/philippines-e-procurement-system-targets-late-2011/|newspaper=FutureGov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improved transparency (to reduce corruption) in procurement services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combating corruption in the EU through e-Procurement|url=http://blog.transparency.org/2011/02/16/combating-corruption-in-the-eu-through-e-procurement/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mettler T, Rohner P |title=E-Procurement in Hospital Pharmacies: An Exploratory Multi-Case Study from Switzerland |journal=IJournal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=23–38 |year=2009 |doi=10.4067/S0718-18762009000100004  }}&lt;/ref&gt; E-procurement in the public sector has seen rapid growth in recent years. Act 590 of Louisiana's 2008 Regular Legislative Session requires political subdivisions to make provisions for the receipt of electronic bids.

E-procurement projects are often part of the country's larger [[e-Government]] efforts to better serve its citizens and businesses in the digital economy. For example, Singapore's [[GeBIZ]] was implemented as one of the programmes under its e-Government masterplan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore E-Government Action Plan I Programmes|url=http://www.egov.gov.sg/egov-masterplans/egap-i/programmes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905083529/http://www.egov.gov.sg/egov-masterplans/egap-i/programmes|archivedate=2011-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The [[Procurement G6]] leads the use of e-procurement instruments in [[Public procurement]].

An example of successful reform is shown by [[Ukraine]] [[Prozorro]]. The result of collaboration between Ukrainian government, business sector, and civil society. This system was developed by international anti-corruption organization, Transparency International Ukraine, with a help of volunteers, NGOs, [[Ukraine|business]] community and state bodies of [[Ukraine]], the WNISEF fund, the [[EBRD]] and other partners.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Vendors ==
This field is populated by two types of vendors: big [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) providers which offer e-procurement as one of their services, and the more affordable services focused specifically on e-procurement.


== Benefits==
Implementing an e-procurement system benefits all levels of an organisation. E-procurement systems offer improved spend visibility and control and help finance officers match purchases with purchase orders, receipts and job tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claritum.com/what-is-e-procurement/ "What is e procurement?"]&lt;/ref&gt;
An e-procurement system also manages tenders through a web site. This can be accessed anywhere globally and has greatly improved the accessibility of tenders.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} An example is the System for Acquisition Management (SAM), which on July 30, 2013 combined information from the former [[Central Contractor Registration]] and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=27 June 2013|url=http://www.ciras.iastate.edu/procurement/ccrandorca.asp|journal=Iowa State University Extension and Outreach|title=CIRAS - Government Contracting CCR and ORCA}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration|url=http://www.hrsa.gov/grants/sam.html|title=CCR Moving to SAM|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eames Lounge Chair''' and [[Ottoman (furniture)|ottoman]] are furnishings made of [[Molding (process)|molded]] [[plywood]] and [[leather]], designed by [[Charles and Ray Eames]] for the [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller furniture company]]. They are officially titled Eames Lounge (670) and Ottoman (671) and were released in 1956 after years of development by [[designer]]s. It was the first chair that the Eameses designed for a high-end market. Examples of these furnishings are part of the permanent collection of New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]].

==Design==
Charles and Ray Eames aimed to develop furniture that could be mass-produced and affordable, with the exception of the Eames Lounge Chair. This luxury item was inspired by the traditional English Club Chair. The Eames Lounge Chair is an icon of [[Modernism|Modern]] style design, although when it was first made, Ray Eames remarked in a letter to Charles that the chair looked "comfortable and un-designy". Charles's vision was for a chair with "the warm, receptive look of a well-used [[First baseman#First-baseman.27s mitt|first baseman's mitt]]." The chair is composed of three curved plywood shells: the headrest, the backrest and the seat. In early production, beginning in 1956 and running through the very early 1990s, the shells were made up of five thin layers of plywood which were covered by a [[Wood veneer|veneer]] of Brazilian [[rosewood]]. The use of Brazilian rosewood was discontinued in the early 1990s, and current production since then consists of seven layers of plywood covered by finishing veneers of cherry, walnut, Palisander rosewood (a sustainably grown wood with similar grain patterns to the original Brazilian versions), and other finishes.

The layers are glued together and shaped under heat and pressure. Earlier models are differentiated from newer models by the sets of rubber spacers between the aluminum spines and the wood panels first used in the earliest production models (and then hard plastic washers used in later versions) early first series versions of the chair used three screws to secure the armrests, second series models used two, the domes of silence (glides/feet) on the chair base had thinner screws originally (1950's era) attaching them to the aluminium base, these are not compatible with later chairs. In the earlier models, the zipper around the cushions may have been brown or black as well, and in newer models the zippers are black. The shells and the seat cushions are essentially the same shape, and composed of two curved forms interlocking to form a solid mass. The chair back and headrest are identical in proportion, as are the seat and the ottoman. Early ottomans had removable rubber slide on feet with metal glides. Early labels are oblong foil type.

The Eameses constantly made use of new materials. The pair's first plywood chair—the [[Eames Lounge Chair Wood (LCW)]]—made use of a heavy rubber washer glued to the backrest of the chair and screwed to the lumbar support. These washers, which have come to be called 'shock mounts', allow the backrest to flex slightly. This technology was brought back in the 670 Lounge chair. The backrest and headrest are screwed together by a pair of aluminum supports. This unit is suspended on the seat via two connection points in the armrests. The armrests are screwed to shock mounts which are connected only via glue to the interior of the backrest shell, allowing the backrest and headrest to flex when the chair is in use. This is part of the chair's unusual design, as well as its weakest link. The shock mounts have been known to tear free causing catastrophic collapse and damage.

Other creative uses of materials include the seat cushions - which eschew standard stapled or nailed upholstery. Instead, the cushions are sewn with a zipper around the outer edge that connects them to a stiff plastic backing. The backing affixes to the plywood shells with a series of hidden clips and rings. This design, along with the hidden shock mounts in the armrest allow the outside veneer of the chair to be unmarred by screws or bolts. The chair has a low seat which is permanently fixed at a recline. The seat of the chair swivels on a cast aluminum base, with glides that are threaded so that the chair may remain level.

==History==
The Eames Lounge Chair first appeared on the [[Arlene Francis]] [[Home (1954 TV series)|''Home'' show]] broadcast on the [[NBC]] television network in the USA in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIEb4HcgZ4s|title=Eames Lounge Chair|last=Eames|first=Charles and Ray|date=1956|work=[[Home (1954 TV series)|''Home'' show]]|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following the debut, Herman Miller launched an advertising campaign that highlighted the versatility of the chair. Print ads depicted the 670 in a Victorian parlor, occupied by a grandmother shelling peas on the front porch of an American Gothic style house, and in the middle of a sunny field of hay. It has been frequently featured in ''[[Frasier]]'' as a piece of furniture in the title character's apartment. In the final episode of the series, [[Martin Crane]] remarks that he finds it comfortable and hints that he may not have needed his recliner after all. A knockoff of the Eames Lounge Chair has been frequently featured in the show ''[[House (TV series)|House]],'' in the protagonist's office''.'' Malory Archer's office chair in ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' is also an animation of the Eames Lounge Chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eamesoffice.com/blog/eames-spotting-animated-eames/|website=Eames Spotting|accessdate=16 September 2015|title=Eames Spotting: Animated Eames}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its introduction, the chair has been in continuous production by [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller]] in America. Later, [[Vitra (furniture)|Vitra]] (in cooperation with the German furniture company Fritz Becker KG) began producing the chair for the European market. It was licensed in the UK for 10 years to [[Hille (furniture)|Hille]] International LTD from 1957. Immediately following its release, other furniture companies began to copy the chair's design. Some made direct copies, others were merely influenced by the design. The former Plycraft Company issued dozens of chairs that were direct copies of or in-the-style-of the Eames 670. Later Chinese and European companies began making direct copies. However, Herman Miller and Vitra remain the only two companies to produce these chairs with the Eames name attached.

In 2006, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the chair, Herman Miller released models using a sustainable Palisander rosewood veneer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5108">[[File:Ericsson bakelittelefon 1931.jpg|thumb|Ericsson Bakelite telephone 1931]]


L'Ericsson DBH 1001 de 1931 était un projet de collaboration entre le Elektrisk Bureau d'Oslo, Televerket (Suède) et Lars Magnus Ericsson (1846-1926). Il a été conçu par l'ingénieur électricien norvégien Johan Christian Bjerknes (1889-1983) et par l'artiste et designer norvégien Jean Heiberg (1884-1976). C'était le premier téléphone en bakélite avec berceau, cadran et sonnerie intégrés; il était très moderne à l'époque [3]. [4] [5]

Jusqu'au début des années 1930, les modèles de téléphones suédois étaient fabriqués en acier pressé. Le passage de l'acier à la bakélite a ouvert de nouvelles perspectives en matière de conception, tout en réduisant le temps de production du boîtier. Le téléphone en bakélite était non seulement compact, mais aussi léger, juste au-dessous de 3 kg, et pouvait être saisi d’une seule main. Avec son design angulaire simple et incurvé, l’appareil a immédiatement séduit l’industrie et les consommateurs et a exercé une grande influence. Dans la plupart des pays européens, il était connu sous le nom de téléphone suédois [6]

==History==
The Ericsson DBH 1001 of 1931 was a collaborative project between the [[Elektrisk Bureau]] in [[Oslo]], [[Televerket (Sweden)]] and [[Lars Magnus Ericsson]](1846–1926). It was designed by Norwegian electrical engineer [[Johan Christian Bjerknes]] (1889-1983) and Norwegian artist and designer [[Jean Heiberg]] (1884–1976). It was the first Bakelite phone with integral cradle, dial and ringer, and was very modern for its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until the early 1930s, the housing of the Swedish phone models was made from pressed steel. Material change from steel to Bakelite brought new opportunities in design, while also reducing the production time for the housing. The Bakelite phone was not only compact but also light at just below 3kg, and could be grasped by one hand. The device with its simple, curved angular design became an instant hit with the industry as well as the consumers, and was highly influential. In most of Europe, it was known as the ''Swedish type of telephone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =   http://www.telephonecollecting.org/Bobs%20phones/Pages/Essays/Plastics.htm |title=    Plastics and the Telephone|publisher=   Telephone Collecting  Org|accessdate= December  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Already in the mid 1930s, Ericsson showed a white Bakelite phone in advertisements, often in the hands of a young woman. However, this model seems never to have been offered to the public. At the [[World's fair|1939 World Fair]] in [[New York City]], Ericsson showed a transparent variant made of [[Acrylic resin|acrylic]] and [[diakon plastic]].  

The standard color of the phone was black, but there were also variants in drab brown, red, and green. The process of using Bakelite did not permit the production of bright colors. The device was manufactured from 1933 in a smaller format, and from 1947 redesigned with softer, more rounded edges as the model designated M50. It was also offered in white [[melamine]]. The metal dial rotor was replaced with a plastic version, and a spiral cord became standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =   https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/products/the-telephones/the-bakelite-telephone-1931|title=    The Bakelite telephone 1931|publisher=   Ericsson |author=Lasse Brunnström|accessdate= December  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1950, Ericsson also experimented with a [[Telephone keypad|keypad]] version, instead of the [[rotary dial]], but it would take another ten years before they became standard in Swedish phones. In 1962, the Bakelite Phone was replaced by the [[Ericsson Dialog]] model.

A '''hot comb''' (also known as a straightening comb) is a metal [[comb]] that is used to [[hair straightening|straighten]] moderate or coarse [[hair]] and create a smoother hair texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-hot-comb.htm//|title=What is a Hot Comb? |publisher=WiseGeek|accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hot comb is heated and used to straighten the hair from the roots. It can be placed directly on the source of heat or it may be electrically heated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-hot-comb.htm//|title=What is a Hot Comb? |publisher=WiseGeek|accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The hot comb was an invention developed in [[France]] as a way for women with coarse curly hair to achieve a fine straight look traditionally modeled by historical Egyptian women.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Ayana D., Tharps, Lori L. ''Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America.'' New York: St. Martin’s Press. 2001 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parisian [[Francois Marcel Grateau]] is said to have revolutionized hair styling when he invented and introduced heated irons to curl and wave his customers' hair in France in 1872. His Marcel Wave remained fashionable for many decades. Britain's Science and Society Library credits L. Pelleray of Paris with manufacturing the heated irons in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10321362&amp;itemw=4&amp;itemf=0005&amp;itemstep=1&amp;itemx=1//|title=Pelleray |publisher=ScienceandSociety|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an 1890s version of Pelleray's curling iron is housed at the Chudnow Museum in Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://chudnowmuseum.org/col/002874.htm#page=objectimages//|title=Pelleray Curling Iron |publisher=ChudnowMuseum|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elroy J. Duncan is believed to have invented and manufactured the first hot comb or heated metal straightening comb in America.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} Sometimes the device is called a "pressing comb." During the late 19th century, Dr. Scott's Electric Curler was advertised in several publications including the 1886 Bloomingdale's catalog&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Villa Bryk ''Bloomingdale's Illustrated 1886 Catalog.'' New York: Dover Publications. 1988 p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; and in the June 1889 issue of ''Lippincott's Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;''Lippincott's Magazine of Literature, Science and Education,'' Volume 43, June 1889 p. 971&lt;/ref&gt; Marketed to men to groom beards and moustaches, the rosewood-handled device also promised women the ability to imitate the "loose and fluffy" hairstyles of actress [[Lillie Langtry]] and opera singer [[Adelina Patti]], popular white entertainers of the era.

Mme. Baum's Hair Emporium, a store on Eighth Avenue in New York with a large black female clientele, advertised Mme. Baum's "entirely new and improved" straightening comb in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Age,'' February 1, 1912, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; In May and June 1914, other Mme. Baum advertisements claimed that she now had a "shampoo dryer and hair straightening comb," said to have been patented on April 1, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Age,'' June 25, 1914, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Patent 1,096,666 for a heated "hair drying" comb – but not a hair straightening comb – is credited to Emilia Baum and was granted on May 12, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office,'' May 12, 1914, Volume 202&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1915, the Humania Hair Company of New York marketed a "straightening comb made of solid brass" for 89 cents.&lt;ref&gt;''Kansas City Sun,'' May 15, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Wolf Brothers of Indianapolis advertised its hair straightening comb and alcohol heater comb for $1.00.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Age,'' May 20, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; The La Creole Company of Louisville claimed to have invented a self-heating comb that required no external flame.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Age,'' May 20, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1915, J. E. Laing, owner of Laing's Hair Dressing Parlor in Kansas City, Kansas claimed to have invented the "king of all straighteners" with a 3/4 inch wide, 9 1/2 inches long comb that also had a reversible handle to accommodate use with either the left or right hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Kansas City Sun,'' September 25, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; Indol Laboratories, owned by Bernia Austin in Harlem, offered a steel magnetic comb for $5.00 in November 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Age,'' November 23, 1916, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Sammons of Philadelphia filed an application for Patent No. 1,362,823 on April 9, 1920. The patent was granted on December 21, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.theblacktechreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/1362823_SAMMONS.pdf//|title=Sammons Patent |publisher=BlackTechReport|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poro Company founder [[Annie Malone]] has been credited by some sources with receiving the first patent for this tool in that same year but the ''Official Gazette of the U. S. Patent Office'' does not list her as a holder of a hot comb patent in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;The Black Inventor Online Museum, [http://www.blackinventor.com/pages/history.html Blackinventor.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724025153/http://www.blackinventor.com/pages/history.html |date=2011-07-24 }} (broken link)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Patent Office Gazette'' of May 16, 1922, however, includes Annie M. Malone of St. Louis in a list of patentees of designs as being granted Patent No. 60,962 for "sealing tape," which Chajuana V. Trawick describes in a December 2011 doctoral dissertation as an ornamental tape used to "secure the closure of the box lid of Poro products" to prevent others from selling products in packages made to look like Poro products.&lt;ref&gt;Chajuana V. Trawick. ''Annie Malone and Poro College: Building an Empire of Beauty in St. Louis, Missouri from 1915 to 1930.'' Ph.D. dissertation University of Missouri, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Hair care entrepreneur [[Madam C. J. Walker]] never claimed to have invented the hot comb,&lt;ref&gt;A'Lelia Bundles ''On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C. J. Walker'' Scribner/Lisa Drew, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; though often has been inaccurately credited with the invention and with modifying the spacing of the teeth, but there is no evidence or documentation to support that assertion. During the 1910s, Walker obtained her combs from different suppliers, including Louisa B. Cason of Cincinnati, Ohio, who eventually filed patent application 1,413,255 on February 17, 1921 for a comb Cason had developed some years earlier. The patent was granted on April 18, 1922&lt;ref&gt;''Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office,'' April 18, 1922 page 492 and page ii&lt;/ref&gt; though Cason had been producing the combs for many years without a patent.

==Potential consequences==
It is not uncommon, especially when using a traditional hot comb, to burn and damage hair. A hot comb is often heated to over 65 degrees [[Celsius]] (149 degrees Fahrenheit), therefore if not careful severe burns and scarring can occur. [[Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia|Hot comb alopecia and follicular degeneration syndrome]] are irreversible [[alopecia]] of the scalp that was believed to occur in people who straighten their hair with hot combs, but this idea was later debunked. 

The hot petrolatum used with the iron was thought to cause a chronic [[inflammation]] around the upper segment of the hair [[Hair follicle|follicle]] leading to degeneration of the external root sheath.&lt;ref&gt;Philip LoPresti, MD; Christopher M. Papa, MD; Albert M. Kligman, MD, PhD.”Hot Comb Alopecia”  Arch Dermatol. 1968; 98(3)p 234&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1992, a hot comb alopecia study was conducted, and it was discovered that there was a poor correlation between the usage of a hot comb and the onset and progression of disease. The study concludes that the term [[follicular degeneration syndrome]] (FDS) is proposed for this clinically and histologically distinct form of scarring alopecia.&lt;ref&gt;LTC Leonard C. Sperling, MC; COL Purnima Sau, MC, “The Follicular Degeneration Syndrome in Black Patients: ‘Hot Comb Alopecia’ Revisited and Revised” Archives of Dermatology. 1992;128(1) p68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercure hotel taksim.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A typical hotel room with a bed, desk, and television]]A '''hotel''' is an establishment  that provides paid [[lodging]] on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and [[En-suite|en-suite bathroom]]s. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually [[Room number|numbered]] (or named in some smaller hotels and [[Bed and breakfast|B&amp;Bs]]) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In Japan, [[capsule hotel]]s provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.
[[File:The Peninsula Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|[[The Peninsula Paris]] hotel]]The precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]]. For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travelers. Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in [[Exeter]] in 1768. Hotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century.

Hotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale full-service hotel facility offers [[Luxury goods|luxury]] amenities, full service accommodations, an on-site [[restaurant]], and the highest level of personalized service, such as a [[concierge]], [[room service]], and clothes pressing staff. [[Conference and resort hotels|Full service hotels]] often contain upscale full-service facilities with a large number of full service accommodations, an on-site full service [[restaurant]], and a variety of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. [[Boutique hotel]]s are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities. Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. [[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.

[[Timeshare]] and [[destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership involving ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage. A [[motel]] is a small-sized low-rise lodging with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. [[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting. A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in [[London]]. Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself, for example at [[casino]]s and holiday [[resort]]s.

Most hotel establishments are run by a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the "[[Hotel Manager]]"), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel (e.g., food service), [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function and class, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.

==Etymology==
The word ''hotel'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] ''hôtel'' (coming from the same origin as ''[[hospital]]''), which referred to a French version of a building seeing frequent visitors, and providing care, rather than a place offering accommodation. In contemporary French usage, ''hôtel'' now has the same meaning as the English term, and ''[[hôtel particulier]]'' is used for the old meaning, as well as "hôtel" in some place names such as [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel-Dieu]] (in Paris), which has been a hospital since the [[Middle Ages]]. The French spelling, with the [[circumflex]], was also used in English, but is now rare. The circumflex replaces the 's' found in the earlier ''[[hostel]]'' spelling, which over time took on a new, but closely related meaning. Grammatically, hotels usually take the [[definite article]] – hence "The Astoria Hotel" or simply "The Astoria."

==History==
[[File:Tabard inn mid19th.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Tabard Inn, [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark, London]]]]
Facilities offering hospitality to travellers have been a feature of the earliest civilizations. In [[Greco-Roman culture]] and [[ancient Persia]], hospitals for recuperation and rest were built at [[thermal bath]]s. Japan's [[Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan]], founded in 705, was officially recognised by the [[Guinness World Records]] as the oldest hotel in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oldest hotel|url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-hotel|accessdate = 2015-04-04|publisher = Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], various religious orders at [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s would offer accommodation for travellers on the road.

The precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]], possibly dating back to the rule of [[Ancient Rome]]. These would provide for the needs of travellers, including food and lodging, [[Stable|stabling]] and [[fodder]] for the traveller's horse(s) and fresh horses for the [[mail coach]]. Famous London examples of inns include the [[The George, Southwark|George]] and the [[The Tabard|Tabard]]. A typical layout of an inn had an inner court with bedrooms on the two sides, with the [[kitchen]] and [[parlour]] at the front and the stables at the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4017990.html|title=Hotels: A Brief History |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travellers (in other words, a [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]]). Coaching [[inn]]s stabled teams of [[horse]]s for [[stagecoach]]es and [[mail coach]]es and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. Traditionally they were seven miles apart, but this depended very much on the terrain.

[[File:TremontHouse ca1830s byJamesBennett Boston SimonsUPNE.png|thumb|right|[[Tremont House (Boston)|Tremont House]] in [[Boston]], United States, a luxury hotel, the first to provide indoor plumbing]]
Some [[England|English]] towns had as many as ten such [[inn]]s and rivalry between them was intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the wealthy passengers. By the end of the century, coaching inns were being run more professionally, with a regular timetable being followed and fixed menus for food.&lt;ref&gt;Coaching Era, The: ''Stage and Mail Coach Travel in and Around Bath, Bristol and Somerset'', Roy Gallop, Fiducia  (2003), {{ISBN|1-85026-019-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inns began to cater for richer clients in the mid-18th century, and consequently grew in grandeur and the level of service provided. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was [[Royal Clarence Hotel|opened]] in [[Exeter]] in 1768, although the idea only really caught on in the early 19th century. In 1812 [[Claridge's|Mivart's Hotel]] opened its doors in [[London]], later changing its name to Claridge's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/buildings/inns.shtml|title=Researching the history of pubs, inns and hotels|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 19th century, and luxury hotels, including the [[Savoy Hotel]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[César Ritz|Ritz chain of hotels]] in [[London]] and [[Paris]] and [[Tremont House (Boston)|Tremont House]] and [[Astor House]] in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles25/hotels-12.shtml |title=Nineteenth Century Hotels In The United States|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to spring up in the later part of the century, catering to an extremely wealthy clientele.

==International scale==
Hotels cater to travelers from many countries and languages, since no one country dominates the travel industry.

Hotel operations vary in size, function, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality companies that operate hotels have set widely accepted industry standards to classify hotel types. General categories include the following:

==={{anchor|Luxury}}Luxury===
A luxury hotel offers high quality amenities, full service accommodations, on-site full-service restaurants, and the highest level of personalized and professional service. Luxury hotels are normally classified with at least a [[AAA Five Diamond Award|Five Diamond]] rating by American Automobile Association or [[Star (classification)|Five Star]] [[hotel rating]] depending on the country and local classification standards. ''Examples include: [[InterContinental Hotels &amp; Resorts|InterContinental]], [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont]], [[Sofitel]], [[Raffles Hotels &amp; Resorts|Raffles]], [[Jumeirah (hotel chain)|Jumeirah]], [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad]], [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group|Mandarin Oriental]], [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]], [[The Peninsula Hotels|The Peninsula]], [[Grand Hyatt]], [[JW Marriott Hotels|JW Marriott]] and [[The Ritz-Carlton]].''

==={{anchor|Boutique}}Boutique and lifestyle hotels===
[[Boutique hotel]]s are smaller independent non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities of varying size in unique or intimate settings with full service accommodations. These hotels are generally 100 rooms or fewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hvs.com/Content/3171.pdf|title = Boutique Hotels Segment|last = Balekjian|first = Cristina|date = September 2011|journal = HVS|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifestyle hotels are branded properties that appeal to a guest with specific lifestyle or personal image. They are typically full-service and sometimes classified as luxury. A key characteristic of boutique and lifestyle hotels is their focus on providing a unique guest experience as opposed to simply providing lodging. Examples include [[W Hotels]], [[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts|Shangri-La Hotels]], [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]], [[Andaz (hotel)|Andaz]], [[Hoshino Resorts]] and [[Banyan Tree Holdings|Banyan Tree]].

==={{anchor|Full}}Full-service===
[[Conference and resort hotels|Full service hotels]] often provide a wide array of guest services and on-site facilities. Commonly found amenities may include: on-site food and beverage (room service and restaurants), meeting and conference services and facilities, fitness center, and business center. Full-service hotels range in quality from mid-scale to luxury.  This classification is based upon the quality of facilities and amenities offered by the hotel. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Full-Service Vs. Limited-Service Hotels|url = http://traveltips.usatoday.com/fullservice-vs-limitedservice-hotels-106136.html|website = Travel Tips - USA Today|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include: [[Holiday Inn]], [[Kimpton Hotels &amp; Restaurants|Kimpton Hotels]], [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton]], [[Marriott International|Marriott]] and [[Hyatt Regency]] brands.

==={{anchor|Focused}}Focused or select service===
Small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a limited number of on-site amenities that only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the single business traveler. Most focused or select service hotels may still offer full service accommodations but may lack leisure amenities such as an on-site restaurant or a swimming pool. Examples include [[Hyatt Place]], [[Courtyard by Marriott]] and [[Hilton Garden Inn]].

==={{anchor|Economy}}Economy and limited service===
Small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a very limited number of on-site amenities and often only offer basic accommodations with little to no services, these facilities normally only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the budget-minded traveler seeking a "no frills" accommodation. Limited service hotels often lack an on-site restaurant but in return may offer a limited complimentary food and beverage amenity such as on-site continental breakfast service.  Examples include [[Ibis Budget]], [[Hampton Inn]], [[Aloft Hotels|Aloft]], [[Holiday Inn Express]], [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inn]], [[Four Points by Sheraton]].

==={{anchor|Extended}}Extended stay===
[[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel. Extended stay [https://www.findhotels.deals hotels] may offer non-traditional pricing methods such as a weekly rate that caters towards travelers in need of short-term accommodations for an extended period of time. Similar to limited and select service hotels, on-site amenities are normally limited and most extended stay hotels lack an on-site restaurant. Examples include [[Staybridge Suites]], [[Candlewood Suites]], [[Homewood Suites by Hilton]], [[Home2 Suites by Hilton]], [[Residence Inn by Marriott]], [[Element by Westin|Element]], and [[Extended Stay America]].

==={{anchor|Timeshare}}Timeshare and destination clubs===
[[Timeshare]] and [[Destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership also referred to as a vacation ownership involving the purchase and ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage during a specified period of time. Timeshare resorts often offer amenities similar that of a Full service hotel with on-site restaurant(s), swimming pools, recreation grounds, and other leisure-oriented amenities. Destination clubs on the other hand may offer more exclusive private accommodations such as private houses in a neighborhood-style setting. Examples of timeshare brands include [[Hilton Grand Vacations]], [[Marriott Vacation Club International]], [[Westgate Resorts]], [[Disney Vacation Club]], and [[Holiday Inn|Holiday Inn Club Vacations]].

==={{anchor|Motel}}Motel===
A [[motel]], an abbreviation for "motor hotel", is a small-sized low-rise lodging establishment similar to a limited service, lower-cost hotel, but typically with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. Motels were built to serve road travellers, including travellers on road trip vacations and workers who drive for their job (travelling salespeople, truck drivers, etc.). Common during the 1950s and 1960s, motels were often located adjacent to a major highway, where they were built on inexpensive land at the edge of towns or along stretches of freeway.

New motel construction is rare in the 2000s as hotel chains have been building economy-priced, limited service franchised properties at freeway exits which compete for largely the same clientele, largely saturating the market by the 1990s. Motels are still useful in less populated areas for driving travelers, but the more populated an area becomes, the more hotels move in to meet the demand for accommodation. While many motels are unbranded and independent, many of the other motels which remain in operation joined national franchise chains, often rebranding themselves as hotels, inns or lodges.  Some examples of chains with motels include [[EconoLodge]], [[Motel 6]], [[Super 8 Motels|Super 8]], and [[Travelodge]].

==={{anchor|Microstay}}Microstay===
Hotels may offer rooms for [[Microstay|microstays]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=By-the-Hour Microstays Add to Big Hotels’ Bottom Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/business/a-room-by-the-hour-to-refresh.html|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of booking for less than 24 hours where the customer chooses the check in time and the length of the stay. This allows the hotel increased revenue by reselling the same room several times a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoteliers urged to tap into microstays market to stay ahead|url=http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Business/Hoteliers-urged-to-tap-into-micro-stay-market-to-stay-ahead|website=www.bighospitality.co.uk|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
{{Main article|Hotel management}}
Hotel management is a globally accepted professional career field and academic field of study. Degree programs such as [[hospitality management studies]], a [[business degree]], and/or certification programs formally prepare hotel managers for industry practice.

Most hotel establishments consist of a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the "Hotel Manager"), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel, [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.

[[File:Hotel Astoria.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hotel Astoria (Saint Petersburg)|Hotel Astoria]] and statue of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia]]
[[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting.
Some hotels have gained their renown through tradition, by hosting significant events or persons, such as Schloss [[Cecilienhof]] in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], which derives its fame from the [[Potsdam Conference]] of the [[World War II]] allies [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harry Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Schloss Cecilienhof - Cecilienhof Palace|url = http://www.potsdam.de/node/276259|website = Landeshauptstadt Potsdam|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower]] in [[Mumbai]] is one of India's most famous and historic hotels because of its association with the [[Indian independence movement]]. Some establishments have given name to a particular meal or beverage, as is the case with the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf Astoria]] in [[New York City]], United States where the [[Waldorf Salad]] was first created or the [[Hotel Sacher]] in [[Vienna]], Austria, home of the [[Sachertorte]]. Others have achieved fame by association with dishes or cocktails created on their premises, such as the [[Hotel de Paris]] where the [[crêpe Suzette]] was invented or the [[Raffles Hotel]] in [[Singapore]], where the [[Singapore Sling]] cocktail was devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Campbell | title=Singapore Journal; Back to Somerset Maugham and Life's Seamy Side |

[[File:Hotel Ritz Paris.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hôtel Ritz Paris]] in [[France]]]]

A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in [[London]], through its association with [[Irving Berlin|Irving Berlin's]] song, '[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]'. The [[Algonquin Hotel]] in New York City is famed as the meeting place of the literary group, the [[Algonquin Round Table]], and [[Hotel Chelsea]], also in New York City, has been the subject of a number of songs and the scene of the stabbing of [[Nancy Spungen]] (allegedly by her boyfriend [[Sid Vicious]]).

==={{anchor|Resort}}Resort hotels===
[[File:Wynn 2 (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Wynn Las Vegas]], United States]]
Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself to create a captive trade, example at [[casino]]s, [[amusement park]]s and holiday [[resort]]s. Though hotels have always been built in popular destinations, the defining characteristic of a resort hotel is that it exists purely to serve another attraction, the two having the same owners.

On the [[Las Vegas Strip]] there is a tradition of [[one-upmanship]] with luxurious and extravagant hotels in a concentrated area. This trend now has extended to other resorts worldwide, but the concentration in Las Vegas is still the world's highest: nineteen of the world's twenty-five largest hotels by room count are on the Strip, with a total of over 67,000 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/largesthotels.htm |title=The 25 Largest Hotels in the World|accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe [[Center Parcs]] might be considered a chain of resort hotels, since the sites are largely man-made (though set in natural surroundings such as [[country park]]s) with captive trade, whereas [[holiday camp]]s such as [[Butlins]] and [[Pontin's]] are probably not considered as resort hotels, since they are set at traditional holiday destinations which existed before the camps.

Some hotels fill daytime occupancy with [[day room (hotel)|day rooms]], for example, [[Rodeway Inn and Suites]] near [[Port Everglades]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Chris Cruises"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Owen|first1=Chris|title=Pre-Cruise Hotels|url=https://chriscruises.com/pre-cruise-hotel-florida/|accessdate=3 December 2016|agency=Chris Cruises|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day rooms are booked in a block of hours typically between 8 am and 5 pm,&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Darren|title=Long Layover? Many Airport Hotels Offer Day-Room Rates|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100324884|accessdate=3 December 2016|agency=CNBC|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the typical night shift. These are similar to transit hotels in that they appeal to travelers, however, unlike transit hotels, they do not eliminate the need to go through Customs.

===Garden hotels===
[[Garden hotels]], famous for their gardens before they became hotels, include Gravetye Manor, the home of garden designer [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]], and [[Cliveden]], designed by [[Charles Barry]] with a rose garden by [[Geoffrey Jellicoe]].

===Ice, snow and igloo hotels===
{{Main article|Ice hotel}}
[[File:Icehotel entre ms.jpg|thumb|Ice Hotel in Jukkasjärvi, Sweden]]
The Ice Hotel in [[Jukkasjärvi]], [[Sweden]], was the first ice hotel in the world; first built in 1990, it is built each winter and melts every spring. Other ice hotels include the Igloo Village in Kakslauttanen, Finland, and the Hotel de Glace in Duschenay, Canada. They can also be included within larger ice complexes; for example, the Mammut Snow Hotel in Finland is located within the walls of the [[Kemi]] snow castle; and the Lainio Snow Hotel is part of a snow village near [[Ylläs]], Finland.

===Love hotels===
{{Main article|Love hotel}}
A love hotel (also 'love motel', especially in Taiwan) is a type of short-stay hotel found around the world, operated primarily for the purpose of allowing guests privacy for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]], typically for one to three hours, but with overnight as an option. Styles of premises vary from extremely low-end to extravagantly appointed. In Japan, love hotels have a history of over 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthew Alexander|last2=Chien Chuan Chen|last3=Andrew MacLaren|last4=Kevin D. O'Gorman|date=2010-03-09|title=Love motels: oriental phenomenon or emergent sector?|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/09596111011018188|journal=International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management|volume=22|issue=2|pages=194–208|doi=10.1108/09596111011018188|issn=0959-6119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Referral hotel===
{{main article|Referral chain}}
A referral hotel is a hotel chain that offers branding to independently-operated hotels; the chain itself is founded by or owned by the member hotels as a group. Many former referral chains have been converted to franchises; the largest surviving member-owned chain is [[Best Western]].

===Railway hotels===
{{further|:Category:Railway hotels}}
{{Commons category|Railway hotels}}
The first recorded purpose-built railway hotel was the [[Great Western Hotel, Reading|Great Western Hotel]], which opened adjacent to [[Reading railway station]] in 1844, shortly after the [[Great Western Railway]] opened its line from London. The building still exists, and although it has been used for other purposes over the years, it is now again a hotel and a member of the [[Malmaison (hotel chain)|Malmaison hotel chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Daphne |last=Phillips |title=The Story of Reading |publisher=Countryside Books |date=1980 |isbn=0-905392-07-8 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |desc= Great Western House |num=1113591 |accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reading |publisher=Malmaison |url=https://www.malmaison.com/locations/reading/ |accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, expanding railway companies built grand hotels at their termini, such as the [[Midland Hotel, Manchester]] next to [[Manchester Central railway station|the former Manchester Central Station]], and in London the ones above [[St Pancras railway station]] and [[Charing Cross railway station]]. London also has the Chiltern Court Hotel above [[Baker Street tube station]], there are also [[Canada's grand railway hotels]]. They are or were mostly, but not exclusively, used by those traveling by rail.

=== Straw bale hotels ===
The Maya Guesthouse in Nax Mont-Noble in the Swiss Alps, is the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales. Due to the insulation values of the walls it needs no conventional heating or air conditioning system, although the Maya Guesthouse is built at an altitude of {{convert|1300|m}} in the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pr-inside.com/the-first-straw-bale-hotel-will-r2744664.htm/article |title=About the first straw bale hotel in Europe |publisher=Pr-inside.com |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2012-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708022431/http://www.pr-inside.com/the-first-straw-bale-hotel-will-r2744664.htm/article |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transit hotels===
{{Main article|Transit Hotel}}
Transit hotels are short stay hotels typically used at international airports where passengers can stay while waiting to change airplanes.  The hotels are typically on the [[Airside (airport)|airside]] and do not require a visa for a stay or re-admission through security checkpoints.

===Treehouse hotels===
Some hotels are built with living trees as structural elements, for example the Treehotel near [[Piteå]], [[Sweden]], the Costa Rica Tree House in the Gandoca-Manzanillo Wildlife Refuge, [[Costa Rica]]; the [[Treetops Hotel]] in [[Aberdare National Park]], [[Kenya]]; the [[Ariau Towers]] near [[Manaus]], [[Brazil]], on the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]; and Bayram's Tree Houses in [[Olympos (Lycia)|Olympos]], [[Turkey]].

===Underwater hotels===
[[File:Ithaa inside.JPG|thumb|[[Ithaa]], the first undersea restaurant at the [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad Maldives]] [[Rangali|Rangali Island]] resort]]
Some hotels have accommodation underwater, such as [[Utter Inn]] in [[Lake Mälaren]], Sweden. [[Hydropolis]], project in [[Dubai]], would have had suites on the bottom of the [[Persian Gulf]], and [[Jules' Undersea Lodge]] in [[Key Largo]], [[Florida]] requires [[scuba diving]] to access its rooms.

===Overwater hotels===
[[File:Rehendi Suite Deck (Service).jpg|thumb|An overwater bungalow on the [[island resort]] in the [[Maldives]]]]
A [[resort island]] is an island or an archipelago that contains resorts, hotels, overwater bungalows, restaurants, tourist attractions and its amenities. [[Maldives]] has the most overwater bungalows resorts.

'''Laflin &amp; Rand Powder Company''' was a [[gunpowder]] and early [[smokeless powder]] manufacturer notable for producing the smokeless powder used by [[United States Army]] infantry rifles from 1896 to 1908, which included the period of development of the [[M1903 Springfield]] rifle and [[.30-06 Springfield]] cartridge.&lt;ref name="sharpe"&gt;Sharpe, Philip B. ''Complete Guide to Handloading'' 3rd Edition (1953) Funk &amp; Wagnalls pp.136,147-149&amp;175-177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Matthew Laflin manufactured [[potassium nitrate]] for the [[Massachusetts militia]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], and built a [[gunpowder]] mill in [[Southwick, Massachusetts]] after the war.  After Laflin's death in 1810, his grandchildren expanded the family business with two mills in New York and one in Wisconsin. These mills produced gunpowder for the [[Union (ACW)|Union]] forces through the [[American Civil War]].  Laflin Powder Company was incorporated in 1866 to consolidate operations to compete successfully for the reduced gunpowder demand after the war.&lt;ref name="dupont"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/related_topics/laflin_rand_powder_company.html|title=Laflin &amp; Rand Powder Company|publisher=DuPont|accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laflin Powder Company further consolidated gunpowder manufacturing around the [[Orange Mill Historic District]] near [[Newburgh (town), New York|Newburgh, New York]] by merger with the competing Smith &amp; Rand Powder Company on 24 August 1869 to form the Laflin &amp; Rand Powder Company of New York City, with Albert Rand as president.&lt;ref name="sharpe"/&gt;

==History==
In 1872 Laflin &amp; Rand formed the United States Gunpowder Trade Association (popularly known as the [[Trust (monopoly)|powder trust]]) with [[DuPont]], [[Hazard Powder Company]], and three smaller gunpowder manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, John K. ''The DuPont Dynasty'' (2005) Kessinger Publishing pp.122&amp;123&lt;/ref&gt;  DuPont and Laflin &amp; Rand jointly established the Repauno Chemical Company in 1880, the [[Hercules Powder Company]] in 1882, and the Eastern Dynamite Company in 1895.&lt;ref name="dupont"/&gt;

==Smokeless powder==
Smokeless powder became a threat to traditional United States gunpowder markets in 1893.  [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]] began loading sporting ammunition with smokeless powder manufactured by the Anglo-American Explosives Company; and the United States Army published smokeless powder specifications for the new [[Krag-Jørgensen]] service rifle.  Laflin &amp; Rand negotiated a license to produce [[Alfred Nobel]]'s patented ''[[Ballistite]]'' smokeless powder adopted by many European military forces; but the U.S. Army selected ''Ruby'' smokeless powder produced by the newly formed Leonard Smokeless Powder Company.  Rather than pay the required royalties to manufacture ''Ballistite'', Laflin &amp; Rand loaned the financially troubled Leonard company $30,000 to reorganize as the American Smokeless Powder Company. U.S. Army Lieutenant Garland Whistler assisted American Smokeless Powder Company factory superintendent Henry Aspinwall in formulating an improved powder.  They reduced the [[nitroglycerine]] content from 58% to 30%; and the extruded formulation, named W.A. in recognition of their work, was cut into black perforated discs {{convert|0.08|inch|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|0.045|inch|mm}} thick.  W.A. .30 caliber smokeless powder was the standard for United States military service rifles from 1896 until 1908.  When the American Smokeless Powder Company plant was destroyed by an explosion in 1898, Laflin &amp; Rand took over the company and rebuilt the plant in [[Haskell, New Jersey]] (named for Laflin &amp; Rand president Jonathan Haskell.)  The Haskell plant became Laflin &amp; Rand's primary smokeless powder factory producing not only military W.A. powder, but sporting powders including ''Bullseye'' pistol powder (introduced in 1898 using small, irregular particles removed by screening runs of larger grained powders), ''Lightning'' powder for lever-action sporting rifles (introduced in 1899), and shotgun powders ''Infallible'' and ''Unique'' (introduced in 1900).&lt;ref name="sharpe"/&gt;

==DuPont control==
[[Image:Orange Powder Mill ruins.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of some of the Laflin &amp; Rand gunpowder mill buildings in New York.]]
Laflin &amp; Rand and DuPont together commanded over two-thirds of the United States explosives and gunpowder industry by 1900. In October 1902 DuPont purchased Laflin &amp; Rand and operated the company as a subsidiary until Federal antitrust action required divestiture in 1912. When Laflin &amp; Rand was dissolved, the reorganized Hercules Powder Company received Laflin &amp; Rand patents for smokeless powder&lt;ref name="dupont"/&gt; and continued manufacture at [[Kenvil, New Jersey]] under the direction of Haskell ballistics laboratory director Bernhart Troxler.  The former Laflin &amp; Rand plant at Haskell operated until dismantled in 1926.&lt;ref name="sharpe"/&gt;  Hercules Powder Company continued to produce ''Bullseye'' and ''Unique'' powders at other plants until selling the product line to the Alliant Powder Company.  Alliant Powder Company continued manufacturing these smokeless powders into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliantpowder.com/products/default.aspx|title=Alliant Powder Products|publisher=Alliant Powder|accessdate=2012-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crudes.PNG|thumbnail|Main features of some qualities of crude oil]]
[[File:Crude oil sulfur content.png|thumb|Density and sulfur content of crude oils]]
In the international [[petroleum industry]], '''crude oil products''' are traded on various [[oil bourse]]s based on established chemical profiles, delivery locations, and financial terms. The chemical profiles, or [[crude oil assay]]s, specify important properties such as the oil's [[API gravity]]. The delivery locations are usually sea ports close to the [[List of oil fields|oil field]]s from which the crude was obtained (and [[Oil megaprojects|new fields]] are constantly being explored), and the pricing is usually quoted based on [[Free On Board|F.O.B.]] (''free on board'', without consideration of final delivery costs).

==Benchmarks==
{{main|Benchmark (crude oil)}}
The three most quoted oil products are [[North America]]'s [[West Texas Intermediate]] crude (WTI), [[North Sea]] [[Brent Crude]], and the [[UAE]] [[Dubai Crude]], and their pricing is used as a barometer for the entire petroleum industry, although, in total, there are 46 key oil exporting countries. Brent Crude is typically priced at about $2 over the WTI Spot price, which is typically priced $5 to $6 above the EIA's Imported Refiner Acquisition Cost (IRAC) and OPEC Basket prices.  WTI and Brent are quoted F.O.B specific locations, not F.O.B. the oilfields.  For WTI, the delivery point is Cushing, OK; for Brent, it is [[Sullom Voe]], located on [[Shetland]], an island archipelago north of mainland Scotland.

Although crude oil assays evaluate various chemical properties of the oil, the two most important properties determining a crude's value are its density (measured as API specific gravity) and its sulphur content (measured per mass). Crude oil is considered "[[Heavy crude oil|heavy]]" if it has long hydrocarbon chains, or "[[Light crude oil|light]]" if it has short hydrocarbon chains: an API gravity of 34 or higher is "light", between 31-33 is "medium", and 30 or below is "heavy".
Crude is considered "[[Sweet crude oil|sweet]]" if it is low in sulphur content (&lt; 0.5%/weight), or "[[Sour crude oil|sour]]" if high (&gt; 1.0%/weight). Generally, the higher the API gravity (the "lighter" it is), the more valuable the crude.

Some of the best known valve amplifiers are listed here.

==Leak TL/12==
[[Image:TL12Bronze.jpg|frame|[[LEAK]] TL/12 Point One Amplifier]]
The first commercially produced amplifier with distortion of 0.1% was the [[LEAK]] Type 15 "Point One" of 1945, using KT66 vacuum tubes (valves) connected as triodes, with 26dB feedback over 4 stages including the output transformer. In 1948 LEAK produced the TL/12 which was also rated at 0.1% but featured improved performance with 26dB over 3 stages and the output transformer (giving better gain-margin and phase-margin). The TL/12 sold in large quantities to professional users, radio stations, laboratories, as well as to the emerging market for hi-fi equipment. It is highly prized even today by audio enthusiasts.

==Williamson==
The [[Williamson amplifier]] was published in 1947 as an article in ''[[Wireless World]]'', and was a milestone which defined the mainstream topology for the majority of amplifiers thereafter. The design gave particular attention to a very high specification for the output transformer, in addition to being generally a consistently well worked-through design. It was not itself originally a commercial design, but many commercial versions and derivatives were subsequently made (with and without due credit).

==Mullard 5-10==
To promote their new 9-pin tubes EZ80, EF86 and [[EL84]], the Anglo-Dutch [[Mullard]] Company developed, in 1954, a famous and very popular mono amplifier circuit, the [[Mullard 5-10]]. The design featured 5 tubes with 10 watts output: EF86 as preamplifier, [[ECC83]] phase-splitting, two EL84 in push-pull configuration, EZ80 rectifier. The amplifier used the excellent Partridge output transformer and was well known for its great sound reproduction.

==Dynaco==

[[Dynaco]] was a major US manufacturer of completed and kit amplifiers of high quality, notably of the Mark III and the Stereo 70, claimed to be the most popular tube amp ever made with over 300,000 produced.

==McIntosh MC275==
[[File:McIntosh MC275 stereo amp.jpg|thumb|MC275 stereo tube amp, 75W per channel]]
[[McIntosh Laboratory]] long held a reputation for producing very high quality high-end equipment in the US. The model MC275 was produced from May 1961 through July 1973.

The model MC275 perhaps demonstrates most clearly the revival in tube amplifiers, as used MC275s in mint condition can sell for up to eight times their original purchase price, and a "Commemorative Edition" made during the 1990s was priced at $4000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analogstereo.com/amp_mcintosh_mc275.htm AnalogStereo.com McIntosh MC275 Amplifier]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marantz 8B==
Another historic manufacturer of valve amplifiers was [[Marantz]]. The Marantz 8B is another design that has been considered a classic and for which a "Reissue" edition has been produced.

MT-Energie develops and distributes both [[turnkey]] [[biogas powerplant]]s and special [[bioprocess engineering]] components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=49553040 |title=Company Overview |accessdate=13 April 2011 |publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it offers technical and biological services for biogas plants. The company’s subsidiary MT-Biomethan GmbH, which was founded as part of the MT Group in 2008, offers technologies for biogas upgrading based on the process of [[amine gas treating|pressureless amine scrubbing]] and a membrane-based gas permeation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mt-biomethan.com/gb/media/news-releases/article/mt-energies-first-biogas-plant-in-england-is-commissioned.html |title=Biogas Processing in UK (Press Release) |accessdate=13 April 2011 |publisher=MT-Energie GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewable-energy-industry.com/news/newstickerdetail.php?changeLang=en_GB&amp;newsid=789 |title=Biogas for the UK |accessdate=13 April 2011 |publisher=International Economic Platform for Renewable Energies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was founded by Christoph Martens in 1995 and initially operated as [[engineering consultant]]s. The early years of the company’s activities focused on the development of special biogas components. In 1997, Martens invented the so-called [[Air-supported structure|air-supported membrane cover]] for biogas plants. This technology is now used by various manufacturers of biogas plants.{{which|date=April 2013}} With the foundation of MT-Energie GmbH &amp; Co. KG in 2001, the company increasingly focused on the construction of turnkey biogas plants. By the end of 2013, about 600 biogas projects with a total installed power of 350&amp;nbsp;MW had been completed. In 2007 the company opened its first site abroad in Italy. Today MT-Energie operates throughout Europe and distributes its products and services in many countries worldwide.
MT-Energie was founded in the German town of Rockstedt in the district of [[Rotenburg (district)|Rotenburg (Wümme)]]. In November 2008 the company moved its premises to the small town of Zeven in [[Lower Saxony]]. There, on the premises of {{convert|62,300|m2}}, the new headquarters including offices, logistics area and manufacturing buildings for gas processing plants were constructed.

When MT-Energie released preliminary results for the 2012 financial year on 25 April 2013, they talked of a collapse of demand in the German market and the high costs of internationalisation, especially in Italy and the United States. MT-Energie has reduced the number of full-time employees in Italy from 40 to 15 and has pulled out of the US market. A company press release from earlier in the month (April 2, 2013) denied rumours of liquidity problems and imminent insolvency.
	 	
The 2013 preliminary financial results were released on 30 June 2014 and they stated an expected loss of 23.3 million euros for the entire company. This loss is more than 25% of the expected company turnover of 87.7 million euros in the same period. 
	
MT-Energie has closed down the Australian, Canadian and US offices and pulled out of the North American and Australian markets completely. The company's only future involvement in North America will be completion of the already-begun projects in the USA. Due to the financial situation, all of the experienced country sales and project management directors were sacked or left the company, which leaves MT-Energie's foreign sales departments with inexperienced managers.
	
MT-Energie also had a covenant breach on their 2012-issued company bond (Anleihe) due to owner's equity also falling to 4.1%. In order to avoid defaulting on their bonds, a deal was made with the bond holders.

This low level of owner's equity also means that the banks offering credit can cancel their credit agreements with MT-Energie. The banks and MT-Energie are now{{When|date=December 2014}} negotiating to find a solution.

==Corporate social responsibility==
In winter 2010/11, MT-Energie offered the national archery team of the German Disabled Sports Association its Zeven storage and logistics centre for their preparations for the summer season. The team members included double Olympic medallist Mario Oehme as well as the incumbent runner-up world champions Michael Arenz and Michael Müller of the “compound team”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2685">'''Magnetolithography''' (ML) is a method for pattern surfaces. ML based on applying a [[magnetic field]] on the substrate using paramagnetic metal masks named "magnetic mask". Magnetic masks are analogous to a [[photomask]] in photolithography, in that they define the spatial distribution and shape of the applied magnetic field. The second component of the process is [[ferromagnetic]] nanoparticles (analogous to the [[photoresist]] in photolithography) that are assembled onto the substrate according to the field induced by the magnetic mask.

ML can be used for applying either a positive or negative approach. In the positive approach, the magnetic nanoparticles react chemically or interact via chemical recognition with the substrate. Hence, the magnetic nanoparticles are immobilized at selected locations, where the mask induces a magnetic field, resulting in a patterned substrate. In the negative approach, the magnetic nanoparticles are inert to the substrate. Hence, once they pattern the substrate, they block their binding site on the substrate from reacting with another reacting agent. After the adsorption of the reacting agent, the nanoparticles are removed, resulting in a negatively patterned substrate.

ML is a backside [[lithography]], which has the advantage of ease in producing multilayer with high accuracy of alignment and with the same efficiency for all layers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4359">A '''Microwave Power Module (MPM)''' is a microwave device used to amplify [[radio frequency]] signals to high power levels. It is a hybrid combination of [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] and [[vacuum tube]] electronics, which encloses a [[solid-state driver amplifier]] (SSPA), [[Traveling-wave tube|traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA)]] and electronic power conditioning (EPC) modules into a single unit.&lt;ref name=Abrams1993&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their average output power capability falls between that of solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) and dedicated Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) amplifiers. They may be applied wherever high power microwave amplification is required, and space is at a premium. They are available in various frequency ranges, from [[S band]] up to [[W band]]. Typical output power at {{Ku band}} ranges from 20W to 1&amp;nbsp;kW.

==History==
The microwave power module concept was designed for use in active [[phased array]] antennas, where their compact size permits packing a large number of modules into the radiating face of the antenna. The concept was explored in detail by the 1989 Microwave Power Module Panel, supported by the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|US Naval Research Laboratory]]. While the eventual goal was to design a power module with a cross section as small as a half square inch, most MPMs today are larger, and suitable only for line arrays, partially distributed arrays and single-module applications.

==Typical Specifications==
Microwave power modules are available at various frequencies, from S band up to W band.&lt;ref name=Smith1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Continuous wave|CW]] and pulsed MPMs are available, the pulsed MPMs having a wide duty cycle range. Power levels range from less than 20W to over 1&amp;nbsp;kW. MPMs are light-weight compared to traditional TWTAs, and the power supply requirements are typically low-voltage DC (28 - 270V DC).

==Construction==
[[Image:Mpm block diagram.png|width=200px|right|frame|Block diagram of an MPM]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mpm internal.png|width=100px|none|thumb|Internal construction of an MPM]] --&gt;
A microwave power module consists of a solid state power amplifier, which drives a vacuum power booster, typically a traveling wave tube. The high voltage power supply required by the TWT is provided by an electronic power conditioner. In pulsed-mode MPMs, the power conditioner provides a pulsed high voltage that is triggered by a trigger input. MPMs also include a [[microcontroller]], which is responsible for controlling the operation of the module, such as making sure the various power supply voltages come up in the appropriate sequence to prevent damage to the TWT. It also reports the module status, including the various voltages, currents and temperatures.

==Applications==
Microwave power modules are used in
*Active phased array antennas
*Radar transmitters where relatively low power, but long pulse widths are needed (such as [[Synthetic aperture radar|Synthetic Aperture Radars]])
*Commercial and military satellite communications

{{Renewable energy}}
'''Ministry of New and Renewable Energy''' or '''MNRE''' is a ministry of the [[Government of India]]. The ministry is currently headed by [[R. K. Singh]], a [[Minister of State-In Charge]]. The ministry was established as the '''Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources''' in 1992. It adopted its current name in October 2006. &lt;ref&gt;1.	http://mnre.gov.in/mission-and-vision-2/people/minister/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry is mainly responsible for [[research and development]], [[intellectual property]] protection, and international cooperation, promotion, and coordination in [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[wind power]], [[small hydro]], [[biogas]], and [[Solar energy|solar power]]. The broad aim of the ministry is to develop and deploy new and renewable energy for supplementing the energy requirements of [[India]].

The ministry is headquartered in [[Lodhi Road]], [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnre.gov.in/contact.htm Contact Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820015739/http://www.mnre.gov.in/contact.htm |date=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ministry's 2016-17 annual report, India has made significant advances in several renewable energy sectors which include, [[solar energy]], [[wind power]], and [[hydroelectricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/annual-report/2016-2017/EN/index.html |title=Annual Report |publisher=Mnre.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[1970s energy crisis]] led to the establishment of the Commission for Additional Sources of Energy (CASE) in the [[Department of Science &amp; Technology (India)]] in March 1981. The CASE was responsible for the formulation of policies and their implementation, creation of programmes for development of new and renewable energy and coordinating and intensifying R&amp;D in the sector.

In 1982, a new department was created in the then Ministry of Energy, i.e., Department of Non-conventional Energy Sources (DNES). DNES incorporated CASE under its umbrella.

A decade later, in 1992, DNES became the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources (MNES). In October 2006, the Ministry was re-christened as the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ujwalbharat.gov.in/content/new-renewable-energy|title=New &amp; Renewable Energy {{!}} UJWAL BHARAT|website=ujwalbharat.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnre.gov.in/mission-and-vision-2/mission-and-vision/|title=Ministry of New and Renewable Energy - Introduction|website=mnre.gov.in|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Mission of the Ministry is to ensure
# Energy Security: Lesser dependence on oil imports through development and deployment of alternative fuels (hydrogen, bio-fuels and synthetic fuels) and their applications to contribute towards bridging the gap between domestic oil supply and demand;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12971">A '''Multi-Gigabit Transceiver''' ('''MGT''') is a [[SerDes]] capable of operating at serial bit rates above 1 Gigabit/second. MGTs are used increasingly for data communications because they can run over longer distances, use fewer wires, and thus have lower costs than parallel interfaces with equivalent data throughput.

==Functions==
Like other [[SerDes]], the primary function of the MGT is to transmit parallel data as stream of serial bits, and convert the serial bits it receives to parallel data. The most basic performance metric of an MGT is its serial bit rate, or line rate, which is the number of serial bits it can transmit or receive per second. Although there is no strict rule, MGTs can typically run at line rates of 1 Gigabit/second or more.
MGTs have become the 'data highways' for data processing systems that demand a high in/out raw data input and output (e.g. video processing applications). They are becoming very common on [[FPGA]] - such programmable logic devices being especially well fitted for parallel data processing algorithms.

Beyond serialization and deserialization, MGTs must incorporate a number of additional technologies to allow them to operate at high line rates. Some of these are listed below:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Technology
! Function
|-
| [[Differential signaling]]
| MGTs use differential signaling to transmit and receive serial data. Differential signaling allows faster switching, because the change in signal level required to switch from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1 is halved. In addition, as long as the skew between the two lines of each [[differential pair]] is minimized, differential signals have increased immunity to [[Electromagnetic Interference|Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)]], [[Crosstalk (electronics)|Crosstalk]], and noise.
|-
| [[Current mode logic|MOS Current Mode Logic (MCML)]]
| MCML refers to current mode logic implemented using MOSFET instead of Bipolar transistors. MCML uses differential amplifiers to drive and receive data at high speeds using low voltages
|-
| [[Emphasis (telecommunications)|Emphasis]]
| At high line rates, the lines carrying serial data tend to behave like low-pass filters. This causes the high frequency components of the serial data to lose power more quickly than the low frequency components, distorting the signal and causing [[Intersymbol interference|Intersymbol Interference (ISI)]]. One way to counter this problem is to use [[Preemphasis]] or [[Deemphasis]] to shape the transmitted signal to compensate for the expected losses.
|-
| [[Signal integrity|Receive Equalization]]
| An alternative to emphasis is Equalization, where the high frequency parts of a received signal's spectrum are amplified more than the low frequency parts, to compensate for the low-pass behavior of the line.
|-
| [[electrical termination|Termination Impedance Matching]]
| At high line rates, the wires used to carry serial data have many of the properties of [[Transmission lines]]. One important property is that signals on the line can be distorted if the impedance of the MGT at the transmitter and receiver does not match the impedance of the line. To counter this, MGTs are typically designed to match the impedance of the wires that connect them as closely as possible. A commonly used impedance value is 100Ω (differential, roughly equivalent to 50Ω single ended impedance for each wire).
|-
| [[phase-locked loop|Phase-locked loops (PLLs)]]
| To serialize data at high speeds, the serial clock rate must be an exact multiple of the clock for the parallel data. Most MGTs use a PLL to multiply a reference clock running at the desired parallel rate to the required serial rate.
|-
| [[Clock recovery|Clock Data Recovery (CDR)]]
| When serial data are received, the MGT must use the same serial clock that serialized the data to deserialize it. At high line rates, providing the serial clock with a separate wire is very impractical because even the slightest difference in length between the data line and the clock line can cause significant clock skew. Instead, MGTs recover the clock signal from the data directly, using transitions in the data to adjust the rate of their local serial clock so it is locked to the rate used by the other MGT. Systems that use CDR can operate over much longer distances at higher speeds than their non-CDR counterparts.
|-
| Encoding/Decoding
| The pattern of data transmitted serially between MGTs can impact their performance. 
* If the data has too few transitions, the receiving MGT will not be able to use CDR. 
* If the data are too repetitive, at high rates the lines will create strong fields and cause [[Electromagnetic Interference|EMI]].
* If the data has too many more 1s than 0s or vice versa, [[AC coupling|AC coupled]] MGTs will experience [[Data dependent jitter|Data Dependent Jitter]] caused by the charging and discharging of capacitances on the line. 
Most communication protocols for MGTs use a data encoding system to avoid these problems.

An additional advantage of encoding is that it allows control information to be transmitted along with data. This is important for functions such as error detection, alignment, clock correction, and channel bonding.

Some popular encodings are:
* [[8B/10B]]: each [[Octet (computing)|octet]] of data is mapped to a 10 bit sequence
* [[64B/66B encoding|64B/66B]]: data are grouped into sets of 64 bits, scrambled, then prefixed with a 2 bit header
* 64B/67B: like 64B/66B, but a 3 bit header is used instead. The extra bit indicates whether the 64 bits are inverted or not, to allow MGTs to ensure the number of 0s and 1s transmitted is roughly balanced
* [[SONET|SONET/SDH]]: not an encoding but a group of related standards that group data into fixed size blocks, scramble it, and add a frame which includes an alignment character
|-
| Error Detection
| Most systems require some form of error detection. The most common forms of error detection in MGTs are:
* Encoding-based error detection: most encodings define a set of legal characters and legal sequences of characters. MGTs can detect errors by looking for data that is illegal in the encoding used.
* [[Cyclic redundancy check|Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)]]: To use CRC, data are broken up into [[Data frame|frames]] (or [[packet (information technology)|packet]]s), and a CRC function is applied to each frame. The result of the function is appended to the frame when it is transmitted - the receiver can recalculate the same function on the data it receives and compare it to the result from the transmitter to determine if the data in the frame (or the transmitter's CRC result) was corrupted during transmission.
|-
| Alignment
| When an MGT receives serial data, it needs to determine the byte boundaries of the data before it can present the data as parallel bits. This function is typically performed by an alignment block. The exact method used for alignment depends on the type of encoding used for the data:
* Comma alignment (8B/10B): The receiver searches the incoming serial stream for Commas (8B/10B Control characters that cannot be created by concatenating other characters). When it finds a Comma, lines up the comma boundary to its byte boundary, so that all the data that follows is aligned.
* Block Synchronization (64B/66B &amp; 64B/67B): The receiver searches the incoming data stream for the 2-bit (or 3-bit, in the case of 64B/67B) header for each 64 bit block.
* A1/A2 alignment (SONET/SDH): SONET frames include a header and a scrambled payload. MGTs receiving SONET data look for repeated match to the alignment characters in the header (called A1 and A2) to determine byte boundaries.
|-
| Clock Correction
| There is always a small frequency difference (typically ~+/-100[[Parts per million|ppm]]) between reference clock sources, even if they are nominally the same frequency. As a result, in systems where each MGT uses its own reference clock, each MGT uses a slightly different frequency for its transmit datapath (TX), and its receive datapath (RX).

Many protocols simplify the clocking by using clock correction. In clock correction, each MGT includes an asynchronous [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]]. RX data are written to the FIFO using the parallel clock from the CDR, and read from the FIFO using the parallel clock from the rest of the system (the local clock), usually the same parallel clock as was used for TX.

Since the CDR clock and the local clock are not exactly the same, the FIFO will eventually overflow or underflow unless it is corrected. To allow correction, each MGT periodically transmits one or more special characters which the receiver is allowed to remove or replicate in the FIFO as necessary. By removing characters when the FIFO is too full, and replicating characters when the FIFO is too empty, the receiver can prevent overflow/underflow. 
|-
| Channel Bonding
| Many protocols combine multiple MGT connections to create a single higher throughput channel (e.g. [[XAUI]], [[PCI Express]]). Unless each of the serial connections is exactly the same length, skew between the lanes can cause data transmitted at the same time to arrive at different times.

Channel bonding allows the MGTs to compensate for skew between multiple connections. The MGTs all transmit a channel bonding character (or sequence of characters) simultaneously. When the sequence is received, the receiving MGTs can determine the skew between them, then adjust the latency of FIFOs in their receive datapaths to compensate. 
|-
| Electrical Idle/Out-of-Band Signaling
| Some protocols use the absence of a differential voltage over a specified threshold value to send messages. For example, PCI Express uses Electrical Idle signals to indicate when endpoints should go in and out of low power modes. Similarly, [[SATA|Serial ATA]] uses COM signals for power management. To support these features, MGTs must include circuits capable of generating and detecting Electrical Idle/OOB signals on the serial lines.
|}

==Signal integrity and jitter==
[[Signal integrity|Signal Integrity]] is critical for MGTs due to their high line rates. The quality of a given high-speed link is characterized by the [[Bit error rate|Bit Error Ratio (BER)]] of the connection (the ratio of bits received in error to total bits received), and [[jitter]].

BER and jitter are functions of the entire MGT connection, including the MGTs themselves, their serial lines, their reference clocks, their power supplies, and the digital systems that create and consume their parallel data. As a result, MGTs are often measured by how little jitter they transmit (Jitter Transfer/Jitter Generation), and how much jitter they can tolerate before their BER is too high (Jitter Tolerance). These measurements are commonly taken using a [[Bit Error Rate Test|BERT]], and analyzed using an [[Eye diagram]].

==Other considerations==
Some other metrics for MGTs include:
* Maximum run length before loss of CDR lock
* Power Consumption
* Flexibility (e.g. multiple line rates, multiple encodings)
* Differential Swing (max differential signal the MGT can drive)
* Receiver sensitivity (min differential signal the MGT can detect)
* [[Common-mode rejection ratio]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2948">'''Multi-project chip''' ('''MPC'''), also known as '''multi-project wafer''' ('''MPW'''), services integrate onto [[microelectronics]] wafers a number of different [[integrated circuit]] designs from various teams including designs from private firms, students and researchers from universities. Because IC fabrication costs are extremely high, it makes sense to share mask and wafer resources to produce designs in low quantities. Worldwide, several MPW services are available from government-supported institutions or from private firms including Canadian Microelectronics Corporation (CMC),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmc.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; MOSIS,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mosis.com/&lt;/ref&gt; CMP,&lt;ref&gt;http://cmp.imag.fr/&lt;/ref&gt; Europractice,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europractice-ic.com/&lt;/ref&gt; eSilicon,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esilicon.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, [[WaferCatalyst]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wafercat.com&lt;/ref&gt;, and Muse Semiconductor &lt;ref&gt;http://www.musesemi.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The first well known MPW service was '''[[MOSIS]]'''  (Metal Oxide Silicon Implementation Service), established by [[DARPA]] as a technical and human infrastructure for [[VLSI]]. MOSIS began in 1981 after [[Lynn Conway]] organized the first VLSI System Design Course at [[MIT]] in 1978. 
MOSIS primarily services commercial users now but continues to serve university students and researchers.

With MOSIS, designs are submitted for fabrication using either open (i.e., non-proprietary) VLSI [[Design rule checking|layout design rules]] or vendor proprietary rules.
Designs are pooled into common lots and run through the fabrication process at foundries. The completed chips (packaged or unpackaged) are returned to customers.

[[BaySand]] announced their ASIC MPW Shuttle Program, named ASIC UltraShuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baysand.com/press-release/baysand-initiate-unique-low-cost-mpw/|title=BaySand to Initiate a Unique Low Cost Multi Project Wafer (MPW) Program|date=2016-07-22|website=BaySand Inc|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; BaySand stated that their shuttle program enables customer to tapeout from RTL and BaySand will deliver 100 units of tested, packaged chips within 8 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baysand.com/solutions/mpw/ultrashuttle/|title=Multi Project Wafer Program (MPW) - BaySand's ASIC UltraShuttle|website=BaySand Inc|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many silicon fabrication facilities offer MPW runs or a company can produce its own MPW, e.g. combine several of its own designs to form one wafer completely owned by the company. In the latter case, it may be profitable to use most of the wafer for production chips and a small portion for producing prototypes of next generation chips.

==Background==
Currie-Gregg, was born Nancy Jane Decker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/currie.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030100836/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/currie.htm |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], but considers [[Troy, Ohio]] to be her hometown.  She graduated from [[Troy High School (Troy, Ohio)|Troy High School]] in [[Troy, Ohio]], in 1977, then received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, with honors, in [[biological science]] from [[Ohio State University]] in 1980, a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[safety engineering]] from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1985, and a [[Doctorate]] in [[industrial engineering]] from the [[University of Houston]] in 1997.

Currie-Gregg is a member of Army Aviation Association of America, [[Phi Kappa Phi]], Ohio State University and [[ROTC]] [[Alumni]] Associations, [[Institute of Industrial Engineers]], and [[Human Factors and Ergonomics Society]].

==Military career==
Currie-Gregg has served in the [[United States Army]] for over 22 years. Prior to her assignment at [[NASA]] in 1987, she attended initial [[rotary-wing]] [[aviator|pilot]] training and was subsequently assigned as an instructor pilot at the [[U.S. Army Aviation School]]. She has served in a variety of leadership positions including [[section leader]], [[platoon leader]], and brigade flight-standardization officer. As a [[United States Aviator Badge|Master Army Aviator]] she has logged over 3,900 flying hours in a variety of rotary-wing and [[fixed-wing]] [[aircraft]].

==NASA career==
Currie-Gregg was assigned to NASA [[Johnson Space Center]] in September 1987 as a flight simulation engineer on the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]], a complex airborne simulator which models flight characteristics of the Shuttle orbiter. An [[astronaut]] since 1990, she has been involved in [[robot]]ic hardware and procedure development for the shuttle and [[space station]] and has worked as a spacecraft communicator. Dr. Currie-Gregg has also served as the chief of the Astronaut Office Robotics and Payloads-Habitability branches and the Habitability and Human Factors Office in JSC’s Space and Life Sciences Directorate. She has assisted the Johnson Space Center’s [[Automation]], Robotics, and Simulation Division in the development of advanced robotics systems and is a consultant to NASA’s Space Human Factors Engineering Project. A veteran of four [[Space Shuttle]] missions, she has accrued 1,000 hours in space. She flew as mission specialist – [[flight engineer]], on [[STS-57]] (1993), [[STS-70]] (1995), [[STS-88]] (1998; the first [[International Space Station]] assembly mission), and [[STS-109]] (2002).

In September 2003, Currie-Gregg was selected to lead the Space Shuttle Program’s Safety and Mission Assurance Office. As of 2006, she  serves as the Senior Technical Advisor to the Automation, Robotics, and Simulation Division in the JSC Engineering Directorate.

==Spaceflight experience==
[[STS-57]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] (June 21 to July 1, 1993). The primary objective of this mission was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier [[satellite]] (EURECA). Additionally, this mission featured the first flight of Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of [[microgravity]] experiments, as well as a [[spacewalk]] by two crewmembers, during which Dr. Currie-Gregg operated the Shuttle’s robotic arm. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials and life sciences research. STS-57 orbited the Earth 155 times and covered over 4.1 million miles in over 239 hours and 45 minutes.

[[STS-70]] [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] (July 13–22, 1995). The five-member crew deployed the final NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to complete the [[Satellite constellation|constellation]] of NASA’s orbiting [[communication]] satellite system. Dr. Currie-Gregg also conducted a [[myriad]] of [[biomedical]] and remote sensing experiments. STS-70 orbited the Earth 143 times and covered over 3.7 million miles in over 214 hours and 20 minutes.

[[STS-88]] ''Endeavour'' (December 4–15, 1998). STS-88, ISS Flight 2A was the first International Space Station assembly mission. The primary objective of this 12-day mission was to mate the first American-made module, Unity, to the first Russian-made module, Zarya. Dr. Currie-Gregg's primary role was to operate the Shuttle's 50-foot robotic arm to retrieve Zarya and connect the first two station segments. Two crewmembers performed a series of three space walks to connect electrical umbilicals and to attach hardware to the exterior structure for use during future EVAs. Dr. Currie-Gregg also operated the robot arm during the space walks. During the mission the STS-88 crew ingressed the International Space Station to complete systems activation and installation of communication's equipment. The crew also deployed two small satellites. STS-88 completed 185 orbits of the Earth and covered over 4.7 million miles in 283 hours and 18 minutes.

[[STS-109]] [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] (March 1–12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourth mission to service the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. During the flight, Dr. Currie-Gregg’s primary role was to operate the Shuttle’s 50-foot robot arm to retrieve and redeploy the [[telescope]] following the completion of numerous upgrades and repairs. She also operated the robot arm during a series of five consecutive spacewalks performed by four crewmembers. Hubble’s scientific capabilities and power system were significantly upgraded with the replacement of both solar arrays and the primary power control unit, the installation of the Advanced [[Camera]] for Surveys, and a scientific instrument cooling system. The Hubble Space Telescope was then boosted to a higher orbit and redeployed to continue its mission of providing views of the universe which are unmatched by ground-based telescopes or other satellites. STS-109 completed 165 earth orbits and covered over 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/currie.html |title=Biography of Nancy J. Currie |website=JSC.NASA.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post astronaut career==
Currie-Gregg served as principal engineer in NASA's engineering safety center. She currently holds an appointment as an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering at [[North Carolina State University]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/nesc/team/Nancy_Currie_bio.html  |title=Dr. Nancy J.

Research on NTFPs has focused on their ability to be produced as commodities for rural incomes and markets, as an expression of traditional knowledge or as a livelihood option for rural household needs, and as a key component of [[sustainable forest management]] and conservation strategies. All research promotes forest products as valuable commodities and tools that can promote the conservation of forests.

==Definitions==
The wide variety of NTFPs includes [[mushroom]]s, [[huckleberries]], [[fern]]s, transplants, seed cones, piñon seeds, [[tree nuts]], [[moss]], [[maple syrup]], cork, [[cinnamon]], rubber, wild pigs, tree oils and [[resins]], and [[ginseng]]. The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Forestry Commission]] defines NTFPs as "any biological resources found in woodlands except timber",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/infd-5xney5 |title=Forest Research - Social, cultural and economic values of contemporary non-timber forest products: Wild Harvests |publisher=Forestry.gov.uk |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Forest Harvest, part of the [[Reforesting Scotland]] project, defines them as "materials supplied by woodlands - except the conventional harvest of timber".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestharvest.org.uk/ |title=non timber forest products in Scotland |publisher=ForestHarvest |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions include wild and managed game, fish, and insects.&lt;ref name="cifor1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/corporate/factSheet/ntfp.htm |title=Forests and non-timber forest products |publisher=Cifor.org |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTFPs are commonly grouped into categories such as floral greens, decoratives, [[medicinal plants]], foods, flavors and fragrances, fibers, and [[sap]]s and resins.

Other terms similar to NTFPs include special, non-wood, minor, alternative, and secondary forest products. NTFPs in particular highlight forest products which are of value to local people and communities, but have been overlooked in the wake of forest management priorities (for example, timber production and animal forage). In recent decades, interest has grown in using NTFPs as alternatives or supplements to forest management practices. In some forest types, under the right political and social conditions, forests can be managed to increase NTFP diversity, and consequently, to increase [[biodiversity]] and potentially economic diversity. Black truffle cultivation in the Mediterranean area is a good example of a high profitability when well managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonet|first1=Jose-Antonio|last2=Oliach|first2=Daniel|last3=Fischer|first3=Christine|last4=Olivera|first4=Antoni|last5=Martinez de Aragon|first5=Juan|last6=Colinas|first6=Carlos|title=Cultivation Methods of the Black Truffle, the Most Profitable Mediterranean Non-Wood Forest Product; A State of the Art Review.|journal=Modelling, Valuing and Managing Mediterranean Forest Ecosystems For Non-Timber Goods and Services|date=2009|volume=57|pages=57–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinez de Aragon|first1=Juan|last2=Fischer|first2=Christine|last3=Bonet|first3=Jose-Antonio|title=Economically profitable post fire restoration with black truffle (Tuber melanosporum) producing plantations|journal=New Forests|date=2012|volume=43|issue=5-6|pages=615–630|doi=10.1007/s11056-012-9316-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11056-012-9316-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The harvest of NTFPs remains widespread throughout the world. People from a wide range of socioeconomic, geographical, and cultural contexts harvest NTFPs for a number of purposes, including  household subsistence, maintenance of cultural and familial traditions, spiritual fulfillment, physical and [[emotional well-being]], house heating and cooking, animal feeding, indigenous medicine and healing, scientific learning, and income.&lt;ref name="cifor1"/&gt; Other terms synonymous with harvesting include wild-crafting, gathering, collecting, and foraging. NTFPs also serve as raw materials for industries ranging from large-scale floral greens suppliers and pharmaceutical companies to microenterprises centered upon a wide variety of activities (such as basket-making, woodcarving, and the harvest and processing of various medicinal plants).

==Economic importance==
Estimate the contribution of NTFPs to national or regional economies is difficult, broad-based systems for tracking the combined value of the hundreds of products that make up various NTFP industries are lacking. One exception to this is the maple syrup industry, which in 2002 in the US alone yielded {{convert|1.4|e6USgal|m3}} worth [[United States dollar|US$D]]38.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | title = SIC 0831 Forest Nurseries and Gathering of Forest Products  | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of American Industries, 5th ed.  | publisher =Gale  | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[temperate forest]]s such as in the US, wild edible mushrooms such as [[matsutake]], medicinal plants such as ginseng, and floral greens such as [[Gaultheria shallon|salal]] and sword fern are multimillion-dollar industries. While these high-value species may attract the most attention, a diversity of NTFPs can be found in most forests of the world.

In tropical forests, for example, NTFPs can be an important source of income that can supplement farming and/or other activities.  A value analysis of the [[Amazon rainforest]] in Peru found that exploitation of NTFPs could yield higher net revenue per hectare than would timber harvest of the same area, while still conserving vital [[ecosystem services|ecological services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Charles M.|author2=Alwyn H. Gentry |author3=Robert O. Mendelsohn |title=Valuation of an Amazonian rainforest|journal=Nature|date=29 June 1989|volume=339 | doi=10.1038/339655a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their economic, cultural, and ecological values, when considered in aggregate, make managing NTFPs an important component of [[sustainable forest management]] and the conservation of [[biological diversity|biological]] and cultural diversity.

==In ethnic minority people's livelihoods==
Minority people in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos are living away from the mainstream settlements. The hill tribes and many other minority groups are closely associated with forests for centuries. Much of their household subsistence and part of the income is generated from the sale of a variety of NTFP products. In the highlands of Vietnam, NTFPs production is spread almost throughout the year, so provides a sustained income for the ethnic minority people. From June to August is the wild berry called ''uoi'' (''Scaphium macropodium'') collection that provides the bulk of household income. Every family sends several people into the forest on a regular basis during this period where they stay for 2–3 days during which 5–6&amp;nbsp;kg of berries are collected. A kilogram of dried berries (2–3 days of sun-dry) is sold for $1.50. The next comes bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and vegetable collection that goes through to February. The minority people in Sa Pa area depends mainly on a variety of NTFPs for their livelihoods. Among the products collected are fruits, berries, leaves, mushrooms, fish, bees honey, bamboo shoots, wild orchids and the list goes on. The Friday market is full of orchids and other wild plants put forward by these people for the tourists, both domestic and international, that flock there. Between 10-15% of the total household income is derived from the sale of NTFPs. The harvesting of leaves in the diet of family goes round the year where different species are readily available in specific months. Water from forest areas is yet another service that is useful in the livelihoods of these people. They have micro-hydro plants installed in streams that generate the much needed power for pounding (grain and seeds) and lighting too.

In the drier areas of Sri Lanka, the harvesting of curry leaves to be sold to traders is an important income. The harvesting of velvet tamarind (''[[Dialium ovoideum]]'') is an important income source to the rural people. This tree which is endemic to the country provides a fruit that has a high-popularity during certain months of the year. The returns from the sale of these two products is an important addition to the household incomes of rural people.

==Research==
Research on NTFPs has focused on three perspectives: NTFPs as a commodity with a focus on rural incomes and markets, as an expression of traditional knowledge or as a livelihood option for rural household needs, and finally, as a key component of sustainable forest management and conservation strategies. These perspectives promote forest products as valuable commodities and important tools that can promote the conservation of forests. In some contexts, the gathering and use of NTFPs can be a mechanism for poverty alleviation and local development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belcher|first=B.M.|title=What isn't an NTFP?|journal=International Forestry Review|year=2003|volume=5|issue=2|pages=161–168|doi=10.1505/IFOR.5.2.161.17408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kala, CP 2003.

The '''Rujno Monastery printing house''' ({{lang-sr|Штампарија манастира Рујно}}) was a printing house established in 1537 in the Monastery of Saint George (Rujno Monastery) in village Vrutci of Rujno Župa near [[Užice]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (modern day [[Serbia]]). The monastery had substantial income from its nearby spa so it established the printing house. Still, this income was insufficient for metal types. That is why hieromonk Teodosije, [[hegumen]] of the monastery, and his fellow monks, made types of 250 engraved wooden plates. They printed one book in this printing house, ''The Rujan Four Gospels'' ({{lang-sr|Рујанско Четворојеванђеље}}). The Ottomans burned monastery together with its printing house to prevent further printing of books. Since 1984 the remnants of this monastery are below [[Lake Vrutci]].

== Rujno Four Gospels ==

The Rujno Monastery printing house was one of the oldest printing houses in the [[Balkans]] and the oldest printing house on the territory of modern day [[Serbia]] (then [[Ottoman Empire]]).{{Sfn|Đorđević|1987|p=39}} It was established and operational in a small monastery of Saint George in village Vrutci of Rujno Župa near [[Užice]] in 1537.{{Sfn|Samardžić|1993|p=409}} The monastery is also known as Rujno Monastery. Only one book was printed in Rujno Monastery printing house, ''The Rujan Four Gospels''. It was printed by hieromonk Teodosije who used wooden types to print it.{{Sfn|Đorđić|1987|p=189}} Dejan Medaković concluded that Rujno Monastery was poor so its hieromonk and printer Teodosije had to use wooden types. Some other authors believe that substantial income of monastery received from its spa actually contributed to establishment of the printing house.{{Sfn|Institut|1964|p=163}} Medaković emphasize that this was not an advancement, but step back to older [[woodcut]] technique.{{Sfn|Medaković|2006|p=118}} For many months Teodosije carefully engraved 250 wooden plates to be used for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Изградњом бране "Врутци" узводно од Ужица, потопљен древни манастир Рујан|url=http://vesnik.net/%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%B0-%D0%B3%D1%80/|publisher=Vesnik|accessdate=25 December 2014|language=Serbian&lt;!-- |quote=Текст тог колофона написао је у традицији византијско-српске рукописне књиге, под воштаницом на 250 дрвених плоча месецима је резбарио слова и штампао Рујанско Четворојеванђеље. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the different shape of some letters it was concluded that he did not engrave all letters by himself. One book was in possession of [[Vuk Karadžić]].{{Sfn|Magazine|1984|p=15}}

== Destruction of the printing house ==
When Ottomans received information about the existence of this printing house they burned monastery while its monks fled to [[Rača monastery]]. The remnants of the monastery were used to build [[madrasa]] in Užice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Изградњом бране "Врутци" узводно од Ужица, потопљен древни манастир Рујан|url=http://vesnik.net/%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%B0-%D0%B3%D1%80/|publisher=Vesnik|accessdate=25 December 2014|language=Serbian&lt;!-- |quote=Сазнавши за штампарију, Турци су Манастир спалили до темеља, а рујански монаси су спас нашли у манастиру Рача.

Вук Караџић је 1857. године написао:“За мене је и за све Србе у данашњој кнежевини Србији најзнатније оно Јеванђеље што је штампано у Рујну, у нахији ужичкој. Знамења тог славног монастира сад никакова другог нема осим камена свете трпезе који као једини сведок свете цркве своје место чува. Говори се да је тај монастир величанстевно озидан и украшен био. Стубови по 2 и 3 фата дугачки, округли и аршин дебели од финог црвеног мермера налазе се сада у Ужицу у главној турској школи-медреси који се спомена ради чувају…”--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

The books printed in the printing house of Rujno Monastery had great influence to other nearby monasteries where they were manually transcribed. Today the exact location of the original monastery is unknown.{{Sfn|Kulundžić|1973|p=30}} The region where original Rujno Monastery was built is today below the surface of lake Vrutci built in 1984 for supply of Užice with potable water. New Rujno Monastery on another location was built in period 2004—2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tasić|first1=Radoje|title=Rujansko jevanđelje dragocjenost srpske kulture|url=http://www.glassrpske.com/kultura/vijesti/Rujansko-jevandjelje-dragocjenost-srpske-kulture/lat/73037.html|publisher=Glas Srpske|accessdate=25 December 2014|date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Waveguide slotted line.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Waveguide slotted line]]
'''Slotted lines''' are used for [[microwave]] measurements and consist of a movable probe inserted into a slot in a [[transmission line]].   They are used in conjunction with a microwave power source and usually, in keeping with their low-cost application, a low cost [[Schottky diode]] detector and [[VSWR meter]] rather than an expensive [[microwave power meter]].

Slotted lines can measure [[standing wave]]s, [[wavelength]], and, with some calculation or plotting on [[Smith chart]]s, a number of other parameters including [[reflection coefficient]] and [[electrical impedance]].  A precision variable [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy.  This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors.  The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test.  This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high [[standing wave ratio]] on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter. 

Slotted lines are no longer widely used, but can still be found in budget applications.  Their main drawback is that they are labour-intensive to use and require calculation, tables, or plotting to make use of the results.  They need to be made with mechanical precision and the probe and its detector need to be adjusted with care, but they can give very accurate results.

==Description==
The slotted line is one of the basic instruments used in [[radio frequency]] test and measurement at [[microwave]] frequencies.  It consists of a precision [[transmission line]], usually [[co-axial cable|co-axial]] but [[waveguide]] implementations are also used, with a movable insulated [[Test probe#Near-field probe|probe]] inserted into a longitudinal slot cut into the line.  In a co-axial slotted line, the slot is cut into the outer conductor of the line.  The probe is inserted past the outer conductor, but not so far that it touches the inner conductor.  In a rectangular waveguide, the slot is usually cut along the centre of the broad wall of the waveguide.  Circular waveguide slotted lines are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Gupta, page 113| Voltmer, pages&amp;nbsp;146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slotted lines are relatively cheap&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Thomas H. Lee (engineering professor)|Thomas H. Lee]] even describes a [[microstrip]] slotted line for use up to {{nowrap|5 GHz}} that he claims can be made for less than $10.  He calls this a "{{nowrap|40 dB}} cost reduction" over the price of a network analyser.  That is, its cost is 10,000 times less than an analyser costing $100,000 (Lee, pages xv, 268-271).&lt;/ref&gt; and can perform many of the measurements done by more expensive equipment such as [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analysers]].  However, slotted line measurement techniques are more labour-intensive and often do not directly output the desired parameter; some calculation or plotting is frequently required.  In particular, they can only carry out a measurement at one spot frequency at a time so producing a plot of a parameter versus [[frequency]] is very time consuming.  This is to be compared to modern instruments like network and [[Spectrum analyzer|spectrum analysers]] which are intrinsically [[Radio-frequency sweep|frequency swept]] and produce a plot instantly.  Slotted lines have now largely been superseded, but are still found where [[capital cost]]s are an issue.  Their remaining uses are mostly in the [[millimetre band]], where modern test apparatus is either prohibitively expensive or not available at all, and with academic laboratories and hobbyists.  They are also useful as a teaching aid as the user is more directly exposed to basic line phenomena than with more sophisticated instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, page 496| Lee, pages 246, 251, 268| Voltmer, page 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The slotted line works by sampling the [[electric field]] inside the transmission line with the probe.  For accuracy, it is important that the probe disturbs the field as little as possible.  For this reason the probe diameter and slot width are kept small (usually around {{nowrap|1 mm}}) and the probe is inserted in no further than necessary.  It is also necessary in waveguide slotted lines to place the slot at a position where the current in the waveguide walls is parallel to the slot.  The current will then not be disturbed by the presence of the slot as long as it is not too wide.  For the [[waveguide dominant mode|dominant mode]] this is on the centre-line of the broad face of the waveguide, but for some [[transverse mode|other modes]] it may need to be off-centre.  This is not an issue for the co-axial line because this operates in the [[Transverse electromagnetic mode|TEM]] (transverse electromagnetic) mode and hence the current is everywhere parallel to the slot.  The slot may be tapered at its ends to avoid [[discontinuity (transmission lines)|discontinuities]] causing reflections.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;497–498| Gupta, page 113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disturbance to the field inside the line caused by the insertion of the probe is minimised as far as possible.  There are two parts to this disturbance.  The first part is due to the power the probe has extracted from the line and manifests as a [[lumped element model|lumped equivalent circuit]] of a [[resistor]].  This is minimised by limiting the distance the probe is inserted into the line so that only enough power is extracted for the detector to operate effectively.  The second part of the disturbance is due to energy stored in the field around the probe and manifests as a lumped equivalent of a [[capacitor]].  This [[capacitance]] can be cancelled out with an [[inductance]] of equal and opposite [[electrical impedance|impedance]].  Lumped inductors are not practical at microwave frequencies; instead, an adjustable [[stub (electronics)|stub]] with an inductive equivalent circuit is used to "tune out" the probe capacitance.  The result is an equivalent circuit of a high impedance in [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] across the line which has little effect on the transmitted power in the line.  The probe is more sensitive as a result of this tuning and the distance it is inserted can be further limited as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, page 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test setup==
[[File:Annotated slotted line test station.png|320 px|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' A test setup using a waveguide slotted line]]
[[File:Slotted line.png|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' Co-axial slotted line]]
A typical test setup with a waveguide slotted line is shown in figure 2.  Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown)  enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a [[co-ax to waveguide launcher|launcher]] (1).   This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide.  An important component in the setup is the [[Isolator (microwave)|isolator]] (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source.  Depending on the test conditions, such [[Signal reflection|reflections]] can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave.  The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] (4).  This is followed by the slotted line itself (5) above which is the probe mounted on a movable carriage.  The carriage also carries the probe adjustements: (6) is the probe depth adjustment, (7) is a length of co-axial section with tuning adjustments, and (8) is a ''detector'', which uses either a point contact ''crystal rectifier'' or a Schottky barrier diode.&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;H.

Whitmer, ''Crystal Rectifiers'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The right-hand end of the slotted line is terminated in a [[Impedance matching|matched load]] (9) which absorbs all the power exiting the end of the waveguide.  The load can be replaced by the component or system that it is desired to test.  It can also be replaced with a reference short-circuit (10) which is used to calibrate the slotted line.  The carriage can be moved along the slotted line by means of a rotary knob (11) which simultaneously moves a [[vernier gauge]] (12) for accurate measurement of the probes position along the line.&lt;ref&gt;Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;496–498&lt;/ref&gt;

The probe is connected to a detector and a display meter (not shown in figure 2).  These can be, respectively, a [[thermistor]] and power meter, or an [[envelope detector]] and [[VSWR meter]].  The detector can be a crystal detector or a [[Schottky barrier diode]].  The detector is mounted on the probe assembly, usually a distance λ/4&lt;ref group=note&gt;'''λ''', the customary symbol for [[wavelength]].  It is usually most convenient to give distances on transmission lines in terms of wavelengths of the transmitted wave, or sometimes, when the distance involved is small or not an exact multiple of a quarter wavelength, in [[radian]]s where θ=2πλ radians.&lt;/ref&gt; from the probe tip as shown in figure 3.  This is because the detector looks almost like a short circuit to the transmission line, and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through the [[quarter-wave impedance transformer]] effect.  Thus, the detector has minimal effect on loading the line.  The probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from the line linking the probe to the detector.  Figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement; the main probe into the waveguide leads to a vertical co-axial tuning and adjustment section but the detector is on a horizontal side-section with a secondary probe into the upright co-axial section.&lt;ref&gt;Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;496–497&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurements==
Measurements of microwave power can be made directly, usually with a thermistor based detector and meter.  However, these instruments are expensive and a common meter used in measurements with a slotted line is instead a cheaper low-frequency VSWR meter.  The microwave power source is [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] with, typically, a {{nowrap|1 kHz}} signal which is recovered by the envelope detector in the probe and sent to the VSWR meter.  This scheme is preferred to simply detecting the unmodulated [[carrier signal|carrier]] directly, which would result in a [[direct current|DC]] output, because a stable, narrowband, [[tuned amplifier]] can be used to amplify the {{nowrap|1 kHz}} signal.  A large amplification is required in the VSWR meter because the limit of the square law range&lt;ref group=note&gt;'''square law''', of a detector diode, the range over which the demodulated output voltage is proportional to the square of the carrier voltage on the line.&lt;/ref&gt; of the detector diode is no more than {{nowrap|10 μW}}.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, page 496| Voltmer, page 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxima and minima===
[[File:Standing Wave Ratio.svg|thumb|'''Figure 4.'''  Standing wave patterns on a line for various reflection coefficients showing maxima and minima]]
When the slotted line is terminated with a precision matching load there is no variation in the detected power along the line, other than a very small decrease due to losses in the line.  However, when this is replaced by a [[device under test]] (DUT) which is not perfectly matched to the line there will be a [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|reflection back towards the source]].  This causes a [[standing wave]] to be set up on the line with periodic [[maxima and minima]] (collectively, ''extrema'') due to alternating constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].  These extrema are found by moving the probe back and forth along the line and the level at that point can then be measured on the meter.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

The extrema are not of any great interest in themselves, but are used in the calculation of several more useful parameters.  Some of these parameters require the measurement of the exact position of the extremum.  Either maxima or minima can equally be used, from a mathematical point of view, but minima are preferred because they are always much sharper than maxima, especially for large reflections, as shown in figure 4.  Additionally, the probe causes less disturbance to the field near a minimum than it does near a maximum.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, pages&amp;nbsp;147–148&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wavelength===
[[Wavelength]] is determined by measuring the distance between two adjacent minima.  This distance will be λ/2.  There is no need for a DUT, better results are obtained with the reference short in position.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, page 498| Voltmer, page 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standing wave ratio===
[[Standing wave ratio]] (SWR or VSWR) is a basic parameter and the one most commonly measured on a slotted line.  This quantity is of particular importance for transmitter [[Antenna (radio)|antennae]].  A high SWR indicates a poor match between the feed line and the antenna, which increases wasted power, can cause damage to components in the transmission path, possibly including the transmitter, and cause distortion to TV, FM stereo and digital signals.  With the input power set so that the maxima are at 0 [[dBm]], a measurement of a minimum in decibels will directly give SWR (after discarding the minus sign).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflection coefficient===
The [[reflection coefficient]], ρ, is the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave.  In general it is a [[complex number]].  The magnitude of the reflection coeffient can be calculated from the VSWR measurement by,

:&lt;math&gt; | \rho | = \frac{\mathrm{VSWR}-1}{\mathrm{VSWR}+1}&lt;/math&gt;

where VSWR is the standing wave ratio expressed as a voltage ratio (not in [[decibel]]s).  However, to completely characterise the reflection coefficient, the phase of ρ must also be found.  This is done on a slotted line by measuring the distance of the first minimum from the DUT.  Moving the probe right up to the DUT is not practicable so a different approach is usually adopted.  The position of the first minimum when the reference short is in place is noted.  The distance back along the line from this reference point to the next minimum when the DUT is in place will be the same as the distance from the DUT to the first minimum.  This is so because the reference short guarantees a minimum at the DUT position.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;112–113| Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Phase (waves)|phase]] part of ρ is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;\angle \rho = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda} x - \pi&lt;/math&gt;

where λ is the wavelength and ''x'' is the distance to the first minimum as described earlier.  The magnitude and phase representation of ρ can, if required, be expressed as real and imaginary parts instead by the usual manipulation of complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;29–32| Das &amp; Das, page 498, 514-515| Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impedance===
The impedance, ''Z'', of the DUT can be calculated from the reflection coefficient by,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_0 \frac {1 + \rho}{1 - \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the characteristic impedance of the line.  An alternative method is to plot the VSWR and distance to the node (in wavelengths) on a [[Smith chart]].  These quantities are directly measured by the slotted line.  From this plot the DUT impedance (normalised to ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) can be read directly off the Smith chart.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;34–38| Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;514–515| Gupta, page 112, 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy considerations==

Good slotted lines are precision made instruments.  They need to be because mechanical defects can affect accuracy.  Some of the mechanical issues that are relevant to this include [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] of the vernier, concentricity of the inner and outer conductor, circularity of the outer conductor, centrality and straightness of the inner conductor, variations in cross-section, and the ability of the carriage to maintain a constant probe depth.  Issues with probe tuning and disturbances to the field have already been discussed, but the insulated spacers holding the centre conductor in place can also disturb the field.  Consequently, these are made as discrete as is compatible with mechanical strength.  However, the greatest source of inaccuracy is usually not the slotted line itself, but the characteristics of the detector diode.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;251–252&lt;/ref&gt;

The detected voltage signal output of the Schottky barrier diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a square law relationship to the power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly.  However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around {{nowrap|5-10 mV}}.  This can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to the detector output, but this also has the undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity.  Another technique is to reduce the range of power being measured (so that it is brought within the square law range of the detector) by measuring at a point other than a maximum.  The maximum is then calculated from the known mathematical shape of the standing wave pattern.  This has the objection that it adds significantly to the labour required to make the measurements, as does the technique of precisely calibrating the detector and adjusting the readings on the meter according to a calibration chart.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to completely eliminate errors in the detector and meter if a precision variable attenuator is used in the test setup.  In this technique a minimum is first found and the attenuator adjusted so that the meter is indicating precisely some convenient mark.  A maximum is then found and the attenuation increased until the meter is indicating the same mark.  The amount the attenuation had to be increased is the VSWR of the standing wave.  Accuracy here depends on the accuracy of the attenuator and not at all on the detector.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, page 253&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smart cut''' is a technological process that enables the transfer of very fine layers of [[monocrystalline|crystalline]] [[silicon]] material onto a mechanical support. It was invented by Michel Bruel of [[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|CEA-Leti]], and is protected by US patent 5374564.&lt;ref name="bruel"&gt;{{Citation  | inventor-last = Bruel  | inventor-first = Michel | publication-date = 20 December 1994  | title = Process for the production of thin semiconductor material films  | country-code = US  | patent-number = 5374564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of this technological procedure is mainly in the production of [[silicon-on-insulator]] (SOI) wafer substrates.

The role of SOI is to electronically insulate a fine layer of monocrystalline silicon from the rest of the [[silicon wafer]]; an ultra-thin silicon film is transferred to a mechanical support, thereby introducing an intermediate, insulating layer. [[Semiconductor]] manufacturers can then fabricate [[integrated circuit]]s on the top layer of the SOI wafers using the same processes they would use on plain silicon wafers. 

The sequence of illustrations pictorially describes the process involved in fabricating SOI wafers using the smart cut technology.

[[File:Solid oxide fuel cell.svg|thumb|300px|Scheme of a solid-oxide fuel cell]]

A '''solid oxide fuel cell''' (or '''SOFC''') is an [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] conversion device that produces electricity directly from [[oxidizing]] a [[fuel]]. [[Fuel cell]]s are characterized by their electrolyte material; the SOFC has a solid oxide or [[ceramic]] electrolyte. Advantages of this class of fuel cells include high efficiency, long-term stability, fuel flexibility, low emissions, and relatively low cost. The largest disadvantage is the high [[operating temperature]] which results in longer start-up times and mechanical and chemical compatibility issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=SPS|title=Review of Progress in High Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells|journal=Journal of the Australian Ceramics society|volume=50|issue=1|url=http://www.austceram.com/JAC-2014-1/ACS-Journal-2014-v1-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129041316/http://www.austceram.com/JAC-2014-1/ACS-Journal-2014-v1-23|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Solid oxide fuel cells are a class of fuel cells characterized by the use of a solid [[oxide]] material as the [[electrolyte]]. SOFCs use a solid oxide electrolyte to conduct negative oxygen ions from the cathode to the anode. The electrochemical oxidation of the oxygen ions with [[hydrogen]] or carbon monoxide thus occurs on the [[anode]] side. More recently, proton-conducting SOFCs (PC-SOFC) are being developed which transport protons instead of oxygen ions through the electrolyte with the advantage of being able to be run at lower temperatures than traditional SOFCs.

They operate at very high temperatures, typically between 500 and 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C. At these temperatures, SOFCs do not require expensive [[platinum]] [[catalysts|catalyst]] material, as is currently necessary for lower temperature fuel cells such as [[Proton exchange membrane fuel cell|PEMFCs]], and are not vulnerable to carbon monoxide catalyst poisoning. However, vulnerability to [[sulfur]] poisoning has been widely observed and the sulfur must be removed before entering the cell through the use of [[adsorption|adsorbent]] beds or other means.

Solid oxide fuel cells have a wide variety of applications, from use as auxiliary power units in vehicles to stationary power generation with outputs from 100 W to 2 MW. In 2009, Australian company, [[Ceramic Fuel Cells]] successfully achieved an efficiency of an SOFC device up to the previously theoretical mark of 60%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfcl.com.au/Assets/Files/20090219_CFCL_Announcement_60_percent_Efficiency.pdf Ceramic fuel cells achieves world-best 60% efficiency for its electricity generator units] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6R3fydwO7?url=http://www.cfcl.com.au/Assets/Files/20090219_CFCL_Announcement_60_percent_Efficiency.pdf |date=14 July 2014 }}. Ceramic Fuel Cells Limited. 19 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The higher operating temperature make SOFCs suitable candidates for application with [[heat engine]] [[energy recovery]] devices or [[combined heat and power]], which further increases overall fuel efficiency.

Because of these high temperatures, light hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane, propane, and butane can be internally reformed within the anode. SOFCs can also be fueled by externally [[Fossil fuel reforming|reforming]] heavier hydrocarbons, such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel (JP-8) or biofuels. Such reformates are mixtures of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam and methane, formed by reacting the hydrocarbon fuels with air or steam in a device upstream of the SOFC anode. SOFC power systems can increase efficiency by using the heat given off by the exothermic electrochemical oxidation within the fuel cell for endothermic steam reforming process. Additionally, solid fuels such as [[coal]] and [[biomass]] may be [[gasification|gasified]] to form [[syngas]] which is suitable for fueling SOFCs in [[Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Cycle|integrated gasification fuel cell power cycles]].

[[Volumetric thermal expansion coefficient|Thermal expansion]] demands a uniform and well-regulated heating process at startup. SOFC stacks with planar geometry require on the order of an hour to be heated to light-off temperature. [[Micro-tubular fuel cell design]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sammes|first=N.M. et al.|date=2005|title=Design and fabrication of a 100 W anode supported micro-tubular SOFC stack|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775305003071|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=145|pages=428–434|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panthi|first=D. et al.|date=2014|title=Micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell based on a porous yttria-stabilized zirconia support|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05754|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=4|pages=5754|via=Nature|doi=10.1038/srep05754}}&lt;/ref&gt; geometries promise much faster start up times, typically in the order of minutes.

Unlike most other types of [[fuel cell]]s, SOFCs can have multiple geometries. The [[planar fuel cell design]] geometry is the typical sandwich type geometry employed by most types of fuel cells, where the electrolyte is sandwiched in between the electrodes. SOFCs can also be made in tubular geometries where either air or fuel is passed through the inside of the tube and the other gas is passed along the outside of the tube. The tubular design is advantageous because it is much easier to seal air from the fuel. The performance of the planar design is currently better than the performance of the tubular design, however, because the planar design has a lower resistance comparatively. Other geometries of SOFCs include [[modified planar fuel cell design]]s (MPC or MPSOFC), where a wave-like structure replaces the traditional flat configuration of the planar cell. Such designs are highly promising because they share the advantages of both planar cells (low resistance) and tubular cells.

==Operation==
[[File:SOFC-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Cross section of three ceramic layers of a tubular SOFC. From left to right: porous cathode, dense electrolyte, porous anode]]
A solid oxide fuel cell is made up of four layers, three of which are [[ceramic]]s (hence the name). A single cell consisting of these four layers stacked together is typically only a few millimeters thick. Hundreds of these cells are then connected in series to form what most people refer to as an "SOFC stack". The ceramics used in SOFCs do not become electrically and [[ion]]ically active until they reach very high temperature and as a consequence, the stacks have to run at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C. Reduction of oxygen into oxygen ions occurs at the cathode. These ions can then diffuse through the solid oxide electrolyte to the anode where they can electrochemically oxidize the fuel. In this reaction, a water byproduct is given off as well as two electrons. These electrons then flow through an external circuit where they can do work. The cycle then repeats as those electrons enter the cathode material again.

===Balance of plant===
Most of the downtime of a SOFC stems from the [[mechanical balance of plant]], the [[air preheater]], [[prereformer]], [[afterburner]], [[water heat exchanger]], [[anode tail gas oxidizer]], and [[electrical balance of plant]], [[power electronics]], [[hydrogen sulfide sensor]] and fans. Internal reforming leads to a large decrease in the [[balance of plant]] costs in designing a full system.&lt;ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch"/&gt;

===Anode===
The ceramic [[anode]] layer must be very porous to allow the fuel to flow towards the electrolyte. Consequently, granular matter is often selected for anode fabrication procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ott| first1=J | last2=Gan | first2=Y |last3=McMeeking |first3=R | last4=Kamlah | first4=M | title= A micromechanical model for effective conductivity in granular electrode structures | journal= Acta Mechanica Sinica.| year= 2013| volume=29| issue=5| pages=682–698 |url=http://www.heterofoam.com/UserFiles/hetfoam/Documents/Ott%20et%20al%20Granular%20Electrodes%20Acta%20Mechanica%20Sinica%202013.pdf | doi=10.1007/s10409-013-0070-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the cathode, it must conduct electrons, with ionic conductivity a definite asset. The most common material used is a [[cermet]] made up of [[nickel]] mixed with the ceramic material that is used for the electrolyte in that particular cell, typically YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) [[nanomaterial-based catalyst]]s, this YSZ part helps stop the grain growth of nickel. Larger grains of nickel would reduce the contact area that ions can be conducted through, which would lower the cells efficiency. The anode is commonly the thickest and strongest layer in each individual cell, because it has the smallest polarization losses, and is often the layer that provides the mechanical support. [[Electrochemistry|Electrochemically]] speaking, the anode’s job is to use the oxygen ions that diffuse through the electrolyte to oxidize the hydrogen [[fuel]].
The [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between the oxygen ions and the hydrogen produces heat as well as water and electricity.
If the fuel is a light hydrocarbon, for example, methane, another function of the anode is to act as a catalyst for steam reforming the fuel into hydrogen. This provides another operational benefit to the fuel cell stack because the reforming reaction is endothermic, which cools the stack internally. Perovskite materials (mixed ionic/electronic conducting ceramics) have been shown to produce a power density of 0.6 W/cm2 at 0.7 V at 800&amp;nbsp;°C which is possible because they have the ability to overcome a larger activation energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrogen Oxidation Mechanisms on Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes|url=http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/163/8/F952.full|website=jes.ecsdl.org/|publisher=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrolyte===
The electrolyte is a dense layer of ceramic that conducts oxygen ions. Its electronic conductivity must be kept as low as possible to prevent losses from leakage currents. The high operating temperatures of SOFCs allow the kinetics of oxygen ion transport to be sufficient for good performance. However, as the operating temperature approaches the lower limit for SOFCs at around {{nowrap|600 °C,}} the electrolyte begins to have large ionic transport resistances and affect the performance. Popular electrolyte materials include [[yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ) (often the 8% form 8YSZ), scandia stabilized zirconia ([[ScSZ]]) (usually 9&amp;nbsp;mol%Sc2O3 – 9ScSZ) and [[gadolinium doped ceria]] (GDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nigel Sammes |author2=Alevtina Smirnova |author3=Oleksandr Vasylyev | title=Fuel Cell Technologies: State and Perspectives | journal=NATO Science Series, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry | year=2005 | volume=202 | pages=19–34 | doi=10.1007/1-4020-3498-9_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrolyte material has crucial influence on the cell performances.&lt;ref name="elmater"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/35104620 | author=Steele, B.C.H., Heinzel, A. | title=Materials for fuel-cell technologies | journal=Nature | year=2001 | volume=414 | issue=15 November | pages=345–352 | pmid=11713541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detrimental reactions between YSZ electrolytes and modern cathodes such as [[lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite]] (LSCF) have been found, and can be prevented by thin (&lt;100&amp;nbsp;nm) [[ceria]] diffusion barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mohan Menon |author2=Kent Kammer | title=Processing of Ce1-xGdxO2-δ (GDC) thin films from precursors for application in solid oxide fuel cells | journal=Advanced Materials Engineering | year=2007 | volume=15–17 | pages=293–298 | doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.15-17.293|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the conductivity for oxygen ions in SOFC can remain high even at lower temperatures (current target in research ~500&amp;nbsp;°C), material choices for SOFC will broaden and many existing problems can potentially be solved. Certain processing techniques such as thin film deposition&lt;ref name="Charpentier2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charpentier|first1=P|title=Preparation of thin film SOFCs working at reduced temperature|journal=Solid State Ionics|volume=135|issue=1–4|year=2000|pages=373–380|issn=0167-2738|doi=10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00472-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; can help solve this problem with existing materials by:

* reducing the traveling distance of oxygen ions and electrolyte resistance as resistance is proportional to conductor length;
* producing grain structures that are less resistive such as columnar grain structure;
* controlling the microstructural nano-crystalline fine grains to achieve "fine-tuning" of electrical properties;
* building composite possessing large interfacial areas as interfaces have been shown to have extraordinary electrical properties.

===Cathode===
The [[cathode]], or air [[electrode]], is a thin porous layer on the electrolyte where oxygen reduction takes place. The overall reaction is written in [[Kröger-Vink Notation]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{O_2(g)} + 2\mathrm{e'} + {V}^{\bullet\bullet}_o \longrightarrow {O}^{\times}_o &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- was: 1/2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 2e' + V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;

Cathode materials must be, at a minimum, electronically conductive. Currently, [[lanthanum strontium manganite]] (LSM) is the cathode material of choice for commercial use because of its compatibility with doped zirconia electrolytes. Mechanically, it has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to YSZ and thus limits stress buildup because of CTE mismatch. Also, LSM has low levels of chemical reactivity with YSZ which extends the lifetime of the materials. Unfortunately, LSM is a poor ionic conductor, and so the electrochemically active reaction is limited to the [[triple phase boundary]] (TPB) where the electrolyte, air and electrode meet. LSM works well as a cathode at high temperatures, but its performance quickly falls as the operating temperature is lowered below 800&amp;nbsp;°C. In order to increase the reaction zone beyond the TPB, a potential cathode material must be able to conduct both electrons and oxygen ions. Composite cathodes consisting of LSM YSZ have been used to increase this triple phase boundary length. Mixed ionic/electronic conducting (MIEC) ceramics, such as perovskite [[LSCF]], are also being researched for use in intermediate temperature SOFCs as they are more active and can make up for the increase in the activation energy of the reaction.

===Interconnect===
The interconnect can be either a metallic or ceramic layer that sits between each individual cell. Its purpose is to connect each cell in series, so that the electricity each cell generates can be combined. Because the interconnect is exposed to both the oxidizing and reducing side of the cell at high temperatures, it must be extremely stable. For this reason, ceramics have been more successful in the long term than metals as interconnect materials. However, these ceramic interconnect materials are very expensive as compared to metals. Nickel- and steel-based alloys are becoming more promising as lower temperature (600–800&amp;nbsp;°C) SOFCs are developed. The material of choice for an interconnect in contact with Y8SZ is a metallic 95Cr-5Fe alloy. Ceramic-metal composites called 'cermet' are also under consideration, as they have demonstrated thermal stability at high temperatures and excellent electrical conductivity.

==Polarizations==

Polarizations, or overpotentials, are losses in voltage due to imperfections in materials, microstructure, and design of the fuel cell. Polarizations result from ohmic resistance of oxygen ions conducting through the electrolyte (iRΩ), electrochemical activation barriers at the anode and cathode, and finally concentration polarizations due to inability of gases to diffuse at high rates through the porous anode and cathode (shown as ηA for the anode and ηC for cathode).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The cell voltage can be calculated using the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt; {V} = {E}_0 - {iR}_\omega - {\eta}_{cathode} - {\eta}_{anode} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;{E}_0&lt;/math&gt; = [[Nernst potential]] of the reactants 
*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = [[Thévenin's theorem|Thévenin equivalent]] resistance value of the electrically conducting portions of the cell
*&lt;math&gt;{\eta}_{cathode}&lt;/math&gt; = polarization losses in the cathode
*&lt;math&gt;{\eta}_{anode}&lt;/math&gt; = polarization losses in the anode

In SOFCs, it is often important to focus on the ohmic and concentration polarizations since high operating temperatures experience little activation polarization. However, as the lower limit of SOFC operating temperature is approached (~600&amp;nbsp;°C), these polarizations do become important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hai-Bo Huo |author2=Xin-Jian Zhu |author3=Guang-Yi Cao | title=Nonlinear modeling of a SOFC stack based on a least squares support vector machine | journal=Journal of Power Sources | year=2006 | volume=162 | issue=2 | pages=1220–1225 | doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.07.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above mentioned equation is used for determining the SOFC voltage (in fact for fuel cell voltage in general). This approach results in good agreement with particular experimental data (for which
adequate factors were obtained) and poor agreement for other than original experimental working parameters. Moreover, most of the equations used require the addition of numerous factors which are difficult or impossible to determine. It makes very difficult any optimizing process of the SOFC working parameters as well as design architecture configuration selection. Because of those circumstances a few other equations were proposed:&lt;ref name="Milewski J, Miller A. 2006 396-402"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1115/1.2349519 |vauthors=Milewski J, Miller A | title=Influences of The Type and Thickness of Electrolyte on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Hybrid System Performance | journal=Journal of Fuel Cell Science and Technology | year=2006 | volume=3 | issue=4 | pages=396–402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E_{SOFC} = \frac{E_{max}-i_{max}\cdot\eta_f\cdot r_1}{\frac{r_1}{r_2}\cdot\left( 1-\eta_f \right) + 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

where: 
*&lt;math&gt;E_{SOFC}&lt;/math&gt; = cell voltage
*&lt;math&gt;E_{max}&lt;/math&gt; = maximum voltage given by the Nernst equation
*&lt;math&gt;i_{max}&lt;/math&gt; = maximum current density (for given fuel flow)
*&lt;math&gt;\eta_f&lt;/math&gt; = fuel utilization factor&lt;ref name="Milewski J, Miller A. 2006 396-402"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Santarelli |author2=P. Leone |author3=M. Calì |author4=G. Orsello | title=Experimental evaluation of the sensitivity to fuel utilization and air management on a 100 kW SOFC system | journal=Journal of Power Sources | year=2007 | volume=171 | issue=2 | pages=155–168 | doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; = ionic specific resistance of the electrolyte
*&lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; = electric specific resistance of the electrolyte.

This method was validated and found to be suitable for optimization and sensitivity studies in plant-level modelling of various systems with solid oxide fuel cells.&lt;ref name="Kupecki J, Milewski J, Jewulski J"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2478/s11532-013-0211-x |author1=Kupecki J. |author2=Milewski J. |author3=Jewulski J. | title=Investigation of SOFC material properties for plant-level modeling | journal=Central European Journal of Chemistry | year=2013 | volume=11 | issue=5 | pages=664–671}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this mathematical description it is possible to account for different properties of the SOFC. There are many parameters which impact cell working conditions, e.g. electrolyte material, electrolyte thickness, cell temperature, inlet and outlet gas compositions at anode and cathode, and electrode porosity, just to name some. The flow in these systems is often calculated using the [[Navier Stokes|Navier-stokes equation]].

===Ohmic polarization===

Ohmic losses in an SOFC result from ionic conductivity through the electrolyte. This is inherently a materials property of the crystal structure and atoms involved. However, to maximize the ionic conductivity, several methods can be done. Firstly, operating at higher temperatures can significantly decrease these ohmic losses. Substitutional doping methods to further refine the crystal structure and control defect concentrations can also play a significant role in increasing the conductivity. Another way to decrease ohmic resistance is to decrease the thickness of the electrolyte layer.

====Ionic conductivity====
An ionic specific resistance of the electrolyte as a function of temperature can be described by the following relationship:&lt;ref name="Milewski J, Miller A. 2006 396-402"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 = \frac{\delta}{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; – electrolyte thickness, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; – ionic conductivity.

The ionic conductivity of the solid oxide is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Milewski J, Miller A. 2006 396-402"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \sigma_0\cdot e^\frac{-E}{R\cdot T}&lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; – factors depended on electrolyte materials, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; – electrolyte temperature, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; – ideal gas constant.

===Concentration polarization===

The concentration polarization is the result of practical limitations on mass transport within the cell and represents the voltage loss due to spatial variations in reactant concentration at the chemically active sites. This situation can be caused when the reactants are consumed by the electrochemical reaction faster than they can diffuse into the porous electrode, and can also be caused by variation in bulk flow composition. The latter is due to the fact that the consumption of reacting species in the reactant flows causes a drop in reactant concentration as it travels along the cell, which causes a drop in the local potential near the tail end of the cell.

The concentration polarization occurs in both the anode and cathode. The anode can be particularly problematic, as the oxidation of the hydrogen produces steam, which further dilutes the fuel stream as it travels along the length of the cell. This polarization can be mitigated by reducing the reactant utilization fraction or increasing the electrode porosity, but these approaches each have significant design trade-offs.

===Activation polarization===
The activation polarization is the result of the kinetics involved with the electrochemical reactions. Each reaction has a certain activation barrier that must be overcome in order to proceed and this barrier leads to the polarization. The activation barrier is the result of many complex electrochemical reaction steps where typically the rate limiting step is responsible for the polarization. The polarization equation shown below is found by solving the [[Butler–Volmer equation]] in the high current density regime (where the cell typically operates), and can be used to estimate the activation polarization:

:&lt;math&gt; {\eta}_{act} = \frac {RT} {{\beta}zF} \times ln \left(\frac {i} {{i}_0} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = gas constant
*&lt;math&gt;{T}_0&lt;/math&gt; = operating temperature
*&lt;math&gt;{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; = electron transfer coefficient
*&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; = electrons associated with the electrochemical reaction
*&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; = Faraday's constant
*&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; = operating current
*&lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; = exchange current density

The polarization can be modified by microstructural optimization. The Triple Phase Boundary (TPB) length, which is the length where porous, ionic and electronically conducting pathways all meet, directly relates to the electrochemically active length in the cell. The larger the length, the more reactions can occur and thus the less the activation polarization. Optimization of TPB length can be done by processing conditions to affect microstructure or by materials selection to use a mixed ionic/electronic conductor to further increase TPB length.

==Target==
[[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] target requirements are 40,000 hours of service for [[stationary fuel cell applications]] and greater than 5,000 hours for transportation systems ([[fuel cell vehicle]]s) at a factory cost of $40/kW for a 10&amp;nbsp;kW [[coal]]-based system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/fuelcells/index.html SECA-Coal and Power Systems]. Netl.doe.gov. Retrieved on 27 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; without additional requirements. Lifetime effects (phase stability, thermal expansion compatibility, element migration, conductivity and aging) must be addressed. The [[Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance]] 2008 (interim) target for overall degradation per 1,000 hours is 4.0%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/press/2009/09018-Fuel_Cell_Exceeds_Goals.html Fuel Cell Stacks Still Going Strong After 5,000 Hours]. Netl.doe.gov (24 March 2009). Retrieved on 2011-11-27. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008091105/http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/press/2009/09018-Fuel_Cell_Exceeds_Goals.html |date=8 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research is going now in the direction of lower-temperature SOFCs (600&amp;nbsp;°C). Low temperature systems can reduce costs by reducing insulation, materials, start-up and degradation-related costs. With higher operating temperatures, the temperature gradient increases the severity of thermal stresses, which affects materials cost and life of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ishihara|first1=Tatsumi|title=Perovskite Oxide for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells|date=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-77708-5|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intermediate temperature system (650-800&amp;nbsp;°C) would enable the use of cheaper metallic materials with better mechanical properties and [[thermal conductivity]]. New developments in nano-scale electrolyte structures have been shown to bring down operating temperatures to around 350&amp;nbsp;°C, which would enable the use of even cheaper steel and [[elastomer]]ic/[[polymer]]ic components.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wachsman|first1=Eric|last2=Lee|first2=Kang|title=Lowering the Temperature of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells|journal=Science|date=18 November 2011|volume=334|issue=6058|page=935|doi=10.1126/science.1204090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowering operating temperatures has the added benefit of increased efficiency. Theoretical fuel cell efficiency increases with decreasing temperature. For example, the efficiency of a SOFC using CO as fuel increases from 63% to 81% when decreasing the system temperature from 900&amp;nbsp;°C to 350&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Research is also under way to improve the fuel flexibility of SOFCs. While stable operation has been achieved on a variety of hydrocarbon fuels, these cells typically rely on external fuel processing. In the case of [[natural gas]], the fuel is either externally or internally reformed and the [[sulfur]] compounds are removed. These processes add to the cost and complexity of SOFC systems. Work is under way at a number of institutions to improve the stability of anode materials for hydrocarbon oxidation and, therefore, relax the requirements for fuel processing and decrease SOFC balance of plant costs.

Research is also going on in reducing start-up time to be able to implement SOFCs in mobile applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Spivey | first=B. | title=Dynamic modeling, simulation, and MIMO predictive control of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell | journal=Journal of Process Control | year=2012 | doi=10.1016/j.jprocont.2012.01.015 | volume=22 | pages=1502–1520}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be partially achieved by lowering operating temperatures, which is the case for [[Proton exchange membrane fuel cell|proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel Cell Comparison|url=http://www.nedstack.com/technology/fuel-cell-comparison|website=Nedstack|publisher=Nedstack|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their fuel flexibility, they may run on partially reformed [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], and this makes SOFCs interesting as auxiliary power units (APU) in refrigerated trucks.

Specifically, [[Delphi Corporation|Delphi Automotive Systems]] are developing an SOFC that will power auxiliary units in automobiles and tractor-trailers, while [[BMW]] has recently stopped a similar project. A high-temperature SOFC will generate all of the needed electricity to allow the engine to be smaller and more efficient. The SOFC would run on the same [[gasoline]] or diesel as the engine and would keep the air conditioning unit and other necessary electrical systems running while the engine shuts off when not needed (e.g., at a stop light or truck stop).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] is developing solid-oxide fuel cells produced by [[screen printing]] onto inexpensive ceramic materials. Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Ltd is developing an SOFC gas turbine hybrid system fueled by natural gas for power generation applications in the order of a megawatt (e.g. [[Futuregen]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

3D printing is being explored as a possible manufacturing technique that could be used to make SOFC manufacturing easier by the Shah Lab at Northwestern University. This manufacturing technique would allow SOFC cell structure to be more flexible, which could lead to more efficient designs. This process could work in the production of any part of the cell. The 3D printing process works by combining about 80% ceramic particles with 20% binders and solvents, and then converting that slurry into an ink that can be fed into a 3D printer. Some of the solvent is very volatile, so the ceramic ink solidifies almost immediately. Not all of the solvent evaporates, so the ink maintains some flexibility before it is fired at high temperature to densify it. This flexibility allows the cells to be fired in a circular shape that would increase the surface area over which electrochemical reactions can occur, which increases the efficiency of the cell. Also, the 3D printing technique allows the cell layers to be printed on top of each other instead of having to go through separate manufacturing and stacking steps. The thickness is easy to control, and layers can be made in the exact size and shape that is needed, so waste is minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Northwestern group invent inks to make SOFCs by 3D printing|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1464285915700246|website=Science Direct|publisher=Fuel Cells Bulletin|accessdate=8 November 2016|doi=10.1016/S1464-2859(15)70024-6|volume=2015|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SOEC===
A [[solid oxide electrolyser cell]] (SOEC) is a solid oxide fuel cell set in [[Regenerative fuel cell|regenerative mode]] for the [[electrolysis of water]] with a solid oxide, or [[ceramic]], [[electrolyte]] to produce oxygen and [[hydrogen gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Anne Hauch | author2=Søren Højgaard Jensen | author3=Sune Dalgaard Ebbesen | author4=Mogens Mogensen | title=Durability of solid oxide electrolysis cells for hydrogen production | journal=Risoe Reports | year=2009 | volume=1608 | pages=327–338 | url=http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/reports/ris-r-1608_327-338.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711161522/http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/reports/ris-r-1608_327-338.pdf | archivedate=11 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOECs can also be used to do electrolysis of CO2 to produce CO and oxygen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rainer Küngas

===ITSOFC===
SOFCs that operate in an intermediate temperature (IT) range, meaning between 600 and 800&amp;nbsp;°C, are named ITSOFCs. Because of the high degradation rates and materials costs incurred at temperatures in excess of 900&amp;nbsp;°C, it is economically more favorable to operate SOFCs at lower temperatures. The push for high-performance ITSOFCs is currently the topic of much research and development. One area of focus is the cathode material. It is thought that the oxygen reduction reaction is responsible for much of the loss in performance so the catalytic activity of the cathode is being studied and enhanced through various techniques, including catalyst impregnation. The research on NdCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; proves it to be a potential cathode material for the cathode of ITSOFC since it is thermos chemically stable within the temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;Nithya, M., and M. Rajasekhar. "Preparation and Characterization of NdCrO3 Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Fuel Cell Application." ''International Journal of Applied Chemistry'' 13, no. 4 (2017): 879-886.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of focus is the electrolyte materials. To make SOFC competitive in the market, ITSOFC is always the focus of the research and people try to lower the operational temperature by using the alternative new materials. However, the efficiency and stability of the materials limit their feasibility. One choice for the electrolyte new materials is the ceria-salt ceramic composites (CSCs). The two-phase CSC electrolytes GDC (gadolinium-doped ceria)- and SDC (samaria-doped ceria)-MCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Li, Na, K, single or mixture of carbonates) can reach the power density of 300-800&amp;nbsp;mW*cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Bin|title=Functional ceria–salt-composite materials for advanced ITSOFC applications|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00592-X|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=114|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/s0378-7753(02)00592-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LT-SOFC===
Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs), operating lower than 650&amp;nbsp;°C, are of great interest for future research because the high operating temperature is currently what restricts the development and deployment of SOFCs. A low-temperature SOFC is more reliable due to smaller thermal mismatch and easier sealing. Additionally, a lower temperature requires less insulation and therefore has a lower cost. Cost is further lowered due to wider material choices for interconnects and compressive nonglass/ceramic seals. Perhaps most importantly, at a lower temperature, SOFCs can be started more rapidly and with less energy, which lends itself to uses in portable and transportable applications.

As temperature decreases, the maximum theoretical fuel cell efficiency increases, in contrast to the Carnot cycle. For example, the maximum theoretical efficiency of an SOFC using CO as a fuel increases from 63% at 900&amp;nbsp;°C to 81% at 350&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, S.; Yoo, S.; Park, S.; Jun, A.; Sengodan, S.; Kim, J.; Shin, J. Highly efficient and robust cathode materials for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells: PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co(2-x)Fe(x)O(5+δ). Sci. Rep. 2013, 3, 2426-2428.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a materials issue, particularly for the electrolyte in the SOFC. YSZ is the most commonly used electrolyte because of its superior stability, despite not having the highest conductivity. Currently, the thickness of YSZ electrolytes is a minimum of ~10 μm due to deposition methods, and this requires a temperature above 700&amp;nbsp;°C. Therefore, low-temperature SOFCs are only possible with higher conductivity electrolytes. Various alternatives that could be successful at low temperature include gallium-doped ceria (GDC) and erbia-cation-stabilized bismuth (ERB). They have superior ionic conductivity at lower temperatures, but this comes at the expense of lower thermodynamic stability. CeO2 electrolytes become electronically conductive and Bi2O3 electrolytes decompose to metallic Bi under the reducing fuel environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hibini, T.; Hashimoto, A.; Inoue, T.; Tokuno, J.; Yoshida, S.; Sano, M. A Low-Operating-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell in Hydrocarbon-Air Mixtures. Science. 2000. 288, 2031-2033.&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat this, researchers created a functionally graded ceria/bismuth-oxide bilayered electrolyte where the GDC layer on the anode side protects the ESB layer from decomposing while the ESB on the cathode side blocks the leakage current through the GDC layer. This leads to near-theoretical open-circuit potential (OPC) with two highly conductive electrolytes, that by themselves would not have been sufficiently stable for the application. This bilayer proved to be stable for 1400 hours of testing at 500&amp;nbsp;°C and showed no indication of interfacial phase formation or thermal mismatch. While this makes strides towards lowering the operating temperature of SOFCs, it also opens doors for future research to try and understand this mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wachsman | first1 = E. | last2 = Lee | first2 = Kang T. | year = 2011 | title = Lowering the Temperature of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells | url = | journal = Science | volume = 334 | issue = | pages = 935–939 | doi=10.1126/science.1204090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ion Conductivity.png|thumb|300px|right|Comparison of ionic conductivity of various solid oxide electrolytes]]

Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology dealt with the instability of BaCeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; differently. They replaced a desired fraction of Ce in BaCeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with Zr to form a solid solution that exhibits proton conductivity, but also chemical and thermal stability over the range of conditions relevant to fuel cell operation. A new specific composition, Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ (BZCY7) that displays the highest ionic conductivity of all known electrolyte materials for SOFC applications. This electrolyte was fabricated by dry-pressing powders, which allowed for the production of crack free films thinner than 15 μm. The implementation of this simple and cost-effective fabrication method may enable significant cost reductions in SOFC fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Zuo, C.; Zha, S.; Liu, M.; Hatano, M.; Uchiyama, M. Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ as an Electrolyte for Low-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells. Advanced Materials. 2006, 18, 3318-3320&lt;/ref&gt; However, this electrolyte operates at higher temperatures than the bilayered electrolyte model, closer to 600&amp;nbsp;°C rather than 500&amp;nbsp;°C.

Currently, given the state of the field for LT-SOFCs, progress in the electrolyte would reap the most benefits, but research into potential anode and cathode materials would also lead to useful results, and has started to be discussed more frequently in literature.

===SOFC-GT===
An [[SOFC-GT]] system is one which comprises a solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine. Such systems have been evaluated by [[Siemens Westinghouse]] and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] as a means to achieve higher operating efficiencies by running the SOFC under pressure. [[SOFC-GT]] systems typically include anodic and/or cathodic atmosphere recirculation, thus increasing [[efficiency]].

Theoretically, the combination of the SOFC and gas turbine can give result in high overall (electrical and thermal) efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S.H. Chan |author2=H.K.

Another feature of the introduced hybrid system is on the gain of 100% CO2 capturing at comparable high energy efficiency. These features like zero CO2 emission and high energy efficiency make the power plant performance noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isfahani|first=SNR|last2=Sedaghat|first2=Ahmad|date=15 June 2016|title=A hybrid micro gas turbine and solid state fuel cell power plant with hydrogen production and CO2 capture|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319915313161|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=41|issue=22|pages=9490–9499|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DCFC===
For the direct use of solid coal fuel without additional gasification and reforming processes, a [[direct carbon fuel cell]] ([http://www.materialsviews.com/direct-carbon-fuel-cells-ultra-low-emission-technology-power-generation/ DCFC]) has been developed as a promising novel concept of a high-temperature energy conversion system. The underlying progress in the development of a coal-based DCFC has been categorized mainly according to the electrolyte materials used, such as solid oxide, molten carbonate, and molten hydroxide, as well as hybrid systems consisting of solid oxide and molten carbonate binary electrolyte or of liquid anode (Fe, Ag, In, Sn, Sb, Pb, Bi, and its alloying and its metal/metal oxide) solid oxide electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giddey | first1 = S | last2 = Badwal | first2 = SPS | last3 = Kulkarni | first3 = A | last4 = Munnings | first4 = C | year = 2012 | title = A comprehensive review of direct carbon fuel cell technology | url = | journal = Progress in energy and combustion science | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 360–399 | doi = 10.1016/j.pecs.2012.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People's research on DCFC with GDC-Li/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the electrolyte, Sm&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as cathode shows good performance.

'''SOFC operated on [[landfill gas]]'''

Every household produces waste/garbage on a daily basis. In 2009, Americans produced about 243 million tons of municipal solid waste, which is 4.3 pounds of waste per person per day. All that waste is sent to landfill sites. Landfill gas which is produced from the decomposition of waste that gets accumulated at the landfills has the potential to be a valuable source of energy since methane is a major constituent. Currently, the majority of the landfills either burn away their gas in flares or combust it in mechanical engines to produce electricity. The issue with mechanical engines is that incomplete combustion of gasses can lead to pollution of the atmosphere and is also highly inefficient.

The issue with using landfill gas to fuel an SOFC system is that landfill gas contains hydrogen sulfide. Any landfill accepting biological waste will contain about 50-60 ppm of hydrogen sulfide and around 1-2 ppm mercaptans. However, construction materials containing reducible sulfur species, principally sulfates found in gypsum-based wallboard, can cause considerably higher levels of sulfides in the hundreds of ppm. At operating temperatures of 750 ⁰C hydrogen sulfide concentrations of around 0.05 ppm begin to affect the performance of the SOFCs.

Ni + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → NiS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The above reaction controls the effect of sulfur on the anode.

This can be prevented by having background hydrogen which is calculated below.

At 453 K the equilibrium constant is 7.39 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;

ΔG calculated at 453 K was 35.833 kJ/mol

Using the standard heat of formation and entropy ΔG at room temperature (298 K) came out to be 45.904 kJ/mol

On extrapolation to 1023 K, ΔG is -1.229 kJ/mol

On substitution, K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; at 1023 K is 1.44 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence theoretically we need 3.4% hydrogen to prevent the formation of NiS at 5 ppm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=Feroze|date=1 January 2012|title=Effect of Hydrogen Sulfide in Landfill Gas on Anode Poisoning of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells|url=http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=ysu1338838003|publisher=Youngstown State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]''''' ({{lang-fr|La technique et le temps, 1: La faute d'Épiméthée}}) is a book by the French [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Bernard Stiegler]], first published by Galilée in 1994.

The English translation, by George Collins and Richard Beardsworth, was published by [[Stanford University Press]] in 1998. The ''Technics and Time'' series is the fullest systematic statement by Stiegler of his philosophy, and the first volume draws on the work of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Bertrand Gille (historian)|Bertrand Gille]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]] in order to outline and develop Stiegler's major philosophical theses. The series currently consists of three books.

==Overview==
Stiegler argues that "technics" forms the horizon of human existence. This fact has been suppressed throughout the history of philosophy, which has never ceased to operate on the basis of a distinction between ''[[episteme]]'' and ''[[techne|tekhne]]''. The thesis of the book is that the genesis of technics corresponds not only to the genesis of what is called "human" but of temporality as such, and that this is the clue toward understanding the future of the dynamic process in which the human and the technical consists.

*'''Part I''' conducts a reading of approaches to the history of technology and the origin of hominisation, in particular by [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], and [[Bertrand Gille (historian)|Bertrand Gille]]. The outcome of this reading is the thought that history cannot be thought according to the idea that humanity is the "subject" of this history and technology simply the object. When it comes to the relation between the human and the technical, the "who" and the "what" are in an undecidable relation.
*'''Part II''' is largely a reading of the work of [[Martin Heidegger]] in terms of the above consideration. Stiegler argues that Heidegger's philosophy fails adequately to grasp that, if there is such a thing as authentic temporality, the only access to it can be via objects, artefacts and, in general, technics, without which access to the past and future is impossible as such. Crucial to Stiegler's formulation of his understanding of humanity, technology, and time, is his reading of the myth of [[Prometheus]].

==Succeeding volumes==
Stiegler has thus far published three volumes in the ''Technics and Time'' series. ''The Fault of Epimetheus'' was followed by ''Tome 2: La désorientation'' (1996) and ''Tome 3: Le temps du cinéma et la question du mal-être'' (2001). Volume Two was published in translation by Stanford University Press in 2008 with the subtitle, ''Disorientation'', with Volume Three appearing in 2010 with the subtitle, ''Cinematic Time and the Question of Malaise'' (both volumes translated by Stephen Barker). Stiegler has at times mentioned his intention to publish further volumes in this series, but these are yet to appear.

In theoretical [[network science]], the '''Turing switch''' is a logical construction modeling the operation of the [[network switch]], just as in [[theoretical computer science]] a [[Turing machine]] models the operation of a [[computer]]. Both are named in honor of the English logician [[Alan Turing]], although the research in Turing switches is not based on Turing's research. Some introductory research on the Turing switch was started at the [[University of Cambridge]] by [[Jon Crowcroft]] ([http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/ Homepage]).

In essence, Crowcroft suggests that instead of using general-purpose computers to do [[packet switching]], the required operations should be reduced to application specific logic and then that application specific logic should be implemented using [[Optical networking|optical components]]. The work is not actually based on Turing's research.

A Turing switch consists of a [[switched fabric]], one or more ingress interfaces (also referred to as sources), one or more egress interfaces (sinks), and a decision procedure to determine an egress interface given an ingress interface. Interfaces are sometimes referred to as ports. A packet (cell or switched unit) arrives at an ingress interface, the appropriate egress interface is determined by the decision procedure, and the packet is then transported across the switching fabric to the egress interface. A packet is a symbol or sequence of 1's and 0's. An ingress interface is connected to an ingress line and an egress interface to an egress line. The ingress line is said to feed the ingress interface; the egress interface feeds the egress line.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Crowcroft [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-556.pdf Turing Switches. Turing machines for all-optical Internet routing] UCAM-CL-TR-556 {{ISSN|1476-2986}} January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wave motors''' were machines designed and built in the late 19th and early 20th century to harness the power of wave or [[tidal energy]].  Many experiments were planned or built in California employing various methods. The earliest wave motors were not intended for the creation of electricity. Prior to 1880, wave motors were designed to operate non-electrically to power vehicles or mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent
