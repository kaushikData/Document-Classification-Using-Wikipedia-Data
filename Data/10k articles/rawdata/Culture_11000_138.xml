'''AP Italian Language and Culture''' (or '''AP Italian''') is a course offered by the American [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]]. It is intended to give students a thorough background in the [[Italian language]] and [[Culture of Italy|Italian culture]] equivalent to a [[college]]-level course.

Due to low numbers of students taking AP Italian, it was temporarily discontinued after the 2008-2009 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=College Board Says, 'Arrivederci, AP Italian' |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/on-education/2009/01/09/college-board-says-arrivederci-ap-italian-.html|accessdate=14 November 2010|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=9 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203351/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/on-education/2009/01/09/college-board-says-arrivederci-ap-italian-.html| archivedate= 5 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 3, 2008, [[The Italian Language Foundation]] was established to support Italian language education and the AP Italian program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italianlanguagefoundation.org/history.html |title=History of the AP Italian Program |publisher=Italian Language Foundation |accessdate=14 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224020403/http://www.italianlanguagefoundation.org/history.html |archivedate=24 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 10, 2010, the College Board announced that the program would be reinstated in the fall of 2011, with the first AP Italian Exam scheduled for May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|title=Italian Studies Regains Spot on the List of AP Courses|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/education/11italian.html?_r=1|accessdate=14 November 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course content==
The AP Italian Language and Culture course focuses on developing students' reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, all framed in order to reflect the richness of Italian language and culture. Teachers of the course will interweave the language structure with cultural content.

==The exam==
The examination tests students' abilities to successfully use three modes of communication: interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational. The five ultimate goals of the exam are communication, culture, connections, comparisons, and community.

==Grade distribution==
In the 2012 administration, 1,806 students took the exam, with a mean score of 3.37. 1,300 students indicated themselves as non-native speakers, who did not use Italian on a regular basis. The mean score for this group was 3.06.

'''Barang''' is a [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] term taken to mean all forms of malignant [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] or sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last1 =Mascuñana | first1 = Rolando V.  | last2 =Mascuñana    | first2 =Evelyn F.  | title =The Folk Healers-Sorcerers of Siquijor  | publisher =REX Book Store, Inc.  | date = 2004  | isbn =971-23-3543-7 |pages = 72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and related terms==
''Barang'' is a [[noun]] used to describe malignant sorcery or [[familiar spirits]] (usually a swarm of destructive insects, specifically carnivorous beetles). Other synonymous words used in the island of [[Siquijor]] in the Philippines include ''haplit'', ''paktol'' and ''anyaw''. 

'''Mambabarang''' (noun) is a practitioner of this specific type of sorcery or witchcraft. '''Binarang''' (noun) is the target of the sorcery or witchcraft. '''Nabarang''' ([[adjective]]) means someone or something experiencing the effects of the [[curse]] or hex.

==The Mambabarang==
The '''Mambabarang''' is the Filipino version of a sorcerer/sorceress; the warlock/witch is a '''Mamalarang''' (e.g. Mamalarang Vonna Rizza Decano). The name is derived from the word ''barang''. Other synonymous terms include the [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] word ''manog hiwit'', which is also synonymous to ''[[kulam]]''. The verb '''barangon''' or ''hiwitan'' means "to place a hex"; a curse in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] is a ''sumpa''. 

In legends the ''mambabarang'' keeps his swarm of carnivorous beetles in a bottle or a section of [[bamboo]], carefully feeding them [[ginger]] root. When the practitioner decides to employ his dark art, he performs a prayer ritual wherein he whispers instructions and identifies the victim to the beetles. The destructive insects are then set free and to seek out the victim and gain entry into the body via any bodily orifice: the nose, mouth, ears, anus or dermal breaks such as open sores/wounds. The victim will then feel the effects of the invasion of the insects through manifestations depending on the area of entry; [[hemorrhoids]] if through the anus, [[ear ache]] if through the ears and other similar cases. The resulting illness is supposedly resistant to conventional medical treatment and only  reveals its true nature when the victim succumbs and flying insects issue forth from bodily cavities. In reality, it is possible a carnivorous beetle could lay eggs in someone it killed, and the eggs would then hatch post-mortem.

[[Superstition|Superstitious]] folks still attribute certain illnesses or diseases to ''barang''. This most often happens in the provinces, where an herbal doctor, [[albularyo]] or a faith healer, a ''[[mananambal]]'' or ''sorhuana'' (female) / ''sorhuano'' (male) treats such diseases. In some rural provincial areas, people completely rely on the ''albularyo'' and ''mananambal'' for treatment.

'''''Canadia: 2056''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] radio [[comedy]] series which premiered on [[CBC Radio One]] in April 2007. A [[science fiction]] comedy written by [[Matt Watts (comedian)|Matt Watts]], the series centres on Max Anderson, the American liaison on board the only Canadian spaceship in an otherwise American space fleet headed toward a galactic war with the planet Ipampilash.

The premise of the series was summed up for promotional purposes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is the year 2056. The United States has launched an armada to destroy an alien threat. Canada sends the nation’s only publicly funded spacecraft, ''The Canadia'' – a ship with a single purpose. To plunge the Americans’ toilets. Travel with them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the second season, the ''Canadia'' became lost in time.

''Canadia: 2056'' first aired on [[CBC Radio One]], on Fridays from 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. - 12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.

==Cast==

Matt Watts, in addition to his role as lead scriptwriter, also provided the voice of Midshipman Anderson. Other actors included [[Shauna MacDonald]] as the voice of the ''Canadia'' computer, and [[Donnelly Rhodes]] as the American president, providing the series' explanatory voice-over at the start of each episode.  Other members of the cast include [[Stephanie Broschart]] as Margaux Faverau, [[Holly Lewis]] as Amanda Lewis, [[Paul O'Sullivan (actor)|Paul O'Sullivan]] as the Captain, [[Chuck Shamata]] as Doc Gaffney, [[Tim Hamaguchi]] as the Crewman, [[Naomi Snieckus]] as Skip, [[Peter Wildman]] as Pickens, and [[Alyson Court]] as Connie.

==Crew==

Greg DeClute directed and produced every episode except the two pilots, the first of which was directed by Tom Anniko, with Joe Mahoney doing post production.  The second pilot was produced and directed by Joe Mahoney, who served as story editor for the rest of the series.

Anton Szabo did the sound effects for every episode except the two pilots, for which Joe Mahoney did the sound effects.

Tom Anniko was Executive Producer of both seasons.

==Theme music==

Accompanying Rhodes' [[voiceover]] at the start of each [[episode]] is an instrumental [[interpretation (aesthetics)|interpretation]] of the [[song]] ''[[Life on Mars?]]'' At the end of each [[episode]], the credits are read over the song "Gravity", taken from the [[Max Webster]] album ''[[High Class in Borrowed Shoes]]''.

[[Image:Man fishing from the banks of a lake in Burkina Faso, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Wild fisheries|Wild fish]] are an example of common goods. They are [[excludability|non-excludable]], as it is impossible to prevent people from catching fish. They are, however, [[rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]], as the same fish cannot be caught more than once.]]

'''Common goods''' are defined in [[economics]] as [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]] which are [[rivalrous]] and [[non-excludable]]. Thus, they constitute one of the four main types of the most common typology of goods based on the criteria:
* whether the consumption of a good by one person precludes its consumption by another person (rivalrousness)
* whether it is possible to prevent people (consumers) who have not paid for it from having access to it (excludability)

One modern example is climate stability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreurope.eu/fileadmin/documents/pdf/Workingpapers/WWWforEurope_WPS_no040_MS110.pdf Dimitrova, A., Hollan, K., Laster, D., Reinstaller, A., Schratzenstaller, M., Walterskirchen, E., Weiss, T.  2013 (September).  Literature review on fundamental concepts and definitions, objectives and policy goals as well as instruments relevant for socio-ecological transition Working, Paper no 40, accessed May 14, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  Classic examples of common goods are water and air.  Water and air can be polluted: water flows can be tapped beyond sustainability, and air is often used in combustion, whether by motor vehicles, smokers, factories, wood fires.  In the production process these resources and others are changed into finished products such as food, shoes, toys, furniture, cars, houses and televisions.  Another example of a private exploitation treated as a [[renewable resource]] and commonly cited have been trees or timber at critical stages (used for wood and paper), oil (used for plastic, paints, foam, fabric, and often burned to create energy), mined metals (used to create machines, tools, nails, cans, coins), and crops (to become cotton and many kinds of foods). Fish stocks in international waters are also cited often.  In this later example (avoiding any issues of the natural rights of the fish), while legal excluded from fishing may not apply, when fish are withdrawn from the water without any limits being imposed, living stocks of fish are likely to be depleted for any later fishermen.  To describe situations in which economic users withdraw resources to secure short-term gains without regard for the long-term consequences, the term [[tragedy of the commons]] was coined. For example, forest exploitation leads to barren lands, and [[overfishing]] leads to a reduction of overall fish stocks, both of which eventually result in diminishing yields to be withdrawn periodically.

Debates about sustainability can be both philosophical and scientific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialeurope.eu/category/debate-and-expert-sourcing/sustainability-debate/ Isik, J. 2011 (5 December ). Sustainability: A Number of Policy Points Focusing on the Environment and Global Warming, Social Europe, accessed May 14, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414010227/http://www.socialeurope.eu/category/debate-and-expert-sourcing/sustainability-debate/ |date=April 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/arts/01iht-design1.html Rawsthornjan, A.

From Conspicuous Consumption to Collective Consumption, 1 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, wise use advocates consider common goods which are an exploitable form of a [[renewable resource]], such as fish stocks, grazing land, etc., to be sustainable in the following two cases:

* As long as demand for the goods withdrawn from the common good does not exceed a certain level, future yields are not diminished and the common good as such is being preserved as a 'sustainable' level.
* If access to the common good is regulated at the community level by restricting exploitation to community members and by imposing limits to the quantity of goods being withdrawn from the common good, the [[tragedy of the commons]] may be avoided.  Common goods which are sustained through an institutional arrangement of this kind are referred to as [[common-pool resource]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12261">'''Communication Aesthetics''' was devised by [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] and [[Fred Forest]] at Mercato San Severino in Italy in 1983. It is a theory of [[aesthetics]] calling for artistic practise engaging with and working through the developments, evolutions and paradigms of late twentieth century communications technologies.  Observing the emerging supremacy of networks over subjects, it called for an artistic approach that was both adapted to, and invested in this changing techno-social arena.

==Background==

At the occasion of Artmedia, on Video Art organized by [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], Professor of Aesthetics at the [[University of Salerno]], Fred Forest had been invited to enact a performance and installation involving the Italian National Television Broadcaster (RAI).  The ensuing encounter revealed their mutual enthusiasm and interest in the evolution of the place of art in society given then developing communications technologies.  Following an evening of intense discussion they wrote and signed a manifesto with Argentinian artist Horacio Zabala acting as witness.  From the next day onwards, they established a list of artists whose practises reflected the artistic movement they had thus established.  As a result, [[Roy Ascott]], [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Stéphan Barron]], Marc Denjean, Natan Karczmar, Jean-Claude Anglade, Mit Mitropoulos, Christian Sevette, Robert X Adrian, Jean-Marc Philippe, Wolfgang Ziemer Chrobatzek, [[Tom Klinkowstein]], Eric Gidney, Ugo la Petria, Horacio Zabala, Daniel Dewaele and Piotr Kowalski expressed their alignment with the informal international group.  [[Derrick de Kerckhove]], director of the Marshall McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the [[University of Toronto]], in direct communication with Fred Forest and [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], then set up a Canadian group titled “Strategic Arts” responding to the same concepts and objectives and in which [[Norman White]] was involved.

Communication Aesthetics is currently intact, though for geographical reasons it is today broken up into three distinct spheres of thought, action and intercession:
* [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] holds positions and furthers action within the universities of Salerno and Naples in Italy
* while [[Fred Forest]] is active in France as professor at the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis]] and currently the National Art School of Cergy, [[Sorbonne]] Paris 1
* and [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] upholds the North American connection as Director of the Marshall McLuhan programme at the [[University of Toronto]].

  | accessdate = 2007-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Forest outlines the purpose of Communication Aesthetics:

“Electrical, electronic and computer technology have now brought us firmly into communication society. This technology is at the heart of changes tha that have come about in social reorganization over a century, thus modifying not only our physical environment but also our mental system of representation. Electricity, electronics and computers today provide artists with new instruments of creation. The way our surroundings are being transformed in this direction a little more each day, together with our continually evolving adjustment with an ever-changing reality, is doubtless what is most important. This is why we must constantly reconsider our perceptions in order to apprehend the world in which we live.”&lt;ref name="Ibid"&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Communication Aesthetics claims that a concomitant evolution in technologies of communication and strategies in art would have democratized (and thus demystified) the means of artistic production thus replacing the purpose of art as material production with the purpose of art as social interaction:  “the artist now intervenes directly on reality, that is to say the carries out his symbolic and aesthetic activity using different means from those he has used up to now.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  But Communication Aesthetics pushing this position further, by calling for an interactive intervention on reality, one that plays with the spectator in both meanings of the phrase.

This play is in turn a form of power play as it questions the labelling and limitations of figures of authority.  The political ramifications of Communication Aesthetics are openly acknowledged by the founders, indeed they are called for: “In turn, the artist becomes a " social operative ", he becomes a social performer. The scaling down and the provocation of power, and its recuperation as a form of play, belong to the field of art. The responsible artist knows this power as his, and confronts the surrounding world with it.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

The socio-political position-taking goes further still, as the artists call for the recognition of the formative as well as informative nature of technology, and particularly information technologies: “It must be admitted once and for all that the history and genesis of the configurations of the imaginary are indelibly engraved in the "technologies" upon which our perception is utterly dependent - and thus today engraved in the "technologies" of communication.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  It is this analysis of the formal and functional aspects of communication that Communication Aesthetics calls for.

Communication Aesthetics pushes the psycho-physiological implications of technological innovations further still, elaborating on their concomitant modification of our concepts of Space and Time.  Just as the auto mobile changed our approach and experience of home and locality, so too Communication Aesthetics posited that IT innovations would change our approach to human interaction.  “The hooking-up of computers to each other, and also to other machines, is a fore-runner of the opening out of the telecommunications network and the abolition of certain constraints of distance.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  And, once again, it is for the artist to understand and harness these modifications and constraints so as to engage with these evolutions in the name of communication:  “We can but remark that all these transformations brought about by media systems are, without our knowing it, reorganising our whole system of aesthetic representation.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

Lastly, Communication Aesthetics engages with another more problematic implication of technological innovations, the increasing intangibility of perception and sensuality resulting from the rise of the virtual.  Indeed, far from encouraging this lapse into asociality or asensuality, Communication Aesthetics seeks to frame these emerging problems rather than shy away from them.  Once again, Communication Aesthetics seeks to lay claim to societal relevance and influence by allying communications innovations and artistic innovations on the levels both formally and functionally.

"The goal of Communication artists is certainly not to produce first level meanings, but above all to make us aware as to how, in the end, the generalised practice of Communication interreacts on the whole of our sensory system. This evolution is about to put into place the data for a " new awareness " at the edge of our perception, and then, along with new " ways of feeling ", it will open up new aesthetic paths."&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

In [[theoretical computer science]], '''communication complexity''' studies the amount of communication required to solve a problem when the input to the problem is [[distributed computation|distributed]] among two or more parties. It was introduced by [[Andrew Yao]] in 1979,&lt;ref name=yao1979&gt;{{Citation

who investigated the following problem involving two separated parties, traditionally called [[Alice and Bob]]. Alice receives an ''n''-[[bit]] string ''x'' and Bob another ''n''-bit string ''y'', and the goal is for one of them (say Bob) to compute a certain function ''f''(''x'',''y'') with the least amount of [[communication]] between them. Of course they can always succeed by having Alice send her whole n-bit string to Bob, who then computes the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'', but the idea here is to find clever ways of calculating ''f'' with fewer than ''n'' bits of communication. Note that in communication complexity, we are not concerned with the [[computational complexity|amount of computation]] performed by Alice or Bob, or the size of the [[computer memory|memory]] used.

This abstract problem with two parties (called two-party communication complexity), and its general form with [[Multiparty communication complexity|more than two parties]], is relevant in many contexts: in [[VLSI]] circuit design, for example, one wants to minimize energy used by decreasing the amount of electric signals required between the different components during a distributed computation. The problem is also relevant in the study of data structures, and in the optimization of computer networks. For a survey of the field, see the textbook by {{harvtxt|Kushilevitz|Nisan|2006}}.

== Formal definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt; f: X \times Y \rightarrow Z &lt;/math&gt; where we assume in the typical case that &lt;math&gt; X=Y=\{0,1\}^n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Z=\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;. Alice draws an n-bit string  &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; while Bob draws an n-bit string  &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;. By communicating to each other one [[bit]] at a time (adopting some [[Protocol (computing)|''communication protocol'']]), Alice and Bob want to compute the value of &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; such that at least one party knows the value at the end of the communication. At this point the answer can be communicated back so that at the cost of one extra bit, both parties will know the answer. The worst case communication complexity of this communication problem of computing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt; D(f) &lt;/math&gt;, is then defined to be

:&lt;math&gt; D(f) = &lt;/math&gt; minimum number of bits exchanged between Alice and Bob in the worst case

Using the above definition, it is useful to think of the function {{mvar|f}} as a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{mvar|A}} (called the ''input matrix'') where each row of the matrix corresponds to &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and each column corresponds to &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;. An entry in the input matrix is &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathrm{x,y}}=f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. Initially both Alice and Bob have a copy of the entire matrix A (assuming the function {{mvar|f}} is known to both). Then, the problem of computing the function value can be rephrased as "zeroing-in" on the corresponding matrix entry. This problem can be solved if either Alice or Bob knows both {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. At the start of communication, the number of choices for the value of the function on the inputs is the size of matrix, i.e. &lt;math&gt;2^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, as and when each party communicates a bit to the other, the number of choices for the answer reduces as this eliminates a set of rows/columns resulting in a [[submatrix]] of A.

More formally, a set &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times Y&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''(combinatorial) rectangle'' if whenever &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1) \in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_2) \in R&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_2) \in R&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, R can also be viewed as a submatrix of the input matrix A such that &lt;math&gt;R = M \times N&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N \subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the case when {{mvar|k}} bits are already exchanged between the parties. Now, for a particular &lt;math&gt;h \in \{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, let us define a matrix

:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mathrm{h}} = \{ (x, y) : \text{ the }k\text{-bits exchanged on input } (x , y) \text{ is }h\}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;T_{\mathrm{h}} \subseteq X \times Y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T_{\mathrm{h}}&lt;/math&gt; is a rectangle and a submatrix of A.

=== Example: EQ ===

We consider the case where Alice and Bob try to determine if they both have the same string.  That is, we are trying to determine if {{mvar|x}} is equal to {{mvar|y}}.  It is easy to prove that the equality problem (EQ) will always require you to communicate {{mvar|n}} bits in the worst case if you want to be absolutely sure {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are equal.
Consider the simple case of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} being 3 bits.  The equality function in this case can be represented by the matrix below.  The rows representing all the possibilities of {{mvar|x}}, the columns those of {{mvar|y}}.

&lt;/center&gt;
As you can see, the function only evaluates to 1 when {{mvar|x}} equals {{mvar|y}} (i.e., on the diagonal).  It is also fairly easy to see how communicating a single bit divides your possibilities in half.  If you know that the first bit of {{mvar|y}} is 1, you only need to consider half of the columns (where {{mvar|y}} can equal 100, 101, 110, or 111).

=== Theorem: &lt;math&gt;D(EQ) = n&lt;/math&gt; ===

Proof. Assume that &lt;math&gt;D(EQ) \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that there exists an &lt;math&gt;(x, x)&lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt;(x', x')&lt;/math&gt; having the same history, {{mvar|h}}.  Since this history defines a rectangle, &lt;math&gt;f(x, x')&lt;/math&gt; must also be 1.  By definition &lt;math&gt;x \neq x'&lt;/math&gt; and we know that equality is only true for &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, we have a contradiction.

Intuitively, for &lt;math&gt;D(EQ)&lt;/math&gt; less than {{mvar|n}}, we need to be able to define a rectangle in the EQ matrix greater in size than a single cell.  All of the cells in this rectangle must contain 1 for us to be able to generalize that this rectangle equals 1.  It is not possible to form such a rectangle in the equality matrix.

== Randomized communication complexity ==
In the above definition, we are concerned with the number of bits that must be ''deterministically'' transmitted between two parties. If both the parties are given access to a random number generator, can they determine the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with much less information exchanged? Yao, in his seminal paper&lt;ref name=yao1979/&gt;
answers this question by defining randomized communication complexity.

A randomized protocol &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; for a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has two-sided error.

:&lt;math&gt;
\Pr[R(x,y) = 0] &gt; \frac{2}{3}, \textrm{if }\, f(x,y) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Pr[R(x,y) = 1] &gt; \frac{2}{3}, \textrm{if }\, f(x,y) = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

A randomized protocol is a deterministic protocol that uses an extra random string in addition to its normal input. There are two models for this: a ''public string'' is a random string that is known by both parties beforehand, while a ''private string'' is generated by one party and must be communicated to the other party. A theorem presented below shows that any public string protocol can be simulated by a private string protocol that uses ''O(log n)'' additional bits compared to the original.

Note that in the probability inequalities above, the outcome of the protocol is understood to depend ''only'' on the random string; both strings ''x'' and ''y'' remain fixed. In other words, if R(x,y) yields g(x,y,r) when using random string ''r'', then g(x,y,r) = f(x,y) for at least half of all choices for the string ''r''.

The randomized complexity is simply defined as the number of bits exchanged in such a protocol.

Note that it is also possible to define a randomized protocol with one-sided error, and the complexity is defined similarly.

=== Example: EQ ===

Returning to the previous example of ''EQ'', if certainty is not required, Alice and Bob can check for equality using only {{tmath|O(\log n)}} messages.  Consider the following protocol:  Assume that Alice and Bob both have access to the same random string &lt;math&gt;z \in \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Alice computes &lt;math&gt;z \cdot x&lt;/math&gt; and sends this bit (call it ''b'') to Bob. (The &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dot product]] in [[finite field#Some small finite fields|GF(2)]].) Then Bob compares ''b'' to &lt;math&gt;z \cdot y&lt;/math&gt;. If they are the same, then Bob accepts, saying ''x'' equals ''y''. Otherwise, he rejects.

Clearly, if &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;z \cdot x = z \cdot y&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;Prob_z[Accept] = 1&lt;/math&gt;. If ''x'' does not equal ''y'', it is still possible that &lt;math&gt;z \cdot x = z \cdot y&lt;/math&gt;, which would give Bob the wrong answer. How does this happen?

If ''x'' and ''y'' are not equal, they must differ in some locations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
x = c_1 c_2 \ldots p   \ldots p'  \ldots x_n \\
y = c_1 c_2 \ldots q   \ldots q'  \ldots y_n \\
z = z_1 z_2 \ldots z_i \ldots z_j \ldots z_n 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} agree, &lt;math&gt;z_i * x_i = z_i * c_i = z_i * y_i&lt;/math&gt; so those terms affect the dot products equally. We can safely ignore those terms and look only at where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} differ. Furthermore, we can swap the bits &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; without changing whether or not the dot products are equal. This means we can swap bits so that {{mvar|x}} contains only zeros and {{mvar|y}} contains only ones:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
x' = 0   0   \ldots 0   \\
y' = 1   1   \ldots 1   \\
z' = z_1 z_2 \ldots z_{n'} 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;z' \cdot x' = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z' \cdot y' = \Sigma_i z'_i&lt;/math&gt;. Now, the question becomes: for some random string &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt;, what is the probability that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_i z'_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;?  Since each &lt;math&gt;z'_i&lt;/math&gt; is equally likely to be {{val|0}} or {{val|1}}, this probability is just &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, when {{mvar|x}} does not equal {{mvar|y}},
&lt;math&gt;Prob_z[Accept] = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm can be repeated many times to increase its accuracy. This fits the requirements for a randomized communication algorithm.

This shows that ''if Alice and Bob share a random string of length n'', they can send one bit to each other to compute &lt;math&gt;EQ(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. In the next section, it is shown that Alice and Bob can exchange only {{tmath|O(\log n)}} bits that are as good as sharing a random string of length ''n''. Once that is shown, it follows that ''EQ'' can be computed in {{tmath|O(\log n)}} messages.

=== Public coins versus private coins ===

It is easier to create random protocols when both parties have access to the same random string (shared string protocol). It is still possible to use these protocols even when the two parties don't share a random string (private string protocol) with a small communication cost.  Any shared string random protocol using any number of random string can be simulated by a private string protocol that uses an extra ''O(log n)'' bits.

Intuitively, we can find some set of strings that has enough randomness in it to run the random protocol with only a small increase in error.  This set can be shared beforehand, and instead of drawing a random string, Alice and Bob need only agree on which string to choose from the shared set. This set is small enough that the choice can be communicated efficiently. A formal proof follows.

Consider some random protocol ''P'' with a maximum error rate of 0.1. Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;100n&lt;/math&gt; strings of length ''n'', numbered &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2, \dots, r_{100n}&lt;/math&gt;. Given such an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, define a new protocol &lt;math&gt;P'_R&lt;/math&gt; which randomly picks some &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; and then runs ''P'' using &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; as the shared random string. It takes ''O''(log&amp;nbsp;100''n'') = ''O''(log&amp;nbsp;''n'') bits to communicate the choice of &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us define &lt;math&gt;p(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p'_R(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to be the probabilities that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P'_R&lt;/math&gt;  compute the correct value for the input &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a fixed &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, we can use [[Hoeffding's inequality]] to get the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr_R[|p'_R(x,y) - p(x,y)| \geq 0.1] \leq 2 \exp(-2(0.1)^2 \cdot 100n) &lt; 2^{-2n}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus when we don't have &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; fixed:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr_R[\exists (x,y):\, |p'_R(x,y) - p(x,y)| \geq 0.1] \leq \sum_{(x,y)} \Pr_R[|p'_R(x,y) - p(x,y)| \geq 0.1] &lt; \sum_{(x,y)} 2^{-2n} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The last equality above holds because there are &lt;math&gt;2^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; different pairs &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the probability does not equal 1, there is some &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; so that for all &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;|p'_{R_0}(x,y) - p(x,y)| &lt; 0.1&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; has at most 0.1 error probability, &lt;math&gt;P'_{R_0}&lt;/math&gt; can have at most 0.2 error probability.

== Quantum communication complexity ==

Quantum communication complexity tries to quantify the communication reduction possible by using quantum effects during a distributed computation.

At least three quantum generalizations of communication complexity have been proposed; for a survey see the suggested text by G. Brassard.

The first one is the [[Quantum entanglement|qubit-communication model]], where the parties can use quantum communication instead of classical communication, for example by exchanging [[photons]] through an [[optical fiber]].

In a second model the communication is still performed with classical bits, but the parties are allowed to manipulate an unlimited supply of quantum entangled states as part of their protocols. By doing measurements on their entangled states, the parties can save on classical communication during a distributed computation.

The third model involves access to previously shared entanglement in addition to [[qubit]] communication, and is the least explored of the three quantum models.

== Nondeterministic communication complexity ==

In nondeterministic communication complexity, Alice and Bob have access to an oracle.  After receiving the oracle's word, the parties communicate to deduce ''f(x,y)''.  The nondeterministic communication complexity is then the maximum over all pairs ''(x,y)'' over the sum of number of bits exchanged and the coding length of the oracle word.

Viewed differently, this amounts to covering all 1-entries of the 0/1-matrix by combinatorial 1-rectangles (i.e., non-contiguous, non-convex submatrices, whose entries are all one (see Kushilevitz and Nisan or Dietzfelbinger et al.)).  The nondeterministic communication complexity is the binary logarithm of the ''rectangle covering number'' of the matrix: the minimum number of combinatorial 1-rectangles required to cover all 1-entries of the matrix, without covering any 0-entries.

Nondeterministic communication complexity occurs as a means to obtaining lower bounds for deterministic communication complexity (see Dietzfelbinger et al.), but also in the theory of nonnegative matrices, where it gives a lower bound on the [[Nonnegative rank (linear algebra)|nonnegative rank]] of a nonnegative matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Yannakakis, M. |title=Expressing combinatorial optimization problems by linear programs|journal=J. Comput. Syst. Sci.|volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=441–466 |year=1991 |doi=10.1016/0022-0000(91)90024-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open problems ==

Considering a 0/1 input matrix &lt;math&gt;M_f=[f(x,y)]_{x,y\in \{0,1\}^n}&lt;/math&gt;, the minimum number of bits exchanged to compute &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; deterministically in the worst case, &lt;math&gt;D(f)&lt;/math&gt;, is known to be bounded from below by the logarithm of the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;M_f&lt;/math&gt;. The log rank conjecture proposes that the communication complexity, &lt;math&gt;D(f)&lt;/math&gt;, is bounded from above by a constant power of the logarithm of the rank of &lt;math&gt;M_f&lt;/math&gt;. Since D(f) is bounded from above and below by polynomials of log rank&lt;math&gt;(M_f)&lt;/math&gt;, we can say D(f) is polynomially related to log rank&lt;math&gt;(M_f)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the rank of a matrix is polynomial time computable in the size of the matrix, such an upper bound would allow the matrix's communication complexity to be approximated in polynomial time. Note, however, that the size of the matrix itself is exponential in the size of the input.

For a randomized protocol, the number of bits exchanged in the worst case, R(f), is conjectured to be polynomially related to the following formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\log \min(\textrm{rank}(M'_f): M'_f\in \mathbb{R}^{2^n\times 2^n}, (M_f - M'_f)_\infty\leq 1/3).&lt;/math&gt;

Such log rank conjectures are valuable because they reduce the question of a matrix's communication complexity to a question of linearly independent rows (columns) of the matrix. This reveals that the essence of the communication complexity problem, for example in the EQ case above, is figuring out where in the matrix the inputs are, in order to find out if they're equivalent.

== Applications ==
Lower bounds in communication complexity can be used to prove lower bounds in [[decision tree complexity]], [[VLSI circuit]]s, data structures, [[streaming algorithms]], [[space–time tradeoff]]s for Turing machines and more.

'''Cook Islands mythology''' comprises [[mythology|historical myths]], [[legend]]s, and [[folklore]] passed down by the [[History of the Cook Islands|ancient Cook Islanders]] over many generations. Many of the Cook Islands legends were recited through ancient songs and chants.&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|url=https://archive.org/stream/mythsandsongsfro013889mbp#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Myths and Songs from the South Pacific|pages=1–7|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cook Islands myths and legends have similarities to general [[Polynesian mythology]], which developed over the centuries into its own unique character.

==Creation myth==
In Cook Islands [[creation myth]], the universe was conceived of as being like the hollow of a vast [[coconut]] shell, the interior of this imaginary shell being [[Avaiki]], the under world, and the outer side of the shell as the upper world of mortals. At various depths there are floors of different levels, or lands, which communicate with each other. At the very bottom of this coconut is a thick stem tapering to a point, which represents the beginning of all things. This point is the dwelling of a spirit without human form called Te aka ia Roe (The root of all existence). The entire fabric of the universe is constantly sustained by this primary being.&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt; Above this extreme point is Te tangaengae (Breathing) or Te vaerua (Life) this being is stout and stronger than the former one. The thickest part of the stem is Te manava roa (The long lived) the third and last of the primary, ever-stationary, sentient spirits, who together form the foundation, permanence, and well-being of the rest of the universe.&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt;

We now advance into the interior of the supposed coconut shell, the lowest part of Avaiki, where the sides of the shell almost meet, there lives a goddess of flesh and blood called [[Varima te takere]] (The very beginning). Her territory is very narrow, so much so that her knees touch her chin, no other position being possible. Varima te takere was very anxious for [[offspring|progeny]]. One day she plucked off part of her right side, like a fruit from a tree, and it became the first human being, the first man [[Avatea]] (or [[Vatea]]). He became the father of gods and men, having the right half of a man and the left half a fish, split down the middle. The land assigned by the Great Mother to Avatea was called Te paparairai (The thin land). Varima te takere continued to pluck from her body more pieces of flesh, from which more children were created, the right side of her body created gods, and from her left side of her body she created goddesses.&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt;

Keeping '''crickets as pets''' emerged in [[China]] in early antiquity. Initially, [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] were kept for their "songs" ([[stridulation]]). In the early 12th century the [[Chinese people]] began holding [[Cricket fighting|cricket fights]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 79, discusses another theory dating cricket fights to the 8th century. However, the earliest ''reliable'' evidence is dated 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial era]] the Chinese also kept pet [[cicada]]s and [[grasshopper]]s, but crickets were the favorites in the [[Forbidden City]] and with the commoners alike. The art of selecting and breeding the finest fighting crickets was perfected during the [[Qing dynasty]] and remained a monopoly of the imperial court until the beginning of the 19th century.

The Imperial patronage promoted the art of making elaborate cricket containers and individual cricket homes. Traditional Chinese cricket homes come in three distinct shapes: wooden cages, ceramic jars, and [[gourd]]s. Cages are used primarily for trapping and transportation. Gourds and ceramic jars are used as permanent cricket homes in winter and summer, respectively. They are treated with special mortar to enhance the apparent loudness and tone of a cricket's song. The imperial gardeners grew custom-shaped [[Molding (process)|molded]] gourds tailored to each species of cricket. Their trade secrets were lost during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]], but crickets remain a favorite pet of the Chinese to the present day. The Japanese pet cricket culture, which emerged at least a thousand years ago, has practically vanished during the 20th century.

Chinese cricket culture and cricket-related business is highly seasonal. Trapping crickets in the fields peaks in August and extends into September. The crickets soon end up at the markets of [[Shanghai]] and other major cities. Cricket fighting season extends until the end of autumn, overlapping with the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] and the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]]. Chinese breeders are striving to make cricket fighting a year-round pastime, but the seasonal tradition prevails.

Modern Western sources recommend keeping pet crickets in transparent jars or small [[terrarium]]s providing at least two inches of soil for burrowing and containing egg-crate shells or similar objects for shelter.&lt;ref name="Amato, pp. 43–44"&gt;Amato, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; A cricket's life span is short: Development from an egg to [[imago]] takes from one to two months. The imago then lives for around one month. Cricket hobbyists have to frequently replace aging insects with younger ones which are either specifically bred for cricket fighting or caught in the wild. This makes crickets less appealing as pets in Western countries. The speed of growth, coupled with the ease of breeding and raising [[larva]]e, makes industrial-grown crickets a preferred and inexpensive food source for pet birds, reptiles, and spiders.

==Cricket biology==
[[File:Chinese crickets.jpg|thumb|Crickets as pets]]
[[File:Gryllus01.jpg|thumb|right|A male field cricket "sings" facing the entrance into his burrow, which serves as a [[resonator]].&lt;br&gt;{{audio|Field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus.ogg|"Song" of ''Gryllus&lt;br&gt;pennsylvanicus''}}]]
{{further|Cricket (insect)}}

True crickets are insects of the ''Gryllidae'', a cosmopolitan [[Family (biology)|family]] of around 100 [[Genus|genera]] comprising some 800 species, belonging to the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Orthoptera]].&lt;ref name=G415&gt;Gordh et al., p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets, like other Orthoptera ([[grasshopper]]s and [[Tettigoniidae|katydids]]), are capable of producing high-pitched sound by [[stridulation]]. Crickets differ from other Orthoptera in four aspects: Crickets possess three-segmented [[Arthropod leg|tarsi]] and long [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]; their [[Tympanal organ|tympanum]] is located at the base of the front [[Arthropod leg|tibia]]; and the females have long, slender [[ovipositor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Foltz (1998). [http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/foltz/eny3005/lab1/orthopteroid/Gryllid.htm "ENY 3005 Family Identification: Orthoptera: Gryllidae"]. University of Florida. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The life cycle of a cricket usually spans no more than three months. The [[larva]]e of the [[field cricket]] hatch from eggs in 7–8 days, while those of [[Acheta domesticus]] develop in 11–12 days. Development of the larvae in a controlled, warm ({{convert|30|C}}) farm environment takes four to five weeks for all cultivated species.&lt;ref name=K103&gt;Kompantseva et al., p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fourth or fifth larval [[instar]] the wingless larvae [[Moulting|moult]] into the winged [[imago]] which lives for around one month.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p.4; Ryan et al., p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets are omnivorous, opportunistic scavengers. They feed on decaying vegetable matter and fruit, and attack weaker insects or their larvae.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Levchenko, p. 125, warns against uncontrolled feeding of crickets to spiders immediately before and during moulting. A cricket will eagerly attack a much larger but defenseless moulting spider.&lt;/ref&gt;

A male cricket "sings" by raising his wing covers ([[Tegmen|tegmina]]) above the body and rubbing their bases against each other. The wing covers of a mature male cricket have protruding, irregularly shaped veins.&lt;ref name=R34/&gt; The scraper of the left wing cover rubs against the [[File (tool)|file]] of the right wing, producing a high-pitched chirp.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Walker, (1999). [http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/crickets/adomest.html "House cricket – Acheta domesticus"]. University of Florida. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets are much smaller than the sound [[wavelength]]s that they emit, which makes them inefficient [[transducer]]s, but they overcome this disadvantage by using external natural [[resonators]]. Ground-dwelling [[field cricket]]s use their funnel-shaped burrow entrances as [[Horn (acoustic)|acoustic horns]]; ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Oecanthus burmeisteri|sv}}'' attach themselves to leaves which serve as [[Sound board (music)|soundboards]] and increase sound volume by 15 to 47 times.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 161, 165–166, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese handlers increase the apparent loudness of their captive crickets by waxing the insects' [[Tympanal organ|tympanum]] with a mixture of [[cypress]] or [[lacebark pine]] tree sap and [[cinnabar]]. A legend says that this treatment was discovered in the day of the [[Qing Dynasty]], when the Emperor's cricket, held in a cage suspended from a pine tree, was observed to develop an "unusually beautiful voice" after accidentally dipping its wings in tree sap.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 16–17; Ryan et al., pp. 22, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Entomology|Entomologists]] from [[Ivan Regen]] onward have agreed that the principal purpose of a male cricket's "song" is to attract females for [[mating]].&lt;ref&gt;Huber et al., p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berthold Laufer]] and Frank Lutz recognized the fact but noted that it was not clear why males do it continuously throughout most of their adult lives, when actual mating doesn't take much time.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 3–4; Ryan et al., pp. 3–4. Huber et al., pp. 44–46, explain that different species "sing" in different periods of the day or night, for no longer than three hours continuously.&lt;/ref&gt; More is known about the attractive mechanism of a cricket's song. Scientists exposed cricket females to [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] "cricket songs", carefully varying different acoustic parameters, and measured the degree of females' response to different sounds. They found that although each species has its own optimal [[mating call]], the repetition rate of chirp "syllables" was the single most important parameter.&lt;ref name=H55&gt;Huber et al., pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; A male's singing skills do not guarantee him instant success: other, silent, males may be waiting nearby to intercept the females he attracts.&lt;ref&gt;Huber et al., p. 46, describe this behaviour in ''[[Gryllus integer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other males may be attracted by the song and rush to the singer just as females do. When another cricket confronts a singing male, the two insects determine each other's sex by touching their [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. If it turns out that both crickets are male, the contact leads to a fight.&lt;ref name=H45&gt;Huber et al., p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is a simplified model of ''[[Teleogryllus commodus]]'' behaviour. Huber et al., pp. 48–54, discuss various other means of sexual recognition in different species.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets, and Orthoptera in general, are model organisms for the study of male-male aggression, although females can also be aggressive.&lt;ref name=J1&gt;Judge and Bonanno, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Judge and Bonanno, the shape and size of male crickets' heads are a direct result of selection through male-male fights.&lt;ref&gt;Judge and Bonanno, pp. 1, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that only males sing, and only males fight, means that females have little value as pets apart from breeding. Chinese keepers feed young home-bred females to birds as soon as crickets display [[sexual dimorphism]].&lt;ref name=R5/&gt; There is one notable exception: males of ''[[Suzumushi|Homoeogryllus japonicus]]'' (''suzumushi'' or ''jin zhong'') sing only in the presence of females, so some females are spared to provide company to the males.&lt;ref name=R5&gt;Laufer, pp. 4–5; Ryan et al., p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pet crickets in China==

===History===

[[File:Cricket container, lacquer over wood, Jiajing reign period.jpg|thumb|left|Lacquer cricket container, 16th century]]

The singing cricket became a domestic pet in early antiquity.&lt;ref name=H136&gt;Heiser, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestors of modern Chinese people possessed a unique attitude towards small creatures, which is preserved in present-day culture of ''flower, bird, fish, insect''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;See Suga, pp. 77–78, for a review of the evolution of ''flower, bird, fish, insect'' culture.&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultures studied and conquered big game: large animals, birds, and fishes. The Chinese, according to [[Berthold Laufer|Laufer]], were more interested in insects than in all other wildlife. Insects, rather than mammals or birds, became symbols of bravery ([[mantis]]) or resurrection ([[cicada]]), and became a precious economic asset ([[Bombyx mori|silkworm]]).&lt;ref name=R9&gt;Laufer, pp. 5–6; Ryan et al., p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 500 and 200 B.C. the Chinese compiled ''[[Erya]]'', a universal encyclopedia which prominently featured insects.&lt;ref name=R69&gt;Laufer, p.6; Ryan et al., p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Affairs of the period Tsin-Tao'' (742–756) mention that "whenever the autumnal season arrives, the ladies of the palace catch crickets in small golden cages ... and during the night hearken to the voices of the insects. This custom was imitated by all the people."&lt;ref name=L10&gt;Laufer, p. 10. See also [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-09/10/content_262767.htm "Fighting won't bug these crickets"]. [[China Daily]], 2003-09-10. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest artifact identified as a cricket home was discovered in a tomb dated 960 A.D.&lt;ref name=R7&gt;Ryan et al., p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Field Museum of Natural History]] owned a 12th-century scroll painted by Su Han-Chen depicting children playing with crickets. By this time, as evidenced in the painting, the Chinese had already developed the art of making clay cricket homes, the skills of careful handling of the insects, and the practice of tickling to stimulate them.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''reliable'' accounts of cricket fights date back to the 12th century ([[Song dynasty]]) but there is also a theory tracing cricket fights to the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (8th century).&lt;ref name=S79&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singing and fighting crickets were the favorite pets of the [[Emperor of China|Emperors of China]]. The noble pastime attracted the educated class, resulting in a wealth of medieval treatises on keeping crickets. The oldest one, ''The Book of Crickets'' (''Tsu chi king''), was written by Kia Se-Tao in the first half of the 13th century. It was followed by the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming period]] books by Chou Li-Tsin and [[Liu Tong]] and early [[Qing Dynasty|Qing period]] books by Fang Hu and Chen Hao-Tse.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 6; Ryan et al., p. 11. Note that the spelling of Chinese names in Laufer's 1927 book, reproduced as-is by Ryan, may differ from modern English renditions.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yutaka Suga, cricket fighting was also popular among the commoners of [[Beijing]] and they, rather than the nobles, were "the driving force behind the amusement" during the Qing period.&lt;ref name=S79/&gt; The court, in turn, forced the commoners to collect and pay their dues in fine fighting crickets, as was retold by [[Pu Songling]] in ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio|A Cricket Boy]]'' (early 18th century). In this story, which is set in the reign of the [[Xuande Emperor]], an unfortunate peasant was given the impossible task of finding the strongest prize-fighting cricket. His cricket miraculously defeated all Emperor's insects; the ending reveals that the champion was mysteriously guided by the spirit of his own unconscious child.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 22–26; source text: Yuan, pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of cricket-keeping, that of growing molded, custom-shaped [[gourd]]s destined to become cricket homes, was an exclusive monopoly of the Forbidden City. The royal gardeners would place the [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] of an emerging ''[[Lagenaria]]'' fruit inside an earthen mould, forcing the fruit to take up the desired shape. The oldest surviving molded gourd, ''Hasshin Hyōko'' dated 1238, is preserved in [[Hōryū-ji]] temple in Japan. The art reached its peak in the 18th century, when the gardeners implemented reusable carved wood and disposable clay molds. The shapes of the gourds were tailored to different species of cricket: larger gourds for larger species, long-bottle gourds for the species known for long hops, and so on. Immature fruit easily reproduces the artwork carved into the mold, but also easily picks up any natural or man-made impurities. The finest craftsmen exploited, rather than concealed, these blemishes. Molded gourds were a symbol of the highest social standing. The ones held by Chinese royalty depicted in medieval portraits were actually prized cricket containers.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yongzheng Emperor]] held a gourd in his hand even when he was sleeping, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] maintained a private molded gourd garden. In the 1800s the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] lifted the monopoly on molded gourds, but they remained expensive even for the upper classes.&lt;ref name=R30&gt;Ryan et al., p. 30; Finch and Zhang, pp. 13–15, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Imperial era [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] revitalized cricket fighting by staging contests between cricket breeders.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Angi (2009). [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2009-12/26/content_9232984.htm "Empty nest"]. China Daily. 2009-12-26. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A cricket of her successor, the infant Emperor [[Puyi]], became a [[plot device]] in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s film ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (1987). Bertolucci presented the cricket's container as a magic [[black box]] that opens up the memories of Puyi. According to Bruce Sklarew, the cricket, mysteriously emerging from the box, carries at least three meanings: it is the [[metaphor]] of Puyi himself, it is the metaphor of his wisdom acquired through suffering, and a symbol of the ultimate freedom that comes with death.&lt;ref&gt;Sklarew, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient secrets of cricket handling and cricket-related crafts, only some of which were recorded on paper, were largely lost during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. From 1949 to 1976&lt;ref name=J211&gt;Jin and Yen, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; the Communist regime suppressed cricket keeping, which was deemed an unacceptable distraction and a symbol of the past. Cricket trade was banned altogether in the 1950s, but continued secretly even on the [[People's Square (Shanghai)|People's Square]] of Shanghai.&lt;ref name=S85&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; A dozen illegal markets emerged in the 1980s, and in 1987 the government formally allowed trading crickets on the Liuhe Road. By 1993 there were five legal markets,&lt;ref name=S85/&gt; and in the 21st century Shanghai has over 20 cricket markets.

===Trapping===
[[File:Taishan (1527).JPG|thumb|right|Landscape of Shandong]]

The short life span of a cricket necessitates frequent replacement of aging insects. The crickets sold in present-day China are usually caught in the wild in remote provinces. Earlier, most crickets sold in major cities were caught in the nearby countryside, but in the 21st century a local catch, or ''dichong'', is extremely rare.&lt;ref name=S80&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of crickets sold in Shanghai in the 1990s and the 2000s came from rural [[Ningjin County, Shandong|Ningjin County]] in [[Shandong]], where cricket hunting became a second job for local peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Yutaka Suga, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Practically all people of Ningjin—men and women of all ages—engage in the cricket business.&lt;ref name=S80/&gt; A peasant usually makes around 70 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] per night, and 2000 yuan per season.&lt;ref name=S83&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A very good season can bring a family over 10,000 yuan ($1,210).&lt;ref name=CD/&gt;

Cricket catching extends over August and September. Crickets are most active between midnight and dawn.&lt;ref name=S79&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; They are agile creatures, and when distressed they quickly hide into burrows or improvised shelter, or hop and even fly away.&lt;ref name=H39&gt;Huber, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical Chinese crickets hide underground,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Burrowing crickets use funnel-shaped entrances to their nests as natural [[resonator]]s to amplify their songs. A singing cricket literally faces its own burrow and can instantly hide underground. – Huber et al., p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; so the catcher's first task is to either force or lure the insect out of its hideout. Trappers from the North of China use lighted candles to lure insects into their traps. Trappers from the South use iron cage-like lanterns or fire baskets to carry smoldering [[charcoal]] which forces insects to flee from the smoke. Other ways of forcing the insect out involve flooding their burrows or setting up juicy fruit baits.&lt;ref name=R23&gt;Laufer, pp. 12–13; Ryan et al., p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ningjin trappers use a simple tool, similar to an ice pick, for digging earth and poking under stones.&lt;ref&gt;Yutaka Suga, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trapper who has located a cricket must catch and contain the insect without causing it any injuries. Present-day trappers use ''zhao'', a soft catching net on a wire frame, to contain the cricket on the ground. The captured crickets are then placed into a clay pot and stay there until being sold; they are fed a few boiled rice grains per day.&lt;ref name=S81&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, the Chinese used cage-like traps made of [[bamboo]] or [[ivory]] rods.&lt;ref name=R23/&gt; Pavel Piassetsky, who visited Beijing in the 1880s, described a different technique. The Beijing people used two kind of tools: a bell-like bowl with a hole in its bottom, and a tube several inches long. When a cricket was forced to leave its hideout, the trapper would quickly cover it with the bell. When the trapped cricket emerged from the hole, the trapper would present the tube, and the cricket would eagerly hide inside it. The plugged tube then became a convenient cricket cage.&lt;ref&gt;Piassetsky, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1927 book, Laufer described seven species of crickets kept by the people of Beijing; ''[[Oecanthus rufescens]]'' and ''[[suzumushi|Homeogryllys japonicus]]'' were the favorites based on their "singing" rather than fighting qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common species sold by Chinese traders in the 21st century are ''[[Anaxipha pallidula]]'', ''[[Homeoxipha lycoides]]'', ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao Changyan (2006).

At best, they can sort crickets by size; their objective is to sell the catch to the wholesalers as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="S82ff"&gt;Yutaga Suga, pp. 82,83,85.&lt;/ref&gt; They offload their catch at the local roadside markets (''daji'') in the early morning, immediately after the night shift. They frequently overstate their selling skills: many crickets remain unsold and are discarded.&lt;ref name=S83/&gt;

The trade is driven by urban consumers.&lt;ref name=S85/&gt; As recently as 1991, from 300,000 to 400,000 people of Shanghai engaged in cricket fighting, with around 100,000&amp;nbsp;crickets fighting every day of the August–September season.&lt;ref name=J211/&gt; Dealers from a large city normally control cricket haunts within {{convert|1000|km}} of their base.&lt;ref name=S85/&gt; The dealers and aficionados from Shanghai arrive in Ningjin in groups and lodge in the villages.

===Fighting and gambling===

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten doos op pootjes met achttien bamboe kokers voor vechtkrekels TMnr 1936-10a.jpg|thumb|right|A set of small tube-like cages for fighting crickets]]

Cricket fighting is a seasonal sport, "an autumn pastime" (''qiu xing'') that relies on the supply of wild-caught insects.&lt;ref name=ARE&gt;James T. Areddy (2003). [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125935631852667013 "In Shanghai, the Autumn Game Just Isn't Cricket Anymore"]. The Wall Street Journal. December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Young crickets must mature before fighting; thus the high season begins near the autumn [[equinox]].&lt;ref name=S89/&gt; Crickets are placed in individual clay homes sprinkled with herbal medicines, bathed in [[Liquorice|licorice]] [[infusion]] every three to five days and fed according to each owner's secret recipes.&lt;ref name=S88&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional diet of captive crickets, described by Laufer, consisted of seasonal green vegetables in the summer and [[mastication|masticated]] chestnuts and yellow beans in winter. The Southern Chinese also fed their crickets chopped fish, insects and honey. Fighting crickets were given a special treatment of rice, lotus seeds, and mosquitoes, and an undisclosed herbal stimulant.&lt;ref name=L15&gt;Laufer, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The owners closely watch the cricket's behavior for signs of discomfort, and adjust the diet to bring the fighters into shape.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 18; Ryan et al., p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The crickets are mated with females before the fight, as the Chinese believe that, unlike other beings, male crickets become more aggressive ''after'' having sex.&lt;ref name=S89&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In Laufer's time the fighters were sorted in three [[weight classes]]; present-day Shanghai aficionados have a system of nine classes from 0.51 to 0.74&amp;nbsp;grams. Both sides in a fight should belong to the same class, thus before the fight the crickets are weighed on high-precision scales (''huang''). The units of cricket weight, ''zun'' and ''dian'', are not used anywhere else.&lt;ref name=S90&gt;Laufer, p. 19; Yutaka Suga, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fights are held outdoors&lt;ref name=R36&gt;Ryan et al., p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; in an oval ring (''douzha''),&lt;ref name=S90/&gt; which was traditionally a flat clay pot but is more commonly a plastic container today. Crickets are stimulated with a tickler (''cao'') made of a rat's whisker hairs (Beijing style) or of fresh grass strands (Shanghai style).&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 16; Ryan et al., p. 34; Yutaka Suga, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The handler tickles the cricket's head, then the abdomen, and finally the hind legs.&lt;ref name=L19&gt;Laufer, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Each fight consists of three or five bouts; the winner must score in two of three or three of five bouts. A bout is stopped when the triumphant winner extends his wings as a sign of victory, or when his opponent flees from the action.&lt;ref name=S91&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Laufer wrote that the fights of his time usually ended in the death of one of the crickets: The winners physically beheaded their opponents.&lt;ref name=L19/&gt; Present-day fights may look vicious but are not lethal; the loser is always allowed to flee from the winner.&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt;

A winning cricket progresses from fight to fight to the rank of "the General". Laufer wrote that the people of [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Whampoa]] buried their dead fighting champions in tiny silver coffins. According to a local tradition, a proper burial of a "general" ensures a good catch of wild crickets.&lt;ref name=R39&gt;Laufer, pp. 20–21; Ryan et al., p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Live champion fighters sell for hundreds, rarely thousands of U.S. dollars.&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt; The highest price for a single cricket was recorded in 1999 at 100,000 yuan ($12,000).&lt;ref name=CD&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-09/10/content_262767.htm "Fighting won't bug these crickets"].

Betting on cricket fights is outlawed throughout the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] but widespread on the streets. In 2004 Shanghai police reported that it had raided 17,478 gambling places involving around 57,000 people. One such place specializing in cricket fights was located in an old factory building and had around 200 patrons, men in their forties and fifties, when the police arrived.&lt;ref name=P6&gt;Cao Li (2006).

===Cricket homes===

[[File:Suzumushi.jpg|thumb|left|''Suzumushi'' (''Homoeogryllus japonicus'') {{audio|Suzumushi 06z3286.ogg|Suzumushi song}}]]

Male crickets, whether held for fighting or for singing, always live in solitary individual homes or containers. Laufer in his 1927 book wrote that Chinese people sometimes hoarded hundreds of singing crickets, with dedicated cricket rooms filled with many rows of cricket homes. Such houses were filled with "a deafening noise which a Chinese is able to stand for any length of time".&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 13; Ryan et al., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day cricket containers take three different shapes: cages are used for trapping and transportation, ceramic jars or pots are used in the summer and autumn, and in the winter the surviving crickets are moved into [[gourd]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden cages made of tiny rods and planks were once the most common type of insect house. The people of Shanghai and Hangzhou areas still use stool-shaped cages for keeping captive [[grasshopper]]s. Elsewhere, cages were historically used for keeping captive [[cicada]]s. They were suspended outdoors, at the eaves of the houses and from tree branches. Their use declined when the Chinese concentrated on keeping crickets. Small cages are still used for transporting crickets. Some are curved to follow the shape of a human body; crickets need warmth and prefer to be kept close to the body. The cage is placed in a ''tao'', a kind of protective [[silk]] bag, and is ideally carried in the pocket of a shirt.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan et al., pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; A special type of funnel-shaped wire mesh cage is used to temporarily contain the cricket while its main home is being cleaned.&lt;ref name=R34&gt;Laufer, p. 16; Ryan et al., p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramic jars or pots with flat lids, introduced in the Ming period, are the preferred type of container for keeping the cricket in summer. Some jars are shaped as a gourd but most are cylindrical. Thick clay walls effectively shield the cricket from excessive heat. Ceramic pots are used for raising cricket [[larva]]e until the insect matures to the point when it can be safely transported in a cage or a gourd. The bottom of the jar is filled with a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] made of clay, lime, and sand. It is levelled at a slant angle of about thirty degrees, smoothed, and dried into a shiny solid mass. In addition to shaping the cricket's habitat, it also defines the acoustic properties of a cricket house. Inside, the jar may contain a cricket "bed" or "sleeping box" (''lingfan'') made of clay, wood, or ivory, and miniature porcelain "dishes".&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 14; Ryan et al., pp. 27–28; Yutaka Suga, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pet crickets spend winters in a different type of container made of a gourd (the hard-shelled fruit of ''Lagenaria vulgaris''). The bottoms of the gourds are filled with lime mortar. The carved lids can be made of [[jade]], coconut shell, sandalwood and ivory; the most common [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] employs an ornament of gourd vines, flowers, and fruits. The thickness of the lid and the configuration of vents in it are tailored to enhance the tone of a cricket's song.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 14–15; Ryan, pp. 21, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient art of growing molded gourds was lost during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when the old pastime was deemed inappropriate for Red China. 20th-century cricket enthusiasts like [[Wang Shixiang]] had to carve their gourds themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Barrass, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary cricket gourds have carved, rather than naturally molded, surfaces. Molded gourds are being slowly re-introduced since the 1990s by enthusiasts like Zhang Cairi.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan et al., p. 30; Finch and Zhang, pp. 15, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pet crickets in Japan==
[[File:Torii Kiyohiro - Three Street Vendors Selling Goods for Autumn.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese market scene by [[Torii school|Torii Kiyohiro]], around 1750. The trader on the right sells cages for crickets.]]

The two species most esteemed in Japan, according to Huber et al., are the ''Homoeogryllus japonicus'' (bell cricket, ''[[suzumushi]]'') and the ''Xenogryllus marmoratus'' (pine cricket, ''matsumushi'').&lt;ref name=H40/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Contemporary English translators renders ''suzumushi'' as ''bell cricket'', ''matsumushi'' as ''pine cricket'' – see translator's notes to ''The Tale of Genji'', pp. 445 and 1135.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lafcadio Hearn]] in his 1898 book named the third species, ''kirigirisu'' (''[[Gampsocleis mikado]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, pp. 46, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese identified and described the most musical cricket haunts centuries ago, long before they began keeping them at home.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hearn, the Japanese esteemed crickets far higher than the cicadas, which were considered "vulgar chatterers" and were never caged.&lt;ref name=HH42&gt;Hearn, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first poetic description of ''matsumushi'' is credited to [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] (905 A.D.).&lt;ref name=HH61&gt;Hearn, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Suzumushi is featured in an eponymous chapter of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (1000–1008 A.D.) which, according to Hearn, is the oldest Japanese account of an insect hunt.&lt;ref name=HH44&gt;Hearn, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets and katydids (''mushi'') were the staple [[kigo|symbols of autumn]] in [[haiku]] poetry.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; The Western culture, unlike its Japanese counterpart, regards crickets as symbols of ''summer''. American film producers routinely insert clips of cricket sounds to tell the audience that the action takes place in summer.&lt;ref name=R42&gt;Huber, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cricket trade emerged as a full-time occupation in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; The poet [[Takarai Kikaku]] complained that he could not find any ''mushiya'' (cricket dealers) in the city of [[Edo]]; according to Hearn this meant that he ''expected'' to find such dealers there.&lt;ref name=HH46&gt;Hearn, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tokyo]] lagged behind other cities; regular trade there emerged only at the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=HH48&gt;Hearn, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; A food vendor named Chuzo, who collected crickets for fun, suddenly discovered considerable demand for them among his neighbors and started trading in wild crickets.&lt;ref name=HH49&gt;Hearn, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his customers, Kiriyama, succeeded in breeding three species of crickets. He partnered with Chuzo in the business, which was "profitable beyond expectations".&lt;ref name=HH50&gt;Hearn, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Chuzo was flooded with orders and switched exclusively to wholesale operations, supplying crickets to street dealers and collecting royalties from cage makers.&lt;ref name=HH51&gt;Hearn, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Bunsei]] period the government contained competition between cricket dealers by limiting them to thirty-six, in a [[guild]] known as Ōyama-Ko (after [[Mount Ōyama (Kanagawa)|Mount Ōyama]]) or, alternatively, the Yedo Insect Company.&lt;ref name=HH53&gt;Hearn, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 19th century cricket trade was dominated by two houses: Kawasumo Kanesaburo and his network supplied wild-caught insects, and the Yumoto house specialized in breeding crickets off-season. They dealt in twelve species of wild-caught and nine species of artificially-bred crickets.&lt;ref name=HH55&gt;Hearn, p. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition, which peaked in the 19th century, is now largely gone but crickets are still sold at pet shops.&lt;ref name=H40&gt;Huber et al., p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; A large colony of suzumushi crickets thrives at the altar of the [[Suzumushi Temple]] in [[Kyoto]]. These crickets have no particular religious significance; they are retained as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=H41&gt;Huber et al., p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pet crickets in the West==

European naturalists studied crickets since the 18th century. [[William Gould (naturalist)|William Gould]] described feeding ant nymphs to a captive [[mole cricket]] for several months.&lt;ref&gt;Rennie, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The European approach to cricket breeding has been popularized by [[Jean-Henri Fabre]]. Fabre wrote that breeding "demands no particular preparations. A little patience is enough."&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fabre, home breeding may start as early as April or May with the capture of a couple of field crickets. They are placed in a flower pot with "a layer of beaten earth" inside, and a tightly fitting lid. Fed only with lettuce, Fabre's cricket couple laid five to six hundred eggs, and practically all of them hatched.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crickets are a common subject of children's books on nature and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large transparent jar or a small [[terrarium]] with at least two inches of damp soil on the bottom. There must be plenty of shelter where the crickets can hide; children's books and industrial breeders recommend [[Egg carton|egg-crate shells]]. The top of the terrarium must be tightly covered with a lid or nylon mesh.&lt;ref name=AK&gt;Amato, pp. 43–44; Kompantseva, pp. 102–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking water is supplied by offering crickets a wet sponge or spraying their container, but never directly: crickets easily drown even in small dishes of water. Crickets feed on all kinds of fresh fruit and greens;&lt;ref name="Amato, pp. 43–44"/&gt; industrial breeders also feed bulk quantities of dry [[fish food]] – ''[[Daphnia]]'' and ''[[Gammarus]]''.&lt;ref name=AK/&gt; Contrary to the Eastern approach of keeping males in solitary cells, keeping males together is acceptable: According to Amato, [[protein]]-rich diet reduces the males' drive to fight.&lt;ref name=AA&gt;Amato, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial cricket farming==

[[File:Gryllus campestris 3.jpg|thumb|right|The British population of ''[[Gryllus campestris]]'' was saved from extinction through deliberate breeding at the [[London Zoo]].]]

Chinese breeders of the 21st century strive to extend the fighting season to the whole year. They advertise farm-bred "designer bugs" as super-fighters and agree that their technology is "completely counter to the natural process". However, they refuse to use [[hormone]]s or the practice of arming crickets with steel [[Implant (medicine)|implants]].&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt; As of 2003, these farm-bred crickets retailed for only around $1.50 a head, ten times lower than average wild-caught Shandong cricket.&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt; Breeding is a risky business: Chinese cricket farms are regularly wiped out by an unknown disease.&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt; [[Mycosis|Fungal diseases]] are manageable,&lt;ref name=PK63/&gt; but crickets have no defenses against [[cricket paralysis virus]] (CrPV), which almost certainly kills the entire population. The virus was first isolated in [[Australia]] around 1970. The worst outbreak in Europe occurred in 2002. The cosmopolitan virus is carried by a multitude of invertebrate [[Host (biology)|hosts]], including [[drosophila]]e and [[honey bee]]s, which are not affected by the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Jan et al., p. 285; Christian and Scotti, pp. 305–308.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Honey bees suffer from two related but different viruses – acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) and chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), discovered in 1863. – Christian and Scotti, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all crickets farmed in the United States are ''[[Acheta domesticus]]''.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; The American cricket industry does not disclose its earnings; in 1989 Huber et al. estimated it at $3,000,000 annually.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; Most of these crickets were not pets, but [[fish bait]] and animal food. The largest shipment, of 445 metric tons, was reported by [[Purina Mills]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; A decade later individual cricket farms like the Bassett Cricket Ranch in [[Visalia, California]] easily surpassed the million-dollar mark. By 1998 Bassett shipped two million crickets a week.&lt;ref name=M181&gt;Menzel and d'Aluisio, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fluker Cricket Farm in [[Louisiana]] exceeded $5,000,000 in annual sales in 2001&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough and Zimmerer, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a staple subject of American business school textbooks.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Fluker case studies are discussed in Steven P. Robbins (2001). ''Organizational Behavior''. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-189095-6}}.; Garnter and Bellamy (2009). ''Enterprise''. Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-324-13085-6}}; Thill and Bovee (1999). ''Excellence in business communication''. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-781501-8}} etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoos of the [[Old World]] breed ''Acheta domesticus'', ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]'', and ''[[Gryllus assimilis]]''. Their cricket farms usually rotate four generation ("four crates") of insects. One generation or one physical crate is used for mating and incubation of eggs, which takes from seven to twelve days. One male usually mates to three or four females. Females are discarded (and fed to zoo animals) immediately after laying the eggs: their life span is too short to give them a second chance. Three other generations, spaced by the same seven to twelve days, are for raising the larvae, which takes 4–5 weeks. Thus the zoos restock their live food supply practically every week.&lt;ref name=KO&gt;Kompantseva et al., pp. 102–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

British zoos breed crickets in deliberate attempts to restore the nearly extinct wild populations. In the late 1980s the British population of ''[[Gryllus campestris]]'' shrunk to a single colony of around 100 individual insects. In 1991 the species became the subject of the national Species Recovery Program. Each year, three pairs of subadult crickets were caught in the wild and bred in a controlled lab environment to preserve the [[gene pool]] of the mother colony. The [[London Zoo]] raised 17,000 crickets; the field biologists laid down seven new cricket colonies, four of which survived into the 21st century. The program became a model for similar efforts in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce-Kelly et al, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period the London Zoo bred the more demanding [[wart-biter]] (''Decticus verrucivorus''), also resulting in the establishment of persistent colonies in the wild.&lt;ref name=PK63&gt;Pearce-Kelly et al., p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural-historical activity theory''' ('''CHAT''')&lt;ref&gt;Or [[activity theory]] (AT), as it is also known. {{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a theoretical framework&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=7}} notes that activity theory is a "''a research framework and set of perspectives''", not a hard and fast methodology or strongly predictive single theory.&lt;/ref&gt; which helps to understand and analyse the relationship between the human mind (what people think and feel) and activity (what people do).&lt;ref name="Daniels10"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|et al.|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaptNard6"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007|page=192}}: ''"CHAT was conceived of as a concrete psychology immersed in everyday [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/praxis praxis]"'': "''consciousness is located in everyday practice: you are what you do''" {{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traces its origins to the founders&lt;ref&gt;In the 1920s till the mid 1930s.&lt;/ref&gt; of the cultural-historical school of Russian psychology [[L. S. Vygotsky]]&lt;ref name="bioBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. (2018). [https://www.routledge.com/Vygotsky-An-Intellectual-Biography/Yasnitsky/p/book/9781138806740 Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography]. London and New York: Routledge [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Yasnitsky_2018_Vygotsky_bookPreview.pdf BOOK PREVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]].&lt;ref&gt;Leontiev may at times also be spelled as Leontyev and Leont'ev.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge99"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamaki|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is well known that the Soviet philosopher of psychology [http://www.panrus.com/books/details.php?bookID=20579 S.L.Rubinshtein], independently of Vygotsky's work, developed his own variant of activity as a philosophical and psychological theory. re: V. Lektorsky in {{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamäki|1999|p=66}};[http://resources.iupsys.net/iupsys/index.php/iupsysresources/565-iupsys-bib-2000/43662-the-activity-approach-and-psychology-2004-  Brushlinskii, A.

Engeström would be happy to also include [in the account of A.T.] reference to Luria, Zinchenko (father, Peter, and son, Vladimir), Elkonin, Davydov, Brushlinsky and Rubstov (as well as to various other figures who have influenced activity-theory in the West, such as Dewey, Mead, and Wittgenstein). {{harvnb|Bakhurst|2009|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Political restrictions in its country of origin (Stalinist Russia) had suppressed the cultural-historical psychology – also known as the Vygotsky School – in the mid-thirties. This meant that the core "[[Activity theory|activity]]" concept remained confined to the field of psychology, although {{harvnb|Blunden|2010}}, in "''An Interdisciplinary Theory of Activity''", argues that it has the potential to evolve as a genuinely interdisciplinary concept. See also {{harvnb|Nussbaumer|2012|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky's important insight into the dynamics of consciousness was that it is essentially subjective and shaped by the history of  each individual's social and cultural experience.&lt;ref name="Vyg78"/&gt; Especially since the 1990s, CHAT has attracted a growing interest among academics worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006}} Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere CHAT has been defined as "a cross-disciplinary framework for studying how humans purposefully transform natural and social reality, including themselves, as an ongoing culturally and historically [[Situated learning|situated]], materially and socially [[Cultural mediation|mediated]] process".&lt;ref&gt;CHAT explicitly incorporates the mediation of activities by ''society'', which means that it can be used to link concerns normally independently examined by sociologists of education and (social) psychologists. {{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007}} and {{harvnb|Roth|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core ideas are: 1) humans act collectively, learn by doing, and communicate in and via their actions; 2) humans make, employ, and adapt tools of all kinds to learn and communicate; and 3) community is central to the process of making and interpreting meaning – and thus to all forms of learning, communicating, and acting.&lt;ref name="Leont78"&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Activity Theory in a Nutshell. Ch 3 in {{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CHAT was coined by Michael Cole&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|1996|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by Yrjö  Engeström&lt;ref&gt;The activity theoretical framework, as recently as the 1990s, was still referred to as "''one of the best kept secrets of academia''" {{harvnb|Engeström|1993|page=64}}; {{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the unity of what, by the 1990s, had become a variety of currents&lt;ref&gt;Prominent among those currents are [[Cultural-historical psychology]], in use since the 1930s, and [[Activity theory]] in use since the 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt; harking back to Vygotsky's work.&lt;ref name="Stets05"&gt;{{harvnb|Stetsenko|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yama07"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical overview==

===Origins: revolutionary Russia===
CHAT traces its lineage to [[dialectical materialism]], classical [[German philosophy]],&lt;ref name="Enge99"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In particular Goethe's [http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/goethe.htm romantic science] ideas which were later taken up by [[Hegel]]. The meaning of "activity" in the conceptual sense is rooted in the German word ''Tätigkeit''. Hegel is considered the first philosopher to point out that the development of humans' knowledge is not spiritually given, but developed in history from living and working in natural environments.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blunden, A. 2012, [http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/origins-chat.htm "The Origins of Cultural Historical Activity Theory"] ; Blunden, A. [http://ethicalpolitics.org/chat/Genealogy-CHAT.htm Genealogy of CHAT] (graph).&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]] and [[Aleksandr Luria]], known as ''"the founding troika"''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blunden|2011|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Cultural-historical psychology|cultural-historical]] approach to [[Social Psychology]]. In a radical departure from the [[behaviorism]] and [[reflexology]] that dominated much of psychology in the early 1920s, they formulated, in the spirit of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Theses on Feuerbach]], the concept of activity, i.e., "artifact-mediated and object-oriented action".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''A human individual never reacts directly (or merely with inborn reflexes) to the environment. Consciousness and conscious action must be the central object of study for psychological science, since it is this that distinguishes humanity. The relationship between human agent and objects of environment is mediated by cultural means, tools and signs. Human action has a tripartite structure.''"({{harvnb|CRADLE|2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; By bringing together the notion of history and culture in the understanding of human activity, they were able to transcend the [[Cartesian dualism]] between subject and object, internal and external, between people and society, between individual inner consciousness and the outer world of society.&lt;ref&gt;At the beginning of and into the mid-20th century, Psychology was dominated by schools of thought that ignored real life processes in psychological functioning (e.g. [[Gestalt psychology]], [[Behaviorism]] and [[Cognitivism (psychology)]]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Vygotsky]], who created the foundation of cultural-historical psychology, based on the concept of mediation, published six books on psychology topics during a working life which spanned only ten years. He died of TB in 1934 at the age of 37. A.N. Leont'ev worked with Lev Vygotsky and Alexandr Luria from 1924 to 1930, collaborating on the development of a [[Marxist psychology]]. Leontiev left Vygotsky's group in Moscow in 1931, to take up a position in [[Kharkov]]. There he was joined by local psychologists, including Pyotr Galperin and [[Pyotr Zinchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;For a history of what came to be known as the [[Kharkov School of Psychology]] re: Yasnitsky &amp; Ferrari, 2008 in: History of Psychology Vol. 11, No. 2, 101–121.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work with Vygotsky for some time but, eventually, there was a split, although they continued to communicate with one another on scientific matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/understanding-vygotsky-a-quest-for-synthesis/oclc/786677274?referer=null&amp;ht=edition Veer and Valsiner, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev returned to Moscow in 1934. Contrary to popular belief, Vygotsky's work per se was never banned in Stalinist&lt;ref&gt;''When Stalin succeeded Lenin in 1924, the Soviet Union gradually turned into a dictatorship. This led to 30 years of stagnation during which intellectuals and academics who deviated from the Stalinist ideology were politically attacked for their work and eventually eliminated. Vygotsky's colleagues had to flee to Ukraine for safety.'' [http://tap.sagepub.com/content/21/5/557.full.pdf+html Sannino &amp; Sutter, 2011] p. 563. Stalin died in 1953 and restrictions were subsequently gradually relaxed.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, J. &amp; Yasnitsky, A. (2015).

This department became an independent Faculty in 1966 due mainly to his hard work. He remained there until his death in 1979. Leontiev's formulation of activity theory, post 1962, had become the new "official" basis for Soviet psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wertsch|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the two decades between a thaw in the suppression of scientific enquiry in Russia and the death of the Vygotsky's continuers,&lt;ref&gt;In the late 1970s, an entire generation of Soviet psychologists died: Luria and Meshcheryakov died in 1977, Leontiev and Ilienkov in 1979. (Ilienkov by his own hand. – see: [http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/soviet-psychology.htm Blunden, 2009 "Soviet Cultural Psychology"]).&lt;/ref&gt; contact was made with the West.

===Developments in the West===
Michael Cole, then a young [[Indiana University]] psychology post-graduate exchange student, arrived in Moscow in 1962 for a one-year stint of research under Alexandr Luria. Keenly aware of the gulf between Soviet and American psychology, he was one for the first Westerners to present Luria's and Vygotsky's idea to an Anglo-Saxon public.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: Luria's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/luria/works/1979/mind/ "The Making of Mind"] translated by Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/soviet-psychology.htm Blunden, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; This, and a steady flow of books translated from the Russian&lt;ref&gt;The earliest books translated into English are Lev Vygotsky's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/words/ "Thought and Language"](1962), Luria's [https://www.marxists.org/archive/luria/works/1976/problem.htm "Cognitive Development"] (1976), Leontiev's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/leontev/works/1978/index.htm|title= Activity, Consciousness, and Personality] (1978) and Wertsch's [http://news.wustl.edu/people/Pages/WertschJamesV.aspx "The Concept of Activity in Soviet Psychology"] (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; ensured the gradual establishment of a solid Cultural Psychology base in the west.&lt;ref&gt;"Historians may come to identify in Michael Cole the single most influential person for acquainting Western scholars to this tradition, both through his writings and through the mediating role of his Laboratory for Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC) at the University of California, San Diego" ({{harvnb|Roth|2007|page=190}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another American scholar, James V.

===The three generations of activity theory===
In his 1987 ''"Learning by expanding"'', Engeström&lt;ref name="Enge87"&gt;{{harvnb|Engestrōm|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a very detailed account of the diverse sources, philosophical and psychological, that inform activity theory. In subsequent years, however, a simplified picture has emerged from his and other researchers' work, namely the idea that (to date) there are three principal 'stages' or 'generations'&lt;ref&gt;'Generations' does not imply a 'better-worse' value judgment. Each illustrates a different aspect and exists in its own right.&lt;/ref&gt; of activity theory, or "cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT).&lt;ref name="Eng09b"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2009b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yama10"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nussbaumer|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge99a"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|1999a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakh09"&gt;{{harvnb|Bakhurst|2009|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the first generation built on Vygotsky's notion of mediated action, from the individual's perspective, and the second generation built on Leont'ev's notion of activity system, with emphasis on the collective,&lt;ref&gt;An activity system is a collective in which one or more human actors labor to cyclically transform an object (a raw material or problem) in order to repeatedly achieve an outcome (a desired result). {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2012|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third generation, which appeared in the mid-nineties, builds on the idea of multiple interacting activity systems focused on a partially shared object, and boundary-crossings between them.&lt;ref name="Eng09b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X08001698 | doi=10.1016/j.tate.2008.09.014 | volume=25 | issue=3 | title=Using activity systems analysis to identify inner contradictions in teacher professional development | year=2009 | journal=Teaching and Teacher Education | pages=507–517 | last1 = Yamagata-Lynch | first1 = Lisa C. | last2 = Haudenschild | first2 = Michael T.}}; Engeström, 2008, [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Paper/ISCARkeyEngestrom.pdf "The Future of Activity Theory" p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AkkerBakker"&gt;{{harvnb|Akkerman|Bakker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First generation – Vygotsky====
The first generation emerges from Vygotsky's theory of [[cultural mediation]], which was a response to [[behaviorism]]'s explanation of consciousness, or the development of the human mind, by reducing "mind" to a series of atomic components or structures associated primarily with the brain as "stimulus – response" (S-R) processes. Vygotsky argued that the relationship between a human subject and an object is never direct but must be sought in society and culture as they evolve historically, rather than in the human brain or individual mind unto itself.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky saw the past and present as fused within the individual, that the "''present is seen in the light of history''" ({{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}).&lt;/ref&gt; His cultural-historical psychology attempted to account for the social origins of language and thinking.  To Vygotsky, consciousness emerges from human activity mediated by artifacts (tools) and signs.&lt;ref name="Vyg78"&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These artifacts, which can be physical tools, such as hammers, ovens, or computers; cultural artifacts, including language; or theoretical artifacts, like algebra or feminist standpoint theory, are created and/or transformed in the course of an activity, which, in the first generation framework, happens at the individual level.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Vygotsky Basic Mediated Action.jpg|thumb|285px|First Generation CHAT]] This idea of semiotic mediation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = G | year = 2007 | title = Semiotic Mediation, Dialogue and Construction of Knowledge | url = http://people.ucsc.edu/~gwells/Files/Papers_Folder/Semiotic%20Mediation%20and%20Ed.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Development | volume = 50 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is embodied in Vygotsky's famous triangular model&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978|page=40}}: this original diagram – (in which "X" stands for 'mediation') – has subsequently been reformulated by, among others, the original [http://www.cs.hut.fi/u/aura/paivin_seminaari/activity_theory.pdf triangle] being inverted.&lt;/ref&gt; which features the Subject (S), Object (O), and Mediating Artifact triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2001|page=134}}. Vygotsky's triangular representation of mediated action attempts to explain human consciousness development in a manner that did not rely on dualistic stimulus–response (S-R) associations.&lt;/ref&gt; in mediated action the Subject, Object, and Artifact stand in a dialectical relationship whereby each affects the other and the activity as a whole.&lt;ref name="Stets05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yama07"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''the dialectic relationship between subject and object as a fundamental unit of analysis for all human endeavour''" {{harvnb|Hasan|2007|page=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Vygotsky's idea of a ''"complex, mediated act"'' commonly expressed as a triad of subject, object and mediating artifact, see {{harvnb|Vygotsky|1987|page=40.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky argues that the use of signs leads to a specific structure of human behavior, which breaks away from mere biological development allowing the creation of new forms of culturally-based psychological processes – hence the importance of (cultural-historical) context: individuals could no longer be understood without their cultural environment, nor society without the ''agency'' of the individuals who use and produced these artifacts. The objects became cultural entities, and action oriented towards the objects became the key to understanding the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky makes the point that ''"man himself determines his behavior with the help of an artificially created stimulus means."'' (as cited by Norris Minick in Vol I of "The Collected Works of L.S. Vygotsky", 1987, PLENUM – New York/London, p.21);&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vygotskyan framework the unit of analysis, however, remains principally the individual. First-generation activity theory has been used to understand individual behavior by examining the ways in which a person's objectivized actions are culturally ''mediated''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mediation'' is perhaps the key theoretical idea behind activity: we don't just use tools and symbol systems; instead, our everyday lived experience is significantly mediated and intermediated by our use of tools and symbols systems. Activity theory helps frame, therefore, our understanding of such mediation.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides a strong focus on material and symbolic mediation, internalization&lt;ref&gt;In Vygotskyan psychology internalization is a theoretical concept that explains how individuals process what they learned through mediated action in the development of individual consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt; of external (social, societal, and cultural) forms of mediation, another important, aspect of first generation CHAT is the concept of the [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD),&lt;ref name="Vyg78"&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, as advanced in ''Mind in Society'' (1978), ''"the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978|page=86}} –  Restated, ZPD is the theoretical range of what a performer can do with competent peers and assistance, as compared with what can be accomplished on one's own({{harvnb|Andersson|2013|page=21}}; DeVane &amp; Squire in {{harvnb|Jonassen|Land|2012|page=245}}).&lt;/ref&gt; ZDP is one of the major legacies of Vygotsky's work in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;see for example [[Collaborative learning]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second generation – Leontiev====
While Vygotsky formulated practical human activity as the general explanatory category in human psychology, he did not fully clarify its precise nature. The second generation moves, beyond Vygotsky's individually-focused to A.N. Leontiev's&lt;ref&gt;Leontiev, (variously spelled Leont'ev/Leontyev) was, with [[Alexander Luria]], one of Vygotsky's pupils in the late 1920s and 1930s. After Vygotsky's death, Leontyev became the principal theoretical contributor within the Vygotskian social-historical school.&lt;/ref&gt; collective model. In Engeström's&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; now famous graphic depiction of second-generation activity, the unit of analysis has been expanded to include collective motivated activity toward an object, making room for understanding how collective action by social groups mediates activity.&lt;ref&gt;Leontiev's breakthrough was twofold: first he theorized activity as resulting from the confluence of a human subject, the object of his/her activity (predmet/[[w:ru:Предмет|Предмет(Russian)]] "the target or content of a thought or action" (Kaptelinin, 2005, p. 6), and the tools (including symbol systems) that mediate the object(ive); second, he saw activity as essentially tripartite in structure, being composed of unconscious operations on/with tools, conscious but finite actions which are goal-directed, and higher level activities which are object-oriented and driven by motives (Leontiev, at times, seems to conflate object and motive, which is potentially problematic).&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the inclusion of ''community'', ''rules'', ''division of labor'' and the importance of analyzing their interactions with each other.&lt;ref name="Enge99a"/&gt; Rules may be explicit or implicit. Division of labor refers to the explicit and implicit organization of the community involved in the activity.  Engeström&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; articulated the clearest distinction between classic Vygotskian psychology, which emphasizes the way semiotic and cultural systems mediate human ''action'', and Leontiev's second-generation  CHAT, which is focused on the meditational effects of the systemic organization of human ''activity''. [[File:Second Generation CHAT.jpg|thumb|285px|Second Generation CHAT]] In insisting that activity only exists in relation to rules, community and division of labor, Engeström expands ''the unit of analysis'' for studying human behavior from that of individual activity to a collective ''activity system''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|1987}} first popularized the triangular representation of the activity system in chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While the ''unit of analysis'', for Vygotsky, is "individual activity" and, for Leontiev, the "collective activity system", for [[Jean Lave]] and others working around [[situated cognition]] the unit of analysis is "practice", "[[community of practice]]", and "participation". Other scholars analyze "the relationships between the individual's psychological development and the development of social systems". re: Minick in {{harvnb|Cole|Engeström|Vasquez|1997|page=125}}; {{harvnb|Lave|Wenger|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective ''activity system'' includes the social, psychological, cultural and institutional perspectives in the analysis. In this conceptualization context or activity systems are inherently related to what Engeström argues are the deep-seated material practices and socioeconomic structures of a given culture. These societal dimensions had not been taken sufficiently into account by Vygotsky's, earlier, more 'simple' triadic model:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1979|page=163}};{{harvnb|Engeström|1999|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hard07"&gt;{{harvnb|Hardman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Leontiev's understanding, thought and cognition should be understood as a part of social life – as a part of the means of production and systems of social relations on one hand, and the intentions of individuals in certain social conditions on the other.&lt;ref name="Leont78"&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the second generation diagram, activity is positioned in the middle, mediation at the top, adding rules, community and division of labor at the bottom. The minimum components of an ''activity system'' are:  the subject; the object; outcome; mediating instruments/tools/artifacts; rules and signs; community and division of labor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his famous example of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041110023910/http://home.hio.no/~kristihh/1_lektor/paper/hunt.htm 'primeval collective hunt'],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1981|page=210–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev clarifies the crucial difference between an individual ''action'' ("the beater frightening game") and a collective ''activity'' ("the hunt"). While individuals' actions (frightening game) are different from the overall ''goal'' of the activity (hunt), they all share in the same ''motive'' (obtaining food). ''Operations'', on the other hand, are driven by the conditions and tools at hand, i.e. the objective circumstances under which the hunt is taking place. To understand the separate actions of the individuals, one needs to understand the broader ''motive'' behind the activity as a whole: this accounts for the three hierarchical levels of human functioning:&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti, K. in {{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=30}};  {{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007}}; {{harvnb|Hardman|2007}}; {{harvnb|Bozalek, et al.|2014|page=15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''object''-related motives drive the collective activity (top); ''goals'' drive individual/group action(s) (middle); ''conditions'' and ''tools'' drive automated operations (lower level).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontyev|2009|page=400–405}} ; {{harvnb|Blunden|2011|page=201}}; {{harvnb|Nussbaumer|2012|page=39}}; DeVane &amp; Squire in {{harvnb|Jonassen|Land|2012|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third generation – Engeström et al.====
After Vygotsky's foundational work on the individual's higher psychological functions&lt;ref name="Vyg78"&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leontiev's extension of these insights to collective activity systems,&lt;ref&gt;Engeström in {{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamäki|1999|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions of diversity and dialogue between different traditions or perspectives became increasingly serious challenges, when, especially in the post-1990s, activity theory 'went international'. The work of Michael Cole and Yrjö Engeström in the 1970s and 1980s – mostly in parallel, but occasionally in collaboration – brought activity theory to a much wider audience of scholars in Scandinavia and North America.&lt;ref&gt;"[Activity Theory]  ''is not only used in Russia, where it originated, but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the United States and other countries.''". ({{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006|page=6}})&lt;/ref&gt; Once the lives and biographies of all the participants and the history of the wider community are taken into account, ''multiple activity systems'' need to be considered, positing, according to Engeström, the need for a "third generation" to "''develop conceptual tools to understand dialogue, multiple perspectives, and networks of interacting activity Systems''".&lt;ref&gt;"''Activities do not exist in isolation, they are part of a broader system of relations in which they have meaning.''" ({{harvnb|Lave|Wenger|1991|page=53.}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge01"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge09a"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This larger canvas of active individuals (and researchers) embedded in organizational, political, and discursive practices constitutes a tangible advantage of second- and third-generation CHAT over its earlier Vygotskian ancestor, which focused on mediated action in relative isolation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third generation activity theory is the application of ''Activity Systems Analysis'' (ASA)&lt;ref name="Yama10"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See "Activity Systems Analysis" (ASA) section below.&lt;/ref&gt; in developmental research where investigators take a participatory and interventionist role in the participants' activities and change their experiences. [[File:Third Generation CHAT.jpg|thumb|285px|Third Generation CHAT]] Engeström's&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; now famous diagram, or ''basic activity triangle'', – (which adds rules/norms, intersubjective community relations, and division of labor, as well as multiple activity systems sharing an object) – has become the principal third generation model among the research community for analysing individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blunden|2012|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engeström summarizes the current state of CHAT with five principles:
# The activity system as primary unit of analysis: the basic third generation model includes minimally two interacting activity systems. 
# Multi-voicedness: an activity system is always a community of multiple points of views, traditions and interests.
# Historicity: activity systems take shape and get transformed over long stretches of time. Potentials and problems can only be understood against the background of their own histories. 
# The central role of contradictions as sources of change and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2001|page=137.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Activity Systems' possibility for ''expansive transformation'' (cycles of qualitative transformation):  when object and motive are reconceptualized a radically wider horizon opens up.&lt;ref name="Enge01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nygård|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most often, learning technologists have used third-generation CHAT as a guiding theoretical framework to understand how technologies are adopted, adapted, and configured through use in complex social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jonasen|Land|2012|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hardman|2007}} Introduction: "''A flurry of recent publications indicates that Activity Theory is proving a useful tool for studying work setting''" She mentions, among others, Product design, Collaborative activity, Studies in creativity, Educational interventions. Although not as widely known in the US, [http://faculty.washington.edu/kfoot/Publications/Foot-CHAT-explored-dist-tf.pdf Kirsten Foot] mentions use of CHAT in Educational curricula development, Mental health care, Organizational processes and Public policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More recently, Engeström has acknowledged that the third generation model limited to analysing 'reasonably well-bounded' systems and that, in view of new, often web-based participatory practices a rethink is needed. (See "[[#"Fourth generation"|Fourth Generation]]" below.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informing research and practice==

===Leontiev and social development===
From the 1960s onwards, starting in the [[global South]], and independently from the mainstream ''European'' developmental line,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4WqwWken_kC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=axel+european+line+theories&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jQTHZvJ3ed&amp;sig=m3dzzzJcHM_-xLC5FnaxsxdKgXE&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd5vvV1rDVAhXIBsAKHVmwCTMQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=axel%20european%20line%20theories&amp;f=false Erik Axel]&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev's core  ''Objective Activity'' concept&lt;ref&gt;From the original [[w:ru:Предметная деятельность|Предметная деятельность(Russian)]] (predmetnaja-dejatelnost) and [[w:de:Gegenständliche Tätigkeit|Gegenständliche Tätigkeit(German)]], commonly translated 
as [[w:es: Actividad objetivada|"Actividad Objetivada"(Spanish)]] – see: {{harvnb|Leontiev|1984|page=66}}, and as ''Objective Activity'' in English: e.g. Chapter 3 of {{harvnb|Leontiev|1978|page=50ss}}, {{harvnb|Wertsch|1979|page=46ss}} and {{harvnb|Miettinen|2005}} Abstract:'Leontiev's concept of practice or Objective Activity'. (For ''"Objectivis/zed"'',  see e.g.: {{harvnb|Leontiev|1978|page=116}}: "Activity's secondary ''objectivised'' existence" and {{harvnb|Leontyev|1977|page=404}}: "the mental image ''objectivised'' in its product"). "''Objectivized Activity''" is perceived to be closer to both the letter and the spirit of dynamic, interactive, dialectical weighting of Leontiev's original ''predmetnaya dyaetel'nost''.&lt;/ref&gt; has been used in a Social Development context. In the [[Organization Workshop]]'s [[Large Group Capacitation]]-method,&lt;ref&gt;''"Laboratories on Objectivized Activity"'' in: {{harvnb|Labra|Labra|2012}}; {{harvnb|Labra|1992}}: [[w:es: Actividad objetivada|''"Actividad Objetivada"''(Spanish)]] p. 53; ''"de Morais' antecedent thought on Objectivised Activity"'' in {{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=221 ss}};  {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|page=118}} &amp; note No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''objective/ized activity'' acts as the core causal principle which postulates that, in order to change the mind-set of (large groups of) individuals, we need to start with changes to their activity – and/or to the object that "suggests" their activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|2013|page=5ss}} (Pre booklaunch chapter from ''"Unbounded Organization: Embracing the Societal Enterprise"'').&lt;/ref&gt; In Leontievian vein, the Organization Workshop is all about semiotically-mediated activities through which (large groups of) participants&lt;ref&gt;Many of whom, historically, unemployed or underemployed persons with 'Lower Levels of Literacy' (LLLs)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''learn how to manage themselves and the organizations they create to perform tasks that require a complex division of labor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|2013|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CHAT-inspired research and practice since the 1980s===
Especially over the last two decades, CHAT has offered a theoretical lens informing research and practice, in that it posits that learning takes place through collective activities that are purposefully conducted around a common object.  Starting from the premise that learning is a social and cultural process that draws on historical achievements, its [[systems thinking]]-based perspectives allow insights into the real world.&lt;ref name="Enge01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge09a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mutizwa Mukute, M.&amp; Lotz-Sisitka, H. 2012 [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Journal/pdfs/19-4-mukute.pdf "Working With Cultural-Historical Activity Theory and Critical Realism to Investigate and Expand Farmer Learning in Southern Africa"]. Rhodes University. SA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foot14"&gt;{{harvnb|Foot|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Change Laboratory (CL)====
Change Laboratory (CL) is a CHAT-based method for formative intervention in activity systems and for research on their developmental potential as well as processes of expansive learning, collaborative concept-formation, and transformation of practices, elaborated in the mid-nineties&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, according to [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6880603 Santally et al., 2014, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sannino, 2008 [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Journal/pdfs/15-3-sannino.pdf "From Talk to Action: Experiencing Interlocution in Developmental Interventions"] Sannino sees in Yves Clot's Vygotsky-inspired [http://tap.sagepub.com/content/21/5/681.full.pdf '''Clinic of Activity'''] (''Clinique de l'Activité'') a potentially complementary – (to CL, that is) – intervention method. (See also Clot, Yves, 2009 [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Mail/xmcamail.2012_01.dir/pdfHqmCdPgVef.pdf Clinic of Activity: The Dialogue as Instrument] in {{harvnb|Sannino|et al|2009}}).&lt;/ref&gt; by the Finnish Developmental Work Research [http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/activity/ (DWR)] group.&lt;ref&gt;Which became [http://www.helsinki.fi/cradle/ CRADLE] in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge05a"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The CL method relies on collaboration between the practitioners of the activity being analyzed and transformed, and academic researchers or interventionists supporting and facilitating collective developmental processes.&lt;ref name="Enge01"/&gt; On the basis of Engeström's theory of ''expansive learning'',&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Expansive learning is described by {{harvnb|Engeström|2008|page=130}} as a process which "''begins with individual subjects questioning accepted practices, and it gradually expands into a collective movement or institution.'' – The theory enables a "''longitudinal and rich analysis of inter-organizational learning [] by using observational as well as interventionist designs in studies of work and organization''". ([http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/13665620710777084 Engeström &amp; Kerosuo, 2007])&lt;/ref&gt; the foundation of an interventionist research approach at DWR&lt;ref name="Enge05a"/&gt; was elaborated in the 1980s, and developed further in the 1990s as an intervention method now known as ''Change Laboratory''.&lt;ref name="EngeVirkk"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|Virkkunen et al.|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "CRAD09"&gt;{{harvnb|CRADLE|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; CL interventions are used both to study the conditions of change and to help those working in organizations to develop their work, drawing on participant observation, interviews, and the recording and videotaping of meetings and work practices.  Initially, with the help of an external interventionist, the first stimulus that ''is beyond the actors' present capabilities'', is produced in the Change Laboratory by collecting first-hand empirical data on problematic aspects of the activity. This data may comprise difficult client cases, descriptions of recurrent disturbances and ruptures in the process of producing the outcome. Steps in the CL process: Step 1 Questioning; Step 2 Analysis;  Step 3 Modeling; Step 4 Examining; Step 5 Implementing; Step 6 Reflecting; Step 7 Consolidating.  These seven action steps for increased understanding are described by Engeström as ''expansive learning'', or phases of an outwardly expanding spiral,&lt;ref&gt;Virkkunen, Makinen &amp; Lintula in {{harvnb|Daniels|et al.|2010|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while multiple kinds of actions can take place at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engestrőm|Sannino|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phases of the model simply allow for the identification and analysis of the dominant action type during a particular period of time. These learning actions are provoked by contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;Engeström. Y. in: {{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamäki|1999|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contradictions are not simply conflicts or problems, but are "''historically accumulating structural tensions within and between activity systems''" ({{harvnb|Engeström|2001|page= 137}}).&lt;/ref&gt; CL is used by a team or work unit or by collaborating partners across the organizational boundaries, initially with the help of an interventionist-researcher.&lt;ref name="Foot14"&gt;{{harvnb|Foot|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EngeVirkk"/&gt; The CL method has been used in agricultural contexts,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/14514153/1465618386/name/14.%20Cultural%20Historical%20Activity%20Theory%20Expansive%20Learning%20and%20Agency%20in%20Permaculture.pdf Mukute, M., 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; educational and media settings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/19805 Teräs, M., 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; health care&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/kay/kasva/vk/kerosuo/abstract.html Kerosuo, H., 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/21/5/598.short Engeström, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and learning support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6880603 Santally et al., 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other examples, among others, in {{harvnb|Daniels|et al.|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Activity systems analysis (ASA)====
''Activity systems analysis'' is a CHAT-based method,&lt;ref&gt;Which uses Activity Theory concepts such as mediated action, goal-directed activity and dialectical relationship between the organism and the environment.&lt;/ref&gt; discussed in {{harvnb|Engeström|1987}}/{{harvnb|Engeström|1993}} and in Cole &amp; Engeström, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Cole, M., &amp; Engeström, Y. (1993). "A cultural–historical approach to distributed cognition" in: [https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Cognitions-Psychological-Considerations-Computational/dp/0521574234 Salomon, G (Ed), 1993.]&lt;/ref&gt; for understanding human activity in real-world situations with data collection, analysis, and presentation methods that address the complexities of human activity in natural settings aimed to advance both theory and practice. It is based on Vygotsky's concept of mediated action and captures human activity in a triangle model that includes the subject, tool, object, rule, community, and division of labor.&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; Subjects are participants in an activity, motivated toward a purpose or attainment of the object. The object can be the goal of an activity, the subject's motives for participating in an activity, and the material products that subjects gain through an activity. Tools are socially shared cognitive and/or material resources that subjects can use to attain the object. Informal or formal rules regulate the subject's participation while engaging in an activity. The community is the group or organization to which subjects belong. The division of labor is the shared participation responsibilities in the activity determined by the community. Finally, the outcome is the consequences that the subject faces because of his/her actions driven by the object. These outcomes can encourage or hinder the subject's participation in future activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2593117/Activity_systems_analysis_methods Yamagata "Activity Systems Analysis Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; In Part 2 of her video "''Using Activity Theory to understand human behaviour''", {{harvnb|vanderRiet|2010}} shows how activity theory is applied to the problem of behavior change and HIV and AIDs (in South Africa). The video focuses on sexual activity as the activity of the system, and illustrates how an ''Activity System Analysis'', through a historical and current account of the activity, provides a way of understanding lack of behavior change in response to HIV and AIDS. In her eponymous book ''"Activity Systems Analysis Methods."'', {{harvnb|Yamagata|2010|page=37ss}} describes seven ASA case studies which fall ''"into four distinct work clusters. These clusters include works that help (a) understand developmental work research (DWR), (b) describe real-world learning situations, (c) design human computer interaction systems, and (d) plan solutions to complicated work-based problems"''.

====Human–computer interaction (HCI)====
When HCI&lt;ref&gt;[[Human-Computer Interaction]] – the study, planning, design and uses of the interfaces between people ([[user (computing)|user]]s) and computers.&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared on the scene as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, HCI adopted the [[information processing]] paradigm of computer science as the model for human cognition, predicated on prevalent [[cognitive psychology]] criteria, which, it was soon realized, failed to account for individuals' interests, needs and frustrations involved, nor of the fact that the technology critically depends on complex, meaningful, social, and dynamic contexts in which it takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti in {{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting a CHAT theoretical perspective had important implications for understanding how people use interactive technologies: the realization, for example, that a computer is typically an object of activity rather than a mediating artefact means that people interact with the world through computers, rather than with computer 'objects'.&lt;ref name="KaptNard6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaptelinin, Victor "Activity Theory" in {{harvnb|Soegaard|Friis|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bødker|Bødker, S.]] "A Human Activity approach to User Interfaces"  in: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15327051hci0403_1 Human-Computer Interaction, 1989, Volume 4, pp.171–195]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of diverse methodologies outlining techniques for human–computer interaction design have emerged since the rise of the field in the 1980s. Most design methodologies stem from a model for how users, designers, and technical systems interact. [[Bonnie Nardi]] produced the – hitherto – most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature.&lt;ref name="KaptNard6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nardi|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT)====
SSAT builds on the general theory of activity to provide an effective basis for both experimental and analytic methods of studying human performance, using carefully developed units of analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bedny | first1 = G. | last2 = Karwowski | first2 = W. | year = 2003 | title = A Systemic-Structural Activity Approach to the Design of Human–Computer Interaction Tasks | url = | journal = International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 235–260 | doi=10.1207/s15327590ijhc1602_06| citeseerx = 10.1.1.151.8384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSAT approaches cognition both as a process and as a structured system of actions or other functional information-processing units, developing a taxonomy of human activity through the use of structurally organized units of analysis. The systemic-structural approach to activity design and analysis involves identifying the available means of work, tools and objects; their relationship with possible strategies of work activity; existing constraints on activity performance; social norms and rules; possible stages of object transformation; and changes in the structure of activity during skills acquisition.This method is demonstrated by applying it to the study of a human–computer interaction task.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bedny, I.|Karwowski, W.|Bedny G.|2014}}; {{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/10447310903575507 | volume=26 | issue=4 | title=A Method of Human Reliability Assessment Based on Systemic-Structural Activity Theory | year=2010 | journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction | pages=377–402 | last1 = Bedny | first1 = I.

==Future==

===Evolving field of study===
The strengths of CHAT are grounded both in its long historical roots and extensive contemporary use: it offers a philosophical and cross-disciplinary perspective for analyzing diverse human practices as development processes in which both individual and social levels are interlinked, as well as interactions and boundary-crossings.&lt;ref name="AkkerBakker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crossing boundaries involves "''encountering difference, entering into [] unfamiliar territory, requiring cognitive retooling''".  Tuomi-Grōhn &amp; Engeström, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pU-ZCkQExcIC  "New Perspectives on Transfer and Boundary Crossing" p.4.]&lt;/ref&gt; between activity systems&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|1999c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti, N. Ch 2 in {{harvnb|Nardi|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the focus of studies of organizational learning has increasingly shifted away from learning within single organizations or organizational units, towards learning in multi‐organizational or inter‐organizational networks, as well as to the exploration and better understanding of interactions in their social context, multiple contexts and cultures, and the dynamics and development of particular activities. This shift has generated, among others, such concepts as "networks of learning"&lt;ref&gt;Miettinen in {{harvnb|Engeström|et al.|1999|page=325}} "Transcending traditional school learning: Teachers' work and networks of learning."&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[networked learning]]",&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, launched in 2001, is one of the most successful instances of networked learning to date.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|Kerosuo|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[coworking]],&lt;ref name= "EngSann"&gt;{{harvnb|Sannino|et al.|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knotworking.&lt;ref name="Enge04"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2011}}; {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry of late has seen strong growth in nonemployer firms (NEFs), thanks to changes in long-term employment trends and developments in mobile technology&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. {{harvnb|Castells|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have led to more work from remote locations, more distance collaboration, and more work organized around temporary projects.&lt;ref name="Spin14"&gt;{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments such as these and new forms of social production or [[commons-based peer production]], such as e.g. [[open source]]&lt;ref&gt;Software, the source code of which is available for modification or enhancement by anyone.&lt;/ref&gt; development and cultural production in [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networks, have become a key focus in Engeström's more recent work.&lt;ref name="Enge04"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social production processes are simultaneous, multi-directional and often reciprocal. The density and complexity of these processes blur distinctions between process and structure. The object of the activity is unstable, resists control and standardization, and requires rapid integration of expertise from various locations and traditions. (Engeström in {{harvnb|Sannino|et al.|2009|page=309}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150128132610/http://www.open.ac.uk/opencetl/files/opencetl/file/ecms/web-content/Engestrom-(2007)-From-communities-of-practice-to-mycorrhizae.pdf Engeström] in: [https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=Mv6H0dm1CvgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1985&amp;dq=Communities+of+practice:+Critical+perspectives&amp;ots=O3Ye0f0Uop&amp;sig=ZSIypdAKreTaGxOdWl-TxbClnfA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Communities%20of%20practice%3A%20Critical%20perspectives&amp;f=false Hughes, Jewson &amp; Unwin, 2007] Ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fourth generation"===
The rapid rise of new forms of activities characterised by web-based social and participatory practices,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Spinuzzi, 2010: shift from bureaucracies (1970s), to adhocracies (1990s), to all-edge adhocracies (2010s), in: [http://www.slideshare.net/spinuzzi/all-edge-understanding-the-new-workplace-networks "''All Edge: Understanding the New Workplace Networks''".]&lt;/ref&gt; 
,&lt;ref&gt;By 2008, Engeström's examples become 'less bounded': ''runaway objects'' – or 'partially shared large-scale objects in complex, distributed multi-activity fields'-, ''wildfire'', and ''mycorrhizae-like'' activities, are examples of this shift. ({{harvnb|Engeström|2009b}}; Engeström in {{harvnb|Sannino|2009|page=310}}; {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2011}}).&lt;/ref&gt; phenomena such as [[distributed workforce]] and the dominance of knowledge work, prompts a rethink of the third generation model, bringing with it the need, as suggested by Engestrōm, for a new, ''fourth generation'' activity system model.&lt;ref&gt;aka "4GAT" e.g. {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sannino|et al.|2009|page=310}} Ch. 19 "The Future of Activity Theory: A rough draft."&lt;/ref&gt; which activity theorists indeed have been working on in recent years.&lt;ref name="Daniels10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EngSann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Generation (4GAT) analysis should allow better examination of how activity networks interact and interpenetrate, and, at times, contradict each other. People "''working alone together''" may illuminate other examples of distributed, interorganizational, collaborative knowledge work.{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fourth generation CHAT, the object(ive) will typically comprise multiple perspectives and contexts and be inherently transient; collaborations between actors, too, are likely to be temporary, with multiple boundary crossings between interrelated activities.&lt;ref name="AkkerBakker"/&gt; Fourth-generation activity theorists have specifically developed activity theory to better accommodate Castells's (and others') insights into how work organization has shifted in the [[network society]]: they hence will focus less on the workings of individual activity systems (often represented by triangles) and more on the interactions across activity systems functioning in networks.&lt;ref name="Spin14"&gt;{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yamazumi|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a fourth generation analytical diagram see {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 ISCAR congress (August, Quebec City) has the following theme: ''''Taking a 360° view of the landscape of cultural-historical activity research:The state of our scholarship in practice''.

'''d5SICS''' is an artificial [[nucleoside]] containing 6-methyl[[isoquinoline]]-1-thione-2-yl group instead of a base.

It [[Base pair#Unnatural base pair (UBP)|pairs up]] with [[dNaM]] in a hydrophobic interaction.

'''''Daing''''', '''''Tuyô''''', or '''''Bilad''''' (literally "[[Drying (food)|sun-dried]]" or "sun-baked") refers to [[dried fish]] from the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="clove"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/sf_daingz.html|title=Philippine Dried Fish|publisher=CloveGarden|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish prepared as ''daing'' are usually split open (though they may be left whole), gutted, salted liberally, and then sun and air-dried. There are also "boneless" variants which fillets the fish before the drying process.&lt;ref name="mm1"/&gt; It was originally a preservation technique, as salt inhibits the growth of bacteria, allowing fish to be stored for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="pb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoybisnes.com/food-business-ideas/how-to-make-salted-dried-fish-daing/|title=How to Make Salted Dried Fish (Daing)|date=November 15, 2009|publisher=Pinoybisnes.com|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessdiary.com.ph/965/how-to-start-a-salted-dried-split-fish-daing-business/|title=How to Start a Salted Dried Split Fish (Daing) Business|date=September 21, 2011|publisher=Business Diary|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A variant of ''daing'' known as '''''labtingaw''''' uses less salt and is dried for a much shorter period (only a few hours). The resulting ''daing'' is still slightly moist and meatier than the fully dried variant.&lt;ref name="labtingaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketmanila.com/archives/three-ways-with-danggit-version-2-labtingaw|title=Three Ways with Danggit — Version 2: Labtingaw|author=Marketman |date=March 11, 2014|publisher=Market Manila|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another variant of ''daing'' known as '''''lamayo''''', does away with the drying process altogether. Instead, after the fish is cleaned, it is simply marinated in vinegar, garlic and other spices before frying.&lt;ref name="lamayo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketmanila.com/archives/three-ways-with-danggit-version-1-lamayo|title=Three Ways with Danggit — Version 1: Lamayo|author=Marketman |date=March 10, 2014|publisher=Market Manila|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Daing'' is considered [[poverty food]] due to its relative cheapness. But it has gained significance in Philippine culture as [[comfort food]].&lt;ref name="mm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="danggit"/&gt; One of the most popular comfort food ''daing'' is ''danggit'' or ''dangguit.'' Danggit, dried [[rabbitfish]], is usually simply fried before consumption and served with rice and a dip (usually vinegar or [[calamansi]]). As breakfast food, they may be served with fried eggs.&lt;ref name="mm1"/&gt; 

In Central and Southern Philippines, ''daing'' is known as ''bulad'' or ''buwad'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. The variants which use sliced and gutted fish are known as ''pinikas'' (literally "halved" referring to the halves of the fish). Northern regions usually do not distinguish between the two, though some may use ''daing'' to refer exclusively to the halved and gutted variants, while ''tuyô'' is used for all variants. 

Virtually any fish can be prepared as ''daing''. The species of fish used is usually identified by name when sold in markets. For example, in [[Cebu]], the local specialty which uses [[rabbitfish]] (''Siganus'' spp., locally known as ''danggit''), is called ''buwad danggit''.&lt;ref name="danggit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eatyourworld.com/destinations/asia/philippines/cebu/what_to_eat/danggit|title=Danggit|publisher=Eat Your World|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fish species used include [[threadfin bream]]s (Nemipteridae, locally known as ''bisugo''); [[Mullet (fish)|grey mullets]] (Mugilidae, locally known as ''banak''); and sardines (''[[Sardinella]]'' spp. and ''[[Dussumieria acuta]]'', locally known as ''tunsoy'' or ''tamban''). ''Daing'' made from sardines are usually dried whole, though exported variants may be gutted to comply with food laws in other countries.&lt;ref name="clove"/&gt; [[Cuttlefish]] and [[squid]] may also be prepared this way ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''daing na pusit''; Cebuano: ''bulad pusit'').&lt;ref name="mm1"&gt;
Phillipino seafarers traditionally prepare this dish by drying it in the ships funnel, thus providing a pleasent smell in the engine room.

}}
In [[music]], a '''drum cadence''' or '''street beat''' is a [[musical composition|work]] played exclusively by the [[percussion instrument|percussion section]] of a modern [[marching band]] (see [[marching percussion]]). It is stylistically descended from early [[military]] [[march (music)|march]]es, and related to [[military cadence]]s, as both are a means of providing a [[beat (music)|beat]] while [[marching]]. Usually, each instrument will have a part that mimics a specific drum or drums on a [[drum set]] to create a sound similar to a [[drum beat]].

According to ''Hiro Songsblog'' a drum cadence is, "'a [[drumline]] piece played in a [[parade|parading]] marching band between or in place of full-band pieces'. Cadences, are also: 'a [[military cadence|chant]] that is sung by military personnel while parading or marching'."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://pentagrammi.wordpress.com/2008/06/13/snare-drum-cadence-1/ Drum cadences and drumline sheet music]", ''Hiro Songsblog''.&lt;!--the use of quotation marks in the website implies a citation but no source appears to be given--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadences employ the four basic [[drum stroke]]s and often directly include [[drum rudiment]]s. They have a wide range of difficulty, from simple [[accent (music)|accent]] patterns to complex rhythms including hybrid rudiments, and are played by virtually every modern drum line. Cadences are important from a performance standpoint, as a good drum cadence can make the band stand out from the rest in competition. [[Marching band#Field marching|Field shows]] are often preceded by the band marching to the beat of the cadence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is a Drumline Cadence?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drumline-cadence.htm|work=Wisegeek.com|publisher=Conjecture Corporation|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marching percussion generally consists of at least [[snare drum]]s, [[tenor drum]]s, [[cymbal]]s, and [[bass drum]]s, and may include [[timpani]].

'''Elective mutism''' is a now outdated term which was defined as a refusal to speak in almost all social situations (despite normal ability to do so), while [[selective mutism]] was considered to be a ''failure'' to speak in specific situations and is strongly associated with [[social anxiety disorder]].  In contrast to selective mutism, it was thought someone who was electively mute may not speak in any situation, as is usually shown in books and movies.  Elective mutism was often attributed to defiance or the effect of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]. Those who are able to speak freely in some situations but not in others are now better described by [[selective mutism]]&lt;ref&gt;Selective Mutism Resource Manual, Second Edition, Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
In 1877, a German physician named the disorder ''aphasia voluntaria'' to describe children who were able to speak normally but often "refused" to.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brighttots.com/Selective_Mutism.html Bright Tots: Selective Mutism&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a study by [[Torey Hayden]] identified four "subtypes" of Elective Mutism:&lt;ref&gt;Torey Hayden. [http://www.torey-hayden.com/research/classification-of-elective-mutism.pdf Classification of elective mutism]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Symbiotic mutism: the most common form, caused by a vocal and dominating mother and absent father (very rarely the other way around) and characterized by the use of mutism as controlling behavior around other adults.
*Speech phobic mutism: the least common, in which the child showed distinct fear at hearing a recording of his or her voice.  This also involved ritualistic behaviors, which may reflect OCD, and was thought to be caused by the child having been told to keep a family secret.
*Reactive mutism: a reaction to trauma and/or abuse, with all children showing symptoms of depression and being notably withdrawn, usually showing no facial expressions.  Notably, Hayden admits that some children put in this category had no apparent incident to react to, but they were included because of their symptoms.
*Passive-aggressive mutism: silence is used as a display of hostility, connected to antisocial behavior.  Some of the children in her study had reportedly not been mute until age 9-12.

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), first published in 1952, first included Elective Mutism in its third edition, published in 1980.  Elective mutism was described as "a continuous refusal to speak in almost all social situations" despite normal ability to speak.  While "excessive shyness" and other anxiety-related traits were listed as associated features, predisposing factors included "maternal overprotection", mental retardation, and trauma.  Elective mutism in the third edition revised (DSM III-R) is described similarly as in the third edition except for specifying that the disorder is ''not'' related to social anxiety disorder.

In 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM reflected the name change to selective mutism and redefined the disorder.

==Cultural references==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
Though elective mutism is no longer recognized by most psychiatrists, it is a popular character element or plot point in stories and movies.  Many characters choose to stop speaking, for various reasons.  Even more commonly, there are also characters who stop speaking after a traumatic incident.  In both these cases, often, and almost always in the second, the character is silent in all situations.  This is therefore not selective mutism, and anxiety is very rarely involved. Selective mutism itself is almost nonexistent in pop culture.

The following are a few references to stories including a character who does not speak despite being physically able to.

* In the book ''[[Cut (novel)|Cut]]'' by Patricia McCormick, the main character, Callie, is an elective mute.
* In ''[[The House of the Spirits]]'' by [[Isabel Allende]], Clara Trueba is mute after witnessing her sisters molestation and autopsy. "She could not move until the first lights of dawn appeared. Only then did she slip back into her bed, feeling within her the silence of the entire world. Silence filled her utterly."
*In ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], [[Hannibal Lecter]] is mute after witnessing his sister killed and eaten.
* In the book ''[[Flying Solo (Fletcher novel)|Flying Solo]]'', the character Rachel is mute for six months after a classmate dies.
* In ''[[The Piano (film)|The Piano]]'', Ada is an elective mute. She chooses to learn to speak at the end of the film.
* In the 1993 movie, ''[[House of Cards (1993 film)|House of Cards]]'', Sally Matthews chooses not to speak after her father dies.
* In the book ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', Lucy-B091 is mute after she is one of only two survivors from her unit of 300.
* In the movie ''[[The Prophet (2014 film)|The Prophet]]'' Kamila's daughter, Elmitra, is depicted as mute after the death of her father.
* In the 2014 video game ''[[Watch Dogs]]'', Aiden Pearce's nephew, Jackson, is electively mute after the death of his sister.
* In the book ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', Christian Grey is depicted as having been an elective mute from age 4, when he witnessed his birth mother's drug overdose and death and was with her body for days before being discovered, until he was 6 years old and he spoke his newly-adopted baby sister's name.
*In [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s narrative YouTube series Swindon Town Swoodilypoopers, midfielder Maric Maric is selectively mute.

'''''Equus''''' is a play by [[Peter Shaffer]] written in 1973, telling the story of a [[psychiatrist]] who attempts to treat a young man who has a pathological religious fascination with horses.&lt;ref name="greatbooks" /&gt;

Shaffer was inspired to write ''Equus'' when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses in a small town near [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt; He set out to construct a fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime. The play's action is something of a detective story, involving the attempts of the [[Child and adolescent psychiatry|child psychiatrist]] Dr. Martin Dysart to understand the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his own sense of purpose.&lt;ref name="equustheplay" /&gt;

The original stage production ran at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in London between 1973 and 1975, directed by [[John Dexter]]. [[Alec McCowen]] played Dysart, and [[Peter Firth]] played Alan Strang. Later came the Broadway productions that starred [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Dysart (later played by [[Richard Burton]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], and [[Anthony Perkins]]) and from the London production, Peter Firth as Alan. When Firth left for Broadway, [[Dai Bradley]] took over the role of Alan in the London production, playing opposite [[Michael Jayston]] as Dr. Dysart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/webb/webb_nt_equus.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412181555/http://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/webb/webb_nt_equus.pdf |archivedate=12 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Hulce]] replaced Firth during the Broadway run. The Broadway production ran for 1,209 performances. [[Marian Seldes]] appeared in every single performance of the Broadway run, first in the role of Hesther and then as Dora. Shaffer also adapted his play for a 1977 film of the [[Equus (film)|same name]].

Numerous other issues inform the narrative. Most important are religious and [[ritual sacrifice]] themes, and the manner in which character Alan Strang constructs a personal theology involving the horses and the supreme [[Deity|godhead]], "Equus". Alan sees the horses as representative of God and confuses his adoration of his "God" with [[sexual attraction]]. Also important is Shaffer's examination of the conflict between personal values and satisfaction and societal mores, expectations, and institutions. In reference to the play's classical structure, themes, and characterisation, Shaffer has discussed the conflict between [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] values and systems in human life.

== Plot summary ==

===Act 1===
[[File:Equus-Dysart02Online.jpg|left|thumb|[[Charles S. Dutton]] as Dysart in ''Equus'', as directed by [[Brad Mays]] in May 1979 in [[Baltimore]]]]
Martin Dysart is a psychiatrist in a mental hospital. He begins with a monologue in which he outlines the case of 17-year-old Alan Strang, who blinded six horses. He also divulges his feeling that his occupation is not all that he wishes it to be and his feelings of dissatisfaction and disappointment about his barren life. Dysart finds that the supply of troubled young people for him to "adjust" back into "normal" living is never-ending, but he doubts the value of treating these youths, since they will simply return to a dull, normal life that lacks any commitment and "worship" (a recurring theme). He comments that Alan Strang's crime was extreme, but adds that just such extremity is needed to break free from the chains of existence.

A court magistrate, Hesther Saloman, visits Dysart, believing that he has the skills to help Alan come to terms with what he did. At the hospital, Dysart has a great deal of difficulty making any kind of headway with Alan, who at first responds to questioning by singing TV advertising jingles.

Dysart reveals a dream he has had, in a [[Ancient Greece|Grecian]]/[[Homer]]ic setting, in which he is a public official presiding over a mass ritual sacrifice. Dysart slices open the abdomens of hundreds of children, and pulls out their entrails. He becomes disgusted with what he is doing, but fears being murdered in the same manner as the children if he is discovered as a "non-believer" by the other priests, so he does not stop. Eventually the other priests, aware of his misgivings, grab the knife from his hand before he awakens from the dream.

Dysart interviews Alan's parents. He learns that, from an early age, Alan has been receiving conflicting viewpoints on religion from his parents. Alan's mother, Dora, is a devout Christian who has read to him daily from the Bible. This practice has antagonized Alan's father Frank, a nonbeliever.

Slowly, Dysart makes contact with Alan by playing a game where each of them asks a question, which must be answered honestly.

Dysart learns that Frank, concerned that Alan has taken far too much interest in the more violent aspects of the Bible, destroyed a violent picture of the [[Crucifixion]] that Alan had hung at the foot of his bed. Alan replaced the picture with one of a horse, with large, staring eyes.

Alan reveals to Dysart that during his youth, he had established his attraction to horses by way of his mother's biblical tales, a horse story that she had read to him, Western movies, and his grandfather's interest in horses and riding. Alan's sexual training began with his mother who told him he could find true love and contentment by way of religious devotion and marriage. During this time, Alan also begins to develop a sexual attraction to horses, desiring to pet their thick coats, feel their muscular bodies, and smell their sweat. Alan reveals to Dysart that he had first encountered a horse at age six, on the beach. A rider approached him, and took him up on the horse. Alan was visibly excited, but his parents found him and Frank pulled him violently off the horse. The horse rider scoffed at the father and rode off.

Dysart hypnotizes Alan, and during the hypnosis, Dysart reveals elements of his terrifying dream of the ritual murder of children. Dysart begins to jog Alan's memory by filling in blanks, and asking questions. Alan reveals that he wants to help the horses by removing the bit, which enslaves them.

After turning 17, Alan took a job working in a shop selling electrical goods, where he met Jill Mason, an outgoing and free-spirited young woman. She visits the shop wanting to purchase blades for horse-clippers. Alan was instantly interested when he discovered that Jill has such close contact with horses after she tells him that she works for a local stable owner. Jill suggested that Alan work for the owner of the stables, Harry Dalton, and Alan agrees.

Dysart meets with Dalton, who tells him that he first held Alan to be a model worker, since he kept the stables immaculately clean and grooms the horses, including one named Nugget. Through Dysart's questioning, it becomes clear that Alan is erotically fixated on Nugget (or 'Equus') and secretly takes him for midnight rides, bareback and naked. Alan also envisions himself as a king, on the godhead Equus, both destroying their enemies.

===Act 2===
[[File:Equus-Jill&amp;Alanoline.jpg|thumb|Lauren Raher and [[Brad Mays]] as Jill and Alan in ''Equus'', as directed by Mays in May 1979 in Baltimore]]
Dysart gives Alan a placebo "truth pill". Revealing a tryst with Jill, he begins to re-enact the event. Jill, who had taken an interest in Alan, had asked him to take her to a porno theater. While there, they both ran into Frank. Alan was traumatized, particularly when he realized that his father was lying when he tried to justify his presence in the theater. However, this occurrence allows Alan to realize that sex is a natural thing for all men... even his father. Alan walks Jill home after they leave. She convinces Alan to come to the stables with her.

Once there, Jill seduces Alan and the two undress and attempt to have sex. However, Alan breaks this off when he hears the horses making noises in the stables beneath, which he decides is the reason for his inability to get an erection. Jill tries to ask Alan what the problem is, but he shouts at her to leave. After Jill dresses and walks out of the stables, the still nude Alan begs the horses for forgiveness, as he sees the horses as God-like figures. "Mine!...You're mine!...I am yours and you are mine!" cries Equus through Dysart's voice, but then he becomes threatening: "The Lord thy God is a jealous God," Equus/Dysart seethes, "He sees you, he sees you forever and ever, Alan. He sees you!...He sees you!" Alan screams, "''God seest!''" and then he says "No more. No more, Equus!" Alan then uses a steel spike to blind the six horses in the stable, whose eyes have "seen" his very soul.

The final scene has another monologue by Dysart questioning the fundamentals of his practice and whether or not what he does will actually help Alan, as the effect of his treatment will make him "normal" at the cost of his humanity.

== Original Broadway production==
The play opened on Broadway at the [[Plymouth Theatre]] on 24 October 1974, ending on 11 September 1976.  It then opened at the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] on 5 October 1976, ending on 2 October 1977, for a total of 1,209 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/equus-3484|title=Equus – Broadway Play – Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|date=|website=www.ibdb.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010075301/https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/equus-3484|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptation ==

{{main article|Equus (film)}}

Shaffer adapted the play for a 1977 film starring [[Richard Burton]], [[Peter Firth]], [[Eileen Atkins]], [[Colin Blakely]], [[Joan Plowright]], and [[Jenny Agutter]], directed by [[Sidney Lumet]]. Unlike stage productions, where the horses are portrayed by human actors, often muscular men wearing tribal-style masks,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harland Smith , "[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17106/Equus/articles.html Equus (1977)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025114601/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17106/Equus/articles.html |date=25 October 2016 }}," ''[[Turner Classic Movies]]'', URL accessed 24 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Lumet did not believe this could adequately be done in a film version, concluding a degree of realism was required, "because the reality he [Alan] was being watched in was going to create the dilemma within him."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Applebaum, "Colour and Concepts," ''Sidney Lumet: Interviews'', University Press of Mississippi, 2006, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the film to the play, English Professor James M. Welsh felt using real horses in the film was understandable, but argued the outdoor scenes infringed on the "abstract theatrical design" that gave the play its creativity.&lt;ref&gt;James M. Welsh, ''Video Versions: Film Adaptations of Plays on Video'', Greenwood Press, 2000, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh also felt the explicit blinding was "potentially repulsive," and "much of the spirit of the play is lost as a consequence."&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Midwest premiere of ''Equus'' opened March 1978 in Lansing, Michigan, at Boarshead Theatre. Directed by John Peakes, it featured Richard Thomsen as Dysart, David Kropp as Alan, Carmen Decker as Dora, and Lisa Hodge as Jill. Local controversy over the nude scene was largely mitigated by casting a married couple as Jill and Alan. This production went on to win Boarshead Theatre's annual awards for Best Production and Best Supporting Actor (Kropp).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/210449495/|title=Lansing State Journal from Lansing, Michigan on May 12, 1984 &amp;middot; Page 24|newspaper=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=28 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202052933/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/210449495/|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Equus'' was also presented in [[Baltimore]] in 1979 by the Lovegrove Alley Theatre. The production starred a pre-Broadway [[Charles S. Dutton]] in the role of Dysart. Director [[Brad Mays]] did double duty in the role of Alan Strang. A young actress named Lauren Raher played Jill Mason, and her real-life mother Rhona Raher portrayed Dora, Alan's mother.&lt;ref name="Lord 1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strausbaugh 1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giuliano 1979" /&gt;

[[File:Daniel Radcliffe NY9.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Radcliffe]] arrives for a performance of ''Equus'' in 2008]]
''Equus'' was revived in 2007 in the West End by producers [[David Pugh and Dafydd Rogers]], starring [[Richard Griffiths]],  [[Daniel Radcliffe]], and [[Joanna Christie]] in the leading roles. The production was directed by [[Thea Sharrock]], and opened in February 2007 at the [[Gielgud Theatre]]. The production attracted press attention, as both Radcliffe and Griffiths appeared in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series (as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Vernon Dursley|Vernon Dursley]], respectively). In particular, the casting of then 17-year-old Radcliffe caused some controversy since the role of Alan Strang required him to appear nude on stage.&lt;ref name="BBC 28 July 2006" /&gt; Radcliffe insisted that the nude scene was not "gratuitous" and that he should portray the character and the scene as called for by the script.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The 2007 London revival was then transferred to Broadway, at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]], running through 8 February 2009. Radcliffe and Griffiths reprised their roles, and Thea Sharrock returned as director. The cast also included [[Kate Mulgrew]], [[Anna Camp]], [[Carolyn McCormick]], Lorenzo Pisoni, [[T. Ryder Smith]], Graeme Malcolm, and Sandra Shipley, with Collin Baja, [[Tyrone Jackson]], Spencer Liff, [[Adesola Osakalumi]], and Marc Spaulding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/121672-Horse-Power-Equus-Revival-Opens-on-Broadway-Sept-25 |title=Horse Power: Equus Revival Opens on Broadway Sept. 25 |work=Playbill |accessdate=20 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193351/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/121672-Horse-Power-Equus-Revival-Opens-on-Broadway-Sept-25 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radcliffe eventually received a nomination for the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play]].

The first illustrated edition of the play text was produced as a large-format artist's book by the Old Stile Press, with images and an afterword by the British artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]], in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Nancy, Frances McDowall, Nicolas McDowall, The Old Stile Press... the Next Ten Years: A Bibliography 2000–2010 (2010: Old Stile Press) {{ISBN|978-0-907664-85-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the troubled teen that he portrays, both he and Strang possess a passion for something that is an inseparable part of their personality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.starkinsider.com/2011/03/theater-review-equus-at-city-lights-san-jose.html|title=Theater Review: 'Equus' at City Lights, San Jose {{!}} Stark Insider|last=Writer|first=Guest|date=22 March 2011|newspaper=Stark Insider|language=en-US|access-date=29 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230160603/http://www.starkinsider.com/2011/03/theater-review-equus-at-city-lights-san-jose.html|archivedate=30 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This production received a Standout Classic Production Award by Silicon Valley Small Theatre Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artsalot.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/6th-annual-silicon-valley-small-venue-theatre-awards-the-2011-honorees/|title=6th Annual Silicon Valley Small Venue Theatre Awards – The 2011 Honorees!|last=Artsalot|date=2 August 2011|website=Artsalot|access-date=29 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230090644/https://artsalot.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/6th-annual-silicon-valley-small-venue-theatre-awards-the-2011-honorees/|archivedate=30 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production was largely funded by donations on Kickstarter and was well received by critics and audiences alike.

'''Fur farming''' is the practice of breeding or raising certain types of [[animal]]s for their [[fur]].

Fur used from animals caught in the wild is not considered farmed fur, and is instead known as "wild fur".
Most of the world’s farmed fur is produced by European farmers. There are 5,000 fur farms in the [[European Union|EU]], all located across 22 countries; these areas of production collectively account for 50% of the global production of farmed fur.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Fur.

The EU accounts for 63% of global mink production and 70% of fox production. Denmark is the leading mink-producing country, accounting for approximately 28% of world production. Other major producers include China, the [[Netherlands]], [[Russia]], and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furcommission.com/us-mink-state-of-the-industry-2011/ US Mink: State of the Industry – 2011].

Demand fell in the late 1980s and 1990s because of a number of factors, including the failure of designers to come up with exciting new lines, and the efforts of animal rights campaigners. Since the turn of the millennium, however, sales worldwide have soared to record highs, fueled by radically new techniques for working with fur, and a sharp rise in disposable income in China and Russia. This growing demand has led to the development of extensive fur farming operations in [[#China|China]] and [[Poland]].

==History==
[[File:Felis catus (Domestic cat) fur skins.jpg|thumb|Cat skins]]
While wearing fur clothing in cold weather as protection goes back to the Stone Age, the source for this material came from the wild. As human populations grew, furs, leathers, and hides for use in clothing came from farm stock, such as sheep (sheepskin), rabbits, cattle, pigs, and goats. The earliest records of breeding mink for fur in [[North America]] were in the 1860s. Foxes were first raised on farms for fur in [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada in 1895.&lt;ref name="International Fur Trade Federation"/&gt;

Historically, the [[fur trade]] played an important economic role in the United States. Fur trappers explored and opened up large parts of North America, and the fashion for [[beaver hat]]s led to intense competition for the raw materials. Starting in the latter half of the 20th century, producers and wearers of fur have been criticized by animal rights activists because of the perceived [[cruelty to animals|cruelty]] they believe is involved in animal [[trapping (Animal)|trapping]] and because of the availability of substitutes such as synthetic fibers (made from petroleum oil).

Today, 80 percent of the fur clothing industry's pelts come from animals raised on farms. The rest is from animals caught in the wild. The most farmed fur-bearing animal is the mink (50 million annually), followed by the fox (about 4 million annually). Asiatic and Finnish raccoon and chinchilla are also farmed for their fur. 64 percent of fur farms are in Northern Europe, 11 percent are in North America, and the rest are dispersed throughout the world, in countries such as Argentina and Russia.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fur Industry |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574462/fur_industry.html |publisher=[[MSN Encarta]] |accessdate=24 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpYHoMs?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574462/fur_industry.html |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==

===Mink===
[[Image:Mink colours.jpg|thumb|Mink colours]]
[[Mink]] have been farmed for fur in the United States for 130 years. In 2010, the U.S. ranked fifth in production behind [[mink industry in Denmark|Denmark]], China, the Netherlands, and Poland. Mink typically breed in March and give birth to their litters in May. Farmers vaccinate the young kits for botulism, distemper, enteritis, and, if needed, pneumonia. They are killed in November and December. Methods for [[animal euthanasia|euthanizing animals]] on fur farms, as on all farms, are detailed in the American Veterinary Medical Association's Report on Euthanasia which is used as a guideline for state departments of agriculture which have jurisdiction over all farms raising domesticated livestock, including mink.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf Guidelines on Euthanasia]. (PDF). avma.org. Retrieved on 4 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The white [[mink]], a northern European breed, was introduced into Canada in 1968. Most mink production in Canada occurs in [[Nova Scotia]] which, with 116 licensed farms in 2016, generated revenues of nearly $54 million by contributing approximately 1.4 million pelts to global markets. That accounted for an average of half of all Canada's mink pelts .&lt;ref&gt; Nova Scotia Mink Breeders Association. (2016). "Mink Farming: Quick Facts". Retrieved from https://nsmink.ca/index.php/mink-farming&lt;/ref&gt; Production of black mink in particular has grown significantly since 2000, with emerging markets in Russia, China, and [[South Korea]] accounting for most of the new demand. Black mink was first bred in Nova Scotia in the late 1950s and has proven popular as a versatile colour. Most Nova Scotia product is sold in China where it is manufactured into luxury garments.

===Chinchilla===

[[File:Chinchilla148.jpg|thumb|A 2-year-old standard gray female chinchilla]]
The international trade in [[chinchilla]] fur goes back to the 16th century and the animal (whose name literally means "Little Chincha") is named after the [[Chincha people]] of the [[Andes]], who wore its soft, dense fur. By the end of the 19th century, chinchillas had become quite rare. In 1923, Mathias F. Chapman brought the eleven wild chinchillas he had captured to the U.S. for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edchinchillas.co.uk/The_Chin/chapman.html |title=Chapman Story |website=Edchinchillas.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only three of these were female. Empress Chinchilla is the breeders association for the chinchilla farmers, many of whom are based in the United States, including California. Empress Chinchilla runs a certification program for farmers.[http://www.empresschinchilla.com/]

===Fox===

[[Finland]] is the world's leading producer of [[fox]] pelts. In the United States, fox production is about 10,000 [[fur|pelts]], produced in about 10 states. [[Wisconsin]] and [[Utah]] have the most mink farms in the USA. Canada produces ten to fifteen times as many fox furs as the USA.&lt;ref name="fur"&gt;{{cite news|author=Audrey Eggers|work=adapted from an article in the August/September 2002 issue of AgVentures|title= Farming For Fur |url=http://www.furcommission.com/farming/foxfarming.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235245/http://www.furcommission.com/farming/foxfarming.htm|archivedate=21 July 2011|publisher=Fur Commission USA|accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dog and cat===
The United States banned the import, export, and sale of products made from dog and cat fur in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090530220220/http://www.happypaws.com.au/articles/the-trade-in-dog-and-cat-fur The trade in dog and cat fur], Happy Paws&lt;/ref&gt;
Italy, France, Denmark, [[Greece]], Belgium, and Australia ban the import of domestic cat and dog fur but the sale is still quasi-legal.&lt;ref name="humane"&gt;{{cite news|title= Betrayal of Trust: the Global Trade in Cat and Dog Fur |url=http://www.hsicanada.ca/cat_dog_fur/|publisher=[[Humane society]]|accessdate=26 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321220309/http://www.hsicanada.ca/cat_dog_fur/ |archivedate = 21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In most countries, novelty items made from farmed cat and dog fur is available in the form of animal toys or as trim on garments like boots, jackets and handbags. The [[European Union]] banned imports in 2009.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite news|title= An Olympic disgrace |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/03/24/animal_cruelty_china/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201202844/http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/03/24/animal_cruelty_china/|archivedate=1 February 2009|author=Kerasote, Ted |date=24 March 2008|accessdate=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbit===
[[Image:Rabbit skins.jpg|thumb|A load of rabbit skins (c. 1905)]] The main breed in the [[rabbit]] fur farming industry is the [[list of rabbit breeds#Rex|Rex]] (Castor Rex and Chinchilla Rex). Breeding animals are kept for up to 3 years, and usually [[give birth]] twice a year. The [[rabbit|kits]] are taken from their mothers at 4 weeks old and put in a nursery with other kits. After this, the mothers are kept separated from their kits, and they get put together only for feeding. When the kits are 7 to 8 weeks old, they are put in solitary cages, where they are kept for about 6–7 months, and are harvested after they have [[moulting|shed]] their winter fur. The rabbits are kept in bare [[wire mesh]] [[cage (enclosure)|cage]]s. A cage for one rabbit has the floor space of about two shoe boxes. The [[mortality rate]] for caged Rex is 10 – 15%, mostly from [[respiratory disease]].&lt;ref name="rabbitfur"&gt;{{cite news|title= Rabbit fur: face the facts |url=http://www.rabbitfur.org/factsheet.htm|publisher=[[The Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade|The Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade (CAFT)]]|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farmed Mink Production Cycle==
===Conditioning and Breeding (December - March)=== 
During this time of year, ranchers are primarily focused on bringing their selected mink into a good condition that is suitable for breeding. Mink are a monoestrous species that undergo delayed implantation when bred successfully, this means that the breeding season can be the most strenuous time of year both in terms of animal nutrition and human labor.&lt;ref&gt;Felska-Blaszczyk, L., Lawrow, N., Lasota, B., Seremak, B., Pezinska-Kijak, K., Zuk, K., and Nowak, P. (2018). The Sex Ratio in Farmed American Mink (''Neovison vison''). ''Archives of Animal Breeding'', 61 (2018), 359 - 363. Retrieved from file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/The_sex_ratio_in_farmed_Americ.pdf. Accessed on November 24th, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential that management practices employ a feeding program that maintains a nutritional diet that is adequate for both male and female mink. A feeding program that encourages the removal of excess weight and an environment that facilitates an increase in exercise is important for good production and a successful whelp.&lt;ref name=CMBA&gt; Canada Mink Breeders Association.(n.d.). "A Year on a Mink Farm". Retrieved from (http://canadamink.webtext.ca/cmbfarm.shtml Retrieved on November 22nd, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Mink are usually fed once or twice a day during the growing season; on most farms they are fed the same quantity of food on all cages and close to an ''ad libitum'' amount so that 50% of all cages have feed left over the next day. &lt;ref&gt;Hansen, S. W. and Moller, S.H. (2007). Diurnal Activity Patterns of Farm Mink (Mustela vison) Subjected to Different Feeding Routines. ''Journal of Applied Animal Behaviour Science,''111 (2008), 146 - 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the rancher select for fur quality and production traits, their major concentration is on the health and temperament of the animal; all of these traits will correlate with the overall [[animal welfare|welfare]] of the herd. &lt;ref name=NFACC&gt; National Farm Animal Care Council.(2013). "Code of Practice: For the Care and Handling of Farmed Mink". Retrieved from (http://canadamink.webtext.ca/2013-06_Mink_Code_of_Practice.pdf Retrieved on November 22nd, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Breeding records are kept for each individual mink, this includes information on the dates of mating, genetics involving family lineage, reproductive success, health status, and fur characteristics. &lt;ref name=CMBA /&gt;.

===Whelping and Weaning (April - June)===
In preparation for [[whelping|whelping]], comfortable conditions are prepared for the female by providing ample aspen bedding in which she can create a nest. It is well-known that female mink are highly motivated to perform maternal-related nest building during the majority of their gestation period &lt;ref&gt;Schou, T.M., Palme, R., and Malmkvist, J. (2018). Prolonged Nest Building Increase the Reproductive Outcome in American Female Mink. ''Journal of Applied Animal Behaviour Science'', 207 (2018), 98 - 107. Retrieved from https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S016815911830114X?token=06A5DE50F9FCF3A8D1E799844ABB066C7F56DF32DA75F853DD736EF7574522FB758BC4E1B5CCD0FEE75BE036E6480F1B. Accessed on November 24th, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, this is why providing an abundance of substrate to prepare a nest is crucial to maintain the animals welfare. Unnecessary stress and noises are avoided so due to the sensitivity of female mink during late gestation. Gestation varies from 40-70 days, this time is often shortened by extending the daylight period by use of artificial lighting. &lt;ref name=CMBA /&gt;.
Females give birth to 5-6 kits on average. Since [[mink|kits]] are born [[altricial|altricial]], the female spends most of her time in the [[nest box|nest boxes]] caring for them. Mink kits are fully dependent on the dam's milk and will nurse for the first four weeks of their life. &lt;ref&gt;Brink, A.L., Jeppesen, L.L., and Heller, K.E. (2004). Behaviour in Suckling Mink Kits Under Farm Conditions: Effects of Accessibility of Drinking Water. ''Journal of Applied Animal Science'', 89 (2004), 131 - 137&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal care is essential to promote offspring survival and growth, particularly in American mink who give birth to altricial young. &lt;ref&gt;Schou, T.M., and Malmkvist, J. (2017). Early Kit Mortality and Growth in Farmed Mink are Affected by Litter Size Rather than Nest Climate. ''The Animal Consortium'', 11 (9), 1581 - 1589. Retrieved from https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/BE1E6A1B57E8C2062E833333FC48331E/S1751731117000234a.pdf/early_kit_mortality_and_growth_in_farmed_mink_are_affected_by_litter_size_rather_than_nest_climate.pdf. Accessed on November 24th, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Ranchers will check them regularly to ensure all the kits are warm, receiving enough milk, and are growing well. Females can loose significant body condition during [[lactation|lactation]] so their health is monitored by visual observations of behavior, appearance, and feed consumption.&lt;ref name=CMBA /&gt;.
[[Weaning|Weaning]] takes place when the kits reach approximately 6-8 weeks old. The changes that take place during weaning can be stressful for both [[dam|dam]] and kits therefore is done at a time that is most beneficial for the mother and litter. Ranchers will ensure the kits are able to consume solid [[animal feed|feed]] and drink water independently before they are ready for weaning. &lt;ref name=NFACC /&gt;.

===Growth and Furring (July - October)===
Very rapid growth takes place during the growth phase of the production cycle. For about 10-11 weeks, it is critical that the juvenile kits have access to adequate amounts of feed that is formulated to meet their nutritional needs. Maintaining a feeding routine that allows for multiple distributions of feed a day will help keep feed fresh and encourage appetite. &lt;ref name=NFACC /&gt;. In July, all mink (including kits and adult breeders) are vaccinated to prevent diseases and promote health and welfare of the herd. Once August arrives, the skeletal growth of kits is complete and the subsequent growth of primarily fat begins. The growth of fur predominantly takes place during the fall where it begins at the tail and continues up the back and to the head. Ranchers maintain a clean, healthy environment during this time by performing daily [[husbandry|husbandry]] practices, this includes; cleaning nest boxes, removal of surrounding debris and manure from the barn, bedding the cages, and up-keeping the cleanliness of the facility and farming equipment. Ranchers are diligent toward creating an environment that prioritizes the welfare of each animal and allows them to live and function comfortably within their environment.

===Grading and Harvesting (November - December)===
Mink are carefully evaluated in November or early December in order to physically assess their coat color, characteristics, and quality. Fur quality, along with skin size are two of the most important traits that are under intense selection in most mink breeding programs.&lt;ref&gt;Thirstrup, J.P., Jensen, J., and Lund, M.S. (2016). Genetic Parameters for Fur Quality Graded on Live Animals and Dried Pelts of American Mink (''Neovison vison''). ''Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics'', 134 (2017), 322 - 331. Retrieved from https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.library.dal.ca/doi/epdf/10.1111/jbg.12258. Accessed on November 24th, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Each mink will be given a grade dictated by the attributes of their coat; this is valuable in determining which mink will be kept as breeding stock for next season. Fur quality, color, and body size are judged by the farmer or a professional grader. &lt;ref&gt;Lagerkvist, G. (1997). Economic Profit from Increased Litter Size, Body Weight and Pelt Quality in Mink (''Mustela vison''). ''ACTA Agriculture Scandinavica'', 47 (1997), 57 0 63.

Accessed on November 28th, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Fur grades are often used alongside size, weight, health history, parent reproductive success, litter size, and temperament to assess the quality and potential of each animal&lt;ref name=CMBA /&gt;.
Mink are harvested in December and methods are used to euthanize each animal so that their death is quick, humane, and as painless as possible. Several techniques have been considered proper to euthanize farmed mink, these include; neck breaking, electricity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, and lethal injection. &lt;ref&gt;Korhonen, H.T., Cizinauskas, S., and Jesernics, J. (2012). Electrophysiological Study on CO and CO2 Euthanasia in Mink (''MUSTELA VISON''). ''Annals of Animal Science'', 12 (4), 597 - 608. Retrieved from file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/Electrophysiological_study_on_.pdf. Accessed on November 24th, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common method of harvesting is by subjecting the animal to a chamber that contains [[carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide]]. 
Pelting takes place either on site or upon shipping the mink to an offsite operation. &lt;ref name=CMBA /&gt;.

Carcasses sometimes go to animal sanctuaries, zoos, and aquariums to feed animals, and some end up as crab bait. Some biological supply companies offer preserved skinned carcasses of ranched mink for classroom [[dissection]] specimens as an alternative to cats or other domesticated mammals. Mink feces are used as organic crop fertiliser, and mink fat is turned into oil to manufacture soap, face oils, cosmetics, and leather treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.montanatrappers.org/management/fur-farming.htm#.VIDGfYs8-LM |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040402073526/http://montanatrappers.org/management/fur-farming.htm#.VIDGfYs8-LM |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2 April 2004 |title=Fur Farming |first= |last=|work=montanatrappers.org |year=2014 |accessdate=4 December 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is authentic fur recyclable, but its production is a renewable resource. Pelts that are produced commercially come from domestic mink that are selectively bred and harvested each year; no interference with wild or endangered species takes places to produce a farmed mink pelt. With the proper care and and eye for fashion, a fur garment can even be reinvented from a coat to jacket to vest to liner, to home accessory. &lt;ref name=NAFA /&gt;

==Controversy==
{{commons category|Animal abuse in fur farming}}
Anti-fur activists have claimed that methods used on fur farms are focused on maximizing profits at the expense of the welfare of fur producing [[livestock|animals]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/animals-used-clothing-factsheets/inside-fur-industry-factory-farms/|title=Inside the Fur Industry: Factory Farms|work=PETA|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frequent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Frequent Reasons for buying Fur|url=http://fur.elehost.com/frequent_reasons.html|publisher=fur.elehost.com|accessdate=24 March 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312054532/http://fur.elehost.com/frequent_reasons.html|archivedate=12 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite news|title= House of Commons Hansard Debates for 5 Mar 1999 (pt 6)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990305/debtext/90305-06.htm| date=5 March 1999| accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other types of [[animal farming]], living conditions of animals vary, and extreme cases are of much contention. According to PETA, the majority of fur farmers pack animals into small cages, preventing them from taking more than a few steps back and forth. PETA claims [[fox]]es and other animals suffer as a result of the confined environment, and may even cannibalize each other as a reaction to their confinement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
In other cases, as with passing of animal welfare legislation in Italy, animals are required to be given enriched living environments in which they can climb on branches, dig holes, use a nest of 50 × 50&amp;nbsp;cm and also have a water basin of at least 2 × 2 metres and 50&amp;nbsp;cm deep in which to swim.&lt;ref name = "Dieren"&gt;{{cite web | title= Support Our Efforts for Animal Rights | work= Bont voor Dieren | url =http://www.bontvoordieren.nl/english/index.php?action=farming | accessdate= 29 December 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051215121641/http://www.bontvoordieren.nl/english/index.php?action=farming |archivedate = 15 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Farmers argue that 50 years ago, the animals were kept in large outdoor holding areas, with pools of water. However, such farms resulted in high disease rates for the animals and were not practical.
Farmers claim that today's farmed animals only know farm life as they have been domesticated through over hundreds of years of selective breeding.{{citation needed| date = April 2012}}
The methods used for slaughtering the animals on farms and in the wild vary depending on the animal. For farmed mink, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] researches the best methods and publishes a report on the subject every 7 to 10 years. This report is used to guide state departments of agriculture which have jurisdiction over farm animals, including farm-raised mink. For those harvesting wild furs, biologists and wildlife managers dictate seasons, method of slaughter, and numbers of animals to be harvested.

After UK mink farmers were subjected to almost daily protests, they agreed to shut down their farming in exchange for compensation in [[England and Wales]] in 2000. At [[second reading]], the ban in England and Wales was justified principally on grounds of public morality.&lt;ref name="Dieren" /&gt; Prior to the ban, there had been 11 fur farms in the UK producing about 100,000 pelts annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1034562.stm |title=Campaigners hail fur ban bill |date=22 November 2000 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the last fur farm in Scotland had closed in 1993, the [[Scottish Parliament]] nevertheless banned fur farming in 2002.

In Austria, six of the nine federal states have banned fur farming, and the remaining three enforce such strict welfare regulations, in relation to the availability of swimming water, that fur farming is no longer economically viable.&lt;ref name = "Dieren" /&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===

These farms focus mainly on the trade of mink fur (some farms which have used fox fur are currently winding down operation as such trade is no longer economically viable). In 2006, approximately 170,000 mink and 300 foxes were harvested in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwf.ie/farminfo/farmfacts_fur.html Compassion In World Farming Ireland – Irish Farming Facts].

In the Republic of Ireland, fur farms are monitored by the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Department of Agriculture]], and welfare standards of Ireland and the European Union must be adhered to at all times.

===Finland===
Finnish citizens have had a right to instigate parliamentarian law initiatives since 2012. The first citizens' initiative to gain enough signatures was that instituting a ban on fur farming. Some 70,000 citizens signed the initiative within the required time period in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/parliament_mulls_how_to_deal_with_citizens_initiatives/6534855 Parliament mulls how to deal with citizens’ initiatives] yle.fi.  13 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In a march to [[Parliament House, Helsinki]] on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/100s_march_against_fur_farming/6694982 100s march against fur farming]. yle.fi 18 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;, four to five hundred people appealed to members of parliament to approve the citizens' initiative to ban fur farming. According to animal expert MSc Sesse Koivisto (wife of Ilkka Koivisto ex-director of the zoo [[Korkeasaari]]) in Helsingin Sanomat in 2010, fur farming did not provide acceptable conditions for the animals. In order to stop the suffering of animals, she demanded a ban on fur farming in Helsingin Sanomat, as in some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://luonnonvarassa.vuodatus.net/lue/2010/02/kurjuuden-ylistys Kurjuuden ylistys]. vuodatus.net. 27 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 2013, the [[Jyrki Katainen's cabinet|Finnish Parliament]] rejected the first citizens' initiative to ban fur farming. A positive development in the [[politics of Finland]] was that the initiative was taken in the Parliament for public voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/parliament_says_no_to_fur-farming_ban/6696170 Parliament says no to fur-farming ban Parliament says no to fur-farming ban]. yle.fi. 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/turkistarhauksen_kielto_kaatui_aanin_146-36/6695753 Turkistarhauksen kielto kaatui äänin 146-36]. yle.fi 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland in August 2016, there were about 950 active fur farms. The breeding of fur-animals has had a long tradition in Finland, having been professionally conducted since the 1920s. Up to 90% of the fur-farming community is situated in the rural areas of [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] and employs four to six thousand people. Today, fur farming is strictly regulated by law. The Finnish Furbreeders Association has developed its own national program of certification and animal health welfare that is tied to the [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso_9000.htm ISO 9001 standard] and monitored by the [http://www.detnorskeveritas.com/about/purpose/ Norske Veritas.] The fur animals are housed in shelter buildings or halls, where each animal has a specific place marked with a kit card. Shelter buildings are suitable for all fur animals, but halls are only used in mink farming.

Fox and mink at the fur farm were seized by animal welfare organizations and some were in such poor condition that they had to be euthanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/a-quebec-first-fur-farm-owner-charged-with-cruelty-negligence-1.2094960 |title=A Quebec first: Fur farm owner charged with cruelty, negligence &amp;#124; CTV Montreal News |website=Montreal.ctvnews.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the S.P.C.A. investigation, this Quebec Fur Farm was raided by anonymous activists who set free thousands of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-farmed-mink-set-free-by-intruder-1.2741807 |title=Quebec farmed mink set free by intruder - Montreal - CBC News |website=Cbc.ca |date=2014-08-20 |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontario====
Canadian fur farms in the Province of Ontario have been repeatedly targeted by an underground group called [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF).

[[File:Germany Must Perish! cover.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''Germany Must Perish!''''' is a 104-page book written by [[Theodore N. Kaufman|Theodore Newman Kaufman]], which he self-published in [[1941]] in the [[United States]]. The book advocated genocide through the sterilization of all [[Germans]] and the territorial dismemberment of Germany, believing that this would achieve world peace. Kaufman founded the Argyle Press in [[Newark, New Jersey]], United States, in order to publish this book. He was the sole proprietor of the Argyle Press and it is not known to have published any other works.

The [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] used the book, written by a [[Jews|Jewish]] author, to support their argument that Jews were plotting against their country.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Jews of Hanover Forced from Homes. Mayor Cites American Book, 'Germany Must Perish'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1941/09/09/archives/jews-of-hanover-forced-from-homes-mayor-cites-american-book-germany.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=September 9, 1941|accessdate=April 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American reactions to the book==
Though written and self-published by a non-notable author, the book received considerable attention. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine published a review in its 24 March issue that compared the book to [[Jonathan Swift]]'s 1729 satirical essay ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', which proposed reducing the population pressure in Ireland by the cannibalistic consumption of poor Irish children. However, the ''Time'' essay recognized that Kaufman's work was not satirical; it described the book as the "enshrinement of a single sensational idea". "Since Germans are the perennial disturbers of the world's peace, says the book, they must be dealt with like any homicidal criminals. But it is unnecessary to put the whole German nation to the sword. It is more humane to sterilize them."&lt;ref name=rev&gt;{{cite news|title=A Modest Proposal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884346,00.html|work=Time magazine|date=March 24, 1941|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Modest Proposal (review from ''Time'' magazine)|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/k/kaufman.theodore.nathan/press/time-review-perish-194103|website=The Nizkor Project|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, reviews in the United States "reflected an odd combination of straight reporting and skepticism".&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;Berel Lang, ''Philosophical Witnessing: The Holocaust as Presence'', [[University Press of New England]]: 2009), pp. 130–131, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman's second and more moderate pamphlet, "No More German Wars" published in 1942, was ignored both in the U.S. and in Germany.&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt;

An advertisement in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the book was released to the public on March 1, 1941. Kaufman also promoted the book by mailing a miniature black cardboard coffin with a hinged lid to reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. Advertisement for ''Germany Must Perish!''. ''New York Times''. March 1, 1941. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the coffin was a card proclaiming, "Read GERMANY MUST PERISH! Tomorrow you will receive your copy."&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lombardo&gt;{{cite book |last=Lombardo |first=Paul A. |author-link1=Paul_A._Lombardo |date=2010 |title=Three Generations, No Imbeciles: Eugenics, the Supreme Court and Buck v. Bell |url= |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins UP |pages=228, 236 |edition=paperback |isbn=978-0-8018-9824-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's dust jacket contained excerpts from reviews of the book. One [[blurb]] read: "A Plan For Permanent Peace Among Civilized Nations! -- New York Times."&lt;ref&gt;"Latest Books Received." ''New York Times''. March 16, 1941. p. BR29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, a Jewish journalist wrote an article claiming that the book was "little more than self-indulgence in dire vituperation by a man who sees Germany as the sole cause of the world's woes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald F. Lach]], "What They Would Do about Germany", ''[[Journal of Modern History]]'', Vol. 17, No. 3. (September 1945), pp. 227-243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Kaufman advocated the mass extermination through [[forced sterilization]] of the German people and the territorial dismemberment of Germany after an Allied victory in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Lombardo /&gt;

Kaufman summarized ''Germany Must Perish!'' in advertisements in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[New York Post]]'' as: "A dynamic volume outlining a plan for the extinction of Germany and containing a map showing possible dissection and apportionment of its territory."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Post'', Friday, February 28, 1941, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview carried in the September 26, 1941, issue of ''The Canadian Jewish Chronicle'', Kaufman defended his plan for the "sterilization of all Germans":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harold U. Ribalow|title=Hitler Will Be Nothing But A Rosebud Says Author 'Germany Must Perish!'. One Man's Plan For Peace Forever|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rPJOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gkwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=theodore-kaufman%20germany%20must%20perish&amp;pg=2325%2C5306|newspaper=The Canadian Jewish Chronicle|page=5|date=September 26, 1941|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GermanyMustPerish2.jpg|thumb|Map showing Kaufman's proposed dismemberment of Germany (and Austria)]]

{{quote|I believe that the Jews have a mission in life. They must see to it that the nations of the world get together in one vast federation. "Union Now" is the beginning of this. Slowly but surely the world will develop into a paradise. We will have perpetual peace. And the Jews will do the most to bring about this confederation, because they have the most to gain. But how can you get peace if Germany exists? The only way to win an eternal peace is to make the punishment of waging war more horrible than war itself. Human beings are penalized for murder, aren't they? Well, Germany starts all the wars of magnitude. Let us sterilize all Germans and wars of world domination will come to an end!}}

==The German reaction==

Kaufman was a Manhattan-born Jew and his advocacy of genocide attracted great attention in Germany.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt; The book was denounced as an "orgy of Jewish hatred" and U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] polemical anti-German agitation was seen as having inspired it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nazis Attack Roosevelt|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/07/24/87646724.pdf|accessdate=September 27, 2014|work=New York Times|date=July 24, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; American journalist [[Howard K. Smith]] was in Germany when ''Germany Must Perish!'' became known. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Howard K. Smith, ''Last Train from Berlin'' (London: Phoenix Pr., 1942), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|No man has ever done so irresponsible a disservice to the cause his nation is fighting and suffering for than Nathan Kaufman. His half-baked brochure provided the Nazis with one of the best light artillery pieces they have, for, used as the Nazis used it, it served to bolster up that terror which forces Germans who dislike the Nazis to support, fight and die to keep Nazism alive ...}}

In September 1941, [[Julius Streicher]] published an essay in ''[[Der Sturmer]]'' that called Kaufman's book "the crazy thinking of [an] insane Jewish brain". He quoted Kaufman at length and then commented: "By destroying the German people, the Jew wants to stop up the spring from which, since the beginning, the world has always found its creative blood, the source of all that is beautiful, good and noble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Streicher|first1=Julius|title=The Battle with the Devil|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/ds15.htm|website=German Propaganda Archive|publisher=[[Calvin College]]|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Goebbels]] also gave a radio address from Berlin warning Germans of "plans 'for sterilization of our entire population under 60 years' of age".&lt;ref name=Lombardo /&gt; These concerns were echoed by [[Adolf Hitler]] himself after the US entered World War II; he claimed mass sterilization of German male youth was a "primary" American goal.&lt;ref name=Lombardo /&gt;

When the Jews of [[Hanover]] were evicted on September 8, 1941, the local authorities cited Kaufman's book as one of the reasons.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Kaufman responded:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hanover Jews Victims of Latest Oppression|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kxhlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vW4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1522,728722&amp;dq=theodore+kaufman+newark&amp;hl=en|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 9, 1941|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unknown Title|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/09/09/87665415.pdf|accessdate=September 27, 2014|work=New York Times|date=September 9, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This is just a flimsy pretext for another of the innate cruelties of the German people ... I don't think it was my book that prompted this barbarity. They employed every possible German cruelty against the Jews long before my book was published.}}

The book appeared in many pieces of [[National Socialist]] propaganda. The ''Parole der Woche''{{'s}} weekly wall newspaper included it as evidence that the Allies' war aims included the destruction of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/parolederwoche.htm|title=Parole der Woche|first=Randall|last=Bytwerk|website=research.calvin.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet "The War Goal of World Plutocracy" detailed the contents of the book, although with some omissions from the text that it quoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/kriegsziel.htm|title=War Aims of World Plutocracy|first=Randall|last=Bytwerk|website=research.calvin.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in 1944 in a pamphlet, "Never!", which described Kaufman's importance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goitsch|first1=Heinrich|title=Never!|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/niemals.htm|website=German Propaganda Archive|publisher=Calvin College|accessdate=September 27, 2014}} The use of quotation marks for the last sentence of this quotation is unexplained.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Jewish president of the American Federation of Peace is no anonymous individual, no fanatic rejected by world Jewry, no mentally ill crackpot, but rather a leading and widely known Jewish personality in the United States. He belongs to the so-called Roosevelt Brain Trust, which provides intellectual and political education and advice to the American President. "It is therefore beyond question that his book and its demand that 'Germany must perish' corresponds to the official opinion of the leading circles of world plutocracy."}}

At his [[Nuremberg trial]] Julius Streicher cited Kaufman's book in his defense, claiming his anger at Jews was prompted by ''Germany Must Perish!''.&lt;ref name=Lombardo /&gt; The German philosopher and historian [[Ernst Nolte]] argues that the German reaction to ''Germany Must Perish!'' supports his contention that World War II was a genuine response to German fears of a worldwide Jewish plot.&lt;ref&gt;Nolte, Ernst "Between Myth and Revisionism", pages 17-38 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'', edited by H.W. Koch (NY: St. Martin's Press, 1985), pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

''“Monumentalized Early Iron Age Landscapes in the Danube river basin”'' 

'''Iron-Age-Danube''' is a cross-border project and is part of the [[Interreg|Interreg Danube Transnational Programme]] of the [[European Union]]. 

In the Iron-Age-Danube project the early [[Iron Age]] landscapes in the [[Danube]] river basin are explored with the help of modern technology and traditional archaeological tools. The participating partners from [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] work together to promote the concept of archaeological [[landscape]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s beyond single [[Archaeological site|archaeological sites]] in these countries.

The project is funded by the [[European Union]] with about 2.169.200 EUR from the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF). These ERDF resources make 85% of the total project volume which is about 2.552.000 EUR.

The Iron-Age-Danube project lasts from the 1st of January 2017 till the 30th of June 2019.

== Goals of the project ==
The major goal of the project is to communicate a lively image of archaeological research and the Iron Age landscapes to the visitors and to raise the awareness for the importance of archaeological [[Ancient monument|monuments]] for the [[Human History|human history]]. 

The project Iron-Age-Danube ignores [[Border (disambiguation)|border]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;lines between the countries and researches the remains of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] (Iron Age) in the Danube region. The data of this research will help to understand the way of living in the past and the needs of the heritage today.

Another goal is the protection of the monuments and landscapes as well as their sustainable use for the tourism. To strengthen the local tourism, already existing archaeological parks or trails will be revitalised. New visitor programs in form of digital and analogous tools will be developed and implemented in 9 micro-regions. The micro-regions are: [[Großklein]] and Strettweg (Austria), [[Jalžabet]] and [[Kaptol, Požega-Slavonia County|Kaptol]] (Croatia), Poštela and [[Dolenjske Toplice]] (Slovenia) and [[Százhalombatta]], [[Süttő]] and [[Sopron]] (Hungary).

[[Java]]nese literature has a very large historical component. In all sorts of texts, such as laudatory [[poem]]s, [[chronicle]]s, and [[Travel literature|travelogue]]s, writers have interpreted the how and why of certain circumstances. 

These texts are important for the knowledge of Javanese perspectives on the past. Scholars of Javanese history have paid much attention to theoretical questions, aiming at a balanced evaluation of Javanese [[historiography]] next to Western historiography. In doing so they focused on Old and Modern Javanese sources, drawing both on written sources and archaeological and epigraphic material. The debate continues up to the present.

{{anchor|Babad}}
==Babads==
''Babads'' as a genre belong to the traditional literature. A characteristic of this kind of literature is that it is written in metrical form and is governed by a set of strict conventions. In traditional Javanese society, prose (''gancaran'') was not considered to be ''belles letters'' but was considered to be merely sets of notes or ''aide-mémoires''. 

This approach reflected the way in which literature was presented: text was not usually read in silence but, rather, was recited or sung to an audience. Every metre had its own particular melody or melodies to which it was sung, in harmony with the contents of the story.

The word ''babad'' means 'a story about past events', 'text on the clearing of (the land...)', i.e. 'story about the origin of this or that settlement'.

The ''Babad Basuki'' relates the clearing of the jungle and founding of a new settlement in Besuki (East Java), while the ''Babad Dipanegara'' relates the events connected with the insurrection of [[Diponegoro]].

==Kakawin and kidung==
[[Kakawin]] are long epic poems in a defined [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] inherited from [[Sanskrit]] poetic forms. [[Kidung]] are epic poems in [[Javanese poetry|Javanese metres]].

The '''Jeolla dialect''' of Korean (also known as '''Cholla'''; {{Hangul|전라도 방언/사투리}}, {{Hanja|全羅道方言}}), or '''Southwestern Korean''', are spoken in the [[Honam]] region of South Korea, including the city of [[Gwangju]]. This area was known as [[Jeolla Province]] during the [[Joseon]] era.

Like the [[Chungcheong dialect]], the Jeolla dialect is considered non-standard. Perhaps the most obvious difference comes from common verb endings. In place of the usual ''-seumnida'' (습니다 {{IPA|[sɯmnida]}}) or ''-seyo'' (세요 {{IPA|[sɛjo]}}) endings, a southern Jeolla person will use ''-rau'' (라우 {{IPA|[ɾau]}}) or ''-jirau'' (지라우 {{IPA|[tɕiɾau]}}) appended to the verb. For a causative verb ending, expressed in standard language with a ''-nikka'' (니까 {{IPA|[nik͈a]}}) ending, Jeolla people use ''-ngkkei'' (응게 {{IPA|[ŋk͈ei]}}), so the past tense of the verb "did" ("because someone did it"), ''haesseunikka'' (했으니까 {{IPA|[hɛs͈ɯnik͈a]}}), becomes ''haesseungkke'' (했승게 {{IPA|[hɛs͈ɯŋk͈e]}}). A similar sound is used for the quotative ending, "somebody said...". The usual verb endings are ''-dago'' (다고 {{IPA|[tako]}}) and ''-rago'' (라고 {{IPA|[ɾako]}}). Jeolla dialect prefers ''-dangkke'' (당게 {{IPA|[taŋk͈e]}}).

Regarding pronunciation differences, there is often a tendency to pronounce only the second vowel in a diphthong. For example, the verb ending that indicates "since", ''-neundae'', becomes ''-neundi'' (는디). The name of the large city of [[Gwangju]] (광주) becomes ''Gangju'' (강주), and the verb 'to not have, to be absent', ''eopda'' 없다, becomes very close to ''upda'' (웂다). There are some words that are unique to the dialect as well: ''utjeseo'' (웆제서) for "why", ''sibang'' (시방) for "now", and ''dwitgan'' (뒷간) for "outhouse". Jeolla dialect speakers have a tendency to end their sentences with ''-ing'', (잉) especially when asking a favor. This can be compared to the word "eh," as used by some Canadians.

[[Pansori]] texts are written in the Jeolla dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, vol. 7, p. 935&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''L'Indice dei libri del mese''''' (''L'Indice'') is an Italian monthly of cultural information. 
Founded in 1984, it is one of the most longeve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.editions-verdier.fr/banquet/n41/indice2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118142835/http://www.editions-verdier.fr/banquet/n41/indice2.htm |archivedate=2008-11-18 |df= }}; the twenty-eight years of ''L'Indice'' have been the object of recent Ph.D. dissertations and seminars at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]]: see http://www.ehess.fr/fr/enseignement/enseignements/2010/ue/1273/.&lt;/ref&gt; and authoritative in the field.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.lindiceonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=71:premio-mondello-2009&amp;catid=51:premi-e-riconoscimenti&amp;Itemid=66 motivation] for the [http://www.fondazionebancodisicilia.it/it/grandi_progetti/scheda.php?id=18 International Literary Prize “Mondello – Città di Palermo”], granted to ''L'Indice'' in 2009 on occasion of the 25th anniversary of its foundation; see also a [http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2011/07/09/salviamo-lindice/144258/ recent article] by the philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]] published on the website of the Italian newspaper [[Il Fatto Quotidiano]].&lt;/ref&gt; Taking inspiration from internationally renowned book reviews such as ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://lindiceonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=271&amp;Itemid=1.&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'Indice'' offers its readers reviews of books and the arts (each issue contains up to a hundred book reviews&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qlibri.it/editoria-tradizionale/riviste-letterarie/l%27indice/.&lt;/ref&gt;), and essays on current events and cultural topics starting from the most significant literary and intellectual production in Italian.

== History ==

The history of ''L'Indice'' begins in October 1984,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1984/10/28/indice-dei-libri-del-mese.html article] of the Italian newspaper [[La Repubblica]] of October 28th, 1984, on the launch of ''L'Indice''.&lt;/ref&gt; with the literary critic [[:it:Cesare Cases|Cesare Cases’s]]&lt;ref&gt;On Cases’s work for ''L'Indice'', see Gian Giacomo Migone’s  [http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,0025/articleid,0236_01_2005_0219_0025_1824152/ article] on the Italian newspaper ''La Stampa'', August 11th, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; words about what a book review is expected to achieve: «The essential is that the first moment, that is the description of a book’s contents, shall have the centrality it deserves. Connivance to the reader should not be established ... on the basis of specialistic interest nor by formal flatteries; contents only can ground it ... The essential is that the reader should get from the description of contents a clear idea of what the book is and of the reasons of its importance, those which have induced us to prefer it to others».&lt;ref&gt;''L'Indice dei libri del mese'', n. 1, 1984, p. 3. Translation from the original Italian «L'essenziale è che il primo momento, cioè l'esposizione del contenuto, abbia la centralità che gli spetta. La connivenza con il lettore non dovendo stabilirsi (...) né attraverso l'interesse specialistico né attraverso lusinghe formali, è solo il contenuto a determinarla (...). L'essenziale è che attraverso l'esposizione il lettore acquisisca una chiara idea di quel che il libro è e delle ragioni della sua importanza, ragioni che hanno fatto sì che lo scegliessimo a differenza di altri»&lt;/ref&gt;

In its twenty-eight years of existence, ''L'Indice'' has always remained faithful to this program.&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by several Italian columnists on the occasion of the successful fund-raising campaign launched by ''L'Indice'' in 2011: see articles from [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2011/10/06/indice-cerca-novantamila-euro-per-sopravvivere.html ''La Repubblica''] (October 6th, 2011),  [http://www3.lastampa.it/cultura/sezioni/articolo/lstp/423584/ ''La Stampa''] (October 6th, 2011), [http://www.ilquotidianoweb.it/it/calabria/catanzaro_indice_libri_riuscira_salvarsi_domenico_talia_commento_4556.html ''Il Quotidiano della Calabria''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926155126/http://www.ilquotidianoweb.it/it/calabria/catanzaro_indice_libri_riuscira_salvarsi_domenico_talia_commento_4556.html |date=2011-09-26 }} (September 24th, 2011), [http://www.ilgiornale.it/cultura/la_rivista_letteraria_muore_se_non_vive_conflitti_e_battaglie_idee/libri-attualit-cultura_italiana-walter_pedull/04-07-2011/articolo-id=533124-page=0-comments=1 ''Il Giornale''] (July 4th, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; It has documented the Italian book production through reviews and notices, along with surveys, columns, interviews and articles of different sorts. Each of its editors has left his own mark on the review: [[:it:Gian Giacomo Migone|Gian Giacomo Migone]] (1984–90) and Cesare Cases (1990–1994) have contributed to specify the original project, whose recognizable physiognomy is indissolubly associated with [[:it:Tullio Pericoli|Tullio Pericoli's]] portraits and graphics, as well as with [[:it:Franco Matticchio|Franco Matticchio's]] drawings. [[:it:Alberto Papuzzi|Alberto Papuzzi]] (1994–1999) brought special attention to the relationship between cinema and literature/essays. Under [[:it:Luca Rastello|Luca Rastello's]] (2000–2001) guidance, ''L'Indice'' inaugurated a new column, "Segnali" (Signals), focusing on cultural and political changes, as well as knotty issues in the society we live in. [[:it:Mimmo Càndito|Mimmo Càndito]] (2001-) has enriched ''L'Indice'' with “Villaggio globale” (Global Village), hosting correspondents who write about books production in Europe and worldwide.

== The European Dimension: "Liber" ==

In 1989, Gian Giacomo Migone, then editor of ''L'Indice'', and [[Pierre Bourdieu]] launched the idea of a European literary and cultural journal to be published with identical contents in several European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin McDowell, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/06/arts/literary-journal-is-planned-in-4-languages.html ''Literary Journal Is Planned in 4 Languages''], ''The New York Times'', June 6th, 1989; see also an [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1989/05/27/si-chiama-liber-ma-una-rivista.html article] appeared on the Italian newspaper [[La Repubblica]] on May 27th, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from apparently national, country-specific interventions, the journal aimed at emphasizing the inherent unity of the European culture in a critical historical moment of the integration process, addressing specialists and the wider public at the same time. Along with ''L'Indice'', ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[El País]]'' sponsored the project. A 24-pages quarterly multinational literary journal called “Liber. Revue européenne des livres” (“Liber. European Review of Books”) – deliberately playing upon the ambiguity intrinsic to the Latin root, which means both “book” and “free” – was therefore published in the biennium 1989-90 (its first issue was presented at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] of October 1989), with a combined circulation of over one million.&lt;ref&gt;On the history and importance of ''Liber'', see Peter Collier, “Liber: Liberty and Literature”, ''French Cultural Studies'', Vol. 4 (12), 1993: 291-300.&lt;/ref&gt; The editor was [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. Jeremy Treglown (then editor of ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''), Frank Schirrmarcher (''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'') and Thomas Ferenczi (''[[Le Monde]]'') joined Migone and Bourdieu in the editorial board. After five editions, “Liber” became a supplement of Bourdieu’s publication ''[[Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grenfell, ''Pierre Bourdieu Agent Provocateur''. London and New York: Continuum, 2004, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

In 2009, ''L'Indice'' was awarded the International Literary Prize [[:it:Premio Mondello|“Mondello – Città di Palermo”]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondazionebancodisicilia.it/it/grandi_progetti/scheda.php?id=18.

'''Miniature art''' or '''painting in little''' is a genre that focuses on art (especially painting, engraving and sculpture) with a long history that dates back to the scribes of the medieval ages. Miniature art societies, such as the World Federation of Miniaturists (WFM), provide applicable definitions of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfm.org/definitions.htm Size definitions of miniature painting] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20020204032723/http://www.worldfm.org/definitions.htm |date=2002-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An often-used definition is that a piece of miniature art can be held in the palm of the hand, or that it covers less than 25 square inches or 100&amp;nbsp;cm². Subjects are depicted in 1/6 actual size, and in all paintings the spirit of miniaturisation should be maintained.

Miniature art has been made for over 1000 years and is prized by collectors. The U.S. [[White House]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], [[Astolat Dollhouse Castle]], and museums around the world have collections of miniature paintings, drawings, original prints and etchings, and sculpture.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

{{Politics of Lebanon}}

The '''Ministry of Tourism''' ({{lang-ar|وزارة السياحة}}) is a [[Ministry (government department)|government ministry]] of [[Lebanon]].  It originates from the [[Lebanon Tourism Service]] created in the 1930s as part of the [[Ministry of Economy and Trade (Lebanon)|Ministry of National Economy]].

==History==
After [[History of Lebanon#Independence|Lebanese independence]], the [[General Tourism Commission]] (CGT or ''Commissariat Général du Tourisme, de l'Estivage et de l'Hivernage'' in [[French Language|French]]) was created in 1948 to monitor tourism professions and promote Lebanese tourism abroad.

In 1959, the CGT was annexed by the [http://www.ministryinfo.gov.lb/ Ministry of Information] which became the Ministry of Information, Orientation, and Tourism. However, it was the [[National Tourism Council (Lebanon)|National Tourism Council]] (CNT or ''Conseil National du Tourisme'' in [[French Language|French]]), a private organization, which effectively promoted [[tourism in Lebanon]].

The growth of tourism on a global scale led to the creation of the Ministry of Tourism in 1966 (Law 21/66, issued on March 29, 1966), composed of the [[General Directorate of Tourism (Lebanon)|General Directorate of Tourism]] (''Direction Générale des Affaires Touristiques'').

Decree no. 7142 was issued on April 20, 1967, defining the specific tasks that fell under the separate responsibility of the National Tourism Council, including overseas promotion and execution of tourism projects. However, this decree was repealed by Decree no. 2829, issued on October 10, 1992, which transferred these tasks to the Ministry of Tourism.

==Minister==
The current minister of tourism is [[Avedis Guidanian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7048">'''Movietone News''' is a [[newsreel]] that ran from 1928 to 1963 in the United States, and – as '''British Movietone News''' – from 1929 to 1979 in the United Kingdom.

==History==
[[File:Fox movietone 2.jpg|thumb|Right|200px|A vintage Fox movietone motion picture camera]]
Movietone News evolved from an earlier newsreel established by [[Twentieth Century Fox|Fox Films]] called [[Fox News (1919 – 1930)|Fox News]] which was founded in 1919. It produced silent newsreels. When Fox entered talkies with ''[[Mother Knows Best (film)|Mother Knows Best]]'', the name '''Fox Movietone''' was applied to Fox's sound productions.

It is known in the U.S. as '''Fox Movietone News''',  produced cinema, sound [[newsreel]]s from 1928 to 1963 in the U.S., from 1929 to 1979 in the UK (for much of that time as '''British Movietone News'''), and from 1929 to 1975 in Australia. One of the earliest in the series featured ''[[George Bernard Shaw]] Talks to Movietone News'', released on June 25, 1928.

One of the known early producers of these newsreels was Abraham Harrison also known as Harry, father of notable black and white photographer [[Dody Weston Thompson]] who also found a brief career in film making.

An early conductor of the Movietone News orchestra was Harry Lauder II, nephew of entertainer Sir [[Harry Lauder]], who was contracted by the company for eighteen months before [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] took him to his Hollywood studio. Sir Harry Lauder also appeared in test sound films made at the [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox Studios]] in [[New York City]] during the winter-spring of 1927.

[[File:JazzSingerAndFox.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=Advertisement from the Blue Mouse Theater announcing the Pacific Coast premiere of ''The Jazz Singer'', and Movietone News|Newspaper ad from a fully equipped theater in Tacoma, Washington, showing ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', on Vitaphone, and a Fox newsreel, on [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], together on the same bill.]]

One installment, ''Fox Grandeur News'', was released on May 26, 1929, in Fox's short-lived [[widescreen]] process [[70 mm Grandeur film|Grandeur]], and shown before the [[feature film]] ''[[Fox Movietone Follies of 1929]]''.

''[[Hearst Metrotone News]]'' initially leased the [[Theodore Case|Case Research Lab]] patents from William Fox for its sound newsreels. Each of these studios used this system of recording [[sound film]] for news items because it was an easily transported single-system of [[sound-on-film]] recording.

Fox's first use of recording a news event was on May 20, 1927: [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s take-off from [[Roosevelt Field, New York|Roosevelt Field]] for his historic solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean was filmed with sound and shown in a New York theater that same night, inspiring Fox to create Movietone News. A regular narrator of the newsreels was broadcaster/journalist [[Lowell Thomas]].

After Fox Films merged with 20th Century Pictures in 1935 to form 20th Century-Fox, the name of Fox Movietone News was shortened to Movietone News.

In [[Australia]], Movietone and [[Cinesound]] were competitors for newsreel coverage, but have now combined under the Movietone News name.

==Status and licensing==
The [[University of South Carolina]] Moving Image Research Collections &lt;ref&gt;http://library.sc.edu/p/collections/mirc]&lt;/ref&gt; has a portion of the Fox Movietone newsreel collection. The rest of it is owned and managed by the [[Fox Film Corporation]]'s corporate successor (and namesake), [[Fox News Channel]]. During its early years, Fox News Channel had a weekend show which played the newsreels.

Licensing for Fox Movietone newsreels owned by the University of South Carolina is handled by the Moving Image Research Collections. while licensing for Fox Movietone News still owned by [[21st Century Fox]] is handled by Fox News Channel. British Movietone is owned separately by the films' successor-in-interest, operating under the name British Movietonews Ltd. British Movietone is represented by AP Archive in the UK. In the United States, licensing of those newsreels is handled by [[ABC News]].

In September 2016, it was announced that the British Movietone archive had been acquired by [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2016/ap-acquires-historic-british-movietone-archive|title=AP acquires historic British Movietone archive|website=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/54fb40d4-8415-11e6-a29c-6e7d9515ad15|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/27/ap-acquires-british-movietone-archive|title=AP acquires British Movietone archive|first=Mark|last=Sweney|date=27 September 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, British Movietone and Associated Press's archival footage were released on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2015/ap-makes-one-million-minutes-of-historical-footage-available-on-youtube|title=AP makes one million minutes of historical footage available on YouTube|website=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/business/media/youtubes-historical-footage-expands-both-serious-and-silly.html|title=YouTube’s Historical Footage Expands, Both Serious and Silly|first=Daniel|last=Victor|date=22 July 2015|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4024">'''New Delhi Kali Bari''' is a Hindu temple dedicated to Goddess [[Kali]] and the center for [[Bengali people|Bengali]] culture in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. Established in 1930s, it is situated on Mandir Marg, close to [[Laxminarayan Temple]] (Birla Mandir) in Delhi.

==History==

After several years of demands by the burgeoning expatriate Bengali population, one acre of land was allotted on the new Mandir Marg (temple road), next to the [[Laxminarayan Temple]]. The small unpretentious temple of Goddess [[Kali]] came up shortly thereafter, with a ''pratima'' (idol) resembling the one at [[Kalighat Kali Temple]] in Kolkata. The mandir committee was formalized in 1935 with [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] as the first president&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newdelhikalibari.com/untold.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Mandir Building was inaugurated by Sir Justice [[Manmatha Nath Mukherjee]]. After that the authority established a building for the visitors and guest. Bengali tourists can book rooms or dormitory for staying there. There is an old and enriched library in Delhi Kalibari.

==Durga Puja==
The [[Durga puja]] celebrated at the Kalibari, is one of the oldest Durga Pujas in the city. It first started in 1925. The original temple of Kali Bari was situated on Baird Road (today's Bangla Sahib Road), where the local Bengali community gathered for the annual Durga Puja. After the present temple came up after 1931, it shifted here. Till today, it continues to be the nodal point for the hundreds of puja committees in Delhi, and is widely revered among Delhi Bengalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kali Bari website to help old bond with the new|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Kali-Bari-website-to-help-old-bond-with-the-new/Article1-664922.aspx |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=February 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Delhi's old timers remember as another Durga Puja dawns|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/india/news/article_1365768.php/Delhis_old_timers_remember_as_another_Durga_Puja_dawns |publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]] |date=Oct 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only older pujas in Delhi are at [[Kashmiri Gate, Delhi|Kashmere Gate]], organized by [[Delhi Durga Puja Samiti]], which started in 1910, and the Timarpur puja organised by the Timarpur and Civil Lines puja samiti, estd. 1914 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How community pujas came about|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/How+community+pujas+came+about/1/63510.html |publisher=[[India Today]] |date=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The puja celebration at Kali Bari continued to follow the traditional style, with traditional ''ekchalar thakur'' (single frame for idols) and ''sholar kaaj''. Even puja rituals have remained unchanged since 1936 and traditional competitions in [[Rabindra sangeet]] and recitation are still organised. Mr Swapan Kumar Chakraborty is the current President of Delhi Kalibari. Artisans are brought in from Kolkata to build the puja [[pandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tradition fuses with modernity |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-03/delhi/30238103_1_durga-puja-pandals-puja-committees |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date= Oct 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Festive spirit pervades the Capital  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/15/stories/2007101565010200.htm |publisher= [[The Hindu]]|date=Oct 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

The temple is located on the Mandir Marg, situated west of [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]] in [[New Delhi]].  The temple is easily accessible from the city by local buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws.  Nearest [[Delhi Metro]] [[List of Delhi metro stations|station]] is R.K.Ashram Marg, located about 2&amp;nbsp;km away.

'''Nianfo''' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:念|念]][[wikt:佛|佛]]|p=niànfó}}, [[Japanese_language|Japanese]]: {{nihongo|[[wikt:念|念]][[wikt:仏|仏]]|ねんぶつ|nenbutsu}}, {{korean|hangul=염불|rr=yeombul}}, {{lang-vi|[[wikt:niệm|niệm]] [[wikt:Phật|Phật]]}}) is a term commonly seen in [[Pure Land Buddhism]]. In the context of Pure Land practice, it generally refers to the repetition of the name of [[Amitābha]]. It is a translation of [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|buddhānusmṛti}}'' (or, "recollection of the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Buswell|2013|p=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Indian Sanskrit Nianfo ==

Although the Sanskrit phrase used in [[India]] is not mentioned originally in the bodies of the two main Pure Land sutras, it appears in the opening of the extant Sanskrit [[Infinite Life Sutra]] as the following:&lt;ref name='inf_life_sutra'&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dsbcproject.org/canon-text/content/59/528| title = Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon: Sukhāvatīvyūhaḥ (Vistaramātṛkā)| accessdate = 2018-05-11| publisher =University of the West}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''namo'mitābhāya.''

The apostrophe and omission of the first "A" in "Amitābha" comes from normal Sanskrit [[sandhi]] transformation, and implies that the first "A" is implied and spoken more quickly. A more accessible rendering might be:

:''Namo Amitābhāya.''

The phrase literally means "Homage to Infinite Light". The Sanskrit pronunciation is the following:

:{{IPA-sa|nɐmoːɐmit̪ɑːbʱɑːjɐ|}}

== Nianfo in various forms ==
[[File:Nembutsu Calligraphy.jpg|100px|thumbnail|A reprint of nembutsu (nianfo) calligraphy composed by [[Honen]], founder of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan.  Printed in a [[Jodo Shu]] liturgy book.]]
As the practice of nianfo spread from India to various other regions, the original pronunciation changed to fit various native languages.

In China, the practice of nianfo was codified with the establishment of the separate Pure Land school of Buddhism. The most common form of this is the six syllable nianfo; some shorten it into Ēmítuófó/Āmítuófó.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfnn.org/book/books3/2068.htm 淨業持名四十八法]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Japanese [[Jodo Shinshu]] sect, it is often shortened to ''na man da bu''.

=== Nianfo Variants ===

In the [[Jodo Shinshu]] tradition in Japan, variant forms of the nianfo have been used since its inception.  The founder, [[Shinran]], used a 9-character {{nihongo|'''Kujimyōgō'''|九字名号||}} in the [[Shoshinge]] and the ''Sanamidabutsuge'' (讃阿弥陀佛偈) hymns:

{{quote|南無不可思議光如来&lt;br /&gt;
Na mu fu ka shi gi kō nyo rai&lt;br /&gt;
"I take refuge in the Buddha of Inconceivable Light!"}}

Further, the "restorer" of Jodo Shinshu, [[Rennyo]], frequently inscribed the nianfo for followers using a 10-character ({{nihongo|'''Jūjimyōgō'''|十字名号||}} :

{{quote|
帰命尽十方無碍光如来&lt;br /&gt;
Ki myō jin jip-pō mu ge kō nyo rai&lt;br /&gt;
"I take refuge in the [[Tathagata]] of Unobstructed Light Suffusing the Ten Directions".}}

The latter was originally popularized by Shinran's descendant (and Rennyo's ancestor), Kakunyo, but its use was greatly expanded by Rennyo.

== Purpose of Nianfo ==
[[File:Mushono-Dainembutsu amulet paper.JPG|100px|thumbnail|Mushono-Dainembutsu amulet paper]]
Regarding Pure Land practice in Indian Buddhism, Hajime Nakamura writes that as described in the Pure Land sūtras from [[India]], Mindfulness of the Buddha (Skt. ''buddhānusmṛti'', Ch. ''nianfo'') is the essential practice.&lt;ref name=nakamura&gt;Nakamura, Hajime. ''Indian Buddhism: A Survey with Bibliographical Notes.'' 1999. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; These forms of mindfulness are essentially methods of meditating upon Amitābha Buddha.&lt;ref name=nakamura/&gt;

In the ''[[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'', the bodhisattva [[Mahasthamaprapta|Mahāsthāmaprāpta]] tells how the practice of nianfo enabled him to obtain [[samadhi|samādhi]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In [[Chinese Buddhism]], the nianfo is specifically taken as a subject of meditation and is often practiced while counting with [[Buddhist prayer beads]].&lt;ref&gt;Wei-an Cheng (2000). [https://web.archive.org/web/20121014164826/http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/monkeym.pdf Taming the monkey mind: a guide to pure land practice], translation with commentary by Elder Master Suddhisukha; New York: Sutra Translation Committee of the U.S. and Canada, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, Pure Land and [[Chan Buddhism]] merged entirely by the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The modern Chan revitaliser [[Nan Huai-Chin]] taught that the nianfo is to be chanted slowly and the mind emptied out after each repetition. When idle thoughts arise, the nianfo is repeated again to clear them. With constant practice, the mind progressively empties and the meditator attains samādhi.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, Margaret. ''Grass Mountain: A Seven Day Intensive in Ch'an Training with Master Nan Huai-Chin''. York Beach: Samuel Weiser, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Pure Land traditions, mindfully chanting of the name of Amitābha is viewed as allowing one to obtain birth in Amitābha's pure land, Sukhāvatī. It is felt that this act would help to negate vast stores of negative karma that might hinder one's pursuit of buddhahood. Sukhāvatī is a place of refuge where one can become enlightened without being distracted by the sufferings of our existence.

Various Pure Land schools in Japan have different interpretations of the nianfo, often based on faith in Amitābha rather than on meditation. In [[Jōdo Shinshū]], the nianfo is reinterpreted as an expression of gratitude to Amitābha. The idea behind this is that rebirth into Sukhāvatī is assured the moment one first has faith in Amitābha.

== Origins of the Nianfo ==
Andrew Skilton looks to an intermingling of Mahāyāna teachings with Buddhist meditation schools in [[Kashmir]] for the rise of Mahāyāna practices related to ''buddhānusmṛti'':
{{quote|Great innovations undoubtedly arose from the intermingling of early Buddhism and the Mahāyāna in Kashmir. Under the guidance of [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādin]] teachers in the region, a number of influential meditation schools evolved which took as their inspiration the Bodhisattva [[Maitreya]]. [...] The Kashmiri meditation schools were undoubtably highly influential in the arising of the ''buddhānusmṛti'' practices, concerned with the 'recollection of the Buddha(s)', which were later to become characteristic of Mahāyāna Buddhism and the Tantra.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The earliest dated sutra describing the nianfo is the ''[[Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra]]'' (first century BCE), which is thought to have originated in ancient kingdom of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]]. This sutra does not enumerate any vows of Amitābha or the qualities of his [[pure land]], [[Sukhavati|Sukhāvatī]], but rather briefly describes the repetition of the name of Amitābha as a means to enter his realm through meditation.
{{quote|Bodhisattvas hear about the Buddha Amitabha and call him to mind again and again in this land. Because of this calling to mind, they see the Buddha Amitabha. Having seen him they ask him what dharmas it takes to be born in the realm of the Buddha Amitabha. Then the Buddha Amitabha says to these bodhisattvas: 'If you wish to come and be born in my realm, you must always call me to mind again and again, you must always keep this thought in mind without letting up, and thus you will succeed in coming to be born in my realm.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harrison, John McRae, trans. (1998). The Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sutra and the Śūraṅgama Samādhi Sutra, Berkeley, Calif.: Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research. {{ISBN|1-886439-06-0}}; pp. 2-3,19&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Both the ''[[Infinite Life Sutra]]''  and the ''[[Amitabha Sutra|Amitābha Sūtra]]'' subsequently included instructions for practicing buddhānusmṛti in this manner. However, it has not been determined which sūtra was composed first, and to what degree the practice of buddhānusmṛti had already been popularized in India. Buddhānusmṛti directed at other buddhas and bodhisattvas is also advocated in sūtras from this period, for figures such as [[Akshobhya|Akṣobhya]] and [[Avalokiteśvara]]. The practice of buddhānusmṛti for Amitābha became very popular in India. With translations of the aforementioned sūtras as well as instruction from Indian monks, the practice rapidly spread to East Asia.

==Nembutsu-ban==
The term nembutsu-ban is applied to the event in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]] in 1207 where [[Hōnen]] and his followers were banned from the city and forced into exile. This occurred when the leaders of older schools of Buddhism persuaded the civil authorities to prohibit the newer practices including the recitation of ''Namu Amida Butsu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Buddhism in Japan: Shin Buddhist religion &amp; culture|author=Esben Andreasen|year=1998|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawai'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was lifted in 1211.

== Nianfo in modern history ==
[[Thích Quảng Đức]], a [[Vietnam]]ese Mahāyāna monk who famously [[Self-immolation|burned himself to death]] in an act of protest, said the nianfo as his last words immediately before death. He sat in the [[lotus position]], rotated a string of wooden prayer beads, and recited the words "Nam Mô A Di Đà Phật" before striking the match and dropping it on himself.

'''''Not Brand Echh''''' is a [[satire|satiric]] [[American comic book|comic book]] [[ongoing series|series]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] that [[parody|parodied]] its own [[superhero]] stories as well as those of other comics publishers. Running for 13 issues ([[cover-date]]d Aug. 1967 to May 1969), it included among its contributors such notable writers and artists as [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], [[Gene Colan]], [[Bill Everett]], [[John Severin|John]] and [[Marie Severin]], and [[Roy Thomas]]. With issue #9, it became a 68-page, 25¢ "giant", relative to the typical 12¢ comics of the times. In 2017, a 14th issue was released.

Its mascot, [[Forbush Man]], introduced in the first issue, was a superhero wannabe with no superpowers and a costume of red long johns emblazoned with the letter "F" and a cooking pot, with eye-holes, covering his never-revealed head. His secret identity was eventually revealed in issue #5 (Dec. 1967) as [[Forbush Man|Irving Forbush]], Marvel's fictitious office [[gofer]].

==Publication history==
Marvel Comics' superhero-satire comic book ''Not Brand Echh'' ran an initial 13 issues ([[cover-date]]d Aug. 1967 - May 1969),&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[https://www.comics.org/series/1811/ ''Not Brand Echh'' at the Grand Comics Database].&lt;/ref&gt; with a 14th issue published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/not-brand-echh-14/| title=Not Brand Echh #14 (Preview)|date=November 10, 2017|accessdate=March 6, 2018|publisher=[[ComicBookResources.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series title was a play on an advertising convention of the time, in which a competitor's product was not referred to by name, but simply as "Brand X"; DC was sometimes playfully called "Brand Echh" in Marvel "[[Bullpen Bulletins]]" and [[comic book letter column|letters pages]], hence this comic was "Not Brand Echh". The copyrighted title of the comic in its postal indicia was ''Brand Echh'' for its first four issues, and afterward ''Not Brand Echh'', the trademarked cover title from the start.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Typical stories and name transpositions included Ironed Man ([[Iron Man]]) vs. Magnut, Robot Biter ([[Gold Key Comics]]' [[Magnus, Robot Fighter]]); "Best Side Story", with Dr. Deranged ([[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]) in a ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' pastiche; "The Origin of...Stuporman", a [[Superman]] takeoff recalling [[Wally Wood]]'s influential "[[Superduperman]]" in ''Mad'' #4 (May 1952); the Ecchs-Men in "If Magneat-O Should Clobber Us", parodying not only the [[X-Men]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], but also the high melodrama of 1960s Marvel titles; and Marvel characters visually standing-in for the [[baseball]]-player protagonists of the otherwise faithfully rendered famous [[poem]] "[[Casey at the Bat]]". Events took place in the "Marble Universe", a play on the [[Marvel Universe]]. 

In broader topical references, [[Gary Friedrich]], writer of ''[[Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos]]'', and [[cartoonist]] and Marvel [[production manager]] [[John Verpoorten]] contributed a Marvel-character version of the [[Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' [[record album]] art. [[Robert Crumb]]'s album cover art for [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]]  was parodied by Herb Trimpe. Later issues had parodies of famous films such as ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' and ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' and features about superhero poetry, superhero carnival and "Rent A Super-Hero", in which children employed their favorite heroes to help with mundane tasks like family plumbing problems. [[Warren Publishing]] editor [[Bill DuBay]] drew and co-wrote one story in his only Marvel appearance. Issue #10 featured solely reprints from earlier issues.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Radio and TV personality [[Paul Gambaccini]] stated he coined the term "Brand Echh" in his letter published in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #7 (Dec. 1963).&lt;ref name=Schelly&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Bill Schelly|last=Schelly| first=Bill | title=Founders of Comic Fandom: Profiles of 90 Publishers, Dealers, Collectors, Writers, Artists and Other Luminaries of the 1950s and 1960s | publisher=McFarland | year=2010|page= 176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar Marvel publications==
In 1988, Marvel published ''[[What The--?!]]'', a four-issue [[miniseries]] (Aug.–Nov. 1988), followed by an additional 22 issues continuing the numbering (July 1989 – Sept. 1993).&lt;ref name=whatthe&gt;[https://www.comics.org/series/3675/ ''What The--?!''] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; One story, for instance, featured "Superbman vs. The Fantastical Four"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/66046/ ''What The--?!'' #2] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; — the same name as in ''Not Brand Echh'' for a parodistic [[Fantastic Four]]. ''Not Brand Echh'' mascot Forbush Man made a cover-featured return appearance in issue #8 (July 1990).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/66051/ ''What The--?!'' #2] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; Two one-shots, ''Wha...Huh?'' in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/250110/ ''Wha...Huh?'' #1] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Marvel: Now What?!'' in 2013&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/series/77207/ ''Marvel: Now What?!'' #1] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; revisited the concept.

The ''[[Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes]]'' (2005) designated the Earth of ''Not Brand Echh'' and ''What The--?!'' as Earth-665.

''Not Brand Echh'' characters made an appearance in Marvel's ''[[Nextwave]]'' series.

==Reprints==
Several stories were reprinted in the three-issue Marvel comic ''Crazy!'' (Feb.–June 1973), not to be confused with Marvel's black-and-white magazine ''[[Crazy Magazine]]''.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the comic was published in a tabloid-like black-and-white format in the early 1980s and renamed ''Marvel Madhouse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id=70979|title=Marvel Madhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Marvel released a collected edition of the series as part of the hardcover [[Marvel Masterworks]] line. Reprinted were ''Not Brand Echh'' (1967) #1-13 and humor backup features from ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] Annual'' #1, ''[[Fantastic Four]] Annual'' #5, ''[[Nick Fury|Sgt. Fury]] Annual'' #4, ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Annual'' #2 and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual'' #5.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1024">'''Reallocation''' is a term in the [[media industry]] used to describe the practice of relocating an unsuccessful series that was originally developed for a [[broadcast network]] onto a [[cable network]] in hopes of gaining the attention and interest of a [[niche audience]] as well as  growing a larger audience.

Reasons for reallocation are not always due to [[Cancellation (television)|cancellation]]. Reallocation is  also used to regain expenses lost due to production fees on under performing content. In some cases reallocation is used in order to promote an unsuccessful series.

The '''ruble''' or '''rouble''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|uː|b|əl}}; {{lang-rus|рубль|p=rublʲ}}) is or was a currency unit of a number of countries in Eastern Europe closely associated with the [[economy of Russia]]. Originally, the ruble was the currency unit of [[Imperial Russia]] and then the [[Soviet Union]] (as the [[Soviet ruble]]), and it is currently the currency unit of [[Russia]] (as the [[Russian ruble]]) and [[Belarus]] (as the [[Belarussian ruble]]). The Russian ruble is also used in the partially recognised states of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]]. In the past, several other countries influenced by Russia and the [[Soviet Union]] had currency units that were also named rubles. One ruble is divided into 100 '''kopeks''' ({{lang-rus|копе́йка|r=kopeyka|p=kɐˈpʲejkə}}).

==Etymology==

===Origins===

According to one version, the word "ruble" is derived from the Russian verb рубить (''rubit''), "to cut, to chop, to hack", as a ruble was considered a cutout piece of a silver [[grivna]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rubles were parts of the [[grivna]] or pieces of silver with notches indicating their weight. Each grivna was divided into four parts; the name "ruble" came from the word "cut" because the silver rod weighing 1 [[grivna]] was split into four parts, which were called rubles.&lt;ref name="Kondrat"&gt;[http://www.rusarch.ru/kondratiev1.htm Кондратьев И. К. Седая старина Москвы. М., 1893.]
In Russian:
Рубли были частями [[:ru:Гривна (денежная и весовая единица Древней Руси)|гривны]] или кусками серебра с зарубками, означавшими их вес. Каждая гривна разделялась на четыре части; название же рубль произошло от слова «рубить», потому что прут серебра в гривну весом разрубался на четыре части, которые и назывались рублями.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Others say the ruble was never part of a grivna but a synonym for it. This is attested in a 13th century Novgorod [[birch bark manuscript]], where both ruble and grivna referred to 204g (6.6 troy ounces) of silver.&lt;ref name=RusMetr&gt;{{ref-ru}} {{cite book|last1=Kamentseva
|first1=E.|last2=Ustyugov|first2=N.|title=Russkaya metrologiya|script-title=Русская метрология|date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casting of these pieces included some sort of cutting (the exact technology is unknown), hence the name from рубить (''rubit'').&lt;ref name=Spas1970&gt;{{ref-ru}} {{cite book|last=Spassky|first=I. G.|title=Russkaya monetnaya sistema|script-title=Русская монетная система|place=Leningrad|date=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Vasmer|Рубль}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another version of the word's origin is that it comes from the Russian noun рубец (''rubets''), the seam that is left around a silver bullions after casting: silver was added to the cast in two steps. Therefore, the word ''ruble'' means "a cast with a seam".&lt;ref name="halatov"&gt;Sergey Khalatov. [http://www.statesymbol.ru/currency/20050421/39595617.html History of Ruble and Kopek] on "Collectors' Portal UUU.RU" {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular theory deriving the word ruble from [[rupee]] is probably not correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fshare%2Fstarling%2Fmorpho&amp;morpho=1&amp;basename=morpho%5Cvasmer%5Cvasmer&amp;first=1&amp;off=&amp;text_word=%D0%A0%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D1%8C&amp;method_word=substring&amp;ic_word=on&amp;text_general=&amp;method_general=substring&amp;ic_general=on&amp;text_origin=&amp;method_origin=substring&amp;ic_origin=on&amp;text_trubachev=&amp;method_trubachev=substring&amp;ic_trubachev=on&amp;text_editorial=&amp;method_editorial=substring&amp;ic_editorial=on&amp;text_pages=&amp;method_pages=substring&amp;ic_pages=on&amp;text_any=&amp;method_any=substring&amp;sort=word&amp;ic_any=on | title=Рубль | author=Vasmer, Max | website=[[Max Vasmer|Vasmer]]  [[Etymological dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruble was the Russian equivalent of the [[mark (money)|mark]], a measurement of weight for silver and gold used in medieval Western Europe. The weight of one ''ruble'' was equal to the weight of one ''grivna''.

In Russian, a folk name for ruble, ''tselkovyj'' (целко́вый, {{IPA-ru|tsɨlˈkovɨj|IPA}}, wholesome), is known, which is a shortening of the целковый рубль ("tselkovyj ruble"), i.e., a wholesome, uncut ruble.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This name persists in the [[Mordvin language|Mordvin]] word for ruble, ''целковой''.

The word ''kopek'', ''kopeck'', ''copeck'', or ''kopeyka'' (in {{lang-ru|link=no|копейка}}, ''kopeyka'') is a diminutive form of the Russian ''kop'yo'' (копьё) — a [[spear]]. The first kopek coins, minted at [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]] from about 1534 onwards, show a horseman with a spear.  From the 1540s onwards the horseman bears a crown, and doubtless the intention was to represent [[Ivan the Terrible]], who was Grand Prince of all Russia until 1547, and Tsar thereafter. Subsequent mintings of the coin, starting in the 18th century, bear instead Saint George striking down a serpent.

Since the monetary reform of 1534, one Russian accounting ruble became equivalent to 100 silver Novgorod [[denga]] coins or smaller 200 Muscovite denga coins or even smaller 400 ''[[polushka]]'' coins. Exactly the former coin with a rider on it soon became colloquially known as ''kopek'' and was the higher coin until the beginning of the 18th century. Ruble coins as such did not exist till Peter the Great, when in 1704 he reformed the old monetary system and ordered mintage of a 28-gramme silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins. Apart from one ruble and one kopek coins other smaller and greater coins existed as well.

===English spelling===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Russian ruble]] --&gt;
[[File:Russian rubles.jpg|thumbnail|Russian rubles – banknotes of 1000 and 5000 rubles.]]
Both the spellings ''ruble'' and ''rouble'' are used in English.  The form ''rouble'' is preferred by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], but the earliest use recorded in English is the now completely obsolete ''robble''. The form ''rouble'' probably derives from the transliteration into French used among the [[Tsarist]] [[aristocracy]]. There are two main usage tendencies: one is for [[North American]] authors to use ''ruble'' and other English speakers to use ''rouble'', while the other is for older sources to use ''rouble'' and more recent ones to use ''ruble''. Neither tendency is absolutely consistent.

The Russian [[plural]]s that may be seen on the actual currency are modified according to [[Russian grammar]]. Numbers 1, 21, 31 etc. (but not 11) are followed by [[nominative]] singular рубль ''rubl′'', копе́йка ''kopéyka''. Numbers 2–4, 22–24, 32–34 etc. (but not 12-14) will be followed by [[genitive]] singular рубля́ ''rublyá'', копе́йки ''kopéyki''. Numbers 5–20, 25–30, 35–40 etc. will be followed by genitive plural рубле́й ''rubléy'', копе́ек ''kopéek''.

===Other languages===
{{See also|Soviet ruble}}
In several languages spoken in Russia and the former Soviet Union, the currency name has no etymological relation with ''ruble''. Especially in [[Turkic languages]] or languages influenced by them, the ruble is often known (also officially) as ''som'' or ''sum'' (meaning ''pure''), or ''manat'' (from Russian ''moneta'', meaning ''coin''). Soviet banknotes had their value printed in the [[Languages of the Soviet Union|languages]] of all [[Soviet republics|15 republics]] of the Soviet Union.

==History==

===Imperial ruble (14th century – 1917)===

[[File:Russian Empire 1912 500 rub Obverse.jpg|thumb|Five hundred rubles featuring [[Peter the Great]] and a [[personification]] of [[Mother Russia]], 1912]]
[[File:Russian Empire-1898-Bill-1-Reverse.jpg|thumb|1898 [[Russian Empire]] one ruble bill, obverse]]
From the 14th to the 17th centuries the ruble was neither a coin nor a currency but rather a unit of weight. The most used currency was a small silver coin called ''denga'' (pl. ''dengi''). There were two variants of the denga minted in [[Veliki Novgorod|Novgorod]] and Moscow. The weight of a denga silver coin was unstable and inflating, but by 1535 one Novgorod denga weighted {{convert|0.68|g|ozt|abbr=off}}, the Moscow denga being a half of the Novgorod denga. Thus one ''account ruble'' consisted of 100 Novgorod or 200 Moscow dengi ({{convert|68|g|ozt|abbr=on}} of silver). As the Novgorod denga bore the image of a rider with a spear ({{lang-ru|копьё, kop’yo}}), it later has become known as ''kopek''. In the 17th century the weight of a kopek coin lowered to {{convert|0.48|g|ozt|abbr=on}}, thus one ruble was equal to {{convert|48|g|ozt|abbr=on}} of silver.&lt;ref name=RusMetr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spas1970/&gt;

In 1654–1655 tsar [[Alexis I]] tried to carry out a monetary reform and ordered to mint silver one ruble coins from imported [[joachimsthaler]]s and new kopek coins from copper (old silver kopeks was left in circulation). Although around 1 million of such rubles was made, its lower weight (28–32 grams) against the nominal ruble (48 g) led to counterfeit, speculation and inflation, and after the [[Copper Riot]] of 1662 the new monetary system was abandoned in favour of the old one.&lt;ref name=RusMetr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spas1970/&gt;

====Russian Empire====

In 1704 [[Peter the Great]] finally reformed the old Russian monetary system, ordering the minting of a {{convert|28|g|oz|abbr=on|adj=on}} silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins, thus making the Russian ruble the world's first decimal currency.&lt;ref name=RusMetr/&gt;

The amount of precious metal in a ruble varied over time. In a 1704 currency reform, [[Peter the Great]] standardized the ruble to 28&amp;nbsp;grams{{clarify|reason=Grams had not been invented. How many of what unit did he actually specify?|date=June 2018}} of silver. While ruble coins were silver, there were higher denominations minted of gold and [[platinum]]. By the end of the 18th century, the ruble was set to 4 [[zolotnik]] 21 dolya (almost exactly equal to 18&amp;nbsp;grams) of pure silver or 27 dolya (almost exactly equal to 1.2&amp;nbsp;grams) of pure gold, with a ratio of 15:1 for the values of the two metals. In 1828, platinum coins were introduced with 1 ruble equal to 77⅔ dolya (3.451&amp;nbsp;grams).

On 17 December 1885, a new standard was adopted which did not change the silver ruble but reduced the gold content to 1.161&amp;nbsp;grams, pegging the gold ruble to the [[French franc]] at a rate of 1 ruble = 4 francs. This rate was revised in 1897 to 1 ruble = 2⅔ francs (0.774&amp;nbsp;grams gold).

The ruble was worth about 0.50 USD in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberussr.com/hcunn/gold-std.html |title=Gold and Silver Standards |publisher=Cyberussr.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=100000&amp;year=1914 |title=Calculate the value of $100000 in 1914 – Inflation on 100000 dollars |publisher=DollarTimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], the [[gold standard]] peg was dropped and the ruble fell in value, suffering from [[hyperinflation]] in the early 1920s. With the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian ruble was replaced by the Soviet ruble. The pre-revolutionary [[Chervonets|Chervonetz]] was temporarily brought back into circulation from 1922–1925.&lt;ref&gt;''La Crise de la Monnaie Anglaise'' (1931), Catiforis S.J.

====Russia's Coins====

[[File:Russia 1771 Sestroretsk Rouble.jpg|thumb|275px|Catherine II Sestroretsk ruble (1771) is made of solid copper with a diameter of {{convert|77|mm|in|frac=100}} and a thickness of {{convert|26|mm|in|frac=100}} with a weight of {{convert|1.022|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It is the largest copper coin ever issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Catherine II.

By the beginning of the 19th century, copper coins were issued for {{frac|4}}, {{frac|2}}, 1, 2 and 5 kopeks, with silver 5, 10, 25 and 50 kopeks and 1 ruble and gold 5 although production of the 10 ruble coin ceased in 1806. Silver 20 kopeks were introduced in 1820, followed by copper 10 kopeks minted between 1830 and 1839, and copper 3 kopeks introduced in 1840. Between 1828 and 1845, platinum 3, 6 and 12 rubles were issued. In 1860, silver 15 kopeks were introduced, due to the use of this denomination (equal to 1 [[Polish złoty|złoty]]) in Poland, whilst, in 1869, gold 3 rubles were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pjsymes.com.au/articles/three.htm |title=Currency of Three |author=Peter Symes |publisher=Pjsymes.com.au |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, a new gold coinage was introduced consisting of 5 and 10 ruble coins. This was followed by another in 1897. In addition to smaller 5 and 10 ruble coins, {{frac|7|1|2}} and 15 ruble coins were issued for a single year, as these were equal in size to the previous 5 and 10 ruble coins. The gold coinage was suspended in 1911, with the other denominations produced until the First World War.

====Constantine ruble====

The [[Constantine ruble]] (Russian: {{lang|ru|константиновский рубль}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|konstantinovsky rubl′}}) is a rare silver coin of the [[Russian Empire]] bearing the profile of [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Constantine]], the brother of emperors [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] and [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Its manufacture was being prepared at the [[Saint Petersburg Mint]] during the brief [[Russian interregnum of 1825|Interregnum of 1825]], but it was never minted in numbers, and never circulated in public. Its existence became known in 1857 in foreign publications.&lt;ref&gt;By 1880 Russian numismatists were well aware of the existence of Constantine rubles, but their first printed description was published only in 1886 – Kalinin, [http://www.arcamax.ru/books/const/kalin01.htm p.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Banknotes====

=====Imperial issues=====
[[File:25 rublej 1769 goda..jpg|thumb|25 Assignation rubles of 1769]]
[[File:Russian Empire-1898-Bill-1-Obverse.jpg|thumb|1898 [[Russian Empire]] one ruble bill, reverse]]

In 1768, during the reign of [[Catherine the Great]], the [[:Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance#Assignation Bank|Assignation Bank]] was instituted to issue the government paper money. It opened in [[Saint Petersburg]] and in Moscow in 1769.

In 1769, [[Assignation ruble]]s were introduced for 25, 50, 75 and 100 rubles, with 5 and 10 rubles added in 1787 and 200 ruble in 1819. The value of the Assignation rubles fell relative to the coins until, in 1839, the relationship was fixed at 1 coin ruble = 3½ assignat rubles. In 1840, the State Commercial Bank issued 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles notes, followed by 50 ruble credit notes of the Custody Treasury and State Loan Bank.

In 1843, the Assignation Bank ceased operations, and ''state credit notes'' (Russian: {{lang|ru|государственные кредитные билеты}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|gosudarstvenniye kreditniye bilety}}) were introduced in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles. These circulated, in various types, until the revolution, with 500 rubles notes added in 1898 and 250 and 1000 rubles notes added in 1917. In 1915, two kinds of small change notes were issued. One, issued by the Treasury, consisted of regular style (if small) notes for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 kopeks. The other consisted of the designs of stamps printed onto card with text and the imperial eagle printed on the reverse. These were in denominations of 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 and 20 kopeks.

=====Provisional Government issues=====
In 1917, the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] issued treasury notes for 20 and 40 rubles. These notes are known as "Kerenski" or "[[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] rubles". The provisional government also had 25 and 1,000 rubles state credit notes printed in the United States but most were not issued.

===Soviet ruble (1917–1992)===
{{main article|Soviet ruble}}

The [[Soviet ruble]] replaced the ruble of the Russian Empire. The Soviet ruble (code: SUR) was the currency of the [[Soviet Union]] since 1917 until the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The Soviet ruble was issued by the [[Gosbank|State Bank of the USSR]]. The Soviet ruble continued to be used in the 15 [[Post-Soviet states]].

The Soviet ruble was used until 1992 in [[Russia]] (replaced by [[Russian ruble]]), [[Ukraine]] (replaced by [[Ukrainian karbovanets]]), [[Estonia]] (replaced by [[Estonian kroon]]), [[Latvia]] (replaced by [[Latvian rublis]]), [[Lithuania]] (replaced by [[Lithuanian talonas]]), and until 1993 in [[Belarus]] (replaced by [[Belarusian ruble]]), [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (replaced by [[Georgian lari]]), [[Armenia]] (replaced by [[Armenian dram]]), [[Kazakhstan]] (replaced by [[Kazakhstani tenge]]), [[Kyrgyzstan]] (replaced by [[Kyrgyzstani som]]), [[Moldova]] (replaced by [[Moldovan cupon]]), [[Turkmenistan]] (replaced by [[Turkmenistan manat]]), [[Uzbekistan]] (replaced by [[Uzbekistani so'm]]), and until 1994 in [[Azerbaijan]] (replaced by [[Azerbaijani manat]]) and until 1995 in [[Tajikistan]] (replaced by [[Tajikistani ruble]]).

An exam guide is also available to prepare for the exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.spe.org/SPE-Petroleum-Engineering-Certification-and-PE-License-Exam-Reference-Guide-P928.aspx|title=SPE Petroleum Engineering Certification and PE License Exam Reference Guide|website=store.spe.org|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course is taught by two university professors and offers 1.6 CEUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://webevents.spe.org/products/spe-certification-and-pe-exam-review|title=SPE Web Events:  SPE Certification and PE Exam Review|website=webevents.spe.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification and professional competency==

Part of SPE's mission is to assist members in furthering their technical and professional competence. Defining required knowledge for different areas of engineering, and offering an opportunity to demonstrate technical knowledge through examination are two of the ways that SPE accomplishes this.  A SPE-certified petroleum professional is competent to provide reserves for oil and gas in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by the [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spe.org/spe-app/spe/career/cert_comp/certification.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-petroleum.org/publications/other.htm World Petroleum Congress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/related_content.html?topic=Society%20of%20Petroleum%20Engineers Dallas Business Journal: Society of Petroleum Engineers related content&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spe.org/spe-site/spe/spe/industry/reserves/Petroleum_Resources_Management_System_2007.pdf Petroleum Resources Management System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petroleum professional certification==
While the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and some other countries have [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineer]] registration programs, many other countries do not. The Society of Petroleum Engineers developed a certification program for petroleum engineers to demonstrate their technical knowledge, the SPE certification program, which requires a thorough knowledge of the principles of petroleum engineering.&lt;ref name="comp"&gt;Society of Petroleum Engineers. [http://www.spe.org/spe-app/spe/career/cert_comp/competency.htm Increase Your Knowledge] (listing of training, certification, and other professional development programs), SPE.org. Retrieved April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements to receive the SPE certification, as listed on the SPE website in April 2013:
* Undergraduate degree in petroleum engineering or related science
* Passing score on the SPE exam to measure level of engineering fundamentals and ability to solve practical engineering problems.
* Demonstration of at least four years of practical engineering experience and training in the industry
* Professional membership in good standing with the Society of Petroleum Engineers&lt;ref name="spe pec"/&gt;

Maintenance of the certification requires completing 16 hours of continued professional development and education, in addition to paying an annual renewal fee (USD$40).&lt;ref name="cert"&gt;Society of Petroleum Engineers. [http://www.spe.org/training/certification.php Petroleum Engineering Certification], SPE.org. Retrieved April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waivers ===
The exam may be waived for those who pass a written competency examination to practice petroleum engineering as a registered, licensed, or professional engineer. Exams administered by Indonesia (IATMI), Alberta, Canada, and all United States are acceptable. University exit exams are not considered valid for this waiver.

==Professional competency matrices==
Beyond basic engineering skills, many disciplines require specialized expertise gained through training and experience. SPE has identified the skills associated with various levels of competency in five primary areas of engineering.

==Guide to professional conduct==
SPE's board has set forth the expectations for professional and ethical behavior by petroleum professionals.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Sama Chakeva''' or '''Sama Chakeba''' is a [[Hindu]] festival, originating from the [[Mithila (region)|Mithila region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is a  festival of brothers and sisters. It is celebrated in November and commences when birds begin their migration from the [[Himalayas]] down towards the plains of India. According to the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', the festival, which includes folk theater and song, celebrates the love between brothers and sisters and is based on a legend recounted in the [[Purana]]s. It tells the story of Sama, a daughter of [[Krishna]] who had been falsely accused of wrongdoing. Her father punished her by turning her into a bird, but the love and sacrifice of her brother Chakeva eventually allowed her to regain human form. The celebration starts from the night of [[Chhath]] puja. This is the 7th day of the month of Kartik. Young, mostly unmarried girls assemble near the ghats of chhath with a basket containing small idols of sama and chakeva, candles, kohl etc. at night. They sing traditional songs, perform some rituals, like making kohl, exchanging baskets. This celebration continues till Kartik Purnima. On the auspicious occasion of Kartik Purnima, girls take a dip in river and the idols of sama and chakeva are immersed in the river.&lt;ref&gt;Bishnu K Jha, (22 November 2012).

==Synopsis==
{{Main article|List of Scarlet Heart episodes}}
Zhang Xiao ([[Cecilia Liu]]), a young woman from the 21st century, suffers a near-fatal accident that sends her back in time to the [[Qing Dynasty]] during the [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s ([[Damian Lau]]) reign. She finds herself trapped in the body of one of her previous incarnations: Ma'ertai Ruoxi, the teenage daughter of a [[Manchu people|Manchu]] general. In this new timeline, she has an elder sister, Ruolan ([[Annie Liu]]), who is a concubine of the Kangxi Emperor's eighth son, [[Yunsi|Yinsi]] ([[Kevin Cheng]]). Ruoxi initially tries to return to the future, but she soon adjusts to life in this era. She meets some of Kangxi's other sons, including the fourth prince [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yinzhen]] ([[Nicky Wu]]), tenth prince [[Yin'e]] (Ye Zuxin) who falls in love with her, and fourteenth prince [[Yunti, Prince Xun|Yinti]] ([[Lin Gengxin]]). She also forges a close friendship with the thirteenth prince, [[Yinxiang, Prince Yi|Yinxiang]] ([[Yuan Hong (actor)|Yuan Hong]]).

Ruoxi attracts the attention of the emperor with rumors of her brashness and bravery, and manages to charm him with her intelligence and wit. Later, at the imperial palace's "beauty draft" (during which concubines and wives are chosen for the princes or the emperor himself), conflicting arrangements are made by Yinsi and his first wife, Gogoro Minghui (Shi Xiaoqun), leading to Ruoxi being drafted into the service of the dowager empress to keep the peace. Ruoxi is given an appointment as a servant to the emperor himself, specifically to prepare and serve tea to him and those he hosts.

During Ruoxi's stay in Yinsi's house, Yinsi falls in love with her. She initially rejects him but eventually returns his feelings, and later agrees to marry him if he gives up competing for the succession to the throne. This is because Ruoxi's knowledge of history makes her aware that Yinsi's ambition will ultimately lead to his death in prison after Yinzhen becomes emperor. However, Yinsi refuses to and thus Ruoxi breaks up with him. Before leaving, Ruoxi warns Yinsi of Yinzhen's plans to usurp the throne and came up with solutions for him to prevent being taken down by Yinzhen.

Ruoxi then started to get closer to Yinzhen, and their interactions changed her unfavorable opinion of him, and she unwittingly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Yinsi and his supporters, acting on Ruoxi's advice, frame Yinzhen for plotting against the crown prince [[Yinreng]] (Zhang Lei). Yinxiang steps forward to take responsibility and is ultimately sentenced to house arrest. After this incident, Yinsi realizes that Ruoxi is now romantically involved with Yinzhen. Yinreng is deposed after his criminal ways are exposed and is imprisoned for life. Kangxi then begins showing preference for Yinti and offers Ruoxi as a concubine to him. However, Ruoxi boldly defies the emperor's order, and as a penalty, she is demoted to the laundry department.

Ruoxi works within the laundry department for a number of years, and is offered some level of protection and special treatment by ways of the princes. Kangxi falls ill during this time, and when Ruoxi is brought back to the emperor's service by Eunuch Wang to prepare pastries and help stimulate Kangxi's appetite, he pardons her and restores her to her former role as his lead tea server.

Kangxi eventually dies of his illness, and with military support from [[Longkodo]] (Zhao Jialin) and [[Nian Gengyao]] (Xing Hanqing), Yinzhen falsely claims that Kangxi named him the successor, effectively staging a coup and taking the throne from Yinti to become the [[Yongzheng Emperor]]. Yinzhen then releases Yinxiang from custody and moves Ruoxi into his quarters, eventually consummating their relationship. He does not, however, marry her, as he wants to be able to live with her and see her every day—wives and concubines have their own estates between which the emperor must divide his time. Ruoxi is pleased enough with this arrangement, as she has always been reticent about marriage and enjoys seeing Yinzhen daily as well. Ruoxi's happiness, however, is marred by Yinzhen's paranoia and his ruthless persecution of Yinsi and his followers. She is often caught between the rivaling factions of Yinzhen and Yinsi.

When Gogoro Minghui tells Ruoxi that Yinsi acted against Yinzhen years ago because of her advice based on the knowledge of the future, she is shocked, and her despair causes her to miscarry Yinzhen's child and is unable to conceive again. Enraged, Yinzhen blames Yinsi and his wife, issuing an edict forcing them to divorce, which leads her to commit suicide. Ruoxi fears Yinzhen's punitive actions against his brothers and confesses the truth to him and Yinxiang. Yinzhen is stunned when he understands why Yinsi plotted against him and starts treating Ruoxi coldly. Ruoxi is unable to withstand the mental stress and asks Yinti to help her leave the palace. Yinsi knows that Yinzhen will not allow Ruoxi to leave and decides to intervene. He discloses details of his past romance with Ruoxi, and an angered Yinzhen eventually agrees to let Ruoxi and Yinti leave the [[Forbidden City]].

Despite Yinti's excellent care, Ruoxi's emotional anguish deeply affects her health, and she begs him to send a letter to Yinzhen, requesting to see the emperor one last time before she dies. However, a misunderstanding between Yinzhen and Yinti causes the letter to be thrown aside unread. Ruoxi struggles to stay alive, but after three days, she concludes that Yinzhen's absence confirms that his love for her has ended, and she dies. When news of Ruoxi's death reaches Yinzhen, he rushes to Yinti's house, regretting his actions after learning that Ruoxi still loved him.

In the later years, Yinsi and Yintang (Han Dong) were imprisoned as Yinzhen blames them for everything that happened. Yinxiang went to visit them in prison and hands them poison, which was Ruoxi's request to him before she left the palace. Both Princes commit suicide and end their suffering. Yinxiang dies a few years later, followed shortly by Yinzhen himself, whose 12-year reign as Emperor was the shortest in Qing history. Yinti lives on but does not find another wife. Only Yin'e has a happy ending with his wife ([[Liu Yuxin]]) that he grew to love, watching [[Qianlong Emperor]] ascend the throne.

Back in 2011, Zhang Xiao regains consciousness in a hospital and is informed that she had been in a coma for weeks. She wonders if her experiences in the past were real or imaginary. After recovering, Zhang researches the Qing Dynasty era, only to find that history remains on its proper course, and there are no records on Ma'ertai Ruoxi.  However, she later visits a museum where she recognizes some Qing Dynasty-era artifacts and sees a woman in a Kangxi Emperor portrait that resembles her. Meanwhile, a man who bears a striking resemblance to Yinzhen visits the exhibition and encounters Zhang Xiao but does not recognize her. The show ends with a cliffhanger of the man walking away as Zhang Xiao's tears start to fall.

==Deviations from the novel==
[[File:Scarlet Heart's ending.jpg|200px|thumb|Zhang Xiao returns to the 21st century.]]
The show's producers have announced that the series will remain mostly faithful to ''[[Bu Bu Jing Xin]]'', the novel by Tong Hua on which it is based. However, there are some differences:

*In the novel's beginning, though in the television series Zhang Xiao remains a 25-year-old white-collar worker — her alter ego, Ma'ertai Ruoxi, was 13 years old, not 16. Another difference was that Zhang supposedly from the year 2005, not 2011.
*In the novel, Ruoxi is unable to return to her own time and ultimately succumbs to her illness, while [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yinzhen]] dies ten years later amid hopes of reuniting with Ruoxi after death. The story ends with Yinzhen's son Hongli's (whom he fathered with [[Empress Xiaoshengxian|Lady Niohuru]]) ascension to the throne as the [[Qianlong Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://book.kanunu.org/files/yuanchuang/201102/1416.html |script-title=zh:步步驚心(上、下) |accessdate= 2011-02-11 |work=努努書坊 |language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the television series, after Ruoxi and Yinzhen's deaths, Ruoxi's soul returns to her incarnation in the 21st century. Whilst struggling to get over the trauma of her experiences of time travel, she encounters a man who resembles Yinzhen and is possibly a present-day incarnation of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2011-08-16/09433387661.shtml|title=《步步惊心》预告片热播 男女主角都在哭|language=zh|work= Sina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man does not recognize her, and Zhang Xiao remains in guilt over everything that happened when she was Ma'ertai Ruoxi. She chooses not say anything and tearfully watches the man leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com.cn/h/2011/1001/c25408-3309510645.html |title=《步步惊心》悲剧收官 网友"哭"声一片 |work=People's Daily |date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scenic route''', '''tourist road''', '''tourist route''', '''tourist drive''', '''holiday route''', '''theme route''', or '''scenic byway''' is a specially designated road or waterway that travels through an area of natural or cultural beauty. The designation is usually determined by a governmental body, such as a [[Department of Transportation]] or a [[Ministry of Transport]].

==Tourist highway==

A '''tourist highway''' or '''holiday route''' is a road which is [[marketing|marketed]] as particularly suited for [[tourist]]s. Tourist highways may be formed when existing roads are promoted with [[traffic sign]]s and [[advertising]] material. Some tourist highways such as the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] are built especially for tourism purposes.  Others may be roadways enjoyed by local citizens in areas of unique or exceptional natural beauty.  Still others, such as the [[Lincoln Highway in Illinois]] are former main roads, only designated as "scenic" after most traffic bypasses them.  In the United States this type of roadway is commonly termed a '''scenic highway'''. In Europe and other countries around the world they are often marked with brown [[tourist sign]]s with the individual route symbol or name, or both.

[[Image:Route66 sign.jpg|thumb|200px|Modern-day sign in [[New Mexico]], along a section of Route 66 named a [[National Scenic Byway]]]]

==United States==
In the United States, a ''scenic route'' may also refer to a type of [[special route]] of the [[U.S. highway]] system that travels through a particularly beautiful area. These special routes, which boast "Scenic" banners are typically longer than the "parent route". There is only one route in the country that remains with the official scenic designation: [[U.S. Route 40 Scenic]].

[[Scenic byways in the United States]], also include state,  [[National Scenic Byway]], [[National Forest Scenic Byways]] and [[Bureau of Land Management Back Country Byways]] programs which designate roads or routes as scenic byways due to some unique characteristics.

[[National Parkway]]s are scenic roads in the [[National Park System]] built for recreational driving through scenic or historic areas.  Unlike most scenic routes, National Parkways are built with a buffer of park land along both sides of the roadway.  They also may have large satellite parks or recreation areas built periodically along their length.

Most [[National Historic Trail]]s are commemorative motor routes which follow historic pathways.

==Theme routes==

'''Theme Routes''' are special theme-based tours, aimed at providing a visitor or tourist with a better insight on that theme. Being popular in Europe, they can cover anything from an individual city, a wine growing region, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] tulip fields, [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Mountains, to [[Norway|Norwegian]] Fjords. Subjects can be architectural, historical, or cultural.

Examples of theme routes: &lt;!-- only ones found on Wikipedia so far --&gt;

'''''The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange''''' &lt;!-- Do not add "or just simply The Annoying Orange", as it's not an official title. --&gt; is an American comedy television series based on the characters from the popular [[web series]] ''[[The Annoying Orange]]'', created by [[Dane Boedigheimer]] and Spencer Grove, which is made for the television by Boedigheimer himself with Tom Sheppard for [[Cartoon Network]]. It was produced by [[Daneboe]]'s company Annoying Orange, Inc., alongside management company [[Collective Digital Studio|The Collective]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2011/04/15/annoying-orange-tv/|title=Popular YouTube Series Annoying Orange Moves to TV|author=Brenna Ehrlich|publisher=[[Mashable]]|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the studios 14th Hour Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://provideocoalition.com/adobe/story/kappa-studios-switches-to-adobe-workflow-to-create-annoying-orange|title=Kappa Studios switches to Adobe workflow to create Cartoon Network's Annoying Orange series|author=Meagan Keane|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preview aired on May 28, 2012,&lt;ref name = "The Surprising Rise of 'Annoying Orange' How The Collective brings Internet stars to TV By D.M. Levine "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/surprising-rise-annoying-orange-137776|title=The Surprising Rise of 'Annoying Orange'|publisher=[[Adweek]]|date=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the official premiere was on June 11, 2012. 

The show ended on March 17, 2014 with two seasons and sixty episodes, with a total of thirty episodes per season. On December 5, 2014, Boedigheimer confirmed publicly the cancellation of the series on Daneboe Exposed #22.

On April 24, 2015, Boedigheimer claimed that one big cause of the series cancellation was the shutdown of his studio, due to Collective Digital Studio closing their film and television division.

==Plot==
The show follows the lives of Orange and friends: Pear, Passion Fruit, Midget Apple, Marshmallow, Apple, Grandpa Lemon, and the (sometimes) [[antagonist]]ic Grapefruit. The show diverges from the YouTube series in that the Fruit Gang live on a Fruit Stand in a supermarket called ''Daneboe's'' (a reference to the creator Dane Boedigheimer) rather than in Dane Boedigheimer's Kitchen.

A reoccurring character from the [[Annoying Orange]] [[YouTube]] series called Nerville (played by [[internet personality]] [[Toby Turner]]) now runs the supermarket (mainly as the Janitor), and is the only human who can talk to the fruit (though other people dismiss it as insanity). Another divergence from the Web Series is that there is the same violence, and acts of Knife that kill the characters and Misadventures of the fruit as they face evil zombie vegetables, alien broccoli, various movies and TV Shows parodies and other weird characters as well.

}}

===Main===
* [[Annoying Orange (character)|Orange]] (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) – The main protagonist of the series. He is annoying, obnoxious, and partial to terrible puns. But deep down, Orange always means well, even though his boredom often drags his friends into ridiculous adventures. The series shows another side of Orange outside of his annoying YouTube self, and casts him as the role of a wacky hero (who is also annoying).
* Pear (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) – Pear is Orange's best friend, and he often stands as the sole voice of reason in the fruit stand. Pear's attempts to talk Orange out of his wilder ideas never work. The episode "Orange Belt" reveals he is a master of Carrot-te ( parody of karate).
* Passion Fruit (voiced by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]]) – Often referred to as "Passion", she is adorable, pragmatic and smart. She has a crush on Orange, which is no secret, except to Orange, who sometimes remains completely oblivious (which is ironic, considering .that he has a crush on her in the episodes uploaded to the YouTube channel)
* Midget Apple (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) – An adorable, small apple with a scrappy demeanor. He prefers to be called ''Little Apple'', and a running gag is that he will correct anyone who calls him ''Midget Apple''. He is constantly teased by Orange, who most frequently calls him Midget Apple and teases him about his size. However Orange once reveals that this is because he finds Midget Apple so cute that he gets distracted and never hears his requests at being called ''Little Apple''. He does not get along with Apple (despite being of the same species), as he thinks Apple's cowardly demeanor puts shame on all apples.
* Marshmallow (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) – The sole non-fruit in the group, Marshmallow is  cute, eternally upbeat, and cheerful. The episode "Marshmalia" indicates her name is Winky. Marshmallow's temper usually appears non-existent, but in the very rare instances it has appeared, it results in large explosions leading directly to gruesome injuries being inflicted on everyone present.
* Grapefruit (voiced by [[YouTube|Robert Jennings]]) – Is a hulking man-boy who thinks of himself as ''large and in charge''. He believes he is in a rivalry with Orange for Passion Fruit's affection, but she has no interest in him. He and Orange do not get along, with Orange always insulting him about his weight, whilst he is under the impression that he is strong.
* Apple (voiced by [[Harland Williams]]) – Apple is an unlikable, pessimistic criticizer who rarely joins Orange's adventures for fear he will get bruised, though he usually ends up even worse off just by staying behind. He is often bullied by Orange. He is seen getting killed more than any other character, but he seems to be revived in every episode he appears in, similar to the Kenny gag in [[South Park (TV series)|South Park]]. He is a character made specifically for this series, although the episode, ''My Name Is Orange'' implies he is the same apple as the one which got killed in the original Annoying Orange YouTube Episode (although that Apple was played by Dane Boedigheimer and had a completely different voice). He had red eyes in the first season but they were changed to white in the second.
* Grandpa Lemon (voiced by Kevin Brueck) – Grandpa Lemon is the befuddled, elder statesman of the fruit stand. He thinks he is everybody's grandpa, and has a habit of falling asleep mid-sentence. Orange constantly makes fun of his age to his chagrin. It is revealed in ''Founding Fruits'' that he is Benjamin Frank-lemon (a lemon version of the renowned [[Benjamin Franklin|Founding Father]]) and that he is over 200 years old.
* Nerville (played by [[Toby Turner]]) – Nerville is an employee at Daneboes Fruit Store, where he lives and sleeps (on a shelf), and is the only human who can talk to the fruit gang, though other humans view it as insanity. He views the fruits as his best (and only) friends and would never eat them, because otherwise he would be lonely (but has no qualms about selling them for other people to eat). He appears to lack a functioning brain, as there is a great big void in the space it should occupy.

===Supporting===
* Coconut (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) – Good-natured, but dim and hard-headed, Coconut is an occasional member of the Fruit Gang where he serves as the muscle. They tolerate his moronic tendencies because he is lovable.
* Peach (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) – Another friend of the Fruit Gang, she is a peach who normally makes cameos. She may have a crush on Orange. She is friends with Passion Fruit, Orange and Onion and her enemies are Coconut, Grapefruit and Apple.
* Broccoli Alien Overlord (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) – An evil alien broccoli, who speaks with an English accent, and serves as the main antagonist of the series. He is bent on enslaving Earth and becoming superior to fruit, though later his goals seem to be focused solely on destroying the Fruit Cart. He is the nemesis of Orange and the Fruit Gang, having attempted to conquer Earth on many occasions, but is foiled by Orange and his friends on every occasion. In later appearances, it reaches the point where the Fruit Gang get fed-up with seeing him rather than fearing him like they initially did.
* Guava (voiced by Tom Kenny) is a member of the Fruit Gang who got women's legs in a dream world, and has them to this day.
* Ginger (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) – An organic ginger root who has a crush on Pear.
* Elderly Banana (voiced by Tom Sheppard) is a very old and ripe banana that talks about scary stuff when he is with the Fruit Gang.
* Big Rock Candy Monster (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) – A monster made entirely of rock candy, and a native of the planet Marshmalia. Upset because marshmallows took their place in desserts, he swore revenge against them. After his initial appearance he becomes a reoccurring character. He also appears in the [[Gangnam Style]], Orange Nya Nya Style video on [[The Annoying Orange|Orange's]] [[YouTube]] Channel.

'''''The Perpetual Orgy: Flaubert and Madame Bovary''''' ({{Lang-es|La orgía perpetua. Flaubert y Madame Bovary}}, 1975) is a book-length essay by the [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]]–winning Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] which examines [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert's]] ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' as the first [[modern novel]]. The first part of the book has an autobiographical tone; Vargas Llosa then goes on to examine the structure and meaning of ''Madame Bovary'' as well as its role in the development of the modern novel. First published in Spanish in 1975, the book was translated into English in 1986 by [[Helen Lane]].&lt;ref name = "jgnyt"&gt;{{cite news

|quote= Originally published in Spanish in 1975, this has now been translated into English under a title taken from one of Flaubert's letters, in which he wrote that the only way to make existence bearable was ''to lose oneself in literature as in a perpetual orgy''.

According to [[Julian Barnes]]:&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite news

|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/books/once-in-love-with-emma.html
|quote= It is important to take Vargas Llosa's opening declaration of love seriously, not as a mere critical conceit, a smart way into the book for him.
|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]
|date= 1986-12-21
|accessdate=2011-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Most of ''The Perpetual Orgy'', at last available in Helen Lane's elegant translation, is a discussion of the genesis, execution, structure and technique of ''Madame Bovary''. It is the best single account of the novel I know. Flaubertistes will instantly set it alongside Francis Steegmuller's classic ''Flaubert and Madame Bovary''; students of literature who want to know how a novel works could not be better advised than to listen to Mr. Vargas Llosa hunched over this masterpiece like some vintage car freak over the engine of a Lagonda.}}

John Gross, also reviewing the Helen Lane translation for ''[[The New York Times]]'', praised the book's treatment of Flaubert's technical mastery:&lt;ref name = "jgnyt"/&gt;

{{quote|He [Vargas Llosa] is excellent, however, on more fundamental matters, on the handling of time in the novel (he differentiates four types of Flaubertian time—singular, circular, immobile and imaginary) and on the constantly shifting narrative viewpoint. These may sound like dry technical issues, but Mr. Vargas Llosa brings them to life, and makes it clear how central they are if you want to understand the suppleness and subtlety that Flaubert achieved.}}

'''''The Story of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the Greater Philosophers''''' is a 1926 book by [[Will Durant]], in which he profiles several prominent [[Western philosophy|Western philosophers]] and their ideas, beginning with [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] and on through [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].  Durant attempts to show the interconnection of their ideas and how one [[philosophy|philosopher's]] ideas informed the next.

There are nine chapters each focused on one philosopher, and two more chapters each containing briefer profiles of three early 20th century philosophers.

The book was published in 1926, with a revised second edition released in 1933. The work was preceded by a number of pamphlets in the [[Little Blue Books]] series of inexpensive worker education pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070310234115/http://ktwu.wuacc.edu/journeys/scripts/412b.html "Little Blue Books"]&lt;/ref&gt; They proved so popular they were assembled into a single book and published in hardcover form by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1926.

Philosophers profiled are, in order: [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Baruch Spinoza]] (with a section on [[Descartes]]), [[Voltaire]] (with a section on [[Rousseau]]), [[Immanuel Kant]] (with a section on [[Hegel]]), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

The final two chapters are devoted to European and then American philosophers. [[Henri Bergson]], [[Benedetto Croce]], and [[Bertrand Russell]] are covered in the tenth, and [[George Santayana]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]] are covered in the eleventh.

In a foreword to the readers in the second edition of the book, Durant expresses his acknowledgement for the criticism that the book received as to how it does not include philosophers from the Asian continent, most notably [[Confucius]], Buddha and [[Adi Shankara]].

'''''The Temptation of St. Anthony''''' is a painting of disputed authorship, attributed to either [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or a follower. It is currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]] in Madrid.

==History==
The work was in the [[El Escorial|Escorial]] monastery, although it was not mentioned in inventories; later it was moved to the Prado. It is likely that the work was one of the ''Temptations'' sent to the monastery by [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1574. This painting has a more serene atmosphere than the [[triptych]] with the same theme now in the [[National Museum of Ancient Art|Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga]] of [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name="Varallo"&gt;{{cite book |first=Franca |last=Varallo |title=Bosch |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all Bosch's works, it cannot be dated with precision, although it is likely from his late production (1500–1516).&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt;

In 2016, the Bosch Research and Conservation project, after five years of researching all known Bosch paintings, announced that they had significant doubts about the attribution of the work to Bosch, instead attributing it to a follower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/arts/design/prado-museum-rescinds-loan-of-downgraded-hieronymus-bosch-works.html|title = Prado Museum Rescinds Loan of Downgraded Hieronymus Bosch Works|last = Siegal|first = Nina|date = 2016-02-16|newspaper = The New York Times|issn = 0362-4331|access-date = 2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:J. Bosch Prado Temptation of St Anthony (detail).jpg|thumb|240px|left|Detail]]
[[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony the Abbot]] is portrayed in meditation, in a sunny landscape near the trunk of a dry tree. St. Anthony is a recurrent figure in Bosch's work, with up to 15 paintings of this subject, all inspired by legends told in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and in his ''Life'' by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. He is represented in a setting of solitude and temptation that the saint experienced over twenty years. Although this picture is significantly different from other works by Bosch of St. Anthony, such as the triptych painting of the same name, customary features of the abbot include his dark brown habit with the Greek letter "[[tau]]" and a pig by his side.&lt;ref name="Museodelprado"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Temptation of Saint Anthony |accessdate=2015-06-14 |publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado |location=Madrid, Spain |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-temptation-of-saint-anthony/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kren |first1=Emil |last2=Marx |first2=Daniel |url=http://www.wga.hu/html/b/bosch/5panels/07anthon.html |title=The Temptation of St Anthony |website=The Web Gallery of Art |accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the earlier paintings with St. Anthony, this version of the temptation of St. Anthony finds the abbot calmer from his meditative spirit. His surroundings are peaceful and evoke a sense of calm. The pig lies next to him like a pet. Once demons, the creatures of temptation are now more like goblins and do not disturb the peaceful feeling of the painting.

This painting, originally framed with a semi-circular arch, was one of Bosch's later works, from sometime after 1490. [[Philip II of Spain]] sent it to the Monastery of El Escorial near Madrid. From there the painting came to the Museo del Prado as part of the Royal Collection.&lt;ref name="Museodelprado" /&gt;

The '''Torslunda plates''' are four cast bronze dies found in the Torslunda parish on the Swedish island [[Öland]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968|p=233}} They display figures in [[relief]],{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968|p=234}} representing what are presumed to be traditional scenes from [[Germanic mythology]].{{sfn|Beck|1968|pp=237–238}} The plates were designed for production rather than display; by placing thin sheets of foil against the scenes and hammering or otherwise applying pressure from the back, identical images could be quickly mass-produced.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968|p=233}} The resulting ''pressblech'' foils would be used to decorate rich helmets of the sort found at [[Vendel]], [[Valsgärde]], and [[Sutton Hoo helmet|Sutton Hoo]]. Two of the plates may have been made as casts of existing ''pressblech'' foils.

The plates were discovered in a [[cairn]] in early 1870, and are in the collection of the [[Swedish History Museum|Statens Historiska Museum]].{{sfn|Hagberg|1976|pp=323–324}} They are considered "famous",{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968|p=233}} for they contain full scenes from mythology, unlike the fragmentary and degraded scraps of ''pressblech'' foils that are known. The plates have been exhibited internationally, including from 13 May to 26 June 1966, when they were part of the exhibition ''Swedish Gold'' at the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968|p=235}}{{sfn|Bowring|2012|p=19}} The plates have been dated to the [[Vendel Period]] of the [[6th century|6th]] and [[7th century|7th centuries]].{{sfn|Liberman|2016|p=133}}

== Design ==
Each plate contains a different mythological design, traditionally labeled, displayed here counterclockwise from the bottom right A to D, as "man between bears", "man with axe holding roped animal", "walking warriors carrying spears" and "dancing man with horned head-dress and man with spear wearing wolfskin".{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968|p=233}}{{sfn|Axboe|1987|p=13}} The last example is particularly well known for its missing right eye, shown by a laser scanner to have been struck out, likely from the original used to make the [[Molding (process)|mould]].{{sfn|Arrhenius|Freij|1992|p=76}} This recalls the one-eyed Norse god [[Odin]], said to have given an eye to be allowed to drink from a well whose waters contained wisdom and intelligence,{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=532}} and suggests that the figure on the plate is him.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Freij|1992|p=76}} The figures have also been interpreted as representing [[berserker]] warriors.{{sfn|Liberman|2016|p=133}}

The '''UNESCO Albert Einstein Medal''' is awarded to outstanding scientific personalities who made a great contribution to science and international scientific cooperation. The medal was established by [[UNESCO]] to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Albert Einstein in 1979. The medal is awarded in gold, silver and bronze.

== Description ==
The medal was designed by the French engraver [[Max Leognany|Max Léognany]]. The medal's [[obverse]] features a portrait of Albert Einstein in his later years. On the reverse, a silhouette of Einstein’s head forms the backdrop for three of the mathematical equations that sum up his essential contributions to physics. First, his most famous equation - ''[[Mass–energy equivalence|E = mc²]]''. The second equation represents Einstein's research into the [[photoelectric effect]], for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1921, ''hν = P + 1/2 mv²''. The third is related to his work on the [[general theory of relativity]], ''R&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/2 g&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;R =  κT&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''. Below these is an autograph of a scientist.
Medal executed in gold, silver and bronze.

Technological innovation has brought more computing to schools, and with it a need to protect students from inappropriate content across the web, while also allowing students to use content-rich educational sites that can enhance the learning experience.&lt;ref name=edweek&gt;[http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/technology-in-education/ "Technology in Education"], [http://www.edweek.org/ew/index.html/ http://www.edweek.org/ew/index.html], 1 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply blocking off large portions of the Internet, many schools are utilizing customizable web filtering systems that allow them greater control over which sites are allowed and which are blocked. The [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA) requires that U.S. schools have appropriate measures in place to protect students from obscene or harmful online content in order to be eligible for discounts on internet access or internal connections through the Schools and Libraries Program of the [[Universal Service Fund]], commonly known as the [[E-Rate|E-Rate program]].&lt;ref name=CIPA&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act "Children's Internet Protection Act"], [http://www.fcc.gov/ http://www.fcc.gov], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of commercially available free and paid services that allow schools to meet CIPA requirements and receive the discount.

==Types of Filtering==

The FCC and CIPA do not specify how the filtering needs to be done, so most schools are using a combination of DNS, Browser and Firewall-based filtering.

=== DNS Filtering ===

The DNS filtering happens at the domain resolution layer of the Internet and does not allow the IP address of an obscene or harmful website to be discovered. There are multiple paid products that perform such work, but many schools are leveraging free solutions to filter non-safe sites.

===  Browser Filtering ===

Some Browser extensions allow parental control to be enabled to restrict non desirable websites categories. For CIPA, those categories include any website with adult-only content.

=== Firewall-based Filtering ===

Firewall-based filtering can be done at the IP layer or using Web proxies to intercept and filter HTTP and HTTPS requests to websites that are not kid safe. This type of solution is difficult to implement as much of the web is moving to HTTPS, so it does not have a high efficiency.
