'''Abortion in Iran''' has been the subject of internal controversy for many years. Iran's abortion policy has been notoriously quick to change in accordance with changes in the regime; most significantly, the more modern policies developed by the government of [[Reza Shah]] under his family planning programs and moves towards more Western social policy were quickly deposed by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] after he took power from the deposed shah in the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979.

Abortion was first legalized in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliz Sanasarian]], ''The Women's Rights Movements in Iran'', Praeger, New York: 1982, {{ISBN|0-03-059632-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, the [[Majlis of Iran|Iranian Parliament]] approved a new bill easing the conditions by also allowing abortion in certain cases when the fetus shows signs of handicap,&lt;ref name=BBC_2005-04-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LifeSiteNews_2005-05-09&gt;"[http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2005/may/05050909.html Iran Rejects Easing of Abortion Law]." (May 9, 2005). LifeSiteNews.com. Retrieved May 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=14225 Iran's Parliament eases abortion law]." (April 13, 2005).''The Daily Star.'' Retrieved May 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Council of Guardians]] accepted the bill in 15/June/2005.&lt;ref name=LifeSiteNews_2005-05-09/&gt;
Abortion is currently legal in cases where the mother's life is in danger, and also in cases of fetal abnormalities that makes it not viable after birth (such as [[anencephaly]]) or produce difficulties for mother to take care of it after birth, such as major thalassemia or bilateral polycystic kidney disease. There is no need for a consent from the father and request and consent of mother with approval of three specialist physicians and final acceptance by legal medicine center suffices. Legal abortion is allowed only before 19th week of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=BBC_2005-04-12&gt;Harrison, Frances. (April 12, 2005). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4436445.stm Iran liberalises laws on abortion]." BBC News. Retrieved May 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the controversy has historically stemmed from Iran's status as a [[theocracy]] as it was established after the 1979 revolution; many policies, including those concerning social topics, are based on [[sharia law]] as interpreted from the [[Qur'an]] through the nation's [[Shi'a]] legal philosophy. While abortion is not actually referenced in the Qur'an, [[infanticide]] is specifically condemned, and this has been used as an argument to keep abortion illegal in most or all cases in which it might be sought. The sections of the Qur'an that detail the importance of health for women have been used to combat this argument,&lt;ref name=Mehryar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mehryar|first=Amir|author2=Shirin Ahmad-Nia|author3=Shahlah Kazemipour|title=Reproductive Health in Iran: Pragmatic Achievements, Unmet Needs, and Ethical Challenges in a Theocratic System|journal=Studies in Family Planning|year=2007|volume=38|issue=4|pages=352–361|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2007.00146.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been moderately successful at changing the reactionary legislation against abortion enacted after 1979. Nowadays, most Islamic legal schools of thought hold that the [[ensoulment]] of a fetus takes place four months after conception, which has extended the discussion of abortion in many nations and communities that base their judicial codes off of [[Islamic law]]; in Iran, a consensus has recently developed that abortion is legitimate if it is before this four-month mark.&lt;ref name=Aramesh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aramesh|first=Kiarash|title=A Closer Look At The Abortion Debate in Iran|journal=American Journal of Bioethics|year=2009|volume=9|issue=8|pages=57–58|doi=10.1080/15265160902939966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing for the legality or partial legality of abortion has the potential to be successful in Iran only if it is through religious discourse. All religious ruling in Iran has its final approval or veto assigned by the [[Guardian Council]], a reviewing and regulatory body that has the ability to support or strike down all policies of Iran.&lt;ref name=Ballantyne&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ballantyne|first=Angela|author2=Ainsley Newson|author3=Florencia Luna|author4=Richard Ashcroft|title=Prenatal Diagnosis and Abortion for Congenital Abnormalities: Is It Ethical to Provide One Without the Other?|journal=The American Journal of Bioethics|year=2009|volume=9|issue=8|pages=48–56|doi=10.1080/15265160902984996|url=https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/12651/1/Prenatal-diagnosis-and-abortion-PP-2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Pre-Revolution===
There is a long history of abortion in Iran. In [[medieval Iran]], it was not shocking to have plant-based agents of abortion and their relative effectiveness listed in physicians' texts; other means of abortion were also described with warnings and instructions for treatment of the woman after the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sa'diyya|last=Shaikh|chapter=Family Planning, Contraception, and Abortion in Islam: Undertaking ''Khilafa''|editor=Daniel C. Maguire|title=Sacred Rights: The Case for Contraception and Abortion in World Religions|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|year=2003|pages=107|isbn=0-19-516001-0|oclc=50080419}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dissemination and translation of different medical texts to and from China, India, Greece, and Persia led to attempts to develop extensive lists of all medical practices, including abortion, and the practice is described in detail in texts from many different regions. One text, written by physician and jurist Hakim Esmail Jorjani (1042-1137 AD), gives instruction for the appropriate use of natural [[abortifacients]], with the caveat that these instructions are meant only for "a very young mother who fears she may die...or when there is disease in the uterus". &lt;ref name="Hakin Esmail Jorjani"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hosseini|first=Seyed|author2=Farid Alakbarli|author3=Kamyar Ghabili|author4=Mohammadali Shoja|title=Hakin Esmail Jorjani (1042-1137 AD): Persian Physician and Jurist|journal=Archives of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|year=2011|volume=248|issue=3|pages=647–650}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, abortion in Persia (and then Iran) was a legal gray area, which may explain why it was not uncommon to describe the correct procedure. Natural abortifacients continued to be used for centuries in Iran, and national law said little about the practice itself until European colonial and imperial intervention in the area.&lt;ref name="LimTan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim Tan|first=Michael|title=Fetal Discourses and the Politics of the Womb|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|year=2004|volume=12|issue=24|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, up until the last years of the shah's regime, Iranian policy on abortion was partially based on parts of [[Islamic law]] and parts of law from the [[French colonial empire]], which had carried influence in the region for some time.&lt;ref name=Hessini&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hessini|first=Leila|title=Abortion and Islam: Policies and Practice in the Middle East and North Africa|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|year=2007|volume=15|issue=29|pages=75–84|doi=10.1016/s0968-8080(06)29279-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate pre-revolutionary period was full of stops and starts in terms of [[social policy]] and [[family planning in Iran]], as the regime of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fell in and out of favor with Iranians in quick fluctuation, eventually collapsing in the 1979 revolution. The pointed nationalism of the shah's government in the early 1960s made for a generally [[pronatal]] policy, as the [[White Revolution]] began to reform social and economic law; families were encouraged to have children, and the country was set to expand until the shah began a national family planning program in 1967, when the country's extreme population growth made officials worry about resources diminishing too quickly.&lt;ref name=Mirazaie&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirazaie|first=Mohammad|title=Swings in Fertility Limitation in Iran|journal=University of Tehran Journal of Social Science|year=2004|volume=11|issue=22|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion became legal at that time under a set of circumstances and restrictions; in fact, a law passed in 1977 even allowed abortion on request.&lt;ref name=Hessini /&gt; A law a year earlier "broadened access and granted an official license" for abortions to be performed in medical facilities such as clinics and hospitals. Abortions were legal so long as the pregnancy had not exceeded twelve weeks, the ensoulment period - or, if it had, so long as the mother's life was endangered specifically by carrying the child to term.&lt;ref name="ErfaniMQ"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erfani|first=Amir|author2=Kevin McQuillan|title=Rates of Induced Abortion in Iran: The Roles of Contraceptive Use and Religiosity|journal=Studies in Family Planning|year=2008|volume=39|issue=2|pages=111–122|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2008.00158.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversation about abortion had begun even before the shah's family planning program in 1967, however; a new global interest in reproductive health and progress in contraception and sexual health matters led a [[gynecologist]] in Iran to receive a fatwa from Ayatollah Mahallati of [[Shiraz]] that approved of, and even encouraged, contraception with the aim of reducing unwanted pregnancies among Iranian families.&lt;ref name=Mehryar /&gt; One of the reasons the legality of abortion was debated in such open air at this time was that the number of women who had abortion declined in Iran in the 1960s due to increased use of contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Fendall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fendall|first=N.R.E.|title=A Comparison of Family Planning Programs in Iran and Turkey|journal=HSMHA Health Reports|year=1971|volume=86|issue=11|pages=1011–1024|doi=10.2307/4594372|pmc=1937193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Revolution===
After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iranian public policy in general began to go in a more conservative direction. Iran joined a small list of nations including [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Sudan]] to use Islamic law in every possible question of [[jurisprudence]]—a trait that still characterizes Iran today. 

The 1991 law of Islamic Penalties stated that though abortion was still legally prohibited, it could be allowed to save the life of the mother.&lt;ref name=Hessini /&gt; This law stands today as a background for further discourse on legalizing abortion in Iran. The legal medicine organization that had the ability to approve of the abortion of a fetus suffering from a specified list of problems was a bureaucratic system that made actual approval hard to obtain. Nearly half of the applicants in the 1999-2000 year were not accepted.&lt;ref name=ErfaniMQ /&gt; Abortion is still ''haram'', or forbidden, according to both Islamic law and to post-revolutionary Iranian law, and the punishments for providing or receiving an illegal abortion can be strict. Under current law, physicians can be sentenced to months of imprisonment, and women who get abortions before ensoulment are at the least fined blood money.&lt;ref name=LimTan /&gt; In other cases, for example if the abortion takes place after ensoulment, the punishments are more severe: both woman and physician can be sentenced to up to ten years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Mehryar /&gt; This is because of the fact that after much debate over the possible legality of abortion in general, the 16-week limit (when ensoulment is believed to happen) was determined by all involved in that policymaking as the last possible time to have a legal abortion for any reason.&lt;ref name=Ballantyne /&gt; Regardless of this baseline, the policies now in place regarding the legality of receiving or providing an abortion are vague in some places.

==Recent developments==
As a global trend, in recent years, it has become more common for members of relatively [[developed nations]] to bring up the question of selective abortion, as science about genetics and techniques for predicting and improving neonatal health has become both more advanced and more common.&lt;ref name=Ballantyne /&gt; Iran has been no different; in fact, it is one of the few governments in the Middle East and North Africa that actively supports programs in sexual and reproductive health for its young people.&lt;ref name=Hessini /&gt; While abortion remains technically illegal in most cases, and in all cases once the pregnancy passes the ensoulment time of 16 weeks, the government has expanded upon its earlier caveat concerning maternal health.

In 2005, the Legal Medicine Organization of Iran created a list of 29 fetal problems and 32 maternal issues in pregnancy that indicated that abortion might possibly be legal—only if, however, it was determined that the life of the mother and the fetus were both endangered if the pregnancy went through, and that the mother could be saved by an abortion.&lt;ref name=Aramesh /&gt; Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' to this effect, allowing abortion in the first trimester for these special cases.&lt;ref name=Hessini /&gt; The Therapeutic Abortion Act of 2005, passed by the Iranian parliament,&lt;ref name=Ballantyne /&gt; stated that if the reason for an abortion was not one of the 61 listed disorders or abnormalities, the cases could be referred to the physician and then the organization, which would decide on an appropriate course of action.&lt;ref name=ErfaniMQ /&gt; The ambiguity of the guidelines for acceptance and the unpredictability of health during pregnancy, however, has not created much definition in the gray area that is Iranian abortion policy.&lt;ref name=Aramesh /&gt; In fact, the Guardian Council rejected the Therapeutic Abortion Act after its passage in 2005,&lt;ref name=Hessini /&gt; adding to the confusion.

Today, most abortions happen "in unsafe and hazardous circumstances" because the penalties for receiving or giving an abortion can still be quite strict.&lt;ref name=ErfaniMQ /&gt; Common reasons for getting an abortion range from fertility concerns (i. e., already having many children), possible or existing health complications, and socio-economic impediments to pregnancy, such as not being able to support another child.&lt;ref name=Erfani /&gt; In a nation whose economy depends almost solely on oil, with 50% of revenue coming from those earnings,&lt;ref name=Fendall /&gt; the distribution of wealth can be strained, and for many families it is not feasible to have many children despite the government's use of oil money to fund statewide welfare systems. With abortion counting for 5% of maternal deaths by some estimates,&lt;ref name=ErfaniMQ /&gt; it is evident that illegal and unsupervised practice of the procedure does occur, and furthermore that it can be quite dangerous to the mother; and with 34% of surveyed pregnant Iranian women in one study reporting their pregnancies as "unintended", &lt;ref name=ErfaniMQ /&gt; it has been noted that the danger has not disappeared in the shift from firm illegality and condemnation of abortion in Iran to its place in a current legal limbo.

==Statistics and trends==
The abortion rate in Iran is contested, and many surveys on the topic land with estimated numbers as opposed to hard data. This is due not only to the inherent difficulty in reaching all populations of Iran, which is a diverse country with large groups of the poor and rural, but also because of the sensitivity of the issue; especially in highly religious groups, the questioning about abortion trends is difficult, and the on-and-off receipt of honest answers has the potential to skew data in a way that makes real conclusions rather vague.

The abortion rate does vary significantly among Iran's provinces, but estimates include .26 lifetime abortions per Iranian woman, an estimated 73,000 a year,&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=H|title=Lifetime Abortion Rate In Iran Is Estimated To Be One Per Four Women|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|year=2008|volume=34|issue=3|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; 27 abortions per 1000 women and 7.5 abortions per 1000 married women,&lt;ref name=ErfaniMQ /&gt; and 11,543 abortions annually in [[Tehran]], the nation's capitol.&lt;ref name="Erfani"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erfani|first=Amir|title=Induced Abortion In Tehran, Iran: Estimated Rates And Correlates|journal=International Perspectives On Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health|year=2011|volume=37|issue=3|pages=134–142|doi=10.1363/3713411}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics are as scholarly accepted as other quite dissimilar ones, such as one study's claim that more than a thousand unsafe abortions "take place every day in Iran" &lt;ref name=Hessini /&gt; and another that reports that 100,000 younger women have illegal or induced abortions annually.&lt;ref name="DeJong"&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeJong|first=Jocelyn|author2=Iman Mortagy|author3=Bonnie Shepard|title=The Sexual and Reproductive Health of Young People in the Arab Countries and Iran|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|year=2005|volume=13|issue=25|pages=49–59|doi=10.1016/s0968-8080(05)25181-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact numbers on abortion in Iran are thus unknown, but there are some trends in the practice that have been widely reported and verified.

All over the world, there is a negative correlation between the use of contraceptives and the abortion rate;&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt; as the world adapts to new and accessible technologies developed for family planning and reproductive health, Iran is one of many nations that has found a lower rate of abortion in those areas that have higher rates of contraceptive use, which accounts for governmental acceptance and support of family planning and sexual health programs for the young. Additionally, ardent religious objections against the practice of abortion have become less legitimate in the eyes of many, especially in the middle and higher classes of Iran, as developments such as pre-natal genetic testing make abortion more of a viable option in the case of a difficult pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Ballantyne /&gt;

'''Abortion''' laws in '''Portugal''' were liberalized on April 10, 2007, allowing the procedure to be done on-demand if a woman's pregnancy has not exceeded its tenth week.&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0410/abortion.html RTE News: Portugal president approves new abortion law]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a three-day waiting period for abortions.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-04-10-portugal-abortion_N.htm?csp=34 USA Today: Portugal president OKs abortion law]&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]] ratified the law allowing abortion, recommending nevertheless that measures should be taken to ensure abortion is the last resort.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6541143.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the liberalization of the laws, in practice, many doctors refuse to perform abortions (which they are allowed to do under a conscientious objection clause) as Portugal remains a country where the Catholic tradition has a significant influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wbez.org/episode-segments/2011-08-10/here-there-portugal-abortion-legal-many-doctors-refuse-perform-them-9005&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions at later stages are allowed for specific reasons, such as risk to woman's health reasons, rape and other sexual crimes, or fetal malformation; with restrictions increasing gradually at 12, 16 and 24 weeks.&lt;ref name="spdc.pt"&gt;http://www.spdc.pt/files/publicacoes/Pub_AbortionlegislationinEuropeIPPFEN_Feb2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The law was signed into law after a [[Portuguese abortion referendum, 2007|February 2007 referendum]] approved of liberalizing the abortion laws.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6350651.stm BBC News: Portugal will legalise abortion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before April 2007, abortion was regulated by Law 6/84 and Law 90/97, and was strongly restricted, allowed only for health reasons, rape and sexual crimes, and fetal malformation.&lt;ref name="spdc.pt"/&gt; Although during that period the abortion laws in Portugal were relatively similar to those of neighboring Spain, in practice, the law was given a much stricter interpretation in Portugal than in Spain, and obtaining a legal abortion was quite difficult.&lt;ref name="Pereira2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ana Maria Prata Amaral Pereira|title=Women's Movements, the State, and the Struggle for Abortion Rights: Comparing Spain and Portugal in Times of Democratic Expansion (1974--1988).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsGHMwiJbBYC|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-11548-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Agricultural Law Association''' ('''AALA''') is a professional organization focusing on the legal needs of the agricultural community in the United States. The association was founded in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Susan|year=2005|title=Thoughts on Agricultural Law and the Role of the American Agricultural Law Association|url=|journal=Drake Journal of Agricultural Law|volume=10|pages=2, 4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AALA’s [[stated vision]] Is:
* That the agricultural industry at every level and rural communities of every size are served by highly competent members of various professions who take pride in their respective professions, are amply rewarded for their contributions, and who are valued members of the community and their professions;
*  That members of the legal and other professions serving agriculture and rural communities in every capacity are well-informed, particularly sensitive of the needs of agriculture and rural communities, well-educated, skilled, and knowledgeable, and that every member of the various professions serving agriculture has access to the best, most advanced, and most useful information and support services related to legal and other matters related to agriculture and rural communities;
*  That excellent information, advice, and counsel on all issues of agricultural law and law affecting rural communities are readily accessible to those who will benefit therefrom, including farmers, agribusinesses, businesses associated with and serving agriculture, members of the legal profession, educators, policy-makers, and interested members of the public; and
*  That the laws and public policies affecting the agricultural industry and rural communities are based on a fundamental understanding of agriculture and individuals comprising agriculture and rural communities, and that such laws and policies are reflective of the special needs and conditions of agriculture and rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aglaw-assn.org/vision/|title=American Agricultural Law Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 The AALA holds an annual two-day educational symposium that offers Continuing Legal Education credit and an update on many of the most significant current agricultural law issues.  It is held in a different U.S. city each year, generally in October. It is attended by over 200 attorneys.  The 2017 symposium will be held in Louisville, Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aglaw-assn.org/category/events/|title=American Agricultural Law Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''''Anisodus tanguticus''''' is a species of flowering plant in the family [[Solanaceae]] which includes many important agricultural plants. It is mostly found growing in the [[Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau]]. ''A. tanguticus'' is collected and used mostly for its medicinal effects thought to be derived from the plant's biologically active [[nicotine]] and [[tropane alkaloids]]. It has a significant impact in [[China]] as one of the [[50 fundamental herbs]] used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

==Scientific Name==
The generic name ''Anisodus'' is a compound of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''anisos'' 'unequal' and ''odous'',''odontos'' 'tooth', hence signifying 'having teeth of different lengths' - so called from the observation that certain species have calyces featuring lobes or teeth of unequal length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Quattrocchi |first=Umberto |year=2012 |title=CRC World dictionary of medicinal and poisonous plants: common names, scientific names, eponyms, synonyms and etymology |volume=IV, M-Q |publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The specific name ''tanguticus'' is a geographical epithet, signifying 'belonging to the [[Western Xia|Tangut region]]' i.e. 'growing in the land of the [[Tangut people]]' - which includes the region of [[Amdo]], one of the three traditional regions of Tibet (taking in the modern Chinese province of [[Qinghai]] and part of the south of the modern Chinese province of [[Gansu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening |editor-last=Chittenden |editor-first=Fred J. |edition= 2nd |last=Synge |first=Patrick M. |volume=IV : Pt-Zy |publisher=Clarendon Press |origyear=1965 |year=1984 |isbn=0-19-869106-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the Tangut, or Western Xia empire included, at its greatest extent, also parts of what are now the [[Chinese provinces]] of [[Ningxia]], northern [[Shaanxi]], northeastern [[Xinjiang]], southwestern [[Inner Mongolia]] and southernmost [[Outer Mongolia]] - all of which in fact lie outside the range of ''Anisodus tanguticus''.&lt;ref&gt;Bian, Ren [边人] (2005).

==Alternative names==
''Anisodus tanguticus'' is more commonly known in China as shān làngdàng (山莨菪) or Zang Qie (transliterated also Tsang-ch'ieh).

==Description==
[[File:Anisodus tanguticus 2.jpg|thumb|''Anisodus tanguticus'']]
''Anisodus tanguticus'' is a [[perennial plant]]. It has flowers that are mostly solitary and borne in leaf axils. The flowers are mostly star shaped and radial. Most of them are nodding but they can sometimes become erect.

The [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]s are of variable length, averaging around {{convert|1.5|–|11|cm}} and may be either glabrous or pubescent.

The [[Calyx (flower)|calyx]] is usually infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and around {{convert|2.5|–|4|cm}} in length.

Most of the calyx lobes of A. tanguticus appear broadly dentate. Closer examination of these lobes generally reveals one or two lobes to be broader and longer than the others. The apices of these lobes may be either acute or obtuse and the lobes themselves are slightly unequal and glabrous.

The infundibuliform [[Corolla (botany)|corolla]] ranges in colour through varying shades and zonations of purple through to occasional wholly pale yellow to green forms, the individual petals making up the corolla reaching between 2.5–4&amp;nbsp;cm in length.

The [[stamens]] are inserted at the base of the corolla tube and are half the length of the corolla. The filaments are about 0.8&amp;nbsp;cm long and are hairless.

The anthers are oblong in shape and around {{convert|5|–|6|mm}} in length, dehiscing longitudinally at maturity.

The ovary is conical, bearing styles that are approximately {{convert|1.2|cm}} long. The stigma is discoidal and somewhat dehiscent at maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1560/9J1P-6GCQ-M375-51P4 |vauthors =Yang DZ, Zhang ZY, Lu AM, Sun K, Liu JQ |year=2002 |title=Floral organogenesis and development of two taxa of the Solanaceae — ''Anisodus tanguticus'' and ''Atropa belladonna'' |journal=Israel Journal of Plant Sciences |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=127–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Entomophily|Insect pollinators]] of the plant include [[flies]], [[honeybees]], and [[ants]].

==Distribution==
''A. tanguticus'' is found growing (on grassy sunny slopes) principally on the Tibetan Plateau, its range extending from the [[Hengduan Mountains]] of [[Sichuan]] and [[Yunnan]] in the east, through [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] to the northwest, [[Tibet]] in the west,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=An-ming |first=Lu |last2=Zhi-yu |first2=Zhang |chapter=Studies of the Subtribe Hyoscyaminae in China, paper no. 5  |title=Solanaceae : Biology and Systematics |editor-first=William G. |editor-last=D'Arcy |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nepal]] in the south.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=110&amp;taxon_id=230005687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://flora.huh.harvard.edu/china/PDF/PDF17/anisodus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is present from altitudes of {{convert|2800|to|4200|m}}. Populations of ''A. tanguticus'' in this region have decreased significantly due to extensive harvesting of the species for medicinal purposes, resulting (since the roots are the part harvested) in the removal of plants in their entirety.&lt;ref name="Zheng 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10709-007-9154-5 |vauthors =Zheng W, Wang L, Meng L, Liu J |year=2008 |title=Genetic variation in the endangered ''Anisodus tanguticus'' (Solanaceae), an alpine perennial endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau |journal=[[Genetica]] |volume=132 |issue=1 |pages=123–9 |pmid=17516136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Topografic map of Tibetan Plateau.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|Distribution of ''A. tanguticus'']]

Due to its distribution on the Tibetan Plateau, which includes many mountains and valleys, ''A. tanguticus'' can be found in very isolated areas relative to another patch of the same plant. This has led to a high level of genetic differentiation of ''A. tanguticus''.

It is frequently found growing in the vicinity of settlements and monasteries, thriving as it does in soils nutrient-rich through the regular depositing of horse and cattle dung.

==Traditional medicine==
''A. tanguticus'' ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:山|山]][[wiktionary:莨|莨]][[wiktionary:菪|菪]]|p=shān làng dàng}})&lt;ref name=efloras/&gt; is one of the [[Chinese herbology#50 fundamental herbs|50 fundamental herbs]] used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

It contains high levels of the [[tropane alkaloid]]s  [[hyoscyamine]] and [[scopolamine]], which affect primarily the parasympathetic nervous system and can act as [[anticholinergic]] agents.&lt;ref name="Zheng 2008"/&gt;

==Pharmaceutical use==
[[File:Anisodamine chemical structure.png|thumb|120px|alt=Anisodamine_chemical_structure alt text|Anisodamine chemical structure]]
[[File:Anisodine.png|thumb|120px|alt=Anisodine alt text|Anisodine chemical structure]]
''A. tanguticus'' is grown and harvested in order to extract two [[alkaloid]]s, [[anisodamine]] and [[anisodine]], which can be obtained from the roots of the plant.  These alkaloids are used as [[anticholinergic]] drugs in China for acute circulatory shock.&lt;ref name="pmid2879586"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors =Varma DR, Yue TL|title=Adrenoceptor blocking properties of atropine-like agents anisodamine and anisodine on brain and cardiovascular tissues of rats|journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]]|volume=87|issue=3|pages=587–94|date=March 1986|pmid=2879586|pmc=1916562|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1986.tb10201.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anisodamine in particular was introduced into clinical use in China in 1965 through the manufacture of a synthetic drug that concentrated the alkaloids from the plant. It was first used to treat epidemic [[meningitis]], but was later used to treat other ailments, including [[glomerulonephritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Clostridium perfringens|hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis]], [[eclampsia]], [[pulmonary edema]], and [[circulatory shock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors =Xiu RJ, Intaglietta M|last-author-amp =yes|year=1984|title=Improvement of microvascular function by Chinese vasocative substance|journal=Advances in Chinese Medicinal Materials Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=553–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Anisodamine has also been found to be highly beneficial in cases of [[noise-induced hearing loss]], dilating the [[capillaries]] and improving [[microcirculation]] in the [[bony labyrinth]]; while Anisodine has been used clinically for [[migraine]] and diseases of the [[fundus (eye)|fundus occuli]] due to [[vasospasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duke |first=James A. |last2=Ayensu |first2=Edward S. |title=Medicinal Plants of China |publisher=Reference Publications |year=1985 |series=Medicinal Plants of the World |volume=2 |page=605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to increase population==
The population of ''A. tanguticus'' is starting to dwindle in its main habitat of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. This can be attributed not only to the effects of over-collection, as a medicinal species, but also to a low rate of [[seed germination]] in ''A. tanguticus'' -  even under most natural conditions. This is probably due to the relative impermeability of the [[Testa (botany)|testa]] of its seeds which tends to prevent water absorption and acts also to inhibit gaseous exchange. The seeds of ''A. tanguticus'' are therefore classified as having coat-imposed dormancy.

A study was conducted in an effort to find the most effective method of breaking [[seed dormancy]] in the species in order to increase rates of germination. Several combinations of treatments (which included chilling, [[gibberellic acid]], and mechanical scarification) were employed.

The mechanical scarification method (which involves the breaking, scratching, or softening of the seed coat) was found to be the only way to increase germination. The rate improved to about 70% and the germination time was improved to 4.1 days.

The study was undertaken in an effort to find ways of increasing the population of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =He T, Jai JF  |year=2009 |title=Breaking dormancy in seeds of ''Anisodus tanguticus'': an endangered medicinal herb of high altitude in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau |journal=Seed Science and Technology |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=229–231 |doi=10.15258/sst.2009.37.1.26 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ista/sst/2009/00000037/00000001/art00026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a patient with suspected post-streptococcal [[glomerulonephritis]], [[Anti-streptolysin O|anti-streptolysin-O]] titres (ASOTs) can be negative even after strep [[pharyngitis]]. Some studies suggest that up to 85% of patients with [[acute rheumatic fever]] from group A strep infection will be positive for [[Anti-streptolysin O|ASO]] titers, leaving 15% of patients having been diagnosed with rheumatic fever negative for [[Anti-streptolysin O|ASO]] titers. In addition and contrary to percentages seen in strep pharyngitis, strep skin infection induces ASO antibodies less often, which can be problematic for physicians searching for a cause of the glomerulonephritis and having a high suspicion that its etiology was strep.

Post-streptococcus glomerulonephritis is more often associated with group A strep skin infection than it is with strep pharyngitis, so in a patient with suspected post-strep glomerulonephritis with a negative ASO titer, one can then obtain Anti-DNase-B titers which are more sensitive for group A strep and for its various strains. Anti-DNase B antibody titers also stay elevated for longer, which is useful since often ASO titers may rise, but then fall prior to the onset of the glomerulonephritis where the onset of disease is often greater than 2 weeks after the infection resolved. In this way anti-DNase B titers are very useful to clinicians and allow for evidence of the recent infection to be seen and levels of this antibody to be quantified.&lt;ref&gt;Antistreptolysin O and Anti-Deoxyribonuclease B Titers: Normal Values for Children Ages 2 to 12 in the United States Edward L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2707">In dentistry, '''centric relation''' is the [[human mandible|mandibular]] jaw position in which the [[mandibular condyle|head of the condyle]] is situated as far anterior and superior as it possibly can within the [[mandibular fossa|mandibular fossa/glenoid fossa]].

It is defined as, ''"The maxillo-mandibular relationship in which the condyles articulate with the thinnest avascular portion of their respective discs with the complex in the anterior-superior position against the slopes of the articular eminences. This position is independent of tooth contact. This position is clinically discernible when the mandible is directed superiorly and posteriorly. It is restricted to a purely rotary movement about the transverse horizontal axis".&amp;nbsp;— GPT.''

This position is used when restoring edentulous patients with [[dentures|removable]] or either [[dental implant|implant]]-supported hybrid or [[fixed prosthodontics|fixed]] prostheses.  Because the dentist wants to be able to reproducibly relate the patient's [[maxilla]] and mandible, but the patient does not have teeth with which to establish his or her own [[vertical dimension of occlusion]], another method has been devised to achieve this goal.  The condyle can only be in the same place as it was the last time it was positioned by the dentist if it is consistently moved to the most superior and anterior position within the fossa.

It is a physiologic position that is used for reproducibility. The Temporomandibular Joint is not restricted to Centric Relation in function. At the most superior position, the condyle-disc assemblies are braced medially, thus centric relation is also the midmost position. A properly aligned condyle-disc assembly in centric relation can resist maximum loading by the elevator muscles with no sign of discomfort. It also allows for the most repeatable and recordable position and therefore should be used when designing an appropriate occlusion.

'''&lt;big&gt;Methods of Recording Centric Relation:&lt;/big&gt;'''
* Physiological Methods:
# Tactile or inter-occlusal check record method.
# Pressureless method.

'''Centrum''' is a brand of [[multivitamin]]s produced by [[Pfizer]] (formerly [[Wyeth]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wyeth sued by teachers group over Centrum ads|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=2003-09-18|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physicians' Health Study II==
{{Technical|section|date=January 2013}}

In 2012, the Physicians' Health Study II (PHS-II) found that participants who took a Centrum-brand multivitamin each day for an average of 11 years had no change in cancer mortality or cardiovascular disease mortality compared to the placebo group.  The authors did find a slight reduction in cancer incidences, although this conclusion was questioned in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''.&lt;ref name=Bach/&gt;

On October 17, 2012, researchers reported on a [[Double-blind#Double-blind trials|double-blind study]] of 14,641 male U.S. physicians initially aged 50 years or older (mean age of 64.3, standard deviation 9.2 years), that began in 1997 with treatment and follow-up through June 1, 2011. They compared total cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) for participants taking a daily multivitamin (Centrum Silver by [[Pfizer]]) versus [[placebo]]. Compared with placebo, men taking a daily multivitamin had a [[statistically significant]] reduction in the incidence of total cancer, with a [[hazard ratio]] (HR) = 0.92 (95% [[confidence interval]] (CI) 0.86-0.998; P = .04). No statistically significant effects were found for any specific cancers or cancer mortality. The 95% CI of the hazard ratio implied a benefit of between 14% and .2% over placebo. In absolute terms the difference was 1.3 cancer diagnoses, per 1000 years of life (18.3-17 events, respectively). The median follow up time was 11.2 years.&lt;ref name="JAMA-20121017"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gaziano |first=J.

Michael Gaziano, a [[cardiologist]], was quoted by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as saying "it certainly appears there is a modest reduction in the risk of cancer from a typical multivitamin."&lt;ref name="NYT-20121017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rabin |first=Roni Caryn |title=Daily Multivitamin May Reduce Cancer Risk, Clinical Trial Finds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/health/daily-multivitamin-may-reduce-cancer-risk-clinical-trial-finds.html |date=October 17, 2012 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=October 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was also featured in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article on October 17, 2012.&lt;ref name=Winslow&gt;{{cite news|last=Winslow|first=Ron|title=Multivitamin Cuts Cancer Risk, Large Study Finds|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444868204578062463819724232|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in the same issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (JAMA), reflecting the opinion of JAMA, was dismissive of the report on several counts. First, they said, "it seems unlikely that a common characteristic across all diseases included under this wide category of cancer would be a protective effect from multivitamins", suggesting if no specific cancer was effected, why would general cancer risk be so affected. Second, they questioned the study's abilities to deliver on the question of whether a multivitamin would be protective in a well-nourished population ([[Bayesian probability]]) stating: "The plausibility of a protective effect is reduced by the absence of a clear path through which 30 different vitamins and minerals would cause a decline in the risk of multiple cancers and, especially, by the negative pattern of prior results." In addition the investigators observed no difference in effect whether the study participants were or were not adherent to the multivitamin intervention, which diminishes the [[dose–response relationship]].&lt;ref name=Bach&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bach|first=Peter B. |author2=Lewis, Roger J.|title=Multiplicities in the Assessment of Multiple Vitamins Is It Too Soon to Tell Men That Vitamins Prevent Cancer?|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=14 November 2012|volume=308|issue=18|pages=1916–1917|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.53273|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=1391897|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editorial was critical of the statistical multiplicity ([[multiple comparisons]]): the complete planned analysis of the primary and secondary end points in the PHS II study would entail 28 tests of association; each of which has "some possibility of yielding a statistically significant result by chance alone, even when there is no true treatment effect. [...] when this finding is considered in the context of the number of already completed and planned analyses of the same study, the strength of the inference is weaker, because the likelihood of a randomly occurring finding [...] is much greater." They concluded that any of the conventional P value corrections for multiple comparisons would eliminate the apparent "statistical significance" of the results.&lt;ref name=Bach /&gt;

From the same double-blind study, they found that taking a daily multivitamin did not have any effect in reducing [[heart attack]]s and other major cardiovascular events, MI, stroke, and CVD mortality.&lt;ref name="JAMA-20121107"&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Defence Services Medical Academy (DSMA)''' ({{lang-my|တပ်မတော် ဆေး တက္ကသိုလ်}}, {{IPA-my|taʔmədɔ̀ sʰé tɛʔkəθò|pron}}), located in [[Mingaladon Township|Mingaladon]], [[Yangon]], is the University of Medicine of the [[Tatmadaw|Myanmar Armed Forces]]. One of the most selective universities in the country, the academy offers [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|M.B., B.S.]] (equivalent of the [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]) degree programs. Upon graduation, most DSMA cadets are commissioned with the rank of [[Lieutenant]] in the [[Myanmar Army Medical Corps]]. The military physicians are to serve the healthcare needs of rural people when they are assigned in the country's remote regions where access to healthcare is poor.

==History==

The DSMA was founded in 1992 as the Defence Services Institute of Medicine (DSIM) to develop physicians to serve in the [[Tatmadaw]] [[Myanmar Armed Forces]]. Prior to the founding of the academy, the Tatmadaw had recruited its medical and dental officers from civilian medical school graduates, who had to undergo a month-long basic military training program at the Medical Corps Center. While the medical corps of the Tatmadaw had always been short of physicians, by the early 1990s, the shortage became more pronounced as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]], fearing student unrest, had shut down most civilian universities, following the [[8888 Uprising]] in 1988. Most civilian universities were closed off and on for much of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=kyodo&gt;{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_/ai_63803917 | title=Myanmar university classes resume for 1st time in 3 years | date=2000-07-31 | publisher=Kyodo News International}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military run universities essentially became the only venue for those who wished to continue university education inside the country.

The DSIM was operated by the [[Ministry of Health (Burma)|Ministry of Health]] and the [[Directorate of Medical Services]]. The purported "aim of the DSMA is to produce good Medical officers endowed with brilliant physical and mental ability to safeguard The Three Main National Causes" espoused by the military government.

The first batch of 47 cadets from the DSIM were commissioned as lieutenants on 17 December 1999, after six years of study and a year as house-surgeons. Through nine intakes, the DSMA produced a total of 1525 medical officers. As of 2008, the DSMA had produced seven Doctor of Medical Science degree holders. The academy is only source of medical officers for the DMS. In terms of Master of Medical Science, by the early 2008, the DSMA had produced 335 specialists, including 48 physicians and 41 surgeons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Nowadays, many army doctors' clinics can be seen in Yangon and specialists of army hospital are also practicing at many private hospitals and clinics. Army doctors are serving the country both in rural and urban regions in the form of private and public practice.

==Admissions==
The academy accepts approximately 400 students annually. Unlike at the country's other four civilian medical schools, the selection process goes beyond high [[University Entrance Examination]] scores. All prospective candidates must be male and must have high enough college matriculation exam scores to enter any civilian medical university. In addition, the prospective student must sit for another entrance exam as well as physical and psychological exams.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} After 2010, the matriculation examination marks are not considered for entrance. Personal interview becomes the most important step for entrance. The academy has accepted fewer than 100 students a year since 2010, and only 40 students are accepted to DSMA in 2012.

The selection criteria are:
* Males only
* DSMA entrance exams on 1. [[Biology]], [[Botany]] and [[Zoology]] and 2. [[English language|English]]
* Physical fitness
* Teamwork and comradeship screening
* Psychometric assessment
* General interviews
* Medical checkups

The entrance selection including physical fitness tests, teamwork and comradeship screening, psychometric assessments and general interviews process takes about five to seven days at Officer Testing Team (OTT). Only those who pass all the tests and steps above are admitted to the DSMA. Students are eligible for state scholarship programs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The benefit of being a student at DSMA is to get a stipend after acceptance to the school and faster career development than  civilian medical doctors. The salary is higher than civilian doctors.

==Programs==

The DSMA offers courses for both basic and advanced degrees in medicine and surgery, and runs 20 graduate programs in medical sciences.&lt;ref name="moh"&gt;{{cite web | title=Health Statistics | url=http://www.moh.gov.mm/file/Health%20Statistics.pdf | accessdate=2008-11-29 | publisher=Ministry of Health, Myanmar | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108035911/http://www.moh.gov.mm/file/Health%20Statistics.pdf | archivedate=2008-11-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, many army doctors are studying in public health master's degree locally as well as internationally.The new generation army doctors are likely to take the duty at Ministry of Health and influence the Myanmar health system set up.

The DSMA is equipped with lab materials, modern textbooks, and training resources. As intern surgeons, the students must take a field practical tour of duty at military hospitals, where they get field training from professional surgeons. The academy is open year round, and is in session for eleven months of study in an academic year—ten months of medical science coursework plus a month of military science and military leadership. Some DSMA graduates continue their post-graduate education in the UK, India, Thailand, Russia, United States, Germany, Belgium and Singapore.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9118">'''Primary Care Case Management (PCCM),''' is a program of the United States government healthcare service [[Medicaid]]. It oversees the United States system of [[managed care]] used by state Medicaid agencies in which a [[primary care]] provider is responsible for approving and monitoring the care of enrolled Medicaid beneficiaries, typically for a small monthly [[Case management (US health system)|case management]] fee in addition to [[fee-for-service]] reimbursement for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Rawlings Sekunda, Deborah Curtis, and Neva Kaye.  “Emerging Practices in Medicaid Primary Care Case Management Programs.”  Prepared by the National Academy for State Health Policy for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, states began enrolling beneficiaries in their PCCM programs in an attempt to increase access and reduce inappropriate [[emergency department]] and other high cost care.  Use increased steadily through the 1990s.

== History ==

In 1981, the 97th session of [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) which allowed state Medicaid programs to implement risk-based managed care programs as well as PCCM, pending HCFA(now known as [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]]) waiver approval.  The state had to meet two requirements in order to be granted HCFA approval.
* The case management restrictions must not "substantially impair access" to primary care services of "adequate quality where medically necessary;" and
* The case management restrictions must be "cost effective."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Freund, Medicaid Reform: Four Studies of Case Management (Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

In their earliest forms, PCCM programs closely resembled traditional fee-for-service Medicaid than managed care. Some states developed PCCM as a first step towards risk-based managed care and considered their [[Managed Care Organization|MCO]] contracts as the main managed care system. As PCCM programs matured, state goals have expanded to improving quality of care provided.  States have used strategies similar to network management principles used by MCOs.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Rawlings Sekunda, Deborah Curtis, and Neva Kaye. “Emerging Practices in Medicaid Primary Care Case Management Programs.” Prepared by the National Academy for State Health Policy for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
PCCM programs have evolved over the past two decades through the addition of a variety of care management and care coordination features. These include payment innovations; increased care management resources; improved performance monitoring and reporting; increased resources for management of serious and complex medical conditions; and a variety of “[[medical home]]” innovations, including performance-based reimbursement, better use of information technology, increased contact with patients, and efforts to provide additional resources for physician offices.

== Intent ==

By 1986, seven states had implemented PCCM programs.&lt;ref&gt;Maren D. Anderson, Peter D. Fox, "Lessons Learned from Medicaid Managed Care Approaches," Health Affairs 6, no. 1 (Spring 1987): 71–88.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, that number had grown to 19.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath, J. and N. Kaye, Eds. Medicaid Managed Care: A Guide for States, 2nd Edition. Portland, Maine: National Academy for State Health Policy, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  States were motivated to implement PCCM programs for several reasons:
* States wanted to increase access to health care. State officials tried giving participating physicians a small payment to encourage physicians to accept more Medicaid beneficiaries.  Each beneficiary would choose or be assigned a participating physician who would serve as his/her medical home.
* States felt physicians would like PCCM more that risk-based managed care.
* States hoped to save money by eliminating unnecessary or inappropriate [[emergency department]] (ED) and specialist visits, lab tests, and other high-cost care.
* States thought PCCM would be well-suited for rural areas where MCOs have difficulty maintaining an adequate population base for financial viability.

== Prevalence of PCCM ==

As of July 1, 2010, approximately 21% of the almost 39 million Medicaid enrollees who were enrolled in a comprehensive managed care plan were enrolled in a PCCM program.&lt;ref&gt;Medicaid Enrollment in Comprehensive Managed Care Plans by Type. 
http://statehealthfacts.org. Accessed January 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* These 8 million consumers participate in PCCM programs in 31 states.
* There are 11 states which offer PCCM as the only managed care option.
* Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Louisiana have the largest PCCM programs, each with over 700,000 enrollees.
* Approximately 30 percent of [[Children's Health Insurance Program|SCHIP]] enrollees are served by PCCM systems.&lt;ref&gt;VanLandeghem K and Brach C. Impact of primary care case management (PCCM) implementation on Medicaid and SCHIP. CHIRI™ Issue Brief No. 8. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. March 2009. AHRQ Pub. No. 090020.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization of PCCM programs ==

In most PCCM programs, PCPs are paid a per member per month fee for each Medicaid beneficiary or an increase in preventive service fees to pay for case management services. In addition, PCPs are paid on a fee-for-service reimbursement for all primary care services that he/she provides. [[Health maintenance organization|HMOs]] are not involved.  In return, the PCP is responsible for providing primary care and for [[prior authorization]]s to hospitals and specialty care providers.&lt;ref&gt;Complete information about the BBA and Medicaid managed care, including the actual text and a series of letter to states from HCFA(now known as CMS) regarding the BBA, is available at http://www.hcfa.gov/medicaid/bbahmpg.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Physicians bear no financial risk for the services they provide or approve.  State Medicaid agencies may include additional activities, such as medical management, network management or performance incentives, to improve outcomes and generate cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;Neva Kaye, "PCCM Contracting and Quality Monitoring", Medicaid Managed Care: A Guide for States (Second Edition) (Portland, ME: National Academy for State Health Policy, 1995), 115–135&lt;/ref&gt;
States vary in how they manage provider networks, provider recruitment, data collection and analysis, monitoring, quality improvement, patient education, [[Disease management (health)|disease management]] programs and enrollment.  Some states perform all these programs in-house using state employees; other states contract out all or some of these functions.&lt;ref&gt;Silberman P, Poley S, Slifkin R. Innovative Primary Care Case Management Programs Operating in Rural Communities: Case Studies of Three States. http://www.schsr.unc.edu/research_programs/rural_program/wp76.pdf. Accessed August 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific evidence ==
States that have tried implementing PCCM programs have encountered mostly positive results:
* PCCM has been shown to improve patient outcomes. A study of Medicaid-enrolled children in Virginia found that immunization rates were higher among PCCM enrollees than among enrollees in either mandatory or voluntary HMO programs.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter JJ, McDonald KA, Parker DA, et al. Effect of different types of Medicaid managed care on childhood immunization rates. Eval Health Prof. Dec 2000;23(4):397–408&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disease management programs, a prominent part of many PCCM programs, have shown to improve health outcomes by increasing communication between the patient and his/her [[Primary care physician|PCP]].&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter LF, Whitehurst-Cook MY, Small RE, et al. The impact of disease
management on outcomes and cost of care: a study of low-income asthma patients.
Inquiry. Summer 2000;37(2):188–202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silberman P, Poley S, Slifkin R. Innovative Primary Care Case Management Programs Operating in Rural Communities: Case Studies of Three States. http://www.schsr.unc.edu/research_programs/rural_program/wp76.pdf. Accessed
August 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* The cost effectiveness of PCCM is thought to derive from increased [[Preventive healthcare|preventive services]] and less use of costly services such as emergency department visits.  A recent [[cost analysis]] of the Iowa PCCM program found that PCCM was associated with substantial aggregate cost savings over an 8-year period, and that this effect becomes stronger over time.&lt;ref&gt;Momany ET, Flach SD, Nelson FD, Damiano PC.

'''Family planning in Hong Kong''' occurs within a context of a total fertility rate in [[Hong Kong]] of currently 1.04 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world.

The Eugenics League was founded in 1936, which became [[The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="famplan.org.hk"&gt;[http://www.famplan.org.hk/fpahk/en/template1.asp?style=template1.asp&amp;content=about/history.asp History of the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation provides [[family planning]] advice, [[sex education]] and [[birth control]] services to the general public. In the 1970s, due to the rapidly rising population, it launched the "Two is Enough" campaign,&lt;ref name="famplan.org.hk"/&gt; which reduced the general birth rate through educational means.

The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong was one of the eight family planning organisations that founded the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]].&lt;ref name="ippf.org"&gt;[http://www.ippf.org/en/About/History.htm History of International Planned Parenthood Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813091603/http://www.ippf.org/en/About/History.htm |date=2009-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fibrosclerosis of the breast''' is most frequently used to mean [[sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosing]] lobular adenosis of the breast. It is not well known if it is related to non-sclerosing adenosis of the breast (which is normally classified as [[fibrocystic breast changes]]) and unlike this it is believed to be correlated with an elevated risk of [[breast cancer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4378">The '''Food for the Brain Foundation''' is a non-profit [[educational]] [[Advertising campaign|campaign]], claiming to have been created by a group of [[nutritionist]]s, [[Physician|doctor]]s, [[psychiatrist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[scientist]]s to promote a purported link between [[nutrition]] and [[mental health]]. It is an initiative led by [[Patrick Holford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodforthebrain.org/content.asp?id_Content=1604 Who we are] Food for the Brain Foundation; 2007; Accessed 05-02-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation has received publicity with its pilot study in a number of [[United Kingdom|British]] schools that has attempted to improve children's performance by improving nutrition. The campaign has been both lauded as revealing a massive improvement in pupils' behaviour and performances &lt;ref name="Transformed"&gt;Paton, Graeme.

== Schools campaign ==
The best known and launching campaign of the Food for the Brain Foundation was a pilot study carried out at Cricket Green special education school in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[London]]. This study lasted seven months and had pupils following "a daily regime of taking the long chain fatty acid supplement "eye q", a combination of [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] fish oil and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] evening primrose oil, a balanced nutritious diet, a new exercise regime, and a multivitamin." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=187808 eye q(TM): New Data Reveals School Children Transformed by Unique School Programme] PRNewswire; London; 10-01-2007; Accessed 05-02-2007&lt;/ref&gt; The study "transformed" the behaviour of children at the school, with a 25% drop in [[psychosomatic]] problems reported.&lt;ref name="Transformed"/&gt; A similar study, followed by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programme [[Tonight with Trevor MacDonald]], is underway at [[Chineham Park]] school [[Basingstoke]].&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;Hoyle, Antonia.

However, the studies have also been criticised. Catherine Collins of [[St George's Hospital]] in [[London]] stated that a pupil in the Merton study had "suffered sleep problems and her weight dropped as a result of the advice [Mr Holford] gave." &lt;ref name="Doctors warn"/&gt; The study as been criticised as being unscientific, with results "cherry-picked" and the effects merely a "[[placebo]]".&lt;ref name=Goldacre/&gt; Holford and the foundation reject some of these allegations. Holford claims that the pupil in the Merton study has since regained the lost weight, which he puts down to a reduction in her [[gluten]] intake, after tests revealed she was "gluten sensitive". He states that her overall behaviour and health have improved during the study.&lt;ref&gt;Holford, Patrick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">'''Food industry''' is a rapidly growing sector in Bangladesh, employing a significant portion of the labor force in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/dhaka-international-trade-fair-2014/food-industry-in-%20%20%20bangladesh-6622&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2010, the [[food processing]] industry in Bangladesh grew at an average 7.7 percent per annum. [[Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics]], in its 25006 Economic Census, reported that there were approximately 246 medium-sized food processing industries employing 19 percent of the industrial manufacturing workforce in Bangladesh or 8 percent of the total manufacturing labor force. The [[food industry]] employs 2.45 percent of the country's total labor force and its share in the GDP was 2.01 percent in 2010. There are also numerous small scale factories and domestic units engaged in food processing throughout the country. According to some industry analysts, the food processing sector in Bangladesh is a 4.5 billion US Dollar industry. In 2010, Bangladesh exported over $700 million worth of processed food and beverages, over 60 percent of them were [[shrimp]] and [[Fishing in Bangladesh|fish]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=International Monetary Fund. Asia and Pacific Dept|title=Bangladesh: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper|date=2013|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=9781475543520|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food processing in Bangladesh has traditionally been small scale, with domestic or family business using common processing knowledge for the conservation and handling of raw agricultural commodities to make them usable as food and feed. Although commercial scale food processing using modern technology especially for wheat and [[rice mill]]ing, [[mustard seed]] crushing and very limited bread and cookie manufacturing appeared during the 1960s, the growth of this sector did not gain momentum in terms of operational scale and quality until the 1980s. Recently the defining characteristics of the industry has been the processing of increasingly diverse products to meet the changing demands of the Bangladesh population. The major food processing sub-sectors in Bangladesh include [[dairy]], [[edible oil]], sugar, rice, wheat, fruit and vegetable, tea, poultry/beaf, pulses and spices and fish processing industries. Induced by the vigorous growth of the diverse middle class population of Bangladesh and the growing demands for additional consumption,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_07-01-2013_Middle-class-boom:-The-image-of-new-Bangladesh_372_1_17_1_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; the food processing sector is set to witness further hefty expansion in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/index.php?%20%20%20ref=MjBfMTJfMjFfMTJfMV84OV8xNTM3OTY=&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender-biased diagnosing''' is a controversial&lt;ref&gt;Authors V. Mark Durand, M.V. &amp; Barlow, D.H. (2009) ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7BZTtO5rh8C&amp;lpg=PA436&amp;dq=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;pg=PA436#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;f=false p.436.] Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-495-59982-4}}. Retrieved November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology|sociological]] observation which asserts that [[medical diagnosis|medical]] and psychological diagnosis may be influenced by the [[gender]] of the patient. Several studies have found evidence of [[differential diagnosis]] for patients with similar ailments but of different sexes.

== Medical diagnosis ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
The phenomenon may affect physical diagnosis. Women are more likely to be given a diagnosis of [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] nature for a [[physical ailment]] than men, despite presenting with similar symptoms. Women sometimes have trouble being taken seriously by physicians when suffering from medically unexplained [[illness]], and report difficulty receiving appropriate medical care for their illnesses because doctors repeatedly diagnose their physical complaints as related to [[Mental illness|psychiatric problems]].
Clinical offices that rely on healthcare routines become less distinct due to biased medical knowledge of gender.  There is a distinct differentiation between gender and sex in the medical sense. Gender is the societal construction of what femininity and masculinity is, whereas, sex is the biological aspect that defines the dichotomy of female and male. The way of lifestyle and the place in society are often considered when diagnosing patients.&lt;ref&gt;Hamberg, K. (2008). Gender bias in medicine. Women's Health (London, England), 4(3), 237-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional medical studies, most of these medical studies were done on men thus overlooking many issues that were related to women's health. This topic alone sparked controversy and brought about question to the medical standard of our time. Research that was done on diseases that affected women more were less funded than those diseases that affected men and women equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Trechak A | year = 1999 | title = On cultural and gender bias in medical diagnosis | url = | journal = Multicultural Education | volume = 7 | issue = 2| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an example of gender bias in the psychiatric field as well, Hamburg notes that, "psychiatrists would diagnose women with depression and then, eventually psychiatrists would begin to assume that women were more depressed than men due to the fact that the patients that were examined by the psychiatrists were women and they had similar symptoms. As for the men, they were diagnosed with drug or alcohol problems and they were thrown out of the study."&lt;ref&gt;Hamberg, Katarina. "Gender Bias in Medicine." Women's Health (London, England), 4.3 (2008): 237-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the Women's Health Equity Act that was passed in 1993, this Act gave women the chance to participate in medical studies and examine the gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1993. Congressional Record Daily Edition. n.p.: 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Women's Health Equity Act was introduced there was no research done on infertility, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer which were essential to women's health.&lt;ref&gt;THE WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1991. Congressional Record Daily Edition. n.p.: 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological diagnosis ==
There is a suggestion that assumptions regarding gender specific behavioural characteristics can lead to a diagnostic system which is biased.&lt;ref&gt;Maddux, J.E. &amp; Winstead, B.A. (2005) ''Psychopathology: foundations for a contemporary understanding'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2SJpF8ucrKgC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;f=false p.77.] Routledge. {{ISBN|0-8058-4077-X}} Retrieved November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of gender bias with regard to ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) [[personality disorder]] criteria has been controversial and widely debated. The fourth DSM (4th ed., text revision; DSM–IV–TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) makes no explicit statement regarding gender bias among the ten personality disorders (PDs), but it does state that six PDs (antisocial, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid) are more frequently found in men. Three others (borderline, histrionic, dependent) are more frequent in women. Avoidant is equally common in men and women.

There are many ways to interpret differential prevalence rates as a function of gender. Some critics have argued that they are an artifact of gender bias. In other words, the PD criteria assume unfairly that stereotypical female characteristics are pathological. The results of this study conclude with no indication of gender-biased criteria in the [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], and [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]] PDs. This is in contrast with what is predicted by critics of these disorders, who suggest they are biased against women. It is possible, however, that other sources of bias, including assessment and clinical bias,  are still at work in relation to these disorders. The results do show that the group means are higher in women than in men, an expected result considering the higher prevalence rate of these disorders for women.&lt;ref&gt;Jane, J. S., Oltmanns, T. F., South, S. C., &amp; Turkheimer, E. (2007) "Gender bias in diagnostic criteria for personality disorders: An item response theory analysis" Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 116(1), 166-175&lt;/ref&gt;

The original purpose of the DSM–IV was to provide an accurate classification of [[psychopathology]], not to develop a diagnostic system that will, democratically, diagnose as many men with a personality disorder as women". However, if the criteria are to serve equally as indicators of disorder for both men and women, it will be important to establish that the implications of these criteria for functional impairment are comparable for both sexes. Whereas it is plausible that there are gender-specific expressions of these disorders, DSM–IV criteria that function differentially for men and women can systematically over-pathologize or under-represent mental illness in a particular gender. The present study is limited by the investigation of only four personality disorders and the lack of inclusion of additional diagnoses that have also been controversial in the gender bias debate (such as dependent and histrionic personality disorders), although it offers a clearly articulated methodology for studying this possibility. In addition, it provides an examination of a clinical sample of substantial size and uses functional assessments that cut across multiple functional domains and multiple assessment methods. Our results indicate that BPD criteria showed some evidence of differential functioning between genders on global functioning, although there is little evidence of sex bias within the diagnostic criteria for [[avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]], or [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]]s. Further investigation and validation across sexes for those disorders would be an important direction of future research.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, C. D., Morey, L. C., Skodol, A. E., Shea, M. T., Sanislow, C. A., Grilo, C. M., et al. (2009) "Differential impairment as an indicator of sex bias in DSM-IV criteria for four personality disorders" Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment, S(1), 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable evidence indicates a prominent role for [[psychological trauma|trauma]]-related cognitions in the development and maintenance of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) symptoms. The present study utilized [[regression analysis]] to examine the unique relationships between various trauma-related cognitions and PTSD symptoms after controlling for gender and measures of general affective distress in a large sample of trauma-exposed college students. In terms of trauma-related cognitions, only negative cognitions about the self were related to PTSD symptom severity. Gender and anxiety symptoms were also related to PTSD symptom severity. Theoretical implications of the results are consistent with previous studies on the relationship between PTSD and negative cognitions, the self, world, and blame subscales of the PTCI were significantly related to PTSD symptoms. The study correlations indicated that increased negative trauma-related cognitions were related to more severe PTSD symptoms. Also consistent with previous reports, correlations also indicated that gender was related to PTSD symptom severity, such that women had more severe PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptom severity was also positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moser J. S. |author2=Hajcak G. |author3=Simons R. F. |author4=Foa E. B. | year = 2007 | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in trauma-exposed college students: The role of trauma-related cognitions, gender, and negative affect | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618507000072 | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 1039–1049 | doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2006.10.009|pmc=2169512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often challenging, especially when the client has experienced a trauma such as [[childhood sexual abuse]] (CSA), which is strongly linked to both disorders. Although the individual diagnostic criteria for these two disorders do not overlap substantially, patients with either of these disorders can display similar clinical pictures. Both patients with BPD and PTSD may present as aggressive toward self or others, irritable, unable to tolerate emotional extremes, dysphoric, feeling empty or dead, and highly reactive to mild stressors. Despite having similar clinical pictures, PTSD and BPD are regarded differently by many clinicians. Results from a 2009 study concluded that patient gender does not affect diagnosis. This finding is consistent with research suggesting that women are not more likely to be given the BPD diagnosis, all else being equal, though it contradicts other findings from studies that have used similar case vignettes. Nor did the data support an effect of clinician gender or age on diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, H. E., Taft, C. T., Gordon, R. A., &amp; Meis, L. A. (2009) "Clinician bias in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder"  Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 1(4), 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study examined gender-specific associations between trauma cognitions, alcohol cravings and alcohol-related consequences in individuals with dually diagnosed PTSD and [[alcohol dependence]] (AD). Participants had entered a treatment study for concurrent PTSD and AD; baseline information was collected from participants about PTSD-related cognitions in three areas: (a) Negative Cognitions About Self, (b) Negative Cognitions About the World, and (c) Self-Blame. Information was also collected on two aspects of AD: alcohol cravings and consequences of AD. Gender differences were examined while controlling for PTSD severity. The results indicate that Negative Cognitions About Self are significantly related to alcohol cravings in men but not women, and that interpersonal consequences of AD are significantly related to Self-Blame in women but not in men. These findings suggest that for individuals with comorbid PTSD and AD, psychotherapeutic interventions that focus on reducing trauma-related cognitions are likely to reduce alcohol cravings in men and relational problems in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jayawickreme N. |author2=Yasinski C. |author3=Williams M. |author4=Foa E.

'''George Walter Hahn''' (September 11, 1894 &amp;ndash; October 24, 1977) was an American Orthodontist who graduated from [[Angle School of Orthodontia]] in 1921. He served as president of California Dental Association and [[American Association of Orthodontists]].&lt;ref name="Angle"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=J|first1=R|title=George W. Hahn|journal=Angle Orthodontist|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-3219(1978)048%3C0089%3AIM%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Hahn was born in [[Murphy]], [[California]] in 1894.  He joined the Navy in 1918, after which he was stationed at the Naval Training Station in San Diego during World War I for about a year. He graduated from University of California College of Dentistry in 1919 after which he worked at private practice in Berkeley, California. Hahn then attended Angle School of Orthodontia and graduated from there in 1921.  He was married to Dorothy and they had two daughters named Margaret and Dowrene.

==Career==
Hahn was an active member of the Northern California component of Angle Society. He played a key role in the first annual reunion of Angle School in Pasadena, California. Hahn served as the Chairman of Northern Component of Angle Society when [[Edward Angle]] presented his newly developed edgewise appliance. He modified Angle's ribbon arch mechanism by banding the premolars for cases in which he did extractions.

Hahn served as assistant professor at University of California Dental School in 1930 and then served as Chairman of the program before World War II. In his career, Dr. Hahn published about 50 articles on clinical Orthodontics. One of his most well-known works is the article called ''Retention, the Stepchild of Orthodontia'' which was published in 1943 in [[Angle Orthodontist]].&lt;ref name="Angle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hahn|first1=George|title=Retention–The Stepchild of Orthodontia|journal=Angle Orthodontist|date=1944|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/abs/10.1043/0003-3219(1944)014%3C0003%3ARSOO%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hahn moved back to Berkeley where he worked at private practice until his retirement in 1964. He died at the age of 83 following a brief illness after cerebral hemorrhage.

[[ICF International]] provided technical assistance during the survey.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|pages: xiii, xv}}

The survey covered both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. Its objectives were to collect data on knowledge and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and measure HIV prevalence among women and men age 15–49.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: xv}} The data was collected 16 December 2011 to 24 May 2012.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: 7}}

These results were not statistically different from the results of the previous survey in 2007–08.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: 111}} [[Njombe Region|Njombe region]] had the highest rate of positive women, 15.4 percent&lt;ref&gt;At a 95 percent [[confidence interval|confidence level]], the rate was 10.8 to 19.9 percent. Refer to page 221 of the survey.&lt;/ref&gt; (240 tested), and men, 14.2 percent&lt;ref&gt;At a 95 percent [[confidence interval|confidence level]], however, the rate was 7.6 to 20.7 percent. Refer to page 221 of the survey.&lt;/ref&gt; (200 tested).&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: 110}} The rate for men was higher than for women in only two of Tanzania's 30 regions.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: 110}} The rate for both men and women was highest for people in the highest wealth quintile.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: 110}}

The HIV positive rate for uncircumcised men was higher than for circumcised men in every five-year age group except for the 15–19 age group.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: 119}} This was also true when the survey results were stratified by urban versus rural areas instead of by age group.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: 119}}

Among couples living in the same household (married or not), 4.6 were [[serodiscordant]], where one was HIV positive and the other was negative. The Njombe region had the highest rate, 16.2 percent. The only other region above 10 percent was the [[Dar es Salaam Region|Dar es Salaam region]].&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: 121}}

===Results for the 15 to 24 age group===

The survey tested 3,852 women and 3,393 men&lt;ref name="Weighted"/&gt; in this age group from every [[Regions of Tanzania|administrative region]] of Tanzania for HIV infection. The survey found that 2.7 percent&lt;ref&gt;At a 95 percent [[confidence interval|confidence level]], the rate was 2.0 to 3.3 percent. Refer to page 202 of the survey.&lt;/ref&gt; of women were HIV positive, which was significantly higher than the 1.2 percentage rate&lt;ref&gt;At a 95 percent [[confidence interval|confidence level]], the rate was 0.7 to 1.7 percent. Refer to page 202 of the survey.&lt;/ref&gt; for men. [[Njombe Region|Njombe region]] had the highest rate of positive women, 8.6 percent&lt;ref&gt;At a 95 percent [[confidence interval|confidence level]], however, the rate was 1.4 to 15.9 percent. Refer to page 221 of the survey.&lt;/ref&gt; (75 tested), while [[Kigoma Region|Kigoma region]] had the highest rate for men, 3.6 percent&lt;ref&gt;At a 95 percent [[confidence interval|confidence level]], however, the rate was 0.0 to 9.4 percent. Refer to page 218 of the survey.&lt;/ref&gt; (153 tested). The rate for men was higher than for women in only six of Tanzania's 30 regions. The rate for both men and women was highest for people in the highest wealth quintile.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;{{rp|page: 116}}

===Results for the 25 to 49 age group===

The survey tested 6,072 women and 4,209 men&lt;ref&gt;These are actual numbers, not [[Sampling_(statistics)#Survey_weights|weighted]] numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; in this age group from every [[Regions of Tanzania|administrative region]] of Tanzania for HIV infection. The survey found that 7.5 percent of women were HIV positive, which was significantly higher than the 5.2 percentage rate for men. [[Njombe Region|Njombe region]] had the highest rate of positive women, 18.6 percent (199 tested), and men, 21.4 percent (149 tested). The rate for men was higher than for women in only four of Tanzania's 30 regions.&lt;ref&gt;The statistics presented for this age group are derived from the data presented in Appendix B of the ''Tanzania HIV/AIDS and Malaria Indicator Survey 2011-12''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==High risk groups==

Populations at high risk for HIV infection include [[sex workers]], miners, [[police officer]]s, prisoners, people in the transport sector, and the military. Injecting drug use is also increasing, highlighting the need to improve prevention efforts and expand access to treatment and care.&lt;ref name=us&gt;[http://www.pepfar.gov/pepfar/press/81642.htm "2008 Country Profile: Tanzania"]. [[U.S. Department of State]] (2008). Accessed August 25, 2008. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health sector challenges==

The greatest challenge facing the health sector is inadequate human resources to deliver quality health services to the Tanzanian population. Since the 1990s, structural adjustment policies and HIV/AIDS have greatly reduced the health-sector workforce. A second challenge is poverty, important because the cost of drugs and health services has constituted a financial barrier to access. Tanzania has formulated its second "Poverty Reduction Strategy" paper to reinforce its commitment to overcoming poverty. Tanzania also continues to struggle with the issue of corruption, with the [[health care]] sector being ranked as the second most corrupt sector in the country by the country's Economic and Social Research Foundation. Due in part to the vast size of the country, health services do not currently meet acceptable quality standards, and access to voluntary counseling and testing services varies greatly. Overall, while services may be available, the human and physical infrastructure is in need of improvement to allow for better quality patient care.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

===Chronic diseases===
There has been an observed increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as [[type 2 diabetes]], [[obesity]], and [[hypertension]]. This increase in prevalence of [[chronic disease]]s has been attributed to lifestyle changes and increased [[urbanization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aschner|first1=Pablo|title=Diabetes trends in Latin America|journal=Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews|date=September 2002|volume=18|issue=S3|pages=S27–S31|doi=10.1002/dmrr.280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved access to processed foods has led to higher consumption of highly processed snacks and sugar-containing drinks in rural areas of Nicaragua, and raw sugar cane is often freely available. Complementary feeding practices involving [[breastfeeding]] paired up with supplementation of artificial snacks were frequently observed amongst 6-to 8-month-olds. These early introduction to highly processed foods leads to increased risk of infections and impaired developmental growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Contreras|first=Mariela|last2=Zelaya Blandón|first2=Elmer|last3=Persson|first3=Lars-Åke|last4=Ekström|first4=Eva-Charlotte|date=2016-01-01|title=Consumption of highly processed snacks, sugar-sweetened beverages and child feeding practices in a rural area of Nicaragua|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|volume=12|issue=1|pages=164–176|doi=10.1111/mcn.12144|issn=1740-8709|pmid=25134722}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, WHO reported that 55.5% of the population was overweight and 22.2% classified as obese,&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2011). Noncommunicable diseases country profiles 2011: Nicaragua. ''WHO,'' 139.&lt;/ref&gt; and trends reveal that obesity rates are steadily rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laux|first=Timothy S.|last2=Bert|first2=Philip J.|last3=González|first3=Marvin|last4=Unruh|first4=Mark|last5=Aragon|first5=Aurora|last6=Lacourt|first6=Cecilia Torres|date=2016-12-12|title=Prevalence of obesity, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption by socioeconomic status among six communities in Nicaragua|journal=Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health|volume=32|issue=3|pages=217–225|issn=1020-4989|pmc=4387569|pmid=23183562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypertension and pre-hypertension are significant national medical concerns. Studies conducted in rural communities of Nicaragua that have revealed that 41.1% of their residents have hypertension. Beyond these patients who have met this traditional hypertensive minimum cut-off, there is also a large population of pre-hypertensive patients. [[Health promotion]]al efforts that focus on preventative measures have been proposed to address this pre-hypertensive sub-population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alicea-Planas|first1=Jessica|last2=Greiner|first2=Lydia|last3=Greiner|first3=Philip A.|title=Hypertension and related lifestyle factors among persons living in rural Nicaragua|journal=Applied Nursing Research|date=February 2016|volume=29|pages=43–46|doi=10.1016/j.apnr.2015.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicable diseases===

==== Tuberculosis ====
In Nicaragua, 48% of [[tuberculosis]] (TB) patients have encountered issues with employment and 27% had reported social problems because of stigma associated with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macq|first=Jean|last2=Solis|first2=Alejandro|last3=Martinez|first3=Guillermo|last4=Martiny|first4=Patrick|last5=Dujardin|first5=Bruno|title=An exploration of the social stigma of tuberculosis in five "municipios" of Nicaragua to reflect on local interventions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2005.01.003|journal=Health Policy|volume=74|issue=2|pages=205–217|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2005.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reduce false community beliefs and fears about tuberculosis that could be feeding into this social stigma, various solutions have been proposed and attempted in communities throughout the country.

In order to increase local awareness of this disease and improve TB control, volunteer-run TB clubs have been created in municipalities across Nicaragua to facilitate the creation of supportive community networks and lead educational workshops for citizens. These TB clubs have been reported to be a cost-effective strategy for controlling the spread of TB in Nicaragua; however, some have argued that they lack lack of sustainability in funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plamondon|first=Katrina M.|last2=Hanson|first2=Lori|last3=Labonté|first3=Ronald|last4=Abonyi|first4=Sylvia|date=2008-01-01|title=The Global Fund and Tuberculosis in Nicaragua: Building Sustainable Capacity?|journal=Canadian Journal of Public Health / Revue Canadienne de Sante'e Publique|volume=99|issue=4|pages=355–358|jstor=41995119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the educational realm, a team of researchers found that they could reduce internalized social stigma of TB patients in rural Nicaragua by pursuing patient-centered care that allowed for medical professionals to see patients at their homes and gain a better understanding of the support given to them by their social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macq|first=Jean|last2=Solis|first2=Alejandro|last3=Martinez|first3=Guillermo|last4=Martiny|first4=Patrick|date=2008-05-08|title=Tackling tuberculosis patients' internalized social stigma through patient centred care: An intervention study in rural Nicaragua|url=http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-8-154|journal=BMC Public Health|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-154|issn=1471-2458|pmc=2396624|pmid=18466604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== HIV/AIDS ====
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Nicaragua}}

Though the prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]] amongst Nicaraguan adults was estimated to be 0.3% by UNAIDS in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS (2015). Nicaragua Report. Available from: http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/Nicaragua%20NCPI%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the past UNAIDS' numbers have been claimed to be grossly underreported due to data collection issues.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manji|first=A.|last2=Peña|first2=R.|last3=Dubrow|first3=R.|date=2007-09-01|title=Sex, condoms, gender roles, and HIV transmission knowledge among adolescents in León, Nicaragua: Implications for HIV prevention|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540120701244935|journal=AIDS Care|volume=19|issue=8|pages=989–995|doi=10.1080/09540120701244935|issn=0954-0121|pmid=17851995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicaragua's high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), high risk sexual behaviors associated with the culture of machismo, low prevalence of condom usage, and the early age of first sexual intercourse of its citizens all contribute to concerns about rising HIV/AIDS rates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In Latin America, stigma and discrimination against HIV/AIDS serve as barriers to effective responses and are linked to social inequalities associated with gender, living status, and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ugarte | first1 = W. | year = 2013 | title = Measuring HIV- and AIDS-related stigma and discrimination in Nicaragua: Results from a Community-Based Study | url = | journal = AIDS Education and Prevention | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 164–178 | doi=10.1521/aeap.2013.25.2.164}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that while 90% of Nicaraguan adolescents would accept and care for a family member with HIV/AIDS, only 69% would tell anyone else if they got diagnosed as HIV-infected and only 46% would share food with someone who was infected.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Nine years following the detection of the first HIV case in Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government instituted Law 238 to protect the rights of those infected with HIV/AIDS in regards to confidentiality, access to healthcare, and nondiscrimination,&lt;ref&gt;National Assembly of Nicaragua. (1999). Ley 238: Promoción, Protección y Defensa de los Derechos Humanos ante el SIDA [Law 238: For the promotion, protection, and defense of human rights of people living with HIV/ AIDS].&lt;/ref&gt; setting the precedent for future intervention strategies focused on decreasing AIDs stigma amongst various professionals, including health care workers.

==== Mosquito-transmitted diseases ====
The [[Chikungunya|chikungunya]], [[Dengue virus|dengue]], and [[Zika virus|Zika]] viruses co-circulate in Nicaragua, and those infected with one or multiple of these viruses can present with similar clinical symptoms, making clinical treatment and diagnosis more difficult.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waggoner|first=Jesse J.|last2=Gresh|first2=Lionel|last3=Vargas|first3=Maria Jose|last4=Ballesteros|first4=Gabriela|last5=Tellez|first5=Yolanda|last6=Soda|first6=K.

Malaria has also been a historically major health issue in Nicaragua, and during the 1930s up to 60% of the population had malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garfield|first=R.|date=1999-07-31|title=Malaria control in Nicaragua: social and political influences on disease transmission and control activities|journal=Lancet|volume=354|issue=9176|pages=414–418|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)02226-6|issn=0140-6736|pmid=10437886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of bed-nets protecting against mosquitos have been reported to be 25.3% amongst all Nicaraguan households. Within these households, it was found that children were more often protected than adults with 46% of bed-net coverage of infants under 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kroeger | first1 = A. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1997 | title = Operational aspects of bednet impregnation for community-based malaria control in NIcaragua, Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia | url = | journal = Tropical Medicine and International Health | volume = 2 | issue = 6| pages = 589–602 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3156.1997.d01-319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infant health ===
A study conducted in 2000 revealed that poverty of Nicaraguan families heightened the risk of infant mortality. Its findings also showed that social inequity, or the contrast in wealth between a household and its surrounding neighborhood, further increased this risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peña|first=R.|last2=Wall|first2=S.|last3=Persson|first3=L. A.|date=2016-12-12|title=The effect of poverty, social inequity, and maternal education on infant mortality in Nicaragua, 1988–1993.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=90|issue=1|pages=64–69|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1446115|pmid=10630139|doi=10.2105/ajph.90.1.64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to income levels, it has been shown that violence against mothers increases the risk of infant and child mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Asling-Monemi |first1=K. |last2=Peña |first2=R. |last3=Ellsberg |first3=M.

===Violence against women===
Out of Nicaraguan women married or previously married women of childbearing age, 52% have identified having had experienced physical violence by an intimate partner at least once.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellsberg|first=Mary|last2=Caldera|first2=Trinidad|last3=Herrera|first3=Andrés|last4=Winkvist|first4=Anna|last5=Kullgren|first5=Gunnar|title=Domestic violence and emotional distress among Nicaraguan women: Results from a population-based study.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.54.1.30|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=1|pages=30–36|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.1.30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 21% of these women report having experienced a full combination of physical, emotional, and sexual violence at one or more points in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ellsberg|first1=M.|last2=Peña|first2=R.|last3=Herrera|first3=A.|last4=Liljestrand|first4=J.|last5=Winkvist|first5=A.|date=2000-12-01|title=Candies in hell: women's experiences of violence in Nicaragua|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=51|issue=11|pages=1595–1610|issn=0277-9536|pmid=11072881|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(00)00056-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence has immediate and lasting effects on its victims. An overwhelming majority of emotional distress cases amongst every-married Nicaraguan women is attributable to current or former experiences of domestic abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Domestic abuse is also correlated with higher incidence of unintended pregnancies in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salazar|first=Mariano|last2=San Sebastian|first2=Miguel|date=2014-01-01|title=Violence against women and unintended pregnancies in Nicaragua: a population-based multilevel study|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6874-14-26|journal=BMC Women's Health|volume=14|pages=26|doi=10.1186/1472-6874-14-26|issn=1472-6874|pmc=3925120|pmid=24521005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Health Care Spending Account''' (HCSA), or '''Healthcare Spending Account''' (HSA) is a type of flexible employee benefit program in [[Canada]] that aims to provide more flexibility than a traditional [[health plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Flexible Employee Benefit Programs | publisher = Canada Revenue Agency | url = http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it529/it529-e.html#P14 | accessdate = 2015-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a supplemental program, it covers items that are not normally part of the traditional plan. Generally these plans include a fixed amount per employee available to be claimed, which makes budgeting for them easier for employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The ries of HCSAs | author = Art Babcock | website = Benefits Canada | publisher = Rogers Publishing Ltd. | url = http://www.benefitscanada.com/benefits/health-benefits/the-rise-of-hcsas-16216 | date = 2011-04-26 | accessdate = 2015-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expenses that can be claimed against an HCSA are regulated by the [[Canada Revenue Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HCSA: What’s covered under CRA | author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | url = http://www.smallbizadvisor.ca/group-benefits/hcsa-whats-covered-under-cra-1129 | website = Small Biz Advisor | publisher = Rogers Publishing Ltd. | date = 2012-04-02 | accessdate = 2015-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Covered &amp; Non-covered Expenses==

HCSA covers expenses connected with health, vision and dental care for you, your spouse, or any dependents (children) qualified by the Canada Revenue Agency. But expenses caused by cosmetic surgery, hair removal/regeneration, non-prescription lenses, over-the-counter drugs without an actual prescription signed by registered medical staff, etc. cannot be paid using your Health Care Spending Account.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30453">In Norway, all hospitals are funded by the public as part of the [[national budget]].&lt;ref name="commonwealthfund.org"&gt;http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2010/jun/1417_squires_intl_profiles_622.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, while medical treatment is free of charge for any person younger than the age of sixteen, residents who have reached adulthood must pay a deductible each year before becoming eligible for an exemption card. The card entitles one to free healthcare for the remainder of that year.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Healthcare is NOT Free in Norway|url = http://mylittlenorway.com/2013/12/healthcare-in-not-free-in-norway/|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All public hospitals in Norway are run by four Regional Health Authorities (RHA) overseen by the Ministry of Health and Care Services. In addition to these public hospitals, there are a small number of privately owned health clinics currently operating.

==Availability and cost==

Expenditure on healthcare is about USD $6,647 per head per year (2016), among the highest in the world.&lt;ref name="commonwealthfund.org"/&gt; It has the highest proportion of nurses and midwives per head in Europe - 1,744 per 100,000 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/prop.-1-s-gul-bok-20172018/id2574460/sec1&lt;/ref&gt;

While the availability of public healthcare is universal in Norway, there are certain payment stipulations.

Children aged sixteen or younger, and pregnant and/or nursing women are given free healthcare regardless of the coverage they may have had in previous situations. All citizens are otherwise responsible for the annual deductible - which averages around 2040 [[Norwegian krone]]  (about $246.00 USD.) Norway’s health system also does not cover specialized care for those above 16 years of age, and anyone needing treatment such as specialized physiotherapy is required to pay an additional deductible. While health appointments themselves are encompassed by the deductible, extra materials and medical equipment are often covered by the patient.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In terms of emergency room admission, all immediate healthcare costs are covered. In the case that hospitals in Norway are unable to treat a patient, then treatment abroad is arranged free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;Botten, G. &amp; Frich, J. (2014). Helsetjenestens nye logikk (s. 1-3). Oslo: Akademika.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health expenses and governmental funding==

[[Norway]] scores overall very high on different rankings in health care performances worldwide. Unique for the Norwegian health care system is that the state funds almost all expenses a patient would have. Patients with extra high expenses due to a permanent illness receive a tax deduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Profiles of Health care systems|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2010/jun/1417_squires_intl_profiles_622.pdf|website=The Common Wealth Fund|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 9.4 percent of the country’s [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] went to health spending, and only about 1.4 percent of that was private spending.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Health statistics 2017|url=http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/health-data.htm|website=OECD|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, 10,4 per cent of the country`s GDP went to health spending. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/helsesat|title=2018-03-14|work=ssb.no|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;Norway is one of the countries in the world where private spending on health care is the lowest percent of the total. In 2007, out-of-pocket payments made up 15 percent of total health expenditure, in 2010 out-of-pocket money payments are up to 15,3 per cent, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$state$time$value=2010;&amp;entities$show$geo$/$in@=nor;;;;&amp;marker$axis_y$which=out_of_pocket_share_of_total_health_spending_percent&amp;scaleType=linear&amp;spaceRef:null;;;&amp;chart-type=linechart|title=Gapminder Tools|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting moderate cost-sharing requirements.&lt;ref name="commonwealth"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Profiles of health care systems|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2010/jun/1417_squires_intl_profiles_622.pdf|website=The commonwealthfund|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government creates an annual health [[budget]] for the following year, every year in December. This budget includes all expenses within the health branch of Norway. The parliament has only on some occasions voted for additional funds later in the year, primarily for hospitals. The [[welfare]] state costs a lot to maintain and to improve after the standard and inflation of the year. Pension, regulated after age, is the largest expense in the budget section covering health and welfare. The government has in the year of 2018 increased expenses and funding to the health sector with 2 percent compared to last year, with the goal to shorten the length of waiting lines and improve health services.&lt;ref name="Regjeringen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prop. 1 S 2017-2018|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/prop.-1-s-gul-bok-20172018/id2574460/sec1|website=Regjeringen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds for hospital care are allocated to the regional health authorities after the budget is passed for the coming year. They are responsible to distribute the financial funding to hospitals and other health services locally.

==History and development==

After the [[World War II|second world war]] the government of Norway decided to include [[National Health Care|national health care]] as one of their main focuses in the development of the welfare state. The state is responsible to provide good and necessary health services for everyone.&lt;ref name="Botton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Botton|first1=Grete|author2=Jan Frich|title=Helsetjenestens nye logikk|date=2014|publisher=Oslo: Akademika|location=Oslo|isbn=9788232103485|pages=1–3|url=https://www.akademika.no/helsetjenestens-nye-logikk/botten-grete/hagen-terje-p/nordby-halvor/9788232103485}}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility is divided between three levels of governmental responsibility. First the state government, second the county and lastly the local council. The government is responsible for developing laws and passing bills, but the department of Health and Care has the main responsibility for the daily running and operations regarding health politics and health services in Norway.&lt;ref name="Høines"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Høines|title=Helsesektoren, norsk helseinformatikk|url=https://ndla.no/nb/node/4000?fag=8|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An arraignment was developed in 2001 that gave each citizen the right to have a permanent doctor in the area they lived in. The city council in every county is responsible for this right, and they also initiate agreements and cooperation with the doctors.&lt;ref name="SNL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helsereformer|url=https://snl.no/helsereformer|website=Store Norske Leksikon|accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This improvement is one of several in the healthcare that Norway have to offer. The different reforms has in common that they all came as a reaction to an inefficient system that did not take full advantage of all available recourses. Another major reform that came in the beginning of the 21st century, was the health reform of 2002.

==Hospital reform of 2002==

In 2002 the government took over the responsibility of running all the hospitals in the country. [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]] was the prime minister at this time. He was the leader of the party [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|KrF]] and he was head of a government in coalition with two other parties, [[Høyre]] and [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Venstre]]. Up until this date the hospitals in Norway was operated by the county and the city council. The goal was to improve the quality of medical treatment, to run the hospitals more efficiently than earlier and to make medical treatment equally available to everyone in the country.&lt;ref name="SNL"/&gt; The reform was inspired by thoughts from the [[New public management|New Public Management]] movement, and major changes was realized after these principles. Hospitals and services was organized in to five regional health-companies. They are independent legal entities organized after the same principles as a corporation, with a few exceptions. The health companies are only owned by the government, they cannot go bankrupt and is guaranteed by the government. The government also loans and gives them financing from state funding.&lt;ref name="Bollingmo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jensen, Bollingmo|first1=Bjarne, Magnar|title=Helsereform, utfordringer og løsninger|date=2007|publisher=Høgskolen i Hedmark|location=Elverum|isbn=978-82-7671-633-7|pages=7–58|url=https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/133754/rapp15_2007.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform was to some extent successful. Patient waiting lists before treatment were reduced with almost 20 thousand patients. But the spending on healthcare in Norway increased, and after a year the financial deficit reached almost 3.1 billion.&lt;ref name="NRK"&gt;{{cite web|title=20.00 færre i sykehuskø|url=https://www.nrk.no/emne/helsereformen-2002-1.507435|website=NRK|publisher=NRK|accessdate=2 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, efficiency improvements in treatments can be noticed by patients when they have less time with the doctor and sometimes must check out of the hospital the same day.

==Pharmaceuticals==

Norway does not produce the bulk of pharmaceuticals consumed domestically, and imports the majority that are used in its health system. This has resulted in most residents having to pay full price for any prescription. Pharmaceutical exporting is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Care Services. Insurance coverage for medicine imported from outside the country is managed through the Norwegian Health Economics Administration (HELFO).&lt;ref&gt;Høines, Ø. (2009, 03.03.2017).

==Administration==

Norway has four designated Regional Health Authorities. They are: [[Northern Norway Regional Health Authority]], [[Central Norway Regional Health Authority]], [[Western Norway Regional Health Authority]], and [[Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority]].&lt;ref name="snl.no"&gt;https://snl.no/helsereformer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snl.no"/&gt; According to the Patients' Rights Act,&lt;ref&gt;https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/133754/rapp15_2007.pdf?sequence=1
&lt;/ref&gt; all eligible persons have the right to a choice in hospitals when receiving treatment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrk.no/emne/helsereformen-2002-1.507435&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==

The Norwegian Health Care System was ranked number 11 in overall performance by the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html|title=The World Health Organization's ranking of the world's health systems|work=photius.com|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[World Health Organization's ranking of health care systems|2000 report]] evaluating the [[health care system]]s of each of the 191 [[United Nations]] [[Member states of the United Nations|member nations]].  According to the [[Euro health consumer index]], in 2015 the Norwegian health system was ranked third in Europe but had inexplicably long waiting lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health topics ==

== Life expectancy and death ==
The report, 2016 shows that life expectancy has increased by five years, from 76.8 years in 1990 to 81.4 years in 2013. The reduction in deaths from cardiovascular disease is the main reason for this increase. Life expectancy in Norway in 2017, was 84,3 years in women and 80,9 years in men. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhi.no/globalassets/dokumenterfiler/rapporter/2018/helsetilstanden-i-norge-20182.pdf|title=PUBLIC HEALTH REPORT - SHORT TERM Health condition in Norway 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 to 2017, life expectancy increased by 2.7 years for men, but only by 1.6 year for women. This can be explained, for example, by different "smoking careers" for men and women. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhi.no/globalassets/dokumenterfiler/rapporter/2018/helsetilstanden-i-norge-20182.pdf|title=PUBLIC HEALTH REPORT - SHORT TERM Health condition in Norway 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public Health Report 05/2018, shows that the two main causes of death are cardiovascular disease and cancer. The mortality rate of cardiovascular disease has fallen significantly over the past 50 years, and deaths have been largely pushed to age groups over 80 years. In younger age groups, the number of deaths is low.

Annually, between 550 and 600 die of suicide, about half past 50 years of age. Compared to other countries, there are relatively many who die of drug-fatal deaths, an average of 260 per year.

Deaths due to traffic accidents have fallen considerably, the average number of death last 5 years is 138, serious injuries 678.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ssb.no/transport-og-reiseliv/statistikker/vtu/aar|title=2018-05-29|work=ssb.no|access-date=2018-09-09|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unhealthy diet ====
One of the major findings from the report (2016), is that an unhealthy diet is the most important risk factor for premature deaths in Norway.

“46 per cent of all deaths before the age of 70 in Norway can be explained by behavioural factors such as unhealthy diet, obesity, low physical activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs” says Professor Stein Emil Vollset, Director of the newly established Centre for Burden of Disease at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

“If we consider the population as a whole, it appears that an unhealthy diet represents a greater risk to public health than smoking. This is not because an unhealthy diet is more dangerous than smoking but because fewer Norwegians now smoke. Since 1990, the percentage of smokers in Norway has decreased from 35 per cent to 13 per cent”, explains Vollset. 

By addressing these risk factors, much of Norway’s disease burden could be reduced. Up to 100,000 years of life could be saved if Norwegians ate healthier diets.

Approximately 1 in 4 middle-aged men and 1 in 5 women have obesity with a body mass index of 30 kg / m2 or higher in Norway. Among children, the proportion with overweight and obesity appears to have stabilised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fhi.no/en/op/hin/risk--protective-factors/overweight-and-obesity-in-norway---/|title=Overweight and obesity in Norway|website=Norwegian Institute of Public Health|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drug overdose and suicide ====
Drug overdose and suicide rates are high. Among the under-49 age group, suicide and drug overdoses are the main causes of death in Norway, with the highest rates among the Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden).

The report shows that lower back pain, neck pain, anxiety and depression are among the main causes of poor health among the Norwegian population as a whole, while heart disease and cancer claim most lives.

==== Tobacco ====
Over the last two decades, efforts to reduce the population’s exposure to tobacco smoke combined with increased awareness of the health risks of smoking appear to be having an impact. For example, early death from tobacco smoke fell 28% between 1990 and 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/policy_report/2016/PolicyReport_IHME_GBD-Norway_2016.pdf|title=Norway: State of the Nation’s Health Findings from the Global Burden of Disease 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway 2017, 11 per cent was daily smokers, in 2007, it was 22 per cent daily smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/helse/statistikker/royk|title=2018-01-18|work=ssb.no|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pregnancy and maternity care ==
All pregnant women in Norway are entitled to maternity care from a midwife at a Maternity and Child Health Care Centre or from their General Practitioner.

There are usually eight antenatal appointments including one ultrasound screening during pregnancy. The consultations are free of charge, and pregnant employees have the right to paid time off work for antenatal appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://helsenorge.no/other-languages/english/pregnancy-and-maternity-care|title=Pregnancy and maternity care in Norway - helsenorge.no|website=helsenorge.no|language=nb-NO|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 56 600 children born in 2017, 2 300 fewer than the previous year. This gave a total fertility rate of 1.62 children per woman - the lowest measured in Norway ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ssb.no/befolkning/artikler-og-publikasjoner/rekordlav-fruktbarhet|title=Rekordlav fruktbarhet|work=ssb.no|access-date=2018-09-09|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

139 children were registered as stillborn in 2017. This corresponds to 2.4 deaths per 1,000 born and is the lowest number ever recorded.

== Infectious diseases ==
Many infectious diseases have declined globally. Higher standards of living and improved hygienic conditions are a major cause, as well as the use of vaccines. Increased international travel and import of food is causing an increase in some infectious diseases in Norway. These include some foodborne infections and infections by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhi.no/en/op/hin/smitte/infeksjoner-i-norge/|title=Norwegian Institute of Public Health|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tuberculosis ====
Tuberculosis is the most infectious disease worldwide, and is a major challenge in global health care. However, in Norway, the decline in the number of tuberculosis cases continues.

By 2017, a total of 261 patients with tuberculosis disease were reported to the Public Health Institute. This is a decline from the previous years. During the last twenty years, the highest number of patients with tuberculosis was 392 in 2013 . It makes Norway one of the countries with the lowest tuberculosis presence in the world. Differences in the global disease burden of tuberculosis are also reflected in the occurrence here in the country, where we see major inequalities based on people's country of origin. Only 11 percent of the patients who were reported with tuberculosis disease in 2017 were born in Norway, and only half of them had Norwegian-born parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fhi.no/nyheter/2018/alvorlig-tuberkulosesituasjon-internasjonalt-men-nedgang-i-norge/|title=Alvorlig tuberkulosesituasjon internasjonalt, men nedgang i Norge|website=Folkehelseinstituttet|language=no|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MDR-TB ====
The number of multiresistant tuberculosis cases is between four and 11 cases per year. By 2017, nine patients were diagnosed with multiresistant tuberculosis. None of these had developed resistance during treatment in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fhi.no/nyheter/2018/alvorlig-tuberkulosesituasjon-internasjonalt-men-nedgang-i-norge/|title=Alvorlig tuberkulosesituasjon internasjonalt, men nedgang i Norge|website=Folkehelseinstituttet|language=no|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preventive treatment Latent Tuberculosis ====
Most cases of tuberculosis disease in Norway are detected early and therefore do not lead to disease of others.

An important part of the tuberculosis work in this country is precisely to ensure that people with an increased risk of post-infection disease development are offered preventive treatment. In addition to those who are thought to be newly infected, these risk groups include children and persons with impaired immune system.

The number of people receiving preventive treatment is still too low, according to the Institute of Public Health. The number of preventive treatments is expected to be greater than the number treated for tuberculosis disease, but in several counties these groups are almost as large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fhi.no/nyheter/2018/alvorlig-tuberkulosesituasjon-internasjonalt-men-nedgang-i-norge/|title=Alvorlig tuberkulosesituasjon internasjonalt, men nedgang i Norge|website=Folkehelseinstituttet|language=no|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== HIV/AIDS ====
HIV infection has been proven in all countries of the world. UNAIDS estimates that by the end of 2016 approximately 36.7 million people living with HIV infection, approximately 17 million of these have access to antiviral treatment. Since the start of the epidemic, it is estimated that approx. 78 million people have been infected with HIV and approximately 35 million people have died of AIDS-related illnesses. Globally, women account for 52% of the HIV-infected persons. About. 69% of the HIV-infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. About. 1.8 million are now infected globally annually with HIV (2016). This is the lowest number of newly diagnosed since the mid 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fhi.no/nettpub/smittevernveilederen/sykdommer-a-a/hivinfeksjonaids---veileder-for-hel/#forekomst-i-norge|title=Hivinfeksjon/Aids|website=Folkehelseinstituttet|language=no|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, HIV infection and AIDS has also been proven, and from 1983, the Public Health Institute in Oslo, has been doing the statistics, showing overall low incidense. In 2017, it is 18 cases diagnosed with AIDS and 213 cases diagnosed with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msis.no/|title=MSIS Statistikk - folkehelseinstituttet|website=www.msis.no|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who test HIV positive will be referred to a doctor with a good knowledge of HIV. Treatment for HIV infection is usually handled by a specialist health service in the hospital. For people who live far from a hospital, the local doctor can collaborate with the specialists to give the best possible local support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fhi.no/globalassets/dokumenterfiler/trykksaker/hiv/about-hiv-infection-pdf2.pdf|title=NPHI: About HIV Infection 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DALYs in Norway 1990 - 2016 ==
The Disability Adjusted Life Years per percent is dominated of Non-communicable diseases, NCDs. Low back and neck pain has the highest share, 8,08% of total DALYs, but it is slightly decreasing. Ischemic heart disease is second largest with 7,42% of total DALYs, COPD is increasing and has 3,09% of total DALYs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ihmeuw.org/4kw1|title=GBD Compare {{!}} IHME Viz Hub|website=ihmeuw.org|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries, including violence and self harm, has got a smaller share of total DALYs. Falls has got the largest share within this area with 2,93% of total DALYs and is most increasing. Self harm is second largest and with 2%, and road injuries has 1,44% of total DALYs, both decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ihmeuw.org/4kw1|title=GBD Compare {{!}} IHME Viz Hub|website=ihmeuw.org|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communicable, neonatal, maternal and nutritional diseases, has the smallest share of the total DALYs. The largest share within this area is: Lower respiratory diseases, 1,22% of total DALYs. Diarrheal diseases are increasing and has got 0,34% of total DALYs. HIV/AIDS is small and decreasing and has got 0,087% of total DALYs. Tuberculosis is even smaller and decreasing, with 0,045% of total DALYs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ihmeuw.org/4kw1|title=GBD Compare {{!}} IHME Viz Hub|website=ihmeuw.org|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Nations: Sustainable development goals, SDGs 2016-2030 ==
Norway regards the 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a transformative global roadmap for both national and international efforts aimed at eradicating extreme poverty, while protecting planetary boundaries and promoting prosperity, peace and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/memberstates/norway|title=Norway .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway was also a part of the 2016 voluntary national review of the high level political forum on Sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/vnrs/|title=Voluntary National Reviews .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN reports and various international indexes show that Norway ranks high in terms of global implementation of the SDGs. At the same time, it is evident that implementing the 2030 Agenda will be demanding for Norway, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/vnrs/|title=Voluntary National Reviews .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government has identified a number of targets that pose particular challenges for domestic follow-up in Norway. These challenges relate to several of the SDGs and all three dimensions of sustainable development – social, economic, and environmental. Targets that are likely to remain the focus of political attention and policy development are those relating to sustainable consumption and production, health and education, equality, employment, and migration. The Government is giving priority to ensuring quality education and employment, especially for young people and those at risk of marginalisation. This is an important contribution to realising the 2030 Agenda vision of leaving no one behind. Challenges that have been identified at the national level:

* Reducing non-communicable diseases and promoting mental health
* Increasing high-school completion rates
* Eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls
* Reducing the proportion of young people not in employment, education or training
* Ensuring sustainable infrastructure
* Sustaining income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average
* Improving urban air quality
* Halving food waste and reducing waste generation
* Reducing the impact of invasive alien species
* Reducing all forms of violence and related death rates and combating organised crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/memberstates/norway|title=Norway .:.

A '''hospital-acquired infection''' ('''HAI'''), also known as a '''nosocomial infection''', is an [[infection]] that is acquired in a [[hospital]] or other [[health care]] facility. To emphasize both hospital and nonhospital settings, it is sometimes instead called a '''health care–associated infection''' ('''HAI''' or '''HCAI''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hai/surveillance/index.html|title=HAI Data and Statistics  {{!}} HAI {{!}} CDC|date=2018-01-10|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an infection can be acquired in hospital, [[nursing home care|nursing home]], [[physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation facility]], outpatient clinic, or other clinical settings. Infection is spread to the susceptible patient in the clinical setting by various means. Health care staff can spread infection, in addition to contaminated equipment, bed linens, or air droplets. The infection can originate from the outside environment, another infected patient, staff that may be infected, or in some cases, the source of the infection cannot be determined. In some cases the microorganism originates from the patient's own skin microbiota, becoming opportunistic after surgery or other procedures that compromise the protective skin barrier. Though the patient may have contracted the infection from their own skin, the infection is still considered nosocomial since it develops in the health care setting.

In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimated roughly 1.7 million hospital-associated infections, from all types of [[microorganism]]s, including [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] combined, cause or contribute to 99,000 deaths each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klevens |first1=R.

== Cause ==

=== Transmission ===
[[Indwelling catheters]] have recently been identified with hospital acquired infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hai/ca_uti/uti.html|title=Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI)  {{!}} HAI {{!}} CDC|date=2017-07-19|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures using [[Intravascular Antimicrobial Lock Therapy]] can reduce infections that are unexposed to blood-borne antibiotics. Introducing antibiotics, including ethanol, into the catheter (without flushing it into the bloodstream) reduces the formation of biofilms.&lt;ref name="AkbariKjellerup2015"/&gt; 
{| class="wikitable"
|+Main routes of transmission
!Route
!Description
|-
|Contact transmission
|The most important and frequent mode of transmission of nosocomial infections is by direct contact.
|-
|Droplet transmission
|Transmission occurs when droplets containing microbes from the infected person are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the patient's body; droplets are generated from the source person mainly by coughing, sneezing, and talking, and during the performance of certain procedures, such as bronchoscopy. 
|-
|[[Airborne transmission]]
|Dissemination can be either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue {5 [[micrometre|µm]] or smaller in size} of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient, depending on environmental factors; therefore, special air-handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Microorganisms transmitted by airborne transmission include ''[[Legionella]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and the [[rubeola]] and [[varicella]] viruses.
|-
|Common vehicle transmission
|This applies to microorganisms transmitted to the host by contaminated items, such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment.
|-
|[[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector borne transmission]]
|This occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin transmit microorganisms.
|}

Contact transmission is divided into two subgroups: direct-contact transmission and indirect-contact transmission.
{| class="wikitable"
|+Routes of contact transmission
!Route
!Description
|-
|Direct-contact transmission
|This involves a direct body surface-to-body surface contact and physical transfer of microorganisms between a susceptible host and an infected or colonized person, such as when a person turns a patient, gives a patient a bath, or performs other [[health care|patient-care]] activities that require direct personal contact. Direct-contact transmission also can occur between two patients, with one serving as the source of the infectious microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host.
|-
|Indirect-contact transmission
|This involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, such as contaminated instruments, [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]s, or dressings, or contaminated gloves that are not changed between patients. In addition, the improper use of saline flush syringes, vials, and bags has been implicated in disease transmission in the US, even when healthcare workers had access to gloves, disposable needles, intravenous devices, and flushes.&lt;ref name=salineflush&gt;{{cite journal

==Prevention==
[[File:Making Health Care Safer-CDC Vital Signs-March 2012.pdf|thumb]]
Controlling nosocomial infection is to implement [[Quality Assurance|QA]]/[[Quality control|QC]] measures to the [[health care]] sectors, and evidence-based management can be a feasible approach.

To reduce HAIs, the state of Maryland implemented the Maryland Hospital-Acquired Conditions Program that provides financial rewards and penalties for individual hospitals based on their ability to avoid HAIs. An adaptation of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services payment policy causes poor-performing hospitals to lose up to 3% of their inpatient revenues, whereas hospitals that are able to avoid HAIs can earn up to 3% in rewards. During the program’s first 2 years, complication rates fell by 15.26 percent across all hospital-acquired conditions tracked by the state (including those not covered by the program), from a risk-adjusted complication rate of 2.38 per 1,000 people in 2009 to a rate of 2.02 in 2011. The 15.26-percent decline translates into more than $100 million in cost savings for the health care system in Maryland, with the largest savings coming from avoidance of urinary tract infections, septicemia and other severe infections, and pneumonia and other lung infections. If similar results could be achieved nationwide, the Medicare program would save an estimated $1.3 billion over 2 years, while the health care system as a whole would save $5.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/statewide-all-payer-financial-incentives-significantly-reduce-hospital-acquired-conditions |title=Statewide, All-Payer Financial Incentives Significantly Reduce Hospital-Acquired Conditions in Maryland Hospitals |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospitals have sanitation protocols regarding [[scrubs (clothing)|uniforms]], equipment [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], washing, and other preventive measures. Thorough [[hand washing]] and/or use of [[Hand sanitizer|alcohol rubs]] by all medical personnel before and after each patient contact is one of the most effective ways to combat nosocomial infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McBryde ES, Bradley LC, Whitby M, McElwain DL |title=An investigation of contact transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus |journal=J. Hosp. Infect. |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=104–8 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15474180 |doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2004.06.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More careful use of [[antimicrobial]] agents, such as [[antibiotic]]s, is also considered vital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Making Health Care Safer: A Critical Analysis of Patient Safety Practices |author=Lautenbach E |chapter=Chapter 14. Impact of Changes in Antibiotic Use Practices on Nosocomial Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance—''Clostridium difficile'' and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/ptsafety/ |editor=Markowitz AJ |year=2001 |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |chapterurl= http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/ptsafety/chap14.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite sanitation protocol, patients cannot be entirely isolated from infectious agents. Furthermore, patients are often prescribed antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs to help treat illness; this may increase the [[natural selection|selection pressure]] for the emergence of resistant strains.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Sterilization===
Sterilization goes further than just sanitizing. It kills all microorganisms on equipment and surfaces through exposure to chemicals, ionizing radiation, dry heat, or steam under pressure.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Isolation===
{{Main article|Isolation (health care)}}
Isolation is the implementation of isolating precautions designed to prevent transmission of microorganisms by common routes in hospitals. (See [[Universal precautions]] and [[Transmission-based precautions]].) Because agent and host factors are more difficult to control, interruption of transfer of microorganisms is directed primarily at transmission for example isolation of infectious cases in special hospitals and isolation of patient with infected wounds in special rooms also isolation of joint transplantation patients on specific rooms.

===Handwashing===
Handwashing frequently is called the single most important measure to reduce the risks of transmitting [[skin flora|skin microorganism]]s from one person to another or from one site to another on the same patient. Washing hands as promptly and thoroughly as possible between patient contacts and after contact with [[blood]], [[body fluid]]s, [[secretion]]s, [[excretion]]s, and equipment or articles contaminated by them is an important component of infection control and isolation precautions. 
The spread of nosocomial infections, among immunocompromised patients is connected with health care workers' hand contamination in almost 40% of cases, and is a challenging problem in the modern hospitals. The best way for workers to overcome this problem is conducting correct hand-hygiene procedures; this is why the WHO launched in 2005 the GLOBAL Patient Safety Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;World Alliance for patient safety. WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care. http://www.who.int/rpc/guidelines/9789241597906/en/. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Two categories of micro-organisms can be present on health care workers' hands: transient flora and resident flora. The first is represented by the micro-organisms taken by workers from the environment, and the bacteria in it are capable of surviving on the human skin and sometimes to grow. The second group is represented by the permanent micro-organisms living on the skin surface (on the stratum corneum or immediately under it). They are capable of surviving on the human skin and to grow freely on it. They have low pathogenicity and infection rate, and they create a kind of protection from the colonization from other more pathogenic bacteria. The skin of workers is colonized by 3.9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; – 4.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The microbes comprising the resident flora are: ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'', ''S. hominis'', and ''Microccocus'', ''Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Dermobacterium'', and ''Pitosporum'' spp., while transient organisms are ''S. aureus'', and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'', and ''Acinetobacter, Enterobacter'' and ''Candida'' spp. The goal of hand hygiene is to eliminate the transient flora with a careful and proper performance of hand washing, using different kinds of soap, (normal and antiseptic), and alcohol-based gels. The main problems found in the practice of hand hygiene is connected with the lack of available sinks and time-consuming performance of hand washing. An easy way to resolve this problem could be the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, because of faster application compared to correct hand-washing.&lt;ref&gt;Hugonnet S, Perneger TV, Pittet D. Alcohol based hand rub improves compliance with hand hygiene in intensive care units. Arch Intern med 2002; 162: 1037-1043.&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving patient hand washing has also been shown to reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. Patients who are bed-bound often do not have as much access to clean their hands at mealtimes or after touching surfaces or handling waste such as tissues.  By reinforcing the importance of handwashing and providing santizing gel or wipes within reach of the bed, nurses were directly able to reduce infection rates.  A study published in 2017 demonstrated this by improving patient education on both proper hand-washing procedure and important times to use sanitizer and successfully reduced the rate of enterococci and "S. aureus".&lt;ref&gt;Haverstick, Stacy. ( 2017, June). Patients' Hand Washing and Reducing Hospital-Acquired Infection. Critical Care Nurse 37, no 3: e1-e8. http://ccn.aacnjournals.org/content/37/3/e1.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

All visitors must follow the same procedures as hospital staff to adequately control the spread of infections. Moreover, multidrug-resistant infections can leave the hospital and become part of the community [[flora (microbiology)|flora]] if steps are not taken to stop this transmission.

It is unclear whether or not nail polish or rings affected surgical wound infection rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrowsmith|first1=VA|last2=Taylor|first2=R|title=Removal of nail polish and finger rings to prevent surgical infection.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Aug 4, 2014|volume=8|pages=CD003325|pmid=25089848|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003325.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gloves===
In addition to hand washing, [[medical gloves|gloves]] play an important role in reducing the risks of transmission of microorganisms. Gloves are worn for three important reasons in hospitals. First, they are worn to provide a protective barrier for personnel, preventing large scale contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin. In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has mandated wearing gloves to reduce the risk of [[bloodborne pathogen]] infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=16265&amp;p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER |title=Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens;Needlestick and Other Sharps Injuries; Final Rule. - 66:5317-5325 |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching a patient's mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Third, they are worn to reduce the likelihood that the hands of personnel contaminated with micro-organisms from a patient or a [[fomite]] can transmit those micro-organisms to another patient. In this situation, gloves must be changed between patient contacts, and hands should be washed after gloves are removed.

Wearing gloves does not replace the need for handwashing due to the possibility of contamination when gloves are replaced, or by damage to the glove. Doctors wearing the same gloves for multiple patient operations presents an infection control hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/865048|title=Medscape Log In|website=www.medscape.com|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface sanitation===
Sanitizing surfaces is part of nosocomial infection in health care environments. Modern sanitizing methods such as [[NAV-CO2|Non-flammable Alcohol Vapor in Carbon Dioxide systems]] have been effective against gastroenteritis, MRSA, and influenza agents. Use of [[hydrogen peroxide]] vapor has been clinically proven to reduce infection rates and risk of acquisition. Hydrogen peroxide is effective against endospore-forming bacteria, such as ''Clostridium difficile'', where alcohol has been shown to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Otter JA, French GL |title=Survival of nosocomial bacteria and spores on surfaces and inactivation by hydrogen peroxide vapor |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=205–7 |date=January 2009 |pmid=18971364 |doi=10.1128/JCM.02004-08 |pmc=2620839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=December 2015}} Ultraviolet cleaning devices may also be used to disinfect the rooms of patients infected with ''Clostridium difficile'' after discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/performance-feedback-ultraviolet-cleaning-device-and-dedicated-housekeeping-team |title=Performance Feedback, Ultraviolet Cleaning Device, and Dedicated Housekeeping Team Significantly Improve Room Cleaning, Reduce Potential for Spread of Common, Dangerous Infection |date=2014-01-15 | accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=December 2015}}&lt;!--this was only one study at one hospital; a great success story but the results have not been duplicated as far as I know Bfpage--&gt;

===Antimicrobial surfaces===
[[Micro-organisms]] are known to survive on inanimate ‘touch’ surfaces for extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, S.A., Michels, H., Keevil, C.W., 2005, The Survival of Escherichia Coli O157 on a Range of Metal Surfaces, International Journal of Food Microbiology, Vol. 105, pp. 445–454. and Michels, H.T. (2006), Anti-Microbial Characteristics of Copper, ASTM Standardization News, October, pp. 28-31&lt;/ref&gt; This can be especially troublesome in hospital environments where patients with [[immunodeficiencies]] are at enhanced risk for contracting nosocomial infections.

Touch surfaces commonly found in hospital rooms, such as bed rails, call buttons, touch plates, chairs, door handles, light switches, grab rails, intravenous poles, dispensers (alcohol gel, paper towel, soap), dressing trolleys, and counter and table tops are known to be contaminated with ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] (one of the most virulent strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) and [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] (VRE).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense-funded clinical trials, as presented at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Washington, D.C., October 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Objects in closest proximity to patients have the highest levels of  MRSA and VRE. This is why touch surfaces in hospital rooms can serve as sources, or reservoirs, for the spread of bacteria from the hands of healthcare workers and visitors to patients.

A number of compounds can decrease the risk of bacteria growing on surfaces including: [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[germicide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weber|first=DJ|author2=Rutala, WA|title=Self-disinfecting surfaces: review of current methodologies and future prospects.|journal=American journal of infection control|date=May 2013|volume=41|issue=5 Suppl|pages=S31-5|pmid=23622745|doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2012.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Among the categories of bacteria most known to infect patients are the category [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] (resistant strain of ''S. aureus''), member of [[gram-positive bacteria]] and ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' (''A. baumannii''), which is [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]]. While antibiotic drugs to treat diseases caused by gram-positive MRSA are available, few effective drugs are available for ''Acinetobacter''. ''Acinetobacter'' bacteria are evolving and becoming immune to existing antibiotics, so in many cases, [[polymyxin]]-type antibacterials need to be used. "In many respects it’s far worse than MRSA," said a specialist at [[Case Western Reserve University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Another growing disease, especially prevalent in [[New York City]] hospitals, is the drug-resistant, gram-negative ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]''. An estimated more than 20% of the ''Klebsiella'' infections in [[Brooklyn]] hospitals "are now resistant to virtually all modern antibiotics, and those supergerms are now spreading worldwide."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Pollack, Andrew. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/business/27germ.html?em=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1267412412-yP2bfl/3pu4+g34XVmluJA "Rising Threat of Infections Unfazed by Antibiotics"] New York Times, Feb. 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The bacteria, classified as gram-negative because of their reaction to the [[Gram stain]] test, can cause severe [[pneumonia]] and infections of the [[urinary tract]], bloodstream, and other parts of the body. Their cell structures make them more difficult to attack with antibiotics than gram-positive organisms like MRSA. In some cases, antibiotic resistance is spreading to gram-negative bacteria that can infect people outside the hospital. "For gram-positives we need better drugs; for gram-negatives we need any drugs," said Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious-disease specialist at [[Harbor-UCLA Medical Center]], and the author of ''Rising Plague'', a book about drug-resistant pathogens.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

One-third of nosocomial infections are considered preventable. The CDC estimates 2 million people in the United States are infected annually by hospital-acquired infections, resulting in 20,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ricks, Delthia |title=Germ Warfare |journal=Ms. Magazine |pages=43–5 |year=2007 |url=http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2007/germwarfare.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common nosocomial infections are of the [[urinary tract]], surgical site and various [[pneumonia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Klevens RM, Edwards JR, Richards CL, etal |title=Estimating health care-associated infections and deaths in U.S. hospitals, 2002 |journal=Public Health Rep |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages=160–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17357358 |pmc=1820440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The methods used differ from country to country (definitions used, type of nosocomial infections covered, health units surveyed, inclusion or exclusion of imported infections, etc.), so the international comparisons of nosocomial infection rates should be made with the utmost care.

===Belgium===
In Belgium the prevalence of nosocomial infections is about 6.2%. Annually about 125,500 patients become infected by a nosocomial infection, resulting in almost 3000 deaths. The extra costs for the health insurance are estimated to be approximately €400 million/year.&lt;ref&gt;Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg (2009) Nosocomiale Infecties in België, deel II: Impact op Mortaliteit en Kosten.

France, résultats 2007 »], Institut de veille sanitaire, Sept. 2009, ii + 60 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nosocomial infections are estimated to make patients stay in the hospital four to five additional days. Around 2004-2005, about 9,000 people died each year with a nosocomial infection, of which about 4,200 would have survived without this infection.&lt;ref&gt;Vasselle, Alain [http://www.senat.fr/rap/r05-421/r05-4211.pdf « Rapport sur la politique de lutte contre les infections nosocomiales »], Office parlementaire d'évaluation des politiques de santé, juin 2006, 290 pp. (III.5.

==History== 
[[File:Yearly mortality rates 1841-1846 two clinics.png|thumb|Mortality rates 1841–1846 in two clinics documented by Semmelweis]]

In 1841, [[Ignaz Semmelweis]], a Hungarian [[obstetrician]] was working at a Vienna maternity hospital. He was "shocked" by the death rate of women who developed [[puerperal fever]]. He documented that the [[infection]] was 20 times higher in the ward where the [[medical student]]s were delivering babies than in the next ward that was staffed by [[midwife]]ry [[student]]s. The medical students were also routinely working with [[cadaver]]s. He compared the [[epidemiology|rates of infection]] with a similar hospital in [[Dublin, Ireland]] and [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] that it was the medical students who somehow were infecting the women after labor. He instituted mandatory [[hand-washing]] in May 1847 and infection rates dropped dramatically. [[Louis Pasteur]] proposed the germ theory of disease and began his work on cholera in 1865 by identifying that it was [[microorganism]]s that were associated with [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pommerville | first = Jeffrey | title = Fundamentals of microbiology | publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning | location = Burlington, MA | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781449647964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p 13 and 16--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The prophet of bacteriology: Ignac Semmelweis (1818-1865) |url=http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/semmelweis.htm |accessdate=2015-11-28 |postscript=; archived content from, The Wayback Machine; Infect Control. 1983 Sep-Oct;4(5):367-70. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404214853/http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/semmelweis.htm |archivedate=April 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How Do I Look''''' is a 2006 American [[documentary film|documentary]] directed by [[Wolfgang Busch]]. The film chronicles [[ball culture]] in [[Harlem]] and [[Philadelphia]] over a ten-year period.

==Overview==
Wolfgang Busch began interviewing subjects from the ball circuit in the mid-1990s and continued filming for a decade.&lt;ref name="zz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/fashion/sundaystyles/22VOGUE.html|title=Still Striking a Pose|last=Trebay|first=Guy|date=May 22, 2005|publisher=nytimes.com|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''How Do I Look'' documents the ball culture, which began in the 1920s during the [[Harlem Renaissance]],&lt;ref name="kilplatrick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/philly_is_burning-38424209.html|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140716182645/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/philly_is_burning-38424209.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 16, 2014|title=Philly Is Burning|last=Kilpatrick|first=Kate|date=February 14, 2007|publisher=philadelphiaweekly.com|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since influenced mainstream artists and musicians. The film follows several ball "legends" such as [[Willi Ninja]], [[Kevin Ultra-Omni]], [[Octavia St. Laurent]], [[Pepper LaBeija]] and [[Jose Xtravaganza]]. Many of the subjects that are featured in ''How Do I Look'' were also featured in the 1990 documentary ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]]''.&lt;ref name="zz"/&gt;

''How Do I Look'' also explores the prejudices members of the ball culture face due to their sexuality and race.&lt;ref name="vv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0002,trebay,11690,5.html|title=Legends of the Ball|last=Trebay|first=Guy|date=January 11, 2000|publisher=villagevoice.com|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 ''New York Times'' article, choreographer Willi Ninja commented about the mainstream society's readiness to embrace facets of ball culture while also rejecting the Ball "children" due to their sexuality:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... "If [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] does [[Vogue (Madonna song)|voguing]], it's O.K.," he added. "But when the ball children dance, even now, people say, 'Oh, it's a bunch of crazy queens throwing themselves on the floor.'"&lt;ref name="zz"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other subjects speak about their attempts to forge careers in mainstream society and the effect that [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] has had on ball culture as many of the subjects featured died of AIDS during or shortly after filming was complete.

==Production notes==
''How Do I Look'' was filmed in [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]]. It premiered at the NewFest Film Festival in New York City in June 2006.  The assistant director was [[Kevin Burrus]].

==Home media==
''How Do I Look'' was released on Region 1 DVD in the United States.

The '''Inclusive Design Research Centre''' (IDRC) is a research and development centre at [[OCAD University]] in Toronto, Canada. The centre defines [[inclusive design]] as that which "considers the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and other forms of human difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the IDRC  |url=http://idrc.ocad.ca/index.php/about-the-idrc|publisher=Inclusive Design Research Centre (OCAD University) |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research centre is directed by [[Jutta Treviranus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff Pages |url=http://idrc.ocad.ca/index.php/about-the-idrc/staff-pages/112-jutta-treviranus-director|publisher=Inclusive Design Research Centre (OCAD University) |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the centre launched a Master of Design in Inclusive Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoda.ca/ocad-u-sees-an-accessible-future-with-new-master-program-in-inclusive-design/ |title=OCAD U Sees an Accessible Future with New Master Program in Inclusive Design |first=Jaclyn |last=Law | website=Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) |publisher=aoda.ca |date=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Master's Program |url=http://idrc.ocad.ca/index.php/workshops-aamp-trainings/masters-program |publisher=Inclusive Design Research Centre (OCAD University) |accessdate=30 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202173140/http://idrc.ocad.ca/index.php/workshops-aamp-trainings/masters-program |archivedate=2 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Projects==

The IDRC supports open standards, open access, and open source technology wherever possible in order to maximize distribution and to encourage broad participation. Some of the new initiatives the IDRC is working on are:

''FLOE Project: Flexible Learning for Open Education.'' FLOE is intended to enable inclusive access to personally relevant, engaging learning opportunities for the full diversity of learners and content producers. For example, Users can customize the look and feel and presentation of web content to meet their unique needs and preferences through FLOE User Interface Options. In addition, the FLOE video player allows multiple language caption support, synchronized and navigable transcripts, and is fully accessible via keyboard control, and screen reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floeproject.org/ |title=Flexible Learning for Open Education |publisher= Inclusive Design Research Centre|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite web|title=New Projects |url=http://idrc.ocad.ca/index.php/research-and-development/new-projects|publisher=Inclusive Design Research Centre (OCAD University) |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''ADOD Project: Accessible Digital Office Document.'' ADOD is developing vendor-neutral manual with practical application-specific instructions that can help users choose accessible office applications and create accessible documents from common office application suites. The guidance is based primarily on [[WCAG]] 2.0 and [[Web Accessibility Initiative#Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines .28ATAG.29|ATAG]] 1.0 recommendations of the [[W3C]]. ADOD is being developed in partnership with [[UNESCO]] and the [[Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services]].&lt;ref name=new/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adod.idrc.ocad.ca/ |title=Accessible Digital Office Document (ADOD) Project |publisher= Inclusive Design Research Centre|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''AEGIS Ontario: Integrating Accessibility into Emerging ICT.'' The ÆGIS Ontario project is devoted to ensuring that emerging information and communication technologies (ICT) are designed inclusively, thereby supporting Ontario's commitment to equal access and preparing Ontario's ICT businesses to meet the growing global demand for products and services that provide accessibility to people of all abilities. The project is funded by the Ontario Research Fund Research Excellence program, and is working in close partnership with AEGIS Europe.&lt;ref name=new/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aegis.idrc.ocad.ca/ |title=

==Inclusive Design Institute==

The '''Inclusive Design Institute''' (IDI) is a related enterprise, housed in the same facilities as the IDRC, that serves as a regional research network for inclusive design. Also directed by Treviranus,&lt;ref name=idi-about&gt;{{cite web|title=Inclusive Design Institute – About – Overview|url=http://inclusivedesign.ca/about/|publisher=Inclusive Design Institute|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2008&lt;ref name=idrc-news-409&gt;{{cite web|last=Treviranus|first=Jutta|title=New Directions|url=http://idrc.ocad.ca/index.php/about-the-idrc/idrc-news/8-latest/409-new-directions|publisher=Inclusive Design Research Centre|accessdate=4 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813130738/http://idrc.ocad.ca/index.php/about-the-idrc/idrc-news/8-latest/409-new-directions#|archive-date=2011-08-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially launched on 24 May 2012,&lt;ref name=cou-pr-20120524&gt;{{cite web|title=OCAD University opens Inclusive Design Institute|url=http://cou.on.ca/news/media-releases/university/ocad-university-opens-inclusive-design-institute|publisher=Council of Ontario Universities|accessdate=5 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201182708/http://cou.on.ca/news/media-releases/university/ocad-university-opens-inclusive-design-institute|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of Inclusive Design==

Some research centres that use the term "inclusive design" do so synonymously with the older field of [[universal design]]. Both inclusive design and universal design seek to design systems "... so that work for people with disabilities results in systems that work better for everyone [and] increase the human capacity to meet legal, policy and societal commitments to [[accessibility]], [[multiculturalism|diversity]] and inclusion at a local, national and global level."&lt;ref name=IDRCDefinition/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocadu.ca/graduate-studies/programs/inclusive-design|title=Master of Design Programs|accessdate=April 14, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222215312/http://www.ocadu.ca/graduate-studies/programs/inclusive-design|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDRC, however, presents a definition of inclusive Design that has key differences from universal design and its own distinctive features.  Inclusive design principles are intended to make universal design more fully inclusive, according to the centre.&lt;ref name=IDRCDefinition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idrc.ocad.ca/index.php/about-the-idrc/49-resources/online-resources/articles-and-papers/443-whatisinclusivedesign |title=IDRC Definition of Inclusive Design|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal design grew out of [[industrial design|industrial]] and [[architecture|architectural design]] whereas inclusive design came out of the [[digital marketing|digital]] world. Greater design options allow inclusive design to produce one-size-fits-one solutions in contrast to universal design that features one-size-fits-all and may exclude [[outliers]] such as the multifaceted people with various [[disabilities]].&lt;ref name="IDRCDefinition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/betterdesign2/whatis/whatis.html#p30|title=What is inclusive design?
|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notes the IDRC: "while universal design is about creating a common design that works for everyone, we [in inclusive design] have the freedom to create a design system that can adapt, morph, or stretch to address each design need presented by each individual." &lt;ref name=IDRCDefinition/&gt; Researchers in inclusive design believe that every user of any system, be it digital or policy, must be recognized as unique and that "it is the responsibility of inclusive designers to be aware of the context and broader impact of any design and strive to effect a beneficial impact beyond the intended beneficiary of the design."&lt;ref name=IDRCDefinition/&gt;

Treviranus, the IDRC head, has led a body of research investigating and developing a new approach to accessibility: reframing disability as a mismatch between the needs of the user and the environment or system offered (and therefore not a personal trait but a consequence of the relationship between the individual and their environment).&lt;ref name="imsglobal.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/accmdv1p0/imsaccmd_infov1p0.html|title=IMS AccessForAll Meta-data Information Model|publisher=IMS Global Learning Consortium, Inc.|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technical and conceptual framework takes advantage of the plasticity of information and communications technology (ICT) systems to personally optimize the user interface to the needs and preferences of each individual.&lt;ref name="imsglobal.org"/&gt; This approach supports human diversity in digital systems not by attempting to find a one-size-fits-all solution but by adapting to the cluster of diverse needs of each user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsglobal.org/acclip/acclipv1p0/imsacclip_infov1p0.html|title=IMS Learner Information Package Accessibility for LIP Information Model|publisher=IMS Global Learning Consortium, Inc.|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jutta Treviranus==

Director of both the IDRC and IDI, [[Jutta Treviranus]] is a world expert in the field of inclusive design who has made appearances at the [[White House]] and [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I Want Your Job: Jutta Treviranus, Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre |url=http://torontoist.com/2013/09/i-want-your-job-jutta-treviranus-director-of-the-inclusive-design-research-centre/|publisher=[[Torontoist]] |last1=Kochany|first1= Kaitlyn |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has "led many international multi‐partner research networks that have created broadly implemented technical innovations that support inclusion." Her work has included designing open source content and helping implement accessibility legislation, standards, and specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jutta Treviranus: Background for ECM |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/egm2012/JuttaTreviranus.pdf |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Treviranus was awarded the [[Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal|Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=261656&amp;t=13&amp;ln=Treviranus |title= The Diamond Jubilee Medal |date= 2013 |publisher=[[Governor General of Canada]] |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] awarded Treviranus their International 1906 Award; it recognizes experts' contributions to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Jutta Treviranus winner of International Electrotechnical Commission 1906 Award  |url=http://www.scc.ca/en/news-events/news/2013/professor-jutta-treviranus-winner-international-electrotechnical-commission |publisher=Standards Council of Canada |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1906 Award: Criteria |url=http://www.iec.ch/about/awards/1906/ |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John McNeill''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCB|PC|FRSE|FRAS|DCL|LLD}} (1795 – 17 May 1883) was a Scottish surgeon and diplomat.

==Early life==
McNeill was born on 12 August 1795 at Oronsay House on the island of [[Oronsay]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]]. He was the third of the six sons of John McNeill, [[laird]] of [[Colonsay]] and [[Oronsay, Inner Hebrides|Oronsay]] (1767–1846) and his wife, Hester McNeill (died 1843). He was the younger brother of the law lord [[Duncan McNeill, 1st Baron Colonsay and Oronsay]].&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book

==Education==
He studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he graduated as a [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1814, at the age of nineteen.{{sfn|Chichester|1893}}
==Career==
===India===
On 6 September 1816 he was appointed assistant surgeon on the [[Honourable East India Company]]'s Bombay establishment. He was moved to [[Persia]] in 1819. He received his licence as a surgeon on 1 May 1824 and retired from the medical service on 4 June 1836, thereafter concentrating on the diplomatic aspects of the East India Company.{{sfn|Chichester|1893}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was attached to the field force under Colonel East in [[Kutch]] and [[Okamundel]] in 1818–19 and was afterwards deputy medical storekeeper at the presidency.{{sfn|Chichester|1893}}

===Persia===
From 1824 to 1835, he was attached to the East India Company's legation in [[Persia]], at first in medical charge, and latterly as political assistant to the Minister, [[John Macdonald Kinneir]], in which post he displayed great ability. For instance, in 1829 he was probably one of the instigators of the murder of [[Alexander Griboyedov]] by Persian mob in [[Teheran]].

On 30 June 1835, he was appointed secretary of the special embassy sent to [[Tehran]] under [[Henry Ellis (diplomat)|Henry Ellis]] to congratulate [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]] on his accession to the Persian throne. McNeill received permission to wear the Persian [[Order of the Lion and the Sun]] of the first class, and on his return home in the spring of 1836, he anonymously published a startling anti-Russian pamphlet, ''Progress and Present Position of Russia in the East''. 

From 1836 to 1844, McNeill was any envoy to Persia. See [[Siege of Herat (1838)|Siege of Herat]].

===Scotland===
In 1845, McNeill was appointed chairman of the [[Board of Supervision]], entrusted with the working of the new [[Poor Law (Scotland) Act 1845]], a post he occupied for twenty-three years. During the [[Highland Potato Famine]] – nearly as disastrous as the [[Irish Potato Famine]] – he conducted a special inquiry into the condition of the western [[Scottish Highlands]] and [[Western Isles]], during which he personally inspected twenty-seven of the most distressed parishes.

During his stay in Scotland he lived at [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]] House in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1850-1&lt;/ref&gt;

He was cofounder in 1851, with [[Sir_Charles_Trevelyan,_1st_Baronet|Sir Charles Trevelyan]], of the [[Highland and Island Emigration Society]] which during the [[Highland Clearances]] supported an exodus of nearly 5,000 people to Australia between 1851 and 1856.
&lt;ref&gt;
Devine, T. M. ''To the Ends of the Earth: Scotland's Global Diaspora'', Allen Lane, 1 August 2011, Chapter 5, Section 2. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimean War===

At the outbreak the [[Crimean War]] in 1854, McNeill published revised editions in French and English of his pamphlet ''Progress and Present Position of Russia in the East'', with supplementary chapters dealing with the progress of events since 1836, and insisting on the importance to Britain and to [[Christendom]] of the autonomy of [[Turkey]] and Persia.

At the beginning of 1855, when the Crimean disasters had roused public indignation, McNeill and Colonel [[Alexander Tulloch]], an officer of great administrative experience at the [[War Office]], were sent to the Crimea with instructions to report on the whole arrangements and management of the [[commissariat]] and the method of keeping accounts, and to the causes of the delays in unloading and distributing clothing and other stores sent to [[Balaklava]].

The commissioners started at once for the seat of war. They took no [[shorthand]] writer with them, as the remuneration sanctioned by the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] was insufficient to secure a qualified person.

The McNeill–Tulloch inquiry was the most effective of the various inquisitions into the Crimean débâcle. It sharply criticised [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan's]] personal staff in the Crimea and Commissary-General Filder, and it led to many recriminations as officers sought to clear their names when the report was published in 1856. A board of general officers was convened to clear the army, but despite its protestations, the McNeill–Tulloch report led to professional reform of the commissariat by the [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] of October 1858.

Very unusually, the [[British House of Commons|Commons]], irritated by executive obfuscation, passed a resolution in 1857 calling for special honours and McNeill soon became a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]] and Tulloch was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|KCB]]. The [[University of Oxford]] made McNeill a [[Doctor of Civil Law]] and the University of Edinburgh chose him as chairman of its amalgamated societies; his inaugural address on competitive examinations was published in 1861.

==Personal life==
[[File:Memorial to Sir John McNeill and Lady Emma Augusta McNeill, Liberton Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Sir John McNeill and Lady Emma Augusta McNeill, [[Liberton, Edinburgh|Liberton Cemetery, Edinburgh]]]]

McNeill married, firstly, in 1814, Innes Robinson, fourth daughter of George Robinson of [[Clermiston]], Midlothian – she died in 1816; secondly, in 1823, Eliza Wilson, third daughter of John Wilson – she died in 1868; thirdly, in 1871, Lady Emma Augusta Campbell, daughter of [[John Campbell, 7th Duke of Argyll]].{{sfn|Chichester|1893}}

McNeill was the brother-in law (by his 2nd marriage) of the author [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]], and (by his 3rd marriage) of [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll]].

McNeill died at Poralto near [[Cannes]] in [[France]], on 17 May 1883.{{sfn|Chichester|1893}} A memorial to his memory lies on the south-east wall of Liberton Cemetery in Edinburgh, at the grave of his third wife, Emma Augusta.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">'''Ladies' Deborah and Child's Protectory''' was a 19th-century [[day care center]] and orphanage located at 204 [[East Broadway (Manhattan)|East Broadway]]. The institution cared for the children, ages two to six years, of indigent parents who worked during the day. The youths were fed and returned to their parents in the evening.&lt;ref name=new/&gt; Abandoned children were also taken in. A [[certificate of incorporation]] was filed at the clerk's office of [[New York County]] on March 5, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;''City And Suburban News'', New York Times, March 6, 1878, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility opened on the morning of March 24, 1878, when fifty-nine small children were received inside. Ladies' Deborah and Child's Protectory was established by Mrs. P.J. Joachimsen.&lt;ref name=new&gt;''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE2DA163FE036A05756C2A9659C946990D7CF&amp;legacy=true A New Charitable Institution]'', [[New York Times]], March 25, 1878, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; She was president of the Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9901EEDE1038E033A25752C1A9669D94659FD7CF&amp;legacy=true Hebrew Charity For Children]'', New York Times,
October 11, 1884, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1880 the New York City Board of Apportionment distributed $1,289.43 from the [[excise]] fund to assist in the support of children at the institution, which was then being called Ladies' Deborah Nursery and Child's Protectory.&lt;ref&gt;''Disposing Of The Excise Fund'', New York Times, January 8, 1880, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1883 the Deborah Nursery was located at 95 East Broadway, with a branch at 101 East Broadway and a girls' branch at 423 East 83rd Street. [[Elbridge T. Gerry]], president of the New York Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Children, listed the buildings of the three sites as worthy of attention by the building department, in regard to repairs.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E4DB1731E433A25752C3A9659C94629FD7CF&amp;legacy=true Buildings Which Require Attention]'', New York Times, March 31, 1883, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child abuse and poor management==
{{See also|Child abuse}}
Israel Schwartz, a thirteen-year-old [[Jewish people|Jewish]] boy, accused superintendent Herman Engel, of the nursery, of assaulting him with a cane, in May 1893. Engel was held for examination and fined $300. Schwartz complaint was one of many which were reported around this time.&lt;ref&gt;''Mr. Engel Must Explain'', New York Times, June 1, 1893, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1896 the facility was ordered to promptly make reforms by the [[New York City Board of Health]]. At this instance the nursery was afflicted by the prevalence of [[ophthalmia]]. In March 1896 eighty cases of the disease were reported among the children at Ladies' Deborah Nursery and Child's Protectorate. Infected children were quarantined but twenty-two of them were released back to the main building, despite continuing to suffer from various forms of eye diseases. The institution was then located at Eagle Avenue and 161st Street in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990CE7DD1331E033A2575BC1A9679D94679ED7CF&amp;legacy=true A Bad State Of Things]'', New York Times, November 18, 1896, pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity background and aftermath==

The Ladies' Deborah Relief Association was active at least four years before the opening of the child's protectory. On July 29, 1874 the
organization held a benefit for the sick and poor at Bellevue Garden near [[80th Street (Manhattan)]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B00E1D81139EF34BC4051DFB166838F669FDE&amp;legacy=true City And Suburban News]'', New York Times, July 28, 1874, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1897 the Eagle Avenue site, on the [[West Side (Manhattan)]], was sold during a foreclosure. The lot measured 150 feet by 125 feet and possessed a three-story and a four-story building, both composed of brick. $18,687 was due on judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F0DE6D91630E132A25754C2A9609C94669ED7CF&amp;legacy=true Auction Sales This Week]'', New York Times, June 27, 1897, pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deadliest events at Everest==
The history of mountaineering expeditions on Mount Everest has evolved since the first official mountaineering expedition trekked up its slopes in 1921. In the subsequent decades from this point until the 1960s, many expeditions were funded by major organizations and launched in a "siege"-style with large climbing parties. These early campaigns helped overcome the relatively remote nature and uncharted territory of Everest. Additionally, these journeys paved the way for the "lightweight"-style expeditions that would follow (a prime example is the successful 1980 solo ascent by [[Reinhold Messner]], the first without [[supplemental oxygen]]). The 80s and 90s saw the emergence and rise in the commercialization of the ascent to Everest's summit. These commercial expeditions range from logistics only (i.e. a permit and some basic base camp supplies) to expensive, professionally-guided expeditions promising even laypeople an increased chance of successfully reaching the summit. The increased access now afforded to scaling the [[world's tallest mountain]], while leading to more people successfully reaching the summit than ever before, has also seen a concomitant and exponential rise in casualties.

==Astronaut fatality==
[[File:Henize.jpg|thumb|Henize had been in space (see [[STS-51-F]] space mission) and co-authored many science papers]]
One of the people claimed by Everest mountaineering was the U.S. astronaut [[Karl Gordon Henize]]. He was on a mission to study radiation but came down with a fatal case of [[High-altitude pulmonary edema|HAPE]] in October 1993 and died at north base camp.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; At the time he was the oldest astronaut to have flown in space and also had a doctorate in astronomy.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; He died on October 5, 1993 and was buried on Mount Everest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-karl-henize-1512511.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9084">This '''list of chiropractic schools''' is organized alphabetically by country. In those countries with functioning, specialized, accrediting agencies, the colleges holding "recognized", or "accredited" status are delineated. Other countries and regions are in the process of developing similar programs of accreditation; and, in Switzerland, [[chiropractic]] is so fully integrated into the health care system that the existence of a separate accrediting agency is thus obviated. The course is taught in university, on the same basis as human medicine.

In 2015, nine internationally accredited chiropractic colleges:  AECC, WIOC, IFEC-Paris, IFEC-Toulouse, SDU-Odense, UZ-Zurich, UJ-Johannesburg, Durbin University of Technology and Macquarie University, Australia, made an open statement which included: "The teaching of the vertebral subluxation complex as a vitalistic construct that claims that it is the cause of disease is unsupported by evidence.  Its inclusion in a modern chiropractic curriculum in anything other than an historic context is therefore inappropriate and unnecessary".

This document is based upon and supports the theme of the World Federation of Chiropractic Educational Statement formulated in November 2014 at the Miami Education Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9564e6cf93ec0c618a68-4f22a039f96a487025fe8e71cbbe8130.r40.cf3.rackcdn.com/Undergraduate/MChiro/Educational%20Statements.pdf |format=PDF |title=The European-South African Education Collaboration : Clinical and Professional Chiropractic Education: a Position Statement |website=9564e6cf93ec0c618a68-4f22a039f96a487025fe8e71cbbe8130.r40.cf3.rackcdn.com |accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During adolescence critical stages of neurodevelopment occur, including remodeling and functional changes in [[synaptic plasticity]] and neuronal connectivity in different brain regions. These changes may make adolescents especially susceptible to the harmful effects of alcohol. Compared to adults, adolescents exposed to alcohol are more likely to exhibit cognitive deficits (including learning and memory dysfunction). Some of these cognitive effects, such as learning impairments, may persist into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Mechanisms of action==

===Neuroinflammation===
Ethanol can trigger the activation of [[astrocyte|astroglial cells]] which can produce a proinflammatory response in the brain. Ethanol interacts with the [[TLR4]] and [[Interleukin 1 receptor, type I|IL-1RI]] receptors on these cells to activate intracellular signal transduction pathways. Specifically, ethanol induces the phosphorylation of IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK), [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK1/2]], stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/[[c-Jun N-terminal kinases|JNK]], and [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)]]. Activation of the IRAK/MAPK pathway leads to the stimulation of the [[transcription factor]]s [[NF-kappaB]] and [[AP-1 transcription factor|AP-1]]. These transcription factors cause the upregulation of [[Nitric oxide synthase|inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)]] and [[PTGS2|cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)]] expression.&lt;ref name="pmid16272348"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Changes in dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling pathways===
Intermittent ethanol treatment causes a decrease in expression of the [[dopamine receptor]] type 2 (D2R) and a decrease in phosphorylation of 2B subunit of the [[NMDA receptor]] (NMDAR2B) in the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[hippocampus]], [[nucleus accumbens]], and for only D2R the [[striatum]]. It also causes changes in the acetylation of [[histone]]s H3 and H4 in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and striatum, suggesting [[chromatin]] remodeling changes which may mediate long-term alterations. Additionally, adolescent rats pre-exposed to ethanol have higher basal levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, along with a prolonged dopamine response in this area in response to a challenge dose of ethanol. Together, these results suggest that alcohol exposure during adolescence can sensitize the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] and [[Mesocortical pathway|mesocortical]] dopamine pathways to cause changes in [[dopaminergic]] and glutamatergic signaling, which may affect the remodeling and functions of the adolescent brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are significant as alcohol’s effect on NMDARs could contribute to learning and memory dysfunction (''see [[Effects of alcohol on memory#Effects on nervous system|Effects of alcohol on memory]]'').

===Inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis===
Excessive alcohol intake ([[binge drinking]]) causes a decrease in hippocampal [[neurogenesis]], via decreases in neural stem cell proliferation and newborn cell survival.&lt;ref name="pmid19554644"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol decreases the number of cells in S-phase of the [[cell cycle]], and may arrest cells in the G1 phase, thus inhibiting their proliferation.&lt;ref name="pmid19554644"/&gt; Ethanol has different effects on different types of actively dividing hippocampal progenitors during their initial phases of neuronal development. Chronic alcohol exposure decreases the number of proliferating cells that are [[Radial glial cell|radial glia]]-like, preneuronal, and intermediate types, while not affecting early neuronal type cells; suggesting ethanol treatment alters the precursor cell pool. Furthermore, there is a greater decrease in differentiation and immature neurons than there is in proliferating progenitors, suggesting that the abnormal decrease in the percentage of actively dividing preneuronal progenitors results in a greater reduction in the maturation and survival of postmitotic cells.&lt;ref name="pmid20534463"/&gt;

Additionally, alcohol exposure increased several markers of cell death. In these studies neural degeneration seems to be mediated by non-apoptotic pathways.&lt;ref name="pmid19554644"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20534463"/&gt; One of the proposed mechanisms for alcohol’s neurotoxicity is the production of nitric oxide (NO), yet other studies have found alcohol-induced NO production to lead to apoptosis (''see [[#Neuroinflammation|Neuroinflammation]] section'').

==Transient versus stable alterations==

Many negative physiologic consequences of [[alcoholism]] are reversible during [[abstinence]].  As an example, long-term chronic alcoholics suffer a variety of cognitive deficiencies.&lt;ref name="pmid25307576"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oscar-Berman M, Valmas MM, Sawyer KS, Ruiz SM, Luhar RB, Gravitz ZR |title=Profiles of impaired, spared, and recovered neuropsychologic processes in alcoholism |journal=Handb Clin Neurol |volume=125 |issue= |pages=183–210 |date=2014 |pmid=25307576 |pmc=4515358 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-62619-6.00012-4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, multiyear abstinence resolves most neurocognitive deficits, except for some lingering deficits in spatial processing.&lt;ref name="pmid16930216"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fein G, Torres J, Price LJ, Di Sclafani V |title=Cognitive performance in long-term abstinent alcoholic individuals |journal=Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=1538–44 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16930216 |pmc=1868685 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2006.00185.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless there are some frequent long-term consequences that are not reversible during abstinence.  Alcohol [[Craving (withdrawal)|craving]] (compulsive need to consume alcohol) is frequently present long-term among [[alcoholism|alcoholics]].&lt;ref name="pmid15208171"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bottlender M, Soyka M |title=Impact of craving on alcohol relapse during, and 12 months following, outpatient treatment |journal=Alcohol Alcohol. |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=357–61 |date=2004 |pmid=15208171 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agh073 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among 461 individuals who sought help for alcohol problems, followup was provided for up to 16 years.&lt;ref name="pmid16445550"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moos RH, Moos BS |title=Rates and predictors of relapse after natural and treated remission from alcohol use disorders |journal=Addiction |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=212–22 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16445550 |pmc=1976118 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01310.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 16 years, 54% of those who tried to remain abstinent '''without''' professional help had relapsed, and 39% of those who tried to remain abstinent '''with help''' had relapsed.

Long-term, stable consequences of chronic alcohol abuse are thought to be due to stable alterations of [[regulation of gene expression#Regulation of transcription in addiction|gene expression]] resulting from [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes within particular regions of the brain.&lt;ref name="pmid25131543"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krishnan HR, Sakharkar AJ, Teppen TL, Berkel TD, Pandey SC |title=The epigenetic landscape of alcoholism |journal=Int.

[[File:Map of USA NC.svg|thumb|North Carolina]]
The state of [[North Carolina]] is undertaking a comprehensive policy shift on how the government budgets for and manages resources for [[mental health]], [[developmental disability]], and [[substance abuse]] services.  The 1915 (b)(c) Medicaid Waiver Program was chosen by the North Carolina Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance as a way to control and more accurately budget for the rising costs of Medicaid funded services.  The 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program was initially implemented at one pilot site in 2005 and evaluated for several years.  Two expansion sites were then added in 2012.  Full statewide implementation is expected by July 1, 2013.

==Mental health reform history==

In October 2001, the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] ratified House Bill 381 (S.L. 2001-437) on Mental Health System Reform.&lt;ref name="H381"&gt;{{cite web|title=House Bill 381 Information/History (2001-2002 Session)|url=http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2001&amp;BillID=H381|work=North Carolina General Assembly|accessdate=16 March 2014|author=North Carolina General Assembly|date=15 October 2001|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003151817/http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2001&amp;BillID=H381 |archive-date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SL2001-437"&gt;{{Citation | author=General Assembly of North Carolina | author-link=North Carolina General Assembly | date=4 October 2001 | title=Session Law 2001-437: An Act to Phase in Implementation of Mental Health System Reform at the State and Local Level | url=http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/SessionLaws/HTML/2001-2002/SL2001-437.html |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114934/http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/SessionLaws/HTML/2001-2002/SL2001-437.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The law] required local jurisdictions to separate the management of mental health services from the delivery of those services.  Previously, local entities such as counties and regional agencies delivered mental health services by directly employing the [[Health professional|care provider]]s. The 2001 law required the governmental local management entities (LMEs) to contract with private providers to serve area residents who needed mental health services.  The local counties and regions no longer directly controlled the provision of services, but instead were responsible for managing provider contracts.&lt;ref name="In the Pub Inter"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since that time, the state has undertaken additional mental health system reform actions.  On January 1, 2002 the NC Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) entered into a contract with [[ValueOptions]] Inc. (a private for-profit company) to provide [[utilization review]] services for the then 1.3 million [[Medicaid]] recipients in North Carolina.  The state renewed that contract in 2006 and 2011.   ValueOptions provides prior authorization for mental health and substance abuse services.&lt;ref name="NC Medicaid"/&gt;

There were significant criticisms of state's shift to [[privatization]], including:
* Many highly trained mental health care workers left the field as private providers took control of service delivery, decimating the professional [[public sector]] workforce.
* The fragmented system created through privatization had a tremendous negative impact on the quality of services provided to clients.  Many times, important mental health services were no longer even available to clients.
* Private providers engaged in "cherry picking," offering only the most profitable services, such as "community support" services.  These services include basic assistance and [[mentoring]], and such tasks as running errands for a client or helping with a child's homework.  They could be performed by low-paid, unlicensed personnel.  Many providers focused on these highly profitable community support services and left seriously ill clients without the more costly care they needed.
* Reports of cost overruns estimate that the state wasted at least $400 million in community support services offered by private providers that were unnecessary for the client or not even performed.  As a result of the treatment offered by the private providers, the number of North Carolinians with mental illness who ended up in [[emergency room]]s or jails significantly increased.&lt;ref name="In the Pub Inter"/&gt;     
Additionally, the budget for Medicaid funded services was not adequately managed and continued to grow at a high rate each year.

Starting in 2005, the state established one LME as a pilot Medicaid managed care vendor through the use of the Medicaid 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt; Piedmont Behavioral Health (PBH) served as the pilot program and serves Cabarrus, Davidson, Rowan, Stanly, and Union counties.  In 2008, the General Assembly supported the planned expansion of the pilot program through S.L. 2008-107.&lt;ref name="SL2008-107"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2016}} Then S.L. 2010-31 was adopted and required the designation of two additional expansion sites.&lt;ref name="SL2010-31"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2016}} Most recently, S.L. 2011-264 &lt;ref name="SL2011-264"/&gt; instructed the [[North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services]] (NC DHHS) to proceed with the statewide restructuring of the mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services system by implementing the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program statewide by July 1, 2013.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt;

Area authorities, like PBH, were originally designated by the state of North Carolina in 1985 through the NC Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, Substance Abuse Service Act.&lt;ref name="Mercer"/&gt; The name change to Local Management Entity (LME) took place in 2001 when North Carolina passed the Mental Health System Reform Act.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt; Authority for LMEs is organized under North Carolina General Statute Chapter 122C.  LMEs are considered a local political subdivision of the state per §122C-116.  According to G.S. §122C-115.4, LMEs are responsible for management and oversight of the public system of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services at the community level.&lt;ref name="122C"/&gt;

==Motivation for reform==

Medicaid "is a [[health insurance]] program for low-income individuals and families who cannot afford health care costs. Medicaid serves low-income parents, children, seniors, and people with disabilities." &lt;ref name="Medicaid"/&gt; According to the Fiscal Research Division of the N.C. General Assembly, "Medicaid is the fastest growing program in the state budget.  In 2009, the authorized state budget for Medicaid was $3.2 billion, or 15% of the state's $21.2 billion authorized operating budget—an increase of 9% from 2008."  &lt;ref name="AgingPopulation"/&gt;  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report that in 2009 (the last year for which data was available) North Carolina had 1,974,287 enrollees in Medicaid.&lt;ref name="NC Medicaid Stats"/&gt; 1.97 million enrollees equaled 21% of the state's population that year (9,380,884).&lt;ref name="NC Medicaid Stats"/&gt;

==Medicaid history in North Carolina==
[[File:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services logo.svg|thumb|right|[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (Medicaid administrator) logo]]

"Title XIX of the Social Security Act is a federal and state entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources. This program, known as Medicaid, became law in 1965 as a cooperative venture jointly funded by the federal and state governments...to assist states in furnishing medical assistance to needy persons.  Within broad national guidelines established by federal statutes, regulations and policies, each state 1) establishes its own eligibility standards, 2) determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services, 3) sets the rate of payment for services, and 4) administers its own program." &lt;ref name="HistoryNCMedicaid"/&gt;

North Carolina submitted its "Medicaid State Plan to the Health Care Financing Administration in 1969 and received approval that year.  North Carolina General Statute Chapter 108A is the law that implemented Title XIX in North Carolina...on January 1, 1970.&lt;ref name="HistoryNCMedicaid"/&gt; Each year new legislation that is passed by the North Carolina General Assembly establishes changes to the program and its policies such as eligibility and benefit coverage expansions and contractions, management and administrative mandates, special funding, etc.&lt;ref name="HistoryNCMedicaid"/&gt;

Medicaid provides medically necessary services related to [[physical health]], mental health, substance abuse treatment, and developmental disabilities.  In North Carolina, Medicaid costs are split between the State (34.87%) and the Federal government (65.13%).&lt;ref name="AgingPopulation"/&gt; "Ranking ninth among states in total Medicaid spending, North Carolina's Medicaid program has worked hard not just to cut spending to keep the program solvent, but also to contain costs while improving the quality of health care."  &lt;ref name="AgingPopulation"/&gt;  In 2009, North Carolina had 1,274,193 adults and children in need of [[mental health]], [[developmental disability]], and [[substance abuse]] services.&lt;ref name="MHDDSAS in NC"/&gt;

The [[Social Security Act]] has been amended many times since its adoption to assist states in managing their Medicaid programs to best meet the needs of the state's eligible residents.  One way the Social Security Act does this is by authorizing "multiple waiver and demonstration authorities to allow states flexibility in operating Medicaid programs." &lt;ref name="Medicaid Waivers"/&gt; Each state's Medicaid Agency must submit for review and approval an application for a [[Medicaid Home and Home and Community-Based Services Waivers|Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) waiver]], and the State Medicaid Agency has the ultimate responsibility for an HCBS waiver program although it may delegate the day-to-day operation of the program to another entity.&lt;ref name="Medicaid Waivers"/&gt;

==1915(b)(c) Waiver Program==
[[File:NorthCarolina-StateSeal.svg|thumb|Seal of North Carolina]]

In response to its increasingly difficult [[budget]] situation, North Carolina is currently undertaking a statewide policy shift in how it budgets and manages funding for Medicaid programs specific to mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders.

North Carolina was originally approved to use both the Section 1915 (b) Managed Care/Freedom of Choice Waiver and the Section 1915 (c) [[Medicaid Home and Home and Community-Based Services Waivers|Home and Community-based Services Waiver]] options in October 2004.&lt;ref name="DHHS Waiver Project"/&gt; The 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program empowers the state designated public authority "to build partnerships with consumers, providers and community stakeholders to create a more responsive system of community care." &lt;ref name="DMA Fact Sheet"/&gt; The vision of this policy is "Responsible Change to Achieve Easy Access, Better Quality and Personal Outcomes." &lt;ref name="State CFAC Presentation"/&gt;

The appeal of the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program is that annual Medicaid expenditures can be more accurately budgeted and managed based on a formula.  Under the Waiver, the State would determine a per member per month amount (known as capitation) to be paid to the public authority designated by the NC Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Division of Medical Assistance (DMA), the State's Medicaid Agency.  The capitation would be based on a formula that takes into account the historical service costs associated with the different Medicaid eligible groups.&lt;ref name="DHHS Waiver Project"/&gt;

In addition to the development of the [[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation rate]], the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program grants rate setting authority to adjust service rates to meet local needs, claims payment to ensure funds are spent in line with service authorizations, a closed network to allow for competition and choice within a stable network, utilization management to provide the right service at the right level, and care management to provide direct support to high cost/high risk customers.&lt;ref name="DHHS Waiver Project"/&gt;

===Policy formulation===

The state of North Carolina formulated the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program policy utilizing the input of numerous internal and external [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s.  The original plan was drafted by the staff of the North Carolina Department of Health &amp; Human Services.  An External Advisory Team from within the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services (MHDDSAS) provided review and feedback.  Additional feedback was sought through the North Carolina Council of Community Programs. The NC Council of Community Programs was incorporated in 1983 and is dedicated to helping area authorities in North Carolina improve their service quality and management effectiveness.&lt;ref name="NC Council"/&gt; The draft plan was then posted on the state's website (www.nc.gov) and distributed via a state Communication Bulletin and an invitation was issued for all stakeholders to provide ideas, suggestions, questions, and feedback.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt;

A complaint has been noted by the North Carolina Council on Developmental Disabilities that individuals and families feel that they were not consulted prior to their local LMEs submitting applications to be designated as an expansion site.  Staff from the NC Division of MHDDSAS responded to this concern by noting that LMEs had little opportunity for this type of stakeholder engagement given the initial time frame for the waiver amendment and the Request for Applications process initiated by NC DHHS.  It was additionally noted that input would be sought after selection and during the implementation process.  NC DHHS staff noted for the record that DHHS was "actively engaging" the State Consumer &amp; Family Advisory Committee as an active partner for input as they move forward.&lt;ref name="NCCDD PowerPt"/&gt;

===Goals of the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program===

The NC Department of Health and Human Services has six goals for the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program.  They are:
# improve access to mental health, developmental disability, and substance abuse (MHDDSA) services,
# improve quality of MHDDSA services,
# improve outcomes for people receiving MHDDSA services,
# improve access to primary care for people with [[mental illness]], developmental disabilities and substance abuse,
# improve cost benefit of services,
# effectively manage all public resources assigned to LMEs (local management entities).&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt;

===Implementation plan===

The NC DHHS implementation plan for the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program included the following key dates per S.L. 2011-264:
# {{timeline-event |date={{start date|2011|08|01}} |event=additional LME sites announced}},
# {{timeline-event |date={{start date|2011|10|01}} |event=Strategic Plan to be presented to the General Assembly}},
# {{timeline-event |date={{start date|2013|01|01}} |event=Assignment of any unassigned counties to an LME}},
# {{timeline-event |date={{start date|2013|07|01}} |event=completion of expansion}}.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt;

Recognizing the diverse capacity for implementation across the 23 LMEs of the state, North Carolina established the following minimum requirements to participate in the Waiver Program:
# the LME must represent a Medicaid eligible population (3 years and older) of 70,000 plus,
# be fully divested of providing all State funded or Medicaid reimbursable services,
# be fully accredited for a minimum of 3 years,
# have sufficient financial resources and strong financial management,
# submit a letter of support from full LME Board of Directors accepting financial responsibility for the program,
# provide proof that the LME does not serve as [[legal guardian]] for a recipient of Medicaid funded MHDDSA services,
# provide proof of no staff or Board conflicts of interest,
# demonstrate a strong Information Technology capacity,
# provide a letter of support from the LME [[Consumer and Family Advisory Committee (North Carolina)|Consumer and Family Advisory Committee]] (CFAC),
# demonstrate strong clinical operations,
# demonstrate strong administrative operations, and
# provide a comprehensive implementation plan for the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt;

The state enlisted the assistance of a consultant group, Mercer Government Human Services Consulting, to assist in creating and evaluating an LME's ability to meet the minimum standards.  It should be noted that if an LME cannot meet the minimum standards established, they will be required to merge with another LME.  The process began with 23 LMEs across the state, it is anticipated that by the end of the implementation process there will only be 8&amp;ndash;10 LMEs left.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt;

===Evaluation===

The State's Strategic Plan for the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program provides for performance evaluation.  Status reports are required to be submitted to the Legislative Oversight Committee and then be published for all stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt; The current schedule for official status reports to be submitted to the General Assembly includes the remaining dates: 10/1/12, 2/1/13, and 10/1/13.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt; Reports will address the Strategic Plan's six objectives and 23 action steps.  The six objectives are:
# oversee MHDDSA service system change,
# partner with LME/MCOs [Managed Care Organizations] to ensure successful implementation,
# ensure access and quality of the service system for individuals with mental illness, developmental disabilities or substance abuse,
# strengthen the partnership with stakeholders in advising the State on implementation of the strategic plan,
# increase knowledge and skills throughout the system, and
# partner with LME/MCOs and CCNC [Community Care North Carolina] to promote and implement a system of integrated care between mental health, intellectual/developmental disability and substance abuse service providers and primary care providers.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt;

Additional quantitative and qualitative evaluation processes are being undertaken.  The Federal government, through the [[Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services]], requires both an External Quality Review and a Global Continuous Quality Improvement Team.  The State is also forming Intra-departmental Monitoring Teams, an Executive Management Team, and MHDDSA Quality Improvement Steering Committee.&lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt;

On the local level, LMEs are required by their contract with DMA to "submit data and measurements to DMA annually for quality of care and service measures and performance improvement projects for 27 measures in 7 broad areas." &lt;ref name="DMA Contract"/&gt; The reporting areas are:
# Effectiveness of Care,
# Access/ Availability,
# Patient and Provider Satisfaction,
# Use of Services,
# Health Plan Stability,
# Plan Descriptive Information, and
# Health &amp; Safety.&lt;ref name="DMA Contract"/&gt;

NC DHHS reports that based on the pilot 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program results to date, "North Carolina has demonstrated that the State can provide quality mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services through private and public sector cooperation and at a lesser or comparable cost than fee-for-service program costs for Medicaid eligible population." &lt;ref name="Partnering for Success"/&gt;  Specifically, in its December 2011 report, NC DHHS shared that "there is a substantial difference in the average expenditure for care beginning in 2008, with expenditures remaining relatively stable at PBH [Piedmont Behavioral Health, the pilot site for the waiver program], while expenditures soared across the rest of the state." &lt;ref name="PBH Managed Care Experience"/&gt;

Response to the policy change has not been all positive, though. Vicki Smith, Executive Director of Disability Rights NC, stated that there is a "great deal of pressure on DHHS to quickly convert LMEs to Medicaid Waivers so the General Assembly's cost cutting targets can be met." &lt;ref name="WSJournal"/&gt;

David Cornwell, Executive Director of NC Mental Hope, stated that "between changes OK'd by House Bill 916 and proposed changes in Chapter 122C, it's not just a wrecking ball that will be slamming into our state's system, it's an army of bulldozers and backhoes and mammoth dump trucks lining up to roll over it.  And the same legislators that can't see further than next year's budget also don't care if there's a blueprint for the final product, only that there is a sketch of what the next phase will look like."  &lt;ref name="NCMentalHope"/&gt;

In 2009 NAMI, [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]], gave the state of North Carolina a D for its mental health system stating that a grade of D "does not even begin to convey the chaos that now pervades the state's mental health care system...NAMI warned three years ago [2006] that the state's reform initiatives were changing too much, too fast, resulting in an increasingly disorganized environment. This prediction was accurate."  &lt;ref name="NAMI"/&gt;

===Pilot Site===

Piedmont Behavioral Health, now{{When|date=June 2016}} known as PBH, was chosen as the pilot site for the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program in 2005.  PBH serves Cabarrus, Davidson, Rowan, Stanly, and Union counties.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Expansion Sites===

Mecklenburg County Area Mental Health and Western Highlands Network (the LME serving Buncombe, Henderson, Madison, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania and Yancey counties) were chosen as the two expansion sites for the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver Program in late 2010.&lt;ref name="WHNannounce"/&gt;

Mecklenburg County Area Mental Health was scheduled to come online with the 1915 (b)(c) Waiver in 2011 but had trouble with policy implementation and "paused" their Waiver program in September 2010.&lt;ref name="Mecklenburg"/&gt;  In June 2011, the State asked Mecklenburg to reenter the waiver program expansion.&lt;ref name="Mecklenburg"/&gt;  Mecklenburg County Area Mental Health is now on track to fully implement the policy in January 2013 in the state's third phase of expansion.  In its place, East Carolina Behavioral Health (ECBH) came on line on April 1, 2012.&lt;ref name="Implementation"/&gt;  ECBH serves Beaufort, Bertie, Camden, Chowan, Craven, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hertford, Hyde, Jones, Martin, Northampton, Pamlico, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Pitt, Tyrrell, and Washington counties.&lt;ref name="ECBH"/&gt;
 
Western Highlands Network (WHN) went into effect on January 3, 2012.  The 14 months between the date that WHN was announced as an expansion site and the date the waiver went into effect were a flurry of activity.  WHN developed both a Care Management/Utilization Management Department to review and authorize requests for services and a Care Coordination Department to provide the administrative function of treatment planning for a select high needs/high risk population.&lt;ref name="WHNstructure"/&gt; They have additionally formed a Child Transition Team to assist with planning for children in residential treatment settings and a Care Review Team that "is a resource for Child and Family Teams (CFTM) of high risk youth with serious mental health issues, substance abuse or developmental disabilities and is primarily used to assist CFTM" in resource identification and planning.&lt;ref name="WHNCRT"/&gt;

In July 2012, Smoky Mountain Center and Sandhills Center LMEs are scheduled to come online as Phase II.  Phase III will be implemented by January 2013 and will include:  Mecklenburg Area Mental Health, CenterPoint Human Services, Durham Center, EastPointe, Pathways, and CoastalCare LMEs.&lt;ref name="Implementation"/&gt;  Any unassigned LMEs will be assigned at that point in time.

==Storylines==
Nathan steals some [[pick 'n' mix]] from a bowling alley and continues to aggravate the situation. He causes a disruption and when the manager threatens to phone the police he tells him to do so before stapling him in the hand.

Nathan's mother, [[List of Misfits characters#Louise|Louise]] ([[Michelle Fairley]]), kicks him out of his house for his behaviour towards his step-father, [[List of Misfits characters#Jeremy|Jeremy]] ([[Jo Stone-Fewings]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6787">'''National Disability Employment Awareness Month''' was declared in 1988 by the [[United States Congress]] for the month of October to raise awareness of the [[employment]] needs and contributions of individuals with all types of [[Disability|disabilities]].  The month is an extension of "National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week" originally observed during the first week of October beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/odep/topics/ndeam/index-2014.htm|title=What is National Disability Employment Awareness Month?|publisher=Department of Labor|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans observe National Disability Employment Awareness Month by paying tribute to the accomplishments of the men and women with disabilities whose work helps keep the nation's economy strong and by reaffirming their commitment to ensure equal opportunity for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/disability-employment-awareness-month/about/|title=About  {{!}} National Disability Employment Awareness Month  {{!}} Library of Congress|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
In 1945, the government pushed to educate the public about issues relating to [[Disability|disabilities]] and [[employment]]. Congress enacted Public Law 176, which declared the first week of October, every year, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week. In 1962, the word “physically” was removed to acknowledge the employment needs and contributions of individuals with all types of disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/stories/2018/disability-employment.html|title=National Disability Employment Awareness Month: October 2018|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Congress|Congress]] later expanded the first week of October to the entire month of October and changed the name to National Disability Employment Awareness Month in 1988.

== History ==
In 1973, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits any public institutions that receive federal funds to discriminate on the premise of disability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/site-assets.rbl.ms/diversityinc-media/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DEA_Main_2016_Timeline.pdf|title=National Disability Employment Awareness Month Timeline|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two years later in 1975, Education for All Handicapped Children Act was passed requiring public schools that accept federal funding to provide equal education and access to education for disabled children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Years later in 1990, President Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities ACT (ADA) guaranteeing access to and prohibits discrimination against individuals with physical or mental disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2000, President Clinton signed an Executive Order, requesting for the federal government to hire 100,000 people with disabilities over the next five years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transportation.gov/civil-rights/civil-rights-library/executive-order-13163|title=Executive Order 13163|date=2015-04-07|work=US Department of Transportation|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final major event that happened is when Congress created the Office of Disability Employment Policy within the Department of Labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/odep/topics/DEI.htm|title=Disability Employment Initiative (DEI) - Office of Disability Employment Policy - United States Department of Labor|website=www.dol.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the United States Department of Labor is an [[Office of Disability Employment Policy]]. This office has created the [[Disability Employment Initiative]] (DEI) which aims to improve education, training and employment opportunities and outcomes for youth and adults with disabilities who are unemployed, underemployed and/or receiving [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] disability benefits.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Through the  DEI, there are 70 [[Disability Resource Coordinators]]. Along with State Project Leads, they serve to strengthen the capacity of [[American Job Centers]] in hopes of increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dei.workforcegps.org/|title=WorkforceGPS: Disability Employment Initiative|website=dei.workforcegps.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3737">A '''premarket tobacco application''' ('''PMTA''') is an application that must be reviewed and approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] before a new [[Tobacco products|tobacco product]] can be legally marketed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premarket Tobacco Applications|url=http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/TobaccoProductReviewEvaluation/ucm304506.htm|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first PMTA, and only to date, was approved by US FDA on November 10, 2015, when the FDA authorized the marketing of eight [[Swedish Match]] North America Inc. [[snus]] smokeless tobacco products (to be marketed under the [[brand name]] "General").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premarket Tobacco Application (PMTA)|url=http://globalsubmit.com/premarket-tobacco-application|website=GlobalSubmit|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm472026.htm FDA issues first product marketing orders through premarket tobacco application pathway], [[Food and Drug Administration]] (November 10, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==New tobacco product==
A new tobacco product is either a product commercially marketed in the United States after February 15, 2007, or any modification to a tobacco product commercially marketed after February 15, 2007. If a predicate product existed prior to February 15, 2007, applicants can apply via the Substantial Equivalence (SE) regulatory pathway. 

==FDA deeming regulation==
On May 10, 2016, the US FDA finalized its "deeming" rule, subjecting additional products to scrutiny under the [[Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]] as amended by the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance Document - Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-10685.pdf|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule gives the US FDA authority to regulate [[e-cigarette]]s, [[cigar]]s, and [[vape pen]]s. The rule also authorizes FDA to take enforcement action against manufacturers who sell and distribute products with unsubstantiated [[modified risk tobacco product]] (MRTP) claims.

==Compliance periods==
FDA is establishing staggered initial compliance periods based on the expected complexity of the applications to be submitted, followed by continued 12-month compliance periods of FDA review. Substantial Equivalence exemptions have a total compliance period of 24 months and an enforcement deadline of August 8, 2017. Substantial Equivalence applications have a total compliance period of 30 months and an enforcement deadline of February 8, 2018. Premarket tobacco applications have a total compliance period of 36 months and an enforcement deadline of August 8, 2018.

'''Protective sequestration''' is a [[public health]] term that refers to [[social distancing]] measures taken to protect a small, defined, and still-healthy population from an [[epidemic]] (or [[pandemic]]) ''before'' the [[infection]] reaches that population. It is sometimes referred to as "reverse [[cordon sanitaire]]."

Given the extraordinary nature{{clarify|date=December 2013}} of these measures, they should be considered, if at all, only under exceptional circumstances:
* Implementation is feasible
* The measures can be enforced, and voluntary compliance of the sequestered population is highly likely
* The sequestered population and/or the work they perform merits this effort and justifies the use of these measures.

The term “protective sequestration” was coined by [[Howard Markel]] and his colleagues, in their paper that described the successes and failures of several communities in the United States in their attempts to shield themselves from the 1918-1920 so-called “Spanish Influenza” pandemic during the second wave of that pandemic (September–December 1918).&lt;ref name = "Markel"/&gt;

The term “protective sequestration” avoids the use of the word [[quarantine]], which, in public health, refers to the voluntary or enforced detention of a person who, because of actual or possible contact with a person carrying an infectious agent, may have acquired that agent and be capable of passing it along to others. The duration of the quarantine period is determined by the incubation period of the infection, i.e., the time between acquisition of the infectious agent and the development of signs or symptoms of the illness caused by that agent.

During the [[1918 flu pandemic]], factors that contributed to the rare successes of protective sequestration were the following:
* The community leader(s) recognized the danger posed by the pandemic before it reached the community and implemented protective measures early (before neighboring communities did)
* Taking advantage of the community’s remoteness or natural barriers that were generally, but not always, present, the community leadership established and enforced a cordon around the outer perimeter of the community
* Anyone seeking entry into the community was placed in quarantine for the incubation period of the infection and released into the community only after they were shown to be free of infection. Furthermore, the leadership established a system whereby supplies were delivered and received in a way that eliminated human-to-human contact with those delivering the supplies
* Families were kept together so that life within the protected zone was as normal as possible. Schools remained in session and places of worship remained open, people continued to work, and entertainment remained available
* Protective sequestration measures remained in effect for the duration of the risk.

The best known historical example is the measures taken by the town of [[Gunnison, Colorado]] during the 1918 influenza epidemic. To prevent an introduction of the infection, the town isolated itself from the surrounding area for two months at the end of 1918. All highways were barricaded near the county lines. Train conductors warned all passengers that if they stepped outside of the train in Gunnison, they would be arrested and quarantined for five days. As a result of the isolation, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chm.med.umich.edu/research/1918-influenza-escape-communities/gunnison/ Gunnison: Case Study], University of Michigan Medical School, Center for the History of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; Several other communities adopted similar measures.&lt;ref name = "Markel"&gt;[https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/12/pdfs/06-0506.pdf H. Markel, A.M. Stern,  J. A. Navarro, J. R. Michalsen, A. S. Monto, and C. DiGiovanni, "Nonpharmaceutical Influenza Mitigation Strategies, US Communities, 1918–1920 Pandemic," ''Emerging Infectious Diseases,'' Vol. 12, No. 12, December 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of protective sequestration is that it shields selected people from infection and possibly buys them time for the development and distribution of drugs or vaccine. A disadvantage, apart from its elitism and social and economic cost, is that those sequestered have no opportunity to develop naturally-acquired immunity to the infectious agent through contact with it, and, therefore, they remain susceptible to the agent during subsequent waves of the epidemic or pandemic.

{{nihongo|'''Takashi Nagai'''|永井 隆|Nagai Takashi|extra=3 February 1908, [[Matsue, Shimane|Matsue]] – 1 May 1951, [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]}} was a Catholic [[physician]] specializing in [[radiology]], an author and survivor of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]]. His subsequent life of prayer and service earned him the affectionate title "[[saint]] of [[Urakami]]," and he has subsequently been honoured with the title of [[Servant of God]], the first step towards Catholic [[sainthood]].

==Early years==
Takashi (meaning "nobility") Nagai had a difficult birth that endangered his and his mother's life. His family was highly educated. His father, Noboru Nagai, was trained in Western medicine; his paternal grandfather, Fumitaka Nagai, was a practitioner of traditional herbal medicine; and his mother, Tsune, was the descendant of an old family of samurai.&lt;ref name="glynn"&gt;Glynn, Paul (2009). ''A Song for Nagasaki''. San Francisco: Ignatius Press. pp. 14–17, 185, 199; {{ISBN|978-1-58617-343-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagai was raised in the rural area of [[Mitoya]] and raised in according to the teachings of [[Confucius]] and the [[Shinto]] religion. In 1920, he commenced his secondary studies at Matsue High School boarding at his cousins' home close by. He became increasingly interested with the surrounding [[atheism]] but was curious about [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shimane-u.ac.jp/docs/2011121200048/ 永井隆博士が旧制松江高校時代の恩師にあてた直筆ハガキを展示 2011年12月12日　島根大学 Dr Nagai's handwritten postcard to his teacher at Matsue High School displayed at Shimane University], shimane-u.ac.jp, 12 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Nagasaki==

In April 1928, he joined the [[Nagasaki University|Nagasaki Medical College]]&lt;ref&gt;Makoto, Nagai (2000). 永井隆―長崎の原爆に直撃された放射線専門医師 "Nagai Takashi- A Radiologist Directly Hit by A-bomb in Nagasaki"], Tokyo/San Paolo, p. 46; {{ISBN|978-4-8056-6407-0}} {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Konishi"&gt;[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110009551840 Konishi, Tetsuro. 永井隆はいかにしてカトリック信者となったか "How Takashi Nagai Become a Catholic"], pp. 75-76, 81-82 ci.nii.ac.jp; accessed 2 November 2016. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Glynn|1988|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he joined the Araragi, a poetry group founded by [[Mokichi Saito]]&lt;ref name="Konishi"/&gt; and the university basketball team (he measured 1.71 m and weighed 70&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="Kataoka"&gt;Kataoka, Yakichi (片岡 弥吉). ''The life of Nagai Takashi'' (永井隆の生涯). San Paolo, 1961, p. 21, 59, 61, 342, 349-50, 355-58, 361; {{ISBN|4-8056-6400-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 his mother died from a [[brain haemorrhage]], which lead him to ponder the works of philosopher and scientist [[Blaise Pascal]]. He began to read the [[Pensées]] which influenced his later conversion to Christianity and boarded with the [[Sadakichi Moriyama|Moriyama family]], who for seven generations had been the hereditary leaders of a group of [[Kakure Kirishitan]]s in Urakami. Takashi learned that the construction of the nearby [[Urakami Cathedral|cathedral]] was financed by poor Christian farmers and fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Glynn|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated in 1932 and was supposed to deliver an address at the ceremony. However, five days before he became [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] at a farewell party and had returned home completely soaked with water from the rain. He slept without drying himself and found the next morning that he had contracted a disease of the right ear (signs of meningitis), which made him depressed and partially deaf. He could not practice medicine and agreed to turn to radiology research.&lt;ref name="Kataoka"/&gt;

On 24 December, Sadakichi Moriyama invited Nagai to participate in a midnight Mass.&lt;ref name="Konishi"/&gt; In the cathedral, Takashi was impressed by the people in prayer, their singing, their faith and the sermon. He would later say: "I felt somebody close to me whom I did not still know." The next night, Sadakichi's daughter Midori was struck down by acute appendicitis. Nagai made a quick diagnosis, telephoned the surgeon at the hospital and carried Midori there on his back through the snow. The operation was successful; Midori, survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Glynn|p=83-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1933, Takashi began his military service. In [[Manchuria]], Nagai cared for the wounded and the sanitary service. He was strongly shaken in his faith in Japanese culture when saw for himself the exactions of the Japanese soldiers and their brutality towards the Chinese civilian population. Upon his return, he continued his reading of the Catholic catechism, the [[Bible]], and the ''Pensées of Blaise Pascal''. He met with a priest, Father [[Matsusaburo Moriyama]], whose father had been deported to [[Tsuwano]] (Shimane Prefecture) for his faith, along with many other Christian villagers in Urakami by the [[Meiji Government]] from the 1860s to the 1870s ([[Urakami Yoban Kuzure]]). Eventually, Nagai's spiritual progress took a decisive turn when he thought about Pascal's words: "There is enough light for those who only desire to see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary disposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Glynn|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Catholicism==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
On 9 June 1934, Nagai received [[baptism]] in the Catholic faith. He chose the Christian first name Paul and proposed to Midori. They married in August and had four children: a boy, Makoto (3 April 1935 – 4 April 2001), and three daughters, Ikuko (7 July 1937 – 1939), Sasano who died shortly after her birth, and Kayano (18 August 1941 – 2 February 2008).

Takashi received the [[sacrament]] of [[confirmation]] in December 1934. Midori was president of the association of the women of the Urakami district. Takashi became a member of the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]] (SSVDP), discovered its founder, [[Frédéric Ozanam]], and his writings, and visited his patients and the poor, to whom he brought assistance, comfort and food. From 1931 to 1936, Father [[Maximilian Kolbe]] lived in a suburb of Nagasaki, where he started a monastery. Takashi met him several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Sino-Japanese War==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The day after the birth of his first daughter Ikuko, the war between Japan and China broke out and he was mobilized as surgeon in the service of the 5th division. He was affected by the harsh winter in China, and the distress of the civilians and soldiers, both Chinese and Japanese. On 4 February 1939, he received news of the death of his father and that of his daughter Ikuko. He remained in China until 1940. Upon his return, he continued his studies at the college.

==World War II==
After Japan declared war on the [[United States]] on 8 December 1941, Nagai had a somber presentiment: His city could be destroyed during this war.

He obtained his doctorate in 1944. On 26 April 1945, an air raid on Nagasaki left numerous victims. The hospital was overwhelmed. Takashi spent his days and nights serving the wounded in his radiology department. In June 1945, he was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] and given a life expectancy of three years.&lt;ref name="Kataoka"/&gt; This disease was probably due to his exposure to [[X-rays]] during radiological examinations which he performed by direct observation, since films were not available during the war period. He spoke to Midori about his disease, and she said to Nagai, "Whether you live or die, it is for God's glory."&lt;ref name="Kataoka"/&gt;

In the evening of 6 August, Nagai learned that an atomic bomb had been dropped by the Americans on Hiroshima. With Midori, he decided to take their children away to Matsuyama, 6&amp;nbsp;km away in the countryside, accompanied by Midori's mother.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Relief activities==
On 9 August 1945, at 11:02 am, the second atomic bomb struck Nagasaki. At the time of the atomic bombing, Dr. Nagai was working in the radiology department of Nagasaki Medical College Hospital. He received a serious injury that severed his right temporal artery but joined the rest of the surviving medical staff in dedicating themselves to treating the atomic bomb victims. He wrote a 100-page medical report about his observations detailing the "concentric circles of death" around the epicentre of the blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bells of Nagasaki |author=Takashi Nagai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August, he found his house destroyed and his wife dead. Months later, Nagai was found to be seriously affected by his head wound. He was confined to bed for a month, with death for a time seeming close as he began suffering from [[Cheyne-Stokes respiration]]. According to Nagai, when he drank water taken from Lourdes in Honkawachi, where Fr. Kolbe had founded a monastery, he heard a voice urge him to ask an intercession from the priest.&lt;ref&gt;Nagai, Takashi (1989). ルルドの奇跡 (''The Miracle of Lourdes''). 原子野録音 (Genshiya Rokuon), p. 37. Seibo no Kishisha; {{ISBN|4-88216-045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar years==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
He returned to the district of Urakami (the epicenter of the bomb) on 15 October 1945 and built a small hut (about six [[tatami]] from pieces of his old house. He remained there with his two surviving children (Makoto and Kayano), his mother-in-law, and two other relatives.&lt;ref name="glynn"/&gt;

In 1947, the local Society of Saint Vincent de Paul (SSVDP) built a simple two-tatami teahouse-like structure for him. Nagai named it "Nyokodo" (如己堂, Nyoko-dō to, literally "As-Yourself Hall", after Jesus' words, "Love your neighbor as yourself." He styled it as a hermitage and spent his remaining years in prayer and contemplation.&lt;ref name="glynn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagai, Takashi (2008). ''Leaving My Beloved Children Behind'', Strathfield: St Paul's Publications. pp. 175–76; {{ISBN|978-1-921472-05-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Man who Loved Others as Himself" (Chapter 4: Nyokodo), Nagasaki; retrieved 23 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nyokodou 2009A.jpg|thumb|Nyoko-do Hermitage, Nagasaki]]
For six months, he observed mourning for Midori and let his beard and hair grow. On 23 November 1945, a mass was celebrated, in front of the ruins of the cathedral, for the victims of the bomb. Takashi gave a speech filled with faith, comparing the victims to a sacred offering to obtain peace.

In the following years, Nagai resumed teaching and began to write books. The first of these, ''[[The Bells of Nagasaki]]'', was completed by the first anniversary of the bombing. Although he failed to find a publisher at first, eventually it became a best seller and the basis for a top box-office movie in Japan. In July 1946, he collapsed on a station platform. Now disabled, he was henceforth confined to bed.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1948, he used 50,000 yen paid by ''[[Kyushu]] Times'' to plant 1,000 three-year-old [[cherry]] trees in the district of Urakami to transform this devastated land into a "Hill of Flowers". Although some have been replaced, these cherry trees are still called "Nagai Senbonzakura" ("1,000 cherry trees of Nagai"); their flowers decorate the houses of Urakami in spring. By 2010, the numbers of these cherry trees were reduced to only about 20 due to aging and other causes.&lt;ref&gt;Yu Kawakami [http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter/article.php?story=20101221112325624_en&amp;query=takashi%2Bnagai Young cherry trees grown from trees planted by Nagasaki A-bomb survivor], Hiroshima Peace Media Center, 22 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 1949, he was made [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] of the city of Nagasaki.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.nagasaki.lg.jp/syokai/720000/721000/p007009.html　名誉・栄誉市民　長崎市(The Honorary Citizens. Nagasaki City)]&lt;/ref&gt; He received a visit from [[Helen Keller]] in October 1948. He was visited, in 1949, by Emperor [[Hirohito]] and by [[Norman Thomas Gilroy|Cardinal Gilroy]] of Australia, a papal emissary.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Death==
On 1 May 1951, he asked to be transported to the college hospital so that the medical students could observe the last moments of a man preparing to die from leukemia. He prolonged the day of hospitalization to wait for the statue of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]], a gift from the Italian [[Catholic Medical Association]].&lt;ref name="Kataoka"/&gt;

Until the evening, his condition seemed stable. However, around 9:40pm, Nagai complained of dizziness and became unconscious. After two injections of cardiotonics, he regained his consciousness and prayed "[[Jesus]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], into your hands, I entrust my soul." Then he took the cross from the hand of his son Makoto, who rushed into the room, and shortly after he shouted the words "Please pray!" Nagai breathed his last at 9:50 pm.&lt;ref name="Kataoka"/&gt; He died at the age of 43. On the following day, his body underwent an autopsy at the hospital according to his will. His spleen had swelled to 3,410g (normal weight: 94g), and his liver weighed 5,035g (normal weight: 1,400g).&lt;ref name="Kataoka"/&gt;

On 3 May, his funeral Mass was celebrated by Bishop [[Paul Aijirō Yamaguchi]] in front of the cathedral. On 14 May, an official ceremony took place in memory of Nagai. An estimated 20,000 attended. The city of Nagasaki observed one minute of silence while the bells of all the religious buildings rang. His remains were interred in the Sakamoto international cemetery.&lt;ref name="Kataoka"/&gt;

==Legacy==
His "Nyokodo", with the addition of a library, became a museum in 1952: the Nagasaki City Nagai Takashi Memorial Museum. After undergoing restoration in 2000, it is managed today by Tokusaburo Nagai, the grandson of Takashi Nagai and son of Makoto Nagai.

The Dr. Takashi Nagai Memorial Museum is in Unnan City, Shimane Prefecture, where he spent his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.unnan.shimane.jp/www/contents/1246529001344/index.html Education and Culture], unnan.shimane.jp; accessed 2 November 2016.{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His name was added to the [[Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations]] erected in [[Hamburg]], Germany.
	
In 1991, the Takashi Nagai Peace Award was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter/article.php?story=20130423095149142_ja 愛と平和がテーマ 島根県雲南市「永井隆賞」小論文や作文を募る] (Love and Peace Are Themes), hiroshimapeacemedia.jp, 23 April 2013. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nagasaki, with the purpose of annually awarding individuals and/or organizations, both domestic and overseas, for their contributions to world peace through the improvements and developments of medicare for hibakusha and related social welfare, the Takashi Nagai Memorial Nagasaki Peace Award was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nashim.org/en/award/index.html Conferment of The Takashi Nagai Memorial Nagasaki Peace Award], Nagasaki Association for Hibakushas' Medical Care, nashim.org; accessed 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2003, for the succession of Nagai's spirit and a center to offer medical care for domestic and overseas [[hibakusha]], the Nagai Takashi Memorial International Hibakusha Medical Center was founded at Nagasaki University Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hibakusha.jp/en Nagai Takashi Memorial International Hibakusha Medical Center], hibakusha.jp; accessed 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==

===Use of nuclear power===
Although Nagai opposed the use of nuclear weapons, he hoped atomic energy might be used for peaceful purposes. At the end of ''Atomic Bomb Rescue and Relief Report'', he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We should utilize the principle of the atomic bomb. Go forward in the research of atomic energy contributing to the progress of civilization. A misfortune will then be transformed to good fortune. The world civilization will change with the utilization of atomic energy. If a new and fortunate world can be made, the souls of so many victims will rest in peace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nashim.org/e_pdf/atomic_bomb/ Atomic Bomb Rescue and Relief Report (長崎医大原子爆弾救護報告Nagasaki Idai Genshi Bakudan Kyuugo Houkoku) Nagasaki Association for Hibakusha's Medical Care], nashim.org; accessed 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Works==
Nagai left behind a voluminous output of essays, memoirs, drawings, and calligraphy on themes including God, war, death, medicine, and orphanhood. These enjoyed a large readership during the American occupation of Japan (1945–52) as spiritual chronicles of the atomic bomb experience. His books have been translated into languages, including Chinese, Korean, French, and German. Three of his literary works are currently available in English: ''We of Nagasaki'', a compilation of atomic-bomb victim testimonies edited by Nagai; ''The Bells of Nagasaki'' (trans. William Johnston); and ''Leaving My Beloved Children Behind'' (trans. Maurice M. Tatsuoka and Tsuneyoshi Takai). His works were recently{{when?|date=June 2018}} republished in new Japanese editions by [[Paulist Press]].

Much of Nagai's writing is spiritual, consisting of Christian reflections on the experience (or, just as often, imagined future experience) of himself and the people around him, especially his children, in the aftermath of the war. His intensely personal meditations are often addressed to his children or to God, and he works out his own spiritual issues on the page as he writes in a visceral and uncensored prose. Nagai's more technical writings, in ''Atomic Bomb Rescue and Relief Report'' (''Nagasaki Idai Genshi Bakudan Kyuugo Houkoku''), were discovered in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/bngkkn/database/Englishdata/BibliographyonA-bombLit.html Atomic Bomb Literature: A Bibliography], hiroshima-u.ac.jp; accessed 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
In July 1949 a song titled "Nagasaki no Kane" ("The Bells of Nagasaki") was released by [[Columbia Records]]. It was sung by [[Ichiro Fujiyama]] with lyrics by Hachiro Sato. [[Yuji Koseki]] was the composer for the song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minyu-net.com/serial/koseki/0713/koseki23.html 古関裕而『うた物語』 長崎の鐘 (Yuji Kosei. "The Stories of Songs".

Nagai's "The Bells of Nagasaki" was used as the basis for a [[The Bells of Nagasaki (film)|film of the same name]] produced by [[Shochiku]] movie studios and directed by Hideo Ōba. It was released on 23 September 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=160483 長崎の鐘 (The Bells of Nagasaki)], allcinema.net; accessed 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leaving These Children Behind'' was filmed by [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=148714 この子を残して(Leaving these beloved Children behind)], allcinema.net; accessed 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British film production company Pixel Revolution Films released the film ''[[All That Remains (film)|All That Remains]]'' based on the life of Nagai in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201402150015|title=Film tells story of Nagasaki scientist who cared for A-bomb survivors|publisher=''[[Asahi Shimbun]]''|date=15 February 2014|accessdate=12 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024153015/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201402150015|archivedate=24 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11993">'''The Cancer Imaging Archive''' ('''TCIA''') is an open-access database of [[Medical imaging|medical images]] for [[cancer]] research. The site is funded by the [[National Cancer Institute]]'s (NCI) Cancer Imaging Program, and the contract is operated by the [[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]]. Data within the archive is organized into collections which typically share a common cancer type and/or anatomical site. The majority of the data consists of [[CT scan|CT]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], and [[nuclear medicine]] (e.g. [[Positron emission tomography|PET]]) images stored in [[DICOM]] format, but many other types of supporting data are also provided or linked to, in order to enhance research utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vendt|first1=Clark|title=The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA): Maintaining and Operating a Public Information Repository.|journal=Journal of Digital Imaging|date=June 2013|volume=26|issue=6|doi=10.1007/s10278-013-9622-7|pmid=23884657|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10278-013-9622-7|pmc=3824915|pages=1045–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; All data are de-identified in order to comply with the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] and [[National Institutes of Health]] data sharing policies.

TCIA resources are intended to support:
* Development of computer aided diagnosis methods (quantitative imaging) 
* Evaluation of unbiased science reproducibility by acceptable standard statistical methods 
* Research on correlation of clinical diagnostic medical images with digital microscopic histological images 
* Exploratory biomarker research for which imaging is a key element 
* Collaboration between cross-disciplinary investigators where imaging is crucial to research on tumor heterogeneity, between patients and within the tumor; tissue temporal response tracking - objective measurements of tumor progression; imaging genomics and Big Data linkages and analysis (clinical, histo-pathology, genomics)&lt;ref name="cancerimagingarchive.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/about-the-cancer-imaging-archive-tcia/|title=About The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) - The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)|website=The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Prior to the creation of TCIA, the NCI funded development of the [[National Biomedical Imaging Archive]]. NBIA is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Web application]] which was designed to allow the storage and query of DICOM images. TCIA was subsequently initiated in December 2010 to expand data sharing activities by funding a service component which would help address the technical and policy challenges associated with medical imaging research. TCIA leverages open-source tools such as NBIA and Clinical Trials Processor in order to provide its services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|last2=Vendt|first2=Bruce|last3=Smith|first3=Kirk|last4=Freymann|first4=John|last5=Kirby|first5=Justin|last6=Koppel|first6=Paul|last7=Moore|first7=Stephen|last8=Phillips|first8=Stanley|last9=Maffitt|first9=David|date=2013-07-25|title=The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA): Maintaining and Operating a Public Information Repository|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10278-013-9622-7|journal=Journal of Digital Imaging|language=en|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1045–1057|doi=10.1007/s10278-013-9622-7|issn=0897-1889|pmc=3824915|pmid=23884657}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imaging.cancer.gov/informatics/thecancerimagingarchive|title=The Cancer Imaging Archive|website=Cancer Imaging Program - National Cancer Institute|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization of the archive ==
The site content is organized into five categories:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cancerimagingarchive.net|title=The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) - A growing archive of medical images of cancer|website=The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* About Us - Provides a general overview of the site the organizations responsible for operating it.
* Share Your Data - Provides an overview of how to apply to upload data to the archive.
* Access the Archive - Provides information about the available data, methods for accessing that data and system usage metrics.
* Research Activities - Provides information about major research initiatives being conducted using TCIA data as well as information about publication guidelines.
* Help - Provides information about how to get support using the archive as well as documentation and data usage policies.

== Methods for accessing data ==
Most collections on the Cancer Imaging Archive can be accessed without an account, but a few are restricted to specific users and therefore require an account to access them.&lt;ref name="cancerimagingarchive.net"/&gt; TCIA has several ways to browse, filter, and download data. They include:
* Downloading the entire contents of a collection in bulk
* Leveraging the [[National Biomedical Imaging Archive|NBIA]] application to filter or search within or across collections
* Utilizing the [[RESTful API Modeling Language|RESTful]] [[Application programming interface]] to filter or search within or across collections

=== Browsing, bulk downloading and access to supporting data ===
The home page includes a list of all available collections. Basic information about the data such as the cancer type, cancer location, modalities, and number of subjects are also provided. Clicking on a collection name presents a page which describes the data including its original research purpose, how the data were generated, and how it might be useful to other TCIA users. For example, {{doi|10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.L4FRET6Z}} describes the NSCLC-Radiomics-Genomics Collection.  In the lower section of the page there are links to search or download the images and any available supporting data in the Data Access tab.  Additional tabs provide information about data versions and how to cite the data if used in publications.

Many collections contain additional data types such as genomics, patient demographics, treatment details, and expert analyses of the images. This data is usually only found by browsing the collection pages as opposed to searching in NBIA or using the API.

=== Filtering or searching with NBIA ===
On each Collection page and also in the main menu of the site there are links to "Search TCIA".  This will load the NBIA application which allows simple, advanced and free text searches. Search results follow the conventional DICOM hierarchy of patient -&gt; study -&gt; series.  TCIA provides comprehensive documentation on the various features of the NBIA software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/Cancer+Imaging+Archive+User%2527s+Guide|title=Cancer Imaging Archive User's Guide - TCIA Online Help - Cancer Imaging Archive Wiki|website=wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RESTful API ===
A number of search and download commands are also available through the API. New iterations on the API are released as new versions, so that existing applications developed against older versions of the API continue to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/NIIiAQ|title=TCIA Programmatic Interface (REST API) Usage Guide - The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) Public Access - Cancer Imaging Archive Wiki|website=wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research activities ==
A list of known publications based on TCIA data is maintained as a convenience to researchers who might want to investigate how it has been used previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/uIEiAQ|title=Publications - The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) Public Access - Cancer Imaging Archive Wiki|website=wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to peer-reviewed publications there are also several major research initiatives described in the Research Activities section of the site.

=== The CIP TCGA Radiology Initiative for Radiogenomics Research ===
A large number of collections contain subjects which were analyzed as part of the NIH/NHGRI database known as [[The Cancer Genome Atlas]] (TCGA). This offers researchers the ability to correlate clinical images using shared unique identifiers each study that has in TCGA extensive genomic analysis, digital pathology slides and bulk download of individual demographic data and clinical data. A multi-institutional network of investigators volunteering their time is using the data to develop methods to determine prognosis or predict the response to therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/sgEe|title=CIP TCGA Radiology Initiative - The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) Public Access - Cancer Imaging Archive Wiki|website=wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; TCGA collections are designated by nomenclature shared by the TCGA Data Portal&lt;ref&gt;[https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov TCGA Data Portal]&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g.: TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-GBM, etc). They are subject to a special publication policy which is unique from the other public data on TCIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/c4hF|title=Data Usage Policies and Restrictions - The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) Public Access - Cancer Imaging Archive Wiki|website=wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenge competitions ===
TCIA also provides specific data sets used for "Challenge" competitions such as international digital image-focused professional societies like MICCAI, [[SPIE]], or ISBI. A directory of previous and upcoming challenges is maintained on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/nYIaAQ|title=Challenge competitions - The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) Public Access - Cancer Imaging Archive Wiki|website=wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital object identifiers ===
To facilitate data sharing, many publications encourage authors to include data citations to the data that the authors used in creating the results described in their scholarly papers.  In addition, new journals are now available for describing data collections outright (e.g., [[Nature Publishing Group|Nature]] ''Scientific Data''). TCIA assigns digital object identifiers (DOIs) to all collections when they are submitted, and also has the ability to create persistent identifiers linked to subsets of data held within TCIA that authors may use for data citations in their scholarly papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/sgH1|title=TCIA Digital Object Identifiers - TCIA DOIs - Cancer Imaging Archive Wiki|website=wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Unnatural Causes: Is Inequality Making Us Sick?''''' is a four-hour [[Documentary film|documentary]] series, broadcast nationally on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in spring 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/unnaturalcauses/ Unnatural Causes at PBS.org]&lt;/ref&gt; that examines the role of [[social determinants of health]] in creating [[health inequalities]]/[[health disparities]] (which the film considers health inequities) in the United States. Based on extensive research by a wide variety of academics, public health experts, and medical practitioners, the seven-part series explores how [[Social class|class]] and [[racism]] can have greater impacts on one's health outcomes than [[genetics]] or personal behavior.

The opening 56-minute episode, ''In Sickness and In Wealth'', presents the series’ overarching themes. Each supporting half-hour episode, set in a different [[ethnic]]/[[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] community, provides a deeper exploration of how social conditions affect population health, and how some communities are extending their lives by improving them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unnaturalcauses.org Unnatural Causes companion site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episode descriptions==

===Episode 1: ''In Sickness and In Wealth'' (56 min.)===
''Produced by Christine Herbes-Sommers and Llewellyn M. Smith; Co-produced by Julie Crawford; Directed by: Llewellyn M. Smith''

The first hour of the series presents a general framework for understanding the relevance of [[social determinants of health]] in creating health inequalities in the United States. The episode introduces the U.S.’s poor health statistics (according to the film) compared to other wealthy industrialized countries, then presents research from [[Michael Marmot| Michael Marmot’s]] [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]], which found that health status and wealth correlate on a continuous gradient from the poor to the wealthy. To understand why this gradient exists, the program looks at the negative health effects of [[chronic stress]], and at evidence that those lower on the social spectrum suffer more from exposure to “toxic stress.” Throughout the program, these fairly academic and complex arguments about [[Stress (biological)|stress]], [[Social class|class]], and health are humanized through the stories of four residents of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], from four different [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic levels]]. Through looking at the lives of a hospital CEO, a lab supervisor, a janitor, and an unemployed mother, the program illustrates how stress increases and control over one’s life decreases as one moves down the socio-economic ladder, with very real consequences for health.

The program includes interviews with the following experts: [[Nicholas Christakis]] ([[Medical sociology|Medical Sociologist]], [[Harvard University]]), Sheldon Cohen ([[Psychologist]], [[Carnegie mellon|Carnegie Mellon University]]), Ana Diez Roux ([[Epidemiology|Epidemiologist]], [[University of Michigan]]), Tony Iton (Director, [[Alameda County]] Public Health Dept.), Ichiro Kawachi (Epidemiologist, [[Harvard School of Public Health]]), Nancy Krieger ([[Social epidemiology|Social Epidemiologist]], Harvard School of Public Health), [[Michael Marmot]] (Epidemiologist, [[University College London]]), [[Bruce McEwen]] ([[Neuroscientist]], [[Rockefeller University]]), Carol Shively ([[Comparative psychology|Comparative Psychologist]], [[Wake Forest University]]), Jack P. Shonkoff ([[Pediatrician]], Harvard Center on the Developing Child), S. Leonard Syme (Epidemiologist, [[UC Berkeley]]), Adewale Troutman (Director, [[Government of Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville Metro]] Public Health &amp; Wellness), and David Williams ([[Sociologist]], Harvard School of Public Health).

===Episode 2: ''When the Bough Breaks'' (27 min.)===
''Produced by Tracy Heather Strain, Randall MacLowry, and Eric Stange; Directed by Tracy Heather Strain''

This episode examines the phenomenon that [[African American]] women, on average, are significantly more likely to give birth to [[Premature birth|premature]] and/or [[Birth weight|low-weight]] babies than [[White people|white]] women, even when studies control for factors like income and education. Interviews with [[Neonatology|neonatologists]] James Collins ([[Children's Memorial Hospital]], [[Chicago]]) and Richard David ([[Stroger Hospital|Stroger Hospital of Cook County]]) present the theory that this [[Health inequality|inequality]] could be due in part to lifelong exposure to the [[chronic stress]] of [[racism]]. After providing evidence against [[Genetics|genetic]] causes for the disparity, the program further explores how exposure to racism might affect health. [[Obstetrician]] Michael Lu ([[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|UCLA School of Medicine]]) discusses the “[[Life course approach|life course model]],” which posits that an individual’s health is determined not only by genetics and current circumstances, but by all circumstances experienced since conception (and even before). The negative [[Physiology|physiological]] effects of chronic stress during pregnancy are discussed, and interviews with David Williams ([[Sociologist]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]]), Camara Phyllis Jones (Physician and [[Social epidemiology|Social Epidemiologist]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]), Nancy Krieger (Social Epidemiologist, Harvard School of Public Health), Carol Hogue ([[Epidemiologist]], [[Emory University]]), and Fleda Jackson ([[Psychologist]], Emory University) explore the legacy and persistence of racism against African Americans in the United States.

The episode weaves in the personal story of Kim Anderson, a well-paid African American lawyer in good health, who “did everything right,” but still delivered her first child two and a half months early.

===Episode 3: ''Becoming American'' (27 min.)===
''Produced and directed by Patricia Garcia Rios and Maria Teresa Rodriguez''

This episode discusses the phenomenon that new Latino immigrants, though often poor, generally have better health than the average American. Evidence that social ties are good for health is considered as a possible factor in this health advantage, sometimes called the "[[Hispanic Paradox|Latino Paradox]]."

===Episode 4: ''Bad Sugar'' (27 min.)===
''Produced and directed by James M. Fortier (Métis-Ojibway); Co-produced by Sativa January''

This episode examines the very high rates of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|adult onset diabetes]] among the [[Pima people|Pima]] Indians of southwest [[Arizona]]. The film states that forty years of research have produced no evidence of a [[Genetics|genetic]] cause; the program explores how the tribe’s diet changed dramatically when the diversion of water to white farmers and cities made the reservation residents dependent on government food programs to avoid starvation. Now that the [[Tohono O'odham]] tribe has regained their water rights and is returning to farming, community groups are working to promote cultural renewal and new economic opportunities, hoping improve diets and living conditions and beat diabetes.

===Episode 5: ''Place Matters'' (27 min.)===
''Produced and directed by [[Ellie Lee]]''

This episode considers the importance of neighborhood environments (such as pollution, violence, parks, and schools) to health. The program first travels to [[Richmond, California]], to meet Gwai Boonkeut, a [[Laos|Laotian]] immigrant in his forties who recently suffered a major heart attack. Looking at the [[urban blight]], lack of services, pollution, and violence endemic to Richmond since its post-[[World War II]] decline, the show considers how a neighborhood environment may limit healthy choices and contribute to [[chronic stress]] for its residents. Interviews with scholars and community action groups also present evidence that the poor state of many of the country's [[inner city|inner cities]] arose from historical factors and government housing policies that favored the white middle class. The program then travels to [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] to see how community activists, public health officials, and others came together to transform the [[High Point, Seattle, Washington|High Point neighborhood]].

===Episode 6: ''Collateral Damage'' (27 min.)===
''Directed and produced by Eric Stange; Co-produced by Kimberlee Bassford''

This episode looks at the legacy of [[United States]] presence in the equatorial Pacific nation of the [[Marshall Islands]]. Decades ago, local residents were relocated from their home islands to make way for [[Pacific Proving Grounds|U.S. nuclear weapons testing]]. While the program mentions the immediate health consequences for the Marshallese people due to [[nuclear fallout]] from testing, it also goes further to consider how the military presence continues to affect the small nation. Specifically, it considers the relationship between the U.S. military base on [[Kwajalein]], where American citizens live relatively healthy, middle-class lives, and [[Ebeye]], home to most of the base's Marshallese employees, where overcrowding, failing infrastructure, and poverty contribute to chronic [[tuberculosis]] and low life expectancies. The episode ends with a brief look at the Marshallese community in [[Springdale, Arkansas]].

===Episode 7: ''Not Just a Paycheck'' (29 min.)===
''Directed and produced by James Rutenbeck; Co-produced by Franziska Blome''

This episode explores how the closing of the [[Electrolux]] factory in [[Greenville, Michigan]] had serious negative effects on the health of the community. The program ends by comparing the situation in Greenville with that of [[Västervik|Västervik, Sweden]], where workers who lost their jobs after an Electrolux factory closure fared much better due to income and educational supports.
