'''Abhidharma-samuccaya''' (Sanskrit; Tibetan Wylie: ''mngon pa kun btus''; English: ''Compendium of Abhidharma'') is a [[Buddhist]] text composed by [[Asanga]]. ''Abhidharma-samuccaya'' is a complete and systematic account of the [[Abhidharma]]. 

According to Traleg Rinpoche, the ''Abhidharma-samuccaya'' is one of Asanga's most essential texts and also one
of the most psychologically oriented. It provides a framework, as well as a general pattern, as to how a practitioner is to follow the path, develop oneself and finally attain Buddhahood.&lt;ref name=t1&gt;Traleg Rinpoche (1993), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It presents the path according to the [[Yogachara]] school [[Mahayana Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; 

==Mental factors==
{{main|Mental factors (Buddhism)}}

The second chapter of this text enumerates fifty-one [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] (Sanskrit: ''caitasika''), divided into the following categories:&lt;ref name=berzin1&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/science-of-mind/mind-mental-factors/primary-minds-and-the-51-mental-factors ''Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors'' by Alexander Berzin] (see section "Count of the Mental Factors")&lt;/ref&gt;
* five ever-functioning factors (kun-’gro lnga, 遍行心所, {{lang-ko|변행심소}}),
* five ascertaining (object-determining) ones (yul-nges lnga, 別境心所, {{lang-ko|별경심소}}),
* eleven virtuous ( or constructive) emotions (dge-ba bcu-gcig, 善心所, {{lang-ko|선심소}}),
* six root disturbing emotions and attitudes (rtsa-nyon drug, 煩惱心所, {{lang-ko|번뇌심소}}),
* twenty auxiliary disturbing emotions (nye-nyon nyi-shu, 隨煩惱心所, {{lang-ko|수번뇌심소}}),
* four changeable factors (gzhan-‘gyur bzhi, 不定心所, {{lang-ko|부정심소}}).

==Contemporary scholarly analysis==
Contemporary scholar Achim Bayer asserts that the thought of different sections of the ''Abhidharma-samuccaya'' might be heterogenous. For example, the important term ālayavijñāna appears not more than six times, with all six
occurrences in the Lakṣaṇasamuccaya section, i.e. within in the first third of the work.&lt;ref name=t2&gt;Bayer (2010), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Acaciella angustissima''''' ('''Prairie acacia''', '''White ball acacia''', '''Ocpatl''', '''Palo de Pulque'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hortipedia.org/de/index.php?title=Acacia_filiciana Hortipedia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001003102/http://www.hortipedia.org/de/index.php?title=Acacia_filiciana |date=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is most recognized for its drought tolerance and its ability to be used as a green manure and ground covering. It is a perennial, deciduous, and belongs to the [[Fabaceae]] family (bean/legume) and as it grows it starts as a [[shrub]] but eventually matures to a small [[tree]]. The tree has a high density of leaves along with small clumps of white flowers and creates 4–7&amp;nbsp;cm long seed pods. 
''Acaciella angustissima'' is found in tropical areas around the equator since, its water needs can vary from 750-2,500&amp;nbsp;mm a year. It has an advantage it can withstand a moderate drought, since its leaves are retained even in long dry periods. Aside from being drought tolerant, ''Acaciella angustissima'' also has the benefit of being a green manure, since it has such a high leaf density, but also loses the majority of its leaves each season. So the leaves can be used in composting or can be saved and used as livestock feed. It should only be used as an additive to the feed and not the main source, since it also toxic in high doses

== Description ==
''Acaciella angustissima'' belongs to the shrub family but can also look similar to a small tree when fully grown, since its height can vary from 2 – 7 m depending on the growing conditions.  Large clumps of small white flowers cover the branches of the bush. The flowers have 5 petals with a large number of stamens extended far past the petals.&lt;ref name="tropicalforages.info"&gt;Tropical Forages, [http://www.tropicalforages.info/key/Forages/Media/Html/Acacia_angustissima.htm ''Acaciella angustissima'' (as ''Acacia angustissima'')], ''Tropical Forages''&lt;/ref&gt;  The plant also produces a small seedpod that starts out green, but then turns brown when fully matured. The seedpods usually have a length of 4–7&amp;nbsp;cm, and are 6–8&amp;nbsp;mm wide. The leaves which are one of the plant’s key traits are made up of 10-20 pairs of long thin leaves that go down a stem. They come in pairs of 3-12. One unique feature of the ''Acaciella angustissima'' is that it is thornless unlike most members of the genus ''[[Acacia]]''&lt;ref name="wildflower.org"&gt;Texas Wildlife Center, [http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=ACAN ''Acaciella angustissima'' (as ''Acacia angustissima'')], ''Wildlife Center''&lt;/ref&gt; (which it formerly belonged to).

== History ==
''Acaciella angustissima'' comes from the Fabaceae family of plants. It only grows in very wet parts of the world, usually around the equator due to its large consumption of water. It is native to southern parts of North America, the Caribbean and the majority of South America.&lt;ref name="wildflower.org"/&gt; However, it is able to grow at almost any elevation and usually prefers a warm climate of 25-30 degrees Celsius. ''Acaciella angustissima'' is still one of the many crops under-utilized and researched. Luckily there is hope, roughly 20 years ago researches started evaluating it in tropical areas such as Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="tropicalforages.info"/&gt;

== Natural habitat ==
[[File:Acacia angustissima 01nsh.jpg|thumb|none|250px|''Acaciella angustissima'' fruit (bean)]]
'''Altitude''':  0-2600m&lt;br&gt;
'''Annual Temperature Mean''':  5-30 deg. C.&lt;br&gt;
'''Annual Rainfall Mean''':  895-2870mm&lt;br&gt;
'''Soil''':  ''A. angustissima'' is well-suited for acidic, low-nutrient soils and it has very good resistance to [[drought]].&lt;ref name="world"&gt;[http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/sea/products/afdbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1762 World Agroforestry Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042432/http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/sea/products/afdbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1762 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growing Conditions ==
Since ''Acaciella angustissima'' is a shrub, it propagates (spreads) through its seeds or clippings.&lt;ref name="wildflower.org"/&gt; The seeds come from all the pods that the ''Acaciella angustissima'' grows each year, and the clippings should be taken from a somewhat hard branch, to better support themselves when transplanted.&lt;ref&gt;NC State University, [http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/hil/hil-8702.html “Plant Propagation by Stem Cuttings”], ''NC State University''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Acaciella angustissima'' should be planted in March or April in soil that has good drainage and is more on the acidic side on the pH scale.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Simmons, [www.worldwidewattle.com/infogallery/cultivation/ Cultivation of ''Acacias''], ''World Wide Wattle''&lt;/ref&gt; To be most effectively utilized it should be used to prevent erosion, since it has such a large root system. This is also one of its downfalls, since when it is intercropped with other species its roots can be a major competitor for vital nutrients. Luckily its fallen leaves can provide enough N, K, and P to keep smaller nearby plants healthy, and provide some shade at the same time.&lt;ref name="Prairie Acacia"&gt;James E. Smith, [http://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_acan.pdf Prairie ''Acacia''], ''USDA''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Acaciella angustissima'' is self-sustaining and does not need fertilizer, but has been found to respond well to fertilizer when added. However, the plant has a large water requirement. It requires a minimum "rain fall" of 700&amp;nbsp;mm but can handle up to a maximum of 3 000&amp;nbsp;mm.

== Uses ==

=== Alcoholic beverages ===
The bark is used in the production of alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;  The root is used in the drink [[pulque]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rätsch | first = Christian | authorlink = Christian Rätsch | coauthors = | title = Enzyklopädie der psychoaktiven Pflanzen. Botanik, Ethnopharmakologie und Anwendungen. | publisher = | date = | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-3-85502-570-1| page = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forage ===
The seeds of ''Acaciella angustissima'' are high in [[protein]] and are somewhat useful as [[Fodder|forage]] for [[livestock]].&lt;ref name="ILDIS"&gt;[http://www.ildis.org/LegumeWeb?version~10.01&amp;LegumeWeb&amp;tno~15362&amp;genus~Acacia&amp;species~angustissima ''Acaciella angustissima'' (as ''Acacia angustissima'')]&lt;/ref&gt;  The tree has a [[tannin]] content of 6%, which inhibits the ability of livestock to make use of the tree's [[protein]].&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

=== Medicine ===
[[File:Acan 001 lvd.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Acaciella angustissima'']]

The indigenous [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]] and [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] [[Maya peoples|Maya people]] of Mexico use ''A. angustissima'' to treat [[digestive tract]] problems.  They also use it to treat [[toothache]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and cuts of the [[skin]].  Experiments have shown that ''A. angustissima'' mildly inhibits the growth of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

== Constraints to wider adoption ==
There are unfortunately many constraints holding ''Acaciella angustissima'' back from being adopted. Firstly the amount of water it needs to survive is 3 – 4 times the amount of rainfall found in more northern parts of Africa. This is unfortunate since dry land farmers could benefit the most from this tree. The second and most important constraint is that, ''Acaciella angustissima'' can actually act as a weed. It is so effective at propagation that it spreads rapidly.&lt;ref name="Prairie Acacia"/&gt;  Thirdly, ''Acaciella angustissima'' contains roughly 10% tannins, which is the plant's natural defense mechanism. The taste created by the tannins is not usually welcomed, and the compound itself negatively affects livestock digestive systems.&lt;ref&gt;Anteonello Cannas, [http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxicagents/tannin.html “Plants Poisonous to Livestock], ''Cornell University – Animal Science''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical Information ==
The most important fact about ''Acaciella angustissima'' is that it has turned into a weed in its native habitat, so it should only be used in a controlled environment or when absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name="tropicalforages.info"/&gt;   The only times it should be considered are when dealing with a harsh conditions where only weeds can survive, and some type of ground cover is needed to help with erosion control. If these circumstances are true, then the expected final height of the plant should be kept in mind when planting to prevent over crowding. Intercropping would also be complementary, by allowing farmers to take advantage of the unused space between plants, the nitrogen fixing habit, and the shade provided by the bushy branches.&lt;ref name="Prairie Acacia"/&gt; It should be noted that due to the complex structure of the leaves it can take a year for them to decompose and release nutrients into the soil. To create a seed bank, it is important to remove all the seeds from the pod, and then clean them before storing, so that the pod doesn’t break down and start attracting insects.

:''Amoron should not be confused with [[Amaron]], [[Ammaron]], [[Ammoron]] or [[Moron (Book of Mormon)]] four other Book of Mormon figures with similar names.''
{{Religious text primary|date=October 2011}}


According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Amoron''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|ɔːr|ɒ|n}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «a-mōr´än»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] from the fifth century AD, and was a contemporary and subordinate of the [[prophet]] and army commander [[Mormon (Book of Mormon prophet)|Mormon]]. During the final war between the [[Lamanites]] and [[Nephites]], Amoron reported to Mormon.

'''Aztek''' is the name of two superheroes in the [[DC Universe]]. Both versions are based out of the fictional Vanity City. Aztek is the champion of the [[Aztecs|Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]].  The first Aztek first appeared in ''Aztek, The Ultimate Man #1'' in August 1996, created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]]. Following the short run series, Aztek appeared in several issues of ''[[Justice League|JLA]]'' also written by Morrison.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Jimenez  | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Aztek | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 32  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Fictional character biography==
===Uno===
Uno is raised from childhood by a secret organization named the Q Society to be the champion of the [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]] to battle their enemy, the Aztec god [[Tezcatlipoca (DC Comics)|Tezcatlipoca]]. He is given a magical suit of armor that bestows many abilities, complementing Uno's peak human mental and physical abilities.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; After his training is completed, he enters the United States and assumes the identity of recently deceased physician Curt Falconer.&lt;ref&gt;''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #1 (August 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aztek later joins the [[Justice League]],&lt;ref&gt;''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; but resigns when it is revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q Society is [[supervillain]] [[Lex Luthor]].&lt;ref&gt;''JLA'' #15 (February 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He is later blinded helping the League save the Earth in a battle against the planet-destroying machine [[Mageddon]] (apparently the Tezcatlipoca that the cult was referring to all along). Aztek ultimately sacrifices himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] story arc.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA'' #41 (May 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nayeli Constant===
A new version of the character appeared in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' vol. 5 #20; instead of being Uno/Curt Falconer, the new hero is Nayeli Constant. She was a software engineer in Austin, Texas who was startled by the Aztek helmet bursting into her window and telling her about the millennia-long war against the dark god Tezcatlipoca. She decided to accept the role of the new Aztek and modified the armor to suit her purposes; eventually finding her way to Vanity after The Ray left the city to join the Justice League of America. When he returned from a mission, the two encountered one another and briefly argued about who should protect the citizens of Vanity but they teamed up to stop a criminal and decided that the city could use both heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-aztek-rebirth/|title=Justice League of America: Aztek to Make Rebirth Debut|date=8 October 2017|website=Cbr.com|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Aztek has peak human physical and mental conditioning. He wears an ancient helmet and armor (powered by a "four-dimensional mirror"), from which he derives flight, infrared and X-Ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation, as well as augmenting his peak physical abilities to superhuman levels. The helmet could feed information directly into his brain even after he was blinded in his first confrontation with Mageddon. The four-dimensional power source could self-destruct in a highly explosive manner.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

==Other versions==
===The Rock of Ages===
A younger black female Aztek, with the same abilities, was seen in Grant Morrison's run on JLA during "''The Rock of Ages''" storyline in which the JLA traveled to an [[alternate future]] overrun by [[Darkseid]]. She sacrifices her life to destroy Darkseid's lunar facilities.

==In other media==
[[File:Aztek.jpg|thumb|right|Aztek in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' along with Shayera Hol, Superman and King Faraday in the episode "I Am Legion".]]

===Television===
*Aztek appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', mostly appearing in brief cameos throughout the series.  After making a very brief appearance in "Question Authority" (voiced by Chris Cox), he made a more significant appearance in "I Am Legion" (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) where he helped Superman and [[Shayera Hol]] investigate where Lex Luthor had gone after escaping prison. Superman asked Aztek to scan the scene to see if he could find out where Luthor went, but had no luck after finishing his scan. [[King Faraday]] then appeared behind the trio and introduced himself to Aztek.

==Bibliography==
The original run of the [[eponym]]ous title has been collected as a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]: ''JLA Presents: Aztek, the Ultimate Man'' (by co-authors [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]], and pencils by N. Steven Harris, and inks by [[Keith Champagne]], 1996, collects ''Aztek, the Ultimate Man'' #1–10, 240 pages, April 30, 2008, {{ISBN|1-4012-1688-9}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=9011 |title='&amp;#39;JLA Presents: Aztek, the Ultimate Man'&amp;#39; profile at DC |publisher=Dccomics.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aztek also appeared in several issues of Morrison's ''JLA'' (5, 10–12, 15, 36, 38–41), as well as the final two issues of Mark Millar's ''JLA: Paradise Lost'' and his fill-in issue for ''JLA'' (27).

He has profile entries in ''JLA Secret Files and Origins'' #1, ''JLA–Z'' #1, and ''The DC Comics Encyclopedia''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6449">In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), there is a general prohibition, deriving from the [[Word of Wisdom]], against intoxicating substances, with [[cannabis]] explicitly banned by the church since 1915.&lt;ref name="Sanna2014"/&gt;

==Early prohibitions==
In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members, and two months later the state of [[Cannabis in Utah|Utah banned cannabis]]. Some scholars have linked the two events, arguing that cannabis usage by Mormon returnees who had earlier fled to [[Mexico]] led the church, and later the state to make its decision.&lt;ref name="Sanna2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=E.J. Sanna|title=Marijuana: Mind-Altering Weed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnDTBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88|date=2 September 2014|publisher=Mason Crest|isbn=978-1-4222-9299-0|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contradict this, noting that [[Utah]]'s prohibition laws were part of a larger package of anti-drug laws which happened to include cannabis, but did not indicate a statewide concern.&lt;ref name="Newton2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Newton|title=Marijuana: A Reference Handbook, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=77P5DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=16 January 2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-5052-3|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1971 decriminalization==
The decriminalization effort in 1971 was said to be strong in Utah due to the state's high rate of use of cannabis, and Mormon members' preference to handle matters within the church and family.&lt;ref name="Clark 2007 p. 508"&gt;{{cite book | last=Clark | first=D.S. | title=Encyclopedia of Law and Society: American and Global Perspectives | publisher=SAGE Publications | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-7619-2387-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlGoODMSEKcC&amp;pg=PT508 | page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to modern cannabis movement==
As medical and recreational cannabis [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalization movements]] began in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century in the [[United States]], the LDS Church has been asked for its position on the issue. 

In a 2010 conference for local church leaders in Colorado, [[General Authorities]] of the church, including now current church President [[Russell M. Nelson]], explained in answer to a question that the church has no position on [[Medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] and that the issue was left to individual consultation with scriptures and a member's [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/2018/04/12/gehrke-lds-churchs-stance-on-medical-marijuana-doesnt-make-sense-why-is-it-ok-for-a-nevada-mormon-but-not-a-utah-mormon/|title=Gehrke: LDS Church’s stance on medical marijuana doesn’t make sense. Why is it OK for a Nevada Mormon but not a Utah Mormon?|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same stance was later reiterated in a private discussion among the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] in a 2010 video that was made public in 2016. The discussion included consensus that the church opposed recreational marijuana use more broadly but had no position on medical use specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mormon Leaks|title=In Which They Fret Over the Growing Popularity of Marijuana|date=2016-10-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8hVH919KmY&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the church released a statement supporting efforts to legalize [[CBD oil]] in Utah, but not whole-plant cannabis remedies:

{{quote|While we are not in a position to evaluate specific medical claims, the Church understands that there are some individuals who may benefit from the medical use of compounds found in marijuana. For that reason, although the Church opposes [[Utah Senate Bill 73|SB 73]], it has raised no objection to SB 89. These two competing pieces of legislation take very different approaches when it comes to issues like access, distribution, control and the potential harm of the hallucinogenic compound, THC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= David |last= Wells |url= http://fox13now.com/2016/02/12/lds-church-clarifies-stance-on-medical-marijuana/ |title= LDS Church issues new statement on medical marijuana |publisher= [[KSTU]] (fox13now.com) |date= February 12, 2016 |accessdate= 2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October 2016, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the LDS Church sent a letter to [[ward (LDS Church)|congregations]] in [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[Arizona]] (states which were to vote on legalized recreational cannabis in November), urging members to oppose legalization:

{{quote|Drug abuse in the United States is at epidemic proportions, and the dangers of marijuana to public health and safety are well documented. Recent studies have shed light particularly on the risks marijuana use poses to brain development in youth. The accessibility of recreational marijuana in the home is also a danger to children. ... We urge Church members to let their voices be heard in opposition to the legalization of recreational marijuana.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Curtis |first=Larry D. |url=http://kutv.com/news/local/lds-leaders-urge-members-to-vote-against-legalizing-marijuana |title=LDS leaders urge members to vote against legalizing marijuana |publisher= [[KUTV]] |date= October 13, 2016 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Church of Scientology Celebrity Centres''' are [[Church of Scientology|Scientology churches]] that are open to the general public but are intended mostly for "artists, politicians, leaders of industry, sports figures and anyone with the power and vision to create a better world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International | url = http://www.scientology.cc/en_US/about/index.html | publisher = Church of Scientology Celebrity International | accessdate = 14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celebrity Centre International was established in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 1969 by  Yvonne Gillham, a [[Sea Org]] member who worked with [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. Since then, other centres have been established in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Florence]], [[Las Vegas]], [[London]], [[Munich]], [[Nashville]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Vienna]], and a number of other cities across the world.&lt;ref name="newyorker_2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all |title=The Apostate |last=Wright |first=Lawrence |date=February 14, 2011 |work=The New Yorker |publisher=Condé Nast Digital |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Scientology point to Hubbard's launch of "Project Celebrity" in 1955 to recruit celebrities into the church, and that the centres were established as an extension of this initial purpose.&lt;ref&gt;William Shaw, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3671262/What-do-Tom-Cruise-and-John-Travolta-know-about-Scientology-that-we-don%27t.html What do Tom Cruise and John Travolta know about Scientology that we don't?], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', February 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Hoffman and Kim Christensen (''[[Los Angeles Times]]'') [http://www.newsday.com/topic/la-fi-scientology18dec18,0,2956222,full.story Tom Cruise and Scientology], ''[[Newsday]]'', December 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The church denies the existence of a policy to recruit high-ranking celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12800404/ Official transcript for Countdown show (May 12, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgqKA3w6T2U YouTube video with part of the show related to Scientology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violent incident ==
On November 23, 2008, Mario Majorski arrived at the Los Angeles Celebrity Centre wielding dual samurai swords and threatening to injure people. Majorski was shot by Celebrity Centre security guards, and was later pronounced dead at [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center]]. [[Police]] regard the guards' actions as justifiable. Majorski was a [[Scientologist]] in the early 1990s; however, he left the group fifteen years prior to the incident, according to church spokesperson [[Tommy Davis (Scientology)|Tommy Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5223393.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Scientology guards kill swordwielding man in LA | first=Hannah | last=Strange | date=2008-11-24 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-briefs4-2008dec04,0,1853307.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Killer of sword-wielding man won't face charges | first=Harriet | last=Ryan | date=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was still a member of the church, Majorski had filed lawsuits, later dismissed, against [[Louis Jolyon West|Louis West]], a psychiatrist who was critical of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Harriet|last2=Wagner|first2=James|title=Man shot at Scientology site had made threats|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/25/local/me-scientology25|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theresienstadt was originally designated as a model community for middle-class Jews from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. Many educated Jews were inmates of Theresienstadt. In a propaganda effort designed to fool the western allies, the Nazis publicised the camp for its rich cultural life. In reality, according to a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor,  &lt;!--name??--&gt;"during the early period there were no [musical] instruments whatsoever, and the cultural life came to develop itself only&amp;nbsp;... when the whole management of Theresienstadt was steered into an organized course."&lt;ref name="Broder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.iit.edu/interview?doc=schlaefrigF&amp;display=schlaefrigF_en |website=Voices of the Holocaust |title=David P. Boder Interviews Friedrich Schlaefrig |date=August 23, 1946 |location=Paris, France |accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community in Theresienstadt tried to ensure that all the children who passed through the camp continued with their education. The Nazis required all camp children over a certain age to work, but accepted working on stage as employment. The prisoners achieved the children's education under the guise of work or cultural activity. Daily classes and sports activities were held. The community published a magazine, ''[[Vedem]].'' The history of the magazine was studied and narrated by the Italian writer [[Matteo Corradini]] in his book ''La repubblica delle farfalle'' (''The Republic of the Butterflies''). Sir [[Ben Kingsley]] read that novel, speaking on 27 January 2015 during the ceremony held at Theresienstadt to mark International [[Holocaust Memorial Day]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Ilse Weber]], a noted Czech Jewish poet, writer and musician for children, was held in the camp from February 1942, and worked as a night nurse in the camp's children's infirmary. She volunteered to join a transport of children to Auschwitz in November 1944, where she, her son Tommy, and all the children with her were murdered in the gas chambers immediately on arrival.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Conductor [[Rafael Schächter]] was among those held at the camp, and he formed an adult chorus. He directed it in a performance of the massive and complex ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. Schächter conducted 15 more performances of the work before he was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=May it go to the heart |author=Bret McCabe |date=Winter 2012 |url=http://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2012/winter/may-it-go-to-heart |magazine=Johns Hopkins Magazine |accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violinist Julius Stwertka, a former leading member of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and co-leader of the [[Vienna Philharmonic]], died in the camp on 17 December 1942.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Pianist [[Alice Herz-Sommer]] (held with her son, Raphael Sommer) performed 100 concerts while imprisoned at Theresienstadt. She and Edith Steiner-Kraus, her friend and colleague, both survived the camp, emigrated to Israel after the war, and became professors of music, Herz-Sommer at the [[Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance|Jerusalem Academy of Music]], and Steiner-Kraus at the Tel Aviv Academy of Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkley|first=George E.|title=Hitler's Gift: Story of Theresienstadt|year=2002|page=262|isbn=978-0828320641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Roman]] and [[Coco Schumann]] were part of the jazz band [[Ghetto Swingers]]. Artist and art teacher [[Friedl Dicker-Brandeis]] created drawing classes for children in the ghetto, among whom were [[Hana Brady]] ("Hana's suitcase").{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} They produced more than 4,000 drawings, which she hid in two suitcases before she was deported to Auschwitz in the final liquidation. The collection was preserved from destruction, and was discovered a decade later. Most of these drawings can now be seen at the [[Jewish Museum in Prague]], whose archive of the Holocaust section administers the Terezín Archive Collection. Others are on display at [[Yad Vashem]] in Jerusalem. The children of the camp also wrote stories and poems. Some were preserved and later published in a collection called ''[[I Never Saw Another Butterfly]]'', its title taken from a poem by young Jewish Czech poet [[Pavel Friedman]]. He had arrived at Terezín on 26 April 1942, and later murdered at Auschwitz.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Painter [[Malva Schalek]] (Malvina Schalkova) was deported to Theresienstadt in February 1942. She produced more than 100 drawings and watercolours portraying life in the camp. On 18 May 1944, due to her refusal to paint the portrait of a collaborationist doctor, she was deported to Auschwitz, where she was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schalek|first=Malva|title=Theresienstadt pictures|url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~catherine.stodolsky/malva/thstd/pix.html|accessdate=14 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612231121/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~catherine.stodolsky/malva/thstd/pix.html|archivedate=12 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and architect [[Norbert Troller]] produced drawings and watercolours of life inside Theresienstadt, to be smuggled to the outside world. When the Gestapo found out, he was arrested and deported to Auschwitz, where he was liberated by the Russians in 1945. His memoirs and two dozen of his artworks were published in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Troller|first=Norbert|title=Theresienstadt: Hitler's gift to the Jews|year=1991|publisher=University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Composer [[Viktor Ullmann]] was interned in September 1942, and died at Auschwitz in October 1944. He composed some twenty works at Theresienstadt, including the one-act opera ''[[Der Kaiser von Atlantis]]'' (''The Emperor of Atlantis or The Refusal of Death''). It was planned for performance at the camp, but the Nazis withdrew permission when it was in rehearsal, probably because the authorities perceived its allegorical intent. The opera was first performed in 1975, and shown in full on [[BBC]] television in Britain. It continues to be performed.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Music composed by inmates is featured in ''[[Terezín: The Music 1941–44]]'', a two-CD set released in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64111685.html|date=11 November 1999 |last=Campbell |first=R.M. |title=Holocaust Musicians Left Powerful Legacy |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=1 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102141510/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64111685.html|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4697092.html |title=Testament of Terezín |newspaper=The Independent |location=London, UK|date=28 January 1995|last=Stearns|first=David Patrick|accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection features music composed mostly in 1943 and 1944 by [[Pavel Haas]], [[Gideon Klein]], [[Hans Krása]], and [[Viktor Ullmann]] while interned at Theresienstadt.

In 2007, the album ''[[Terezín - Theresienstadt (Anne Sofie von Otter album)|Terezín – Theresienstadt]]'' of music composed at Theresienstadt was released by the Swedish singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], assisted by baritone [[Christian Gerhaher]], pianists, and chamber musicians. In 2008, [[Bridge Records]] released a recital by Austrian baritone [[Wolfgang Holzmair]] and American pianist Russell Ryan that drew on a different selection of songs.

====Culture as Survival ====
Scholars have interpreted acts of cultural expression through theater, music, and art in Theresienstadt as a strategy for survival by those deported there. The ghetto became the site of a wide variety of works of art using different artistic mediums, from lectures to drawings, and devoted to a variety of themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blodig |first1=Vojtech |last-author-amp=yes |first2=Joseph Robert |last2=White |chapter=Terezin |title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum encyclopedia of camps and ghettos, 1933–1945 |url=https://www.ushmm.org/research/publications/encyclopedia-camps-ghettos/volumes-i-and-ii-available-online |editor1=Geoffrey P.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis decided that Theresienstadt could function uniquely as a place to deport member of Europe’s cultural elite.{{sfnb|Rovit|Goldfarb|p=172}} At this time the ''Freizeitgestaltung'' (Association of Free Time Activities) was established, and cultural activities were allowed by the Nazis. However, instruments had previously been smuggled into Theresienstadt since 1941, and many artists considered them to be among their most basic needs.{{sfnb|Karas|1985|pp=13-15}} Children in the ghetto expressed themselves and their reactions to their circumstances through drawings in the lessons permitted by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=Ghetto2930/&gt; With these outlets, the people attempted to create a sense of hope within the ghetto.{{sfnb|Rovit|Goldfarb|p=173}}

In Theresienstadt, cultural production thrived much more than in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]]. Art in the ghetto underwent drastic development as it allowed for depiction and representation of true life in Theresienstadt.&lt;ref name=Ghetto2930/&gt; The artwork provided the people with an artistic outlet through which they could express their feelings of defiance.{{sfnb|Karas|1985|p=18}} Despite constant deportations of inmates to the East, the ghetto inhabitants remained determined to continue performing and creating. Places in casts often needed to be reassigned as participants were deported.&lt;ref name=Ghetto2930/&gt; The people remained strong willed in their persistence to create, as it helped them remain hopeful and live a more humane existence.&lt;ref name=Ghetto2930/&gt; [[Rafael Schachter]] was one of the pioneering members of cultural activity in Theresienstadt. In the early days of Theresienstadt’s cultural activity, Schachter included a satirical sketch in his first performance.{{sfnb|Karas|1985|pp=11-14}} Later in his time in Theresienstadt, Schachter put together a rendition of [[Requiem (Verdi)|Verdi’s ''Requiem'']]. In this version of ''Requiem,'' Schachter changed the ending notes to communicate a resistance signal. [[Adolf Eichmann]] and other important Nazi leaders were in the audience for a performance of Schachter’s ''Requiem,'' and Eichmann specifically enjoyed this version of the piece.{{sfnb|Kramer|1998|p=17}} The Nazi’s didn't understand the underlying meanings of the change to ''Requiem'' or many other works performed in the ghetto.{{sfnb|Kramer|1998|p=21}}

On September 23, 1943, the first performance of the children’s show ''[[Brundibár|Brundibar]]'' appeared in Theresienstadt. The show was performed fifty five times, and was the most successful show of all of the productions ever performed in the ghetto. Cast members were replaced as they were deported, but the show's main acts remained the same throughout the duration of the performances.{{sfnb|Karas|1985|p=100}} ''Brundibar’s''  original composer [[Hans Krása|Hans Krasa]] composed a new score for the show in Theresienstadt as the original score had been lost, and the show was put together by Rudolf Freudenfeld under the supervision and tutelage of Rafael Schachter.{{sfnb|Rovit|Goldfarb|pp=193-194}} For the Theresienstadt performances of the show, poet Emil A. Saudek changed the ending lines from the original version to emphasize a political meaning behind the show. It was clear to the audience that the show’s main antagonist represented [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], but the Nazi’s themselves did not realize the hidden meaning in ''Brundibar'', and even had the show presented during a visit by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].{{sfnb|Rovit|Goldfarb|pp=197-198}} ''Brudibar'' was the top musical performance ever performed at Theresienstadt.{{sfnb|Karas|1985|p=102}}

''[[Der Kaiser von Atlantis|Emperor of Atlantis]]'' was another opera produced in Theresienstadt. The opera was created by [[Peter Kien]] and [[Viktor Ullmann]], who created the opera in the form of a legend so that they could include hidden meaning that would be missed by the Nazi’s.{{sfnb|Kramer|1998|p=19}} Ullman strategically used music to include undertones with resistance implications, including artistic manipulation of [[Deutchland Uber Alles]], and a secondary version of sheet music, with less direct implications than the version that was actually rehearsed, was handed over to the Nazi.{{sfnb|Kramer|1998|pp=20-21}} Ultimately, ''Emperor of Atlantis'' was never performed at Theresienstadt, although scholars differ on their reasoning as to why the opera never reached performance. The show may have ended before being performed because the Nazi’s in control of the ghetto saw the allegorical connection to Hitler and [[Nazi Germany]] in the opera’s plot line.{{sfnb|Kramer|1998|p=22}} Alternatively, some scholars say the show never reached performance because of deportation to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].{{sfnb|Karas|1985|p=35}}

Scholar’s views vary on Nazi reaction to the production of Theresienstadt’s cultural works. Some say the Nazis remained indifferent to the work that was composed and sung inside the ghetto.&lt;ref name=Ghetto2930/&gt; Others say that the Nazis encouraged the artistic production, as the SS thought that nothing from Theresienstadt would ever reach outside of the ghetto.{{sfnb|Kramer|1998|pp=15 &amp; 17}}

'''David W. Orme-Johnson''' (born January 17, 1941) is a former professor of [[psychology]] at [[Maharishi University of Management]] in [[Fairfield, Iowa]]. He is the author of over 100 papers investigating the effects of the [[Transcendental Meditation technique]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthabouttm.org/truth/Home/AboutDavidOrme-Johnson/index.cfm Truth About TM]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
David Orme-Johnson was born in [[El Paso, Texas]]. He received a B.A. from [[Columbia University]] in Psychology in 1963, and  a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology (with a second speciality in Quantitative Methods) (1969) from the [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orme-Johnson|first=David|author2=Michael Dillbeck|title=Maharishi’s Program to Create World Peace: Theory and Practice|journal=Modern Science and Vedic Science: An Interdiciplinary Journal Devoted to Research on the Unified Field of All the Laws of Nature|year=1987|volume=1|issue=2|pages=207–259|url=http://www.mum.edu/pdf_msvs/v01/orme-johnson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

From 1969 to 1971, Orme-Johnson served as a lecturer at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] (UTEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

While at UTEP, he conducted the first research on the effects of Transcendental Meditation (TM) on autonomic stability and autonomic recovery from stressors. The paper, published in ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', the journal of the American Psychosomatic Society, reported fewer spontaneous galvanic skin responses (GSR) in meditators, and more rapid habituation of the GSR to loud tones.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychosomatic Society [http://www.psychosomatic.org/about/index.htm] Orme-Johnson, D.

According to Orme-Johnson he was Vice Chancellor of [[Maharishi European Research University]], [[Seelisberg]], Switzerland from 1975 to 1977 and Acting President of Maharishi University of Management from 1976 to 1977.&lt;ref name="Self Published Bio Data"/&gt;

In 1982, Orme-Johnson was the co-presenter for a report on Transcendental Meditation research given at Congressional hearings by the Subcommittees on International Security and Scientific Affairs to establish an Academy of Peace. Orme-Johnson gave a four-point proposal dedicated to peace in the US and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Orme-Johnson, D.W. &amp; Dillbeck, M.C. (1982, July 21).

Orme-Johnson's paper, "International peace project in the Middle East" was published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution in 1988 and again in 1990 in the ''Scientific Research on Maharishi’s Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi Program: Collected Papers''.

They complained that Orme-Johnson refused to share his raw data and concluded that the probability of the Maharishi Effect theory was "very close to zero".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

He participated in a delegation of teachers from Maharishi International University who traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] to provide instruction in Transcendental Meditation in 1990. The trip, initially scheduled to last ten days, was extended to six months and resulted in the training of 35,000 people in Transcendental Meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''David Shayler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ|l|ər}}; born 24 December 1965) is a former [[United Kingdom|British]] [[MI5]] officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wadham|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/aug/21/davidshayler.comment|title=David faces Goliath|work=The Guardian|date=21 August 2000|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shayler was prosecuted under the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]] for passing secret documents to ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' in August 1997 that alleged that MI5 was paranoid about [[socialism|socialists]], and that it had previously investigated [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] ministers [[Peter Mandelson]], [[Jack Straw]] and [[Harriet Harman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Timeline - David Shayler's MI5 secrets |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/216877.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=28 December 2013 |date=18 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shayler was born in [[Middlesbrough]], England; when he was 10 his family left the northeast. He attended [[John Hampden Grammar School]] in [[High Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]] whose head teacher, according to Shayler himself, once described him as "a born rebel who sails close to the wind ... and suffers neither fools nor their arguments gladly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended the [[University of Dundee]] from 1984 where he was editor of the student newspaper ''Annasach'' and was responsible for publishing extracts of the book ''[[Spycatcher]]'' by another former MI5 officer [[Peter Wright]] (banned in Britain at the time).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/216868.stm BBC: Troubled history of the Official Secrets Act]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a 2:1 degree in [[English Language|English]] (2nd class honours upper division) in July 1989. After leaving university he worked as a journalist at ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' newspaper although his employment was terminated six months later. {{Citation needed|reason=Not clear whether this happened and according to whom|date=March 2017}}

==MI5 career==
Shayler joined MI5 in October 1991 after responding to an oblique job advertisement in the 12 May edition of ''[[The Observer]]'' titled "Godot isn't coming" a reference to the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in which Godot never arrives. The advert asked if applicants had an interest in current affairs, had common sense and an ability to write. Believing the job was media related, Shayler applied.&lt;ref&gt;Ronson, J,(2011),  ''The Psychopath Test, ''Picador: London, p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

He started work in F branch, which dealt with counter-subversion, including the monitoring of left-wing groups and activists, where he worked vetting [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politicians prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 election]], later being transferred to T branch, which handled Irish terrorism, in August 1992. Shayler moved again, to G9 branch, responsible for Middle Eastern terrorism where he reportedly headed the Libyan desk as G9A/5. It was during his tenure at the Libyan desk that he claims that he learned of the [[MI6]] plot to assassinate Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Gaddafi]] from his MI6 counterpart David Watson (PT16B) and Richard Bartlett (PT16) who had overall control and responsibility for the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the service in October 1996.

==After MI5==
{{BLP refimprove|section|date=August 2017}}
Shayler stated that MI6 had been involved in a failed assassination attack on [[Libya]]n leader Colonel Gaddafi in February 1996 without the permission of the then foreign secretary Sir [[Malcolm Rifkind]]. The plot involved paying the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]] with supporters in London and links to [[Al-Qaeda]] [[Pound sterling|£]]100,000 to carry out the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Gambill|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=411&amp;issue_id=3275&amp;article_id=2369477|title=The Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG)|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|date=24 March 2005|accessdate=14 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718051648/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=411&amp;issue_id=3275&amp;article_id=2369477|archivedate=18 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was paid to plant a bomb underneath Gaddafi's motorcade. The attack happened in March 1996 in Gaddafi's native [[Sirte]], a coastal city. The bomb was planted under the wrong car and failed to kill Gaddafi but did result in the deaths of several innocent civilians.&lt;ref name="Gaddafi"/&gt; In November 1999 he sent a dossier of detailed evidence of this including the names of those involved to then home secretary [[Jack Straw]] who stated that he was "looking into the matter"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/shayler/article/0,,359729,00.html |title=David Shayler: Don't shoot the messenger|newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 August 2000|accessdate=22 July 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Parliament's [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] and the police. In 2005, the LIFG was banned as a terrorist group in Britain.

Shayler claimed the intelligence services were deliberately planting stories in newspapers and the mainstream media by feeding willing journalists with misinformation, such as a November 1996 article in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' by [[Con Coughlin]] linking Colonel Gaddafi's son with a currency [[Counterfeit#Counterfeiting of money|counterfeiting]] operation citing the source as a British banking official when in reality the source was MI6. This was later confirmed when Gaddafi's son served the paper with a libel writ which later admitted the true source of the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Leigh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/shayler/article/0,,339990,00.html|title=Tinker, tailor, soldier, journalist|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 June 2000|accessdate=6 July 2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shayler the [[Israeli Embassy Attack in London|1994 bombing of the Israeli embassy]] in London was known to the intelligence services before it happened, and could have been prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defending The Realm: MI5 and the Shayler Affair|last=Mark Hollingsworth &amp; Nick Fielding|first=|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=0 233 99776 8|location=London|pages=145-147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government later placed an injunction on the republication of Shayler's claims although this was later lifted on 2 November 1997 allowing the paper to print his claims of how the [[1994 London Israeli Embassy attack|bombing of the Israeli Embassy in London]] in 1994 could have been prevented if the service had acted on prior knowledge it had obtained. On 19 June 1998 he told ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine that the security service had information that could have prevented the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

After revealing information to ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' in August 1997, Shayler fled the day prior to publication, first to [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]] and then later to [[France]] with his girlfriend and former colleague [[Annie Machon]] and was arrested by [[French police]] on 1 August 1998 with an extradition warrant on the request of the British government and then held in [[La Santé Prison]] for four months under the prisoner number 269151F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/165967.stm|title=Whistle-blower on the web|publisher=BBC News|date=7 September 1998|accessdate=4 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 November 1998 the [[Judiciary of France|French courts]] determined the British government's extradition request was politically motivated and therefore not grounds for [[extradition]]. In 2000, Shayler appeared on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' via satellite, where he was the subject of a number of jokes.&lt;ref name=bbc-20000821&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/890450.stm |title=Whistleblower calls the tune|publisher=BBC|date=21 August 2000|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return and trial==
[[File:David Shayler.jpg|thumb|right|David Shayler talking at an [[anti-war]] meeting at [[Sheffield University]]]]

In August 2000, Shayler voluntarily returned to the UK on condition he was not [[Detention of suspects|remand]]ed in custody pending his trial. He was arrested and subsequently released on bail. He was charged with three counts of breaching the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]] on 21 September 2000, one charge of passing on information acquired from a telephone tap (a breach of Section Four of the Act), and two others of passing on information and documents obtained by virtue of his membership of the service (a breach of Section One of the Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

At the trial Shayler represented himself, claiming that the Official Secrets Act was incompatible with the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] and that it was not a crime to report a crime although these arguments were dismissed by the court with the latter being ruled irrelevant.&lt;ref name="guardianmi5"/&gt; Shayler's defence attempted to argue that there were no other avenues to pursue his concerns with the service and its performance. The judge ruled that while this was true it was irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/shayler/article/0,,834442,00.html |title=Richard Norton-Taylor and John Wadham: The public has the right to the truth |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 November 2002 |accessdate=22 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge instructed the jury to return a guilty verdict and that the House of Lords had ruled in another case that a defendant could not argue that he had revealed information in the public interest. After more than three hours of deliberation the jury found him guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/shayler/article/0,,830205,00.html |title=Shayler faces jail after jury rejects impassioned plea |newspaper=The Guardian |date=5 November 2002 |accessdate=22 July 2009 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002 he was sentenced to 6 months in prison, of which he served three weeks in [[Belmarsh prison]] and just under five weeks in [[Ford (HM Prison)|Ford Open Prison]], with the four months served on remand in France being taken into consideration. He was finally released on 23 December 2002, although he was electronically tagged and under a 7pm to 7am curfew for a further seven weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Following the release of the [[9/11 Commission Report]], David Shayler joined the [[9/11 Truth Movement]], which maintains as its primary tenet the belief that the official explanation for the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] is partly (or completely) fraudulent. Shayler claims the planes seen crashing into the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] were switched out planes {{Clarify|date=September 2011}} with detonation pods underneath, as well as saying that the attack on the Pentagon was not the result of a plane impact.&lt;ref name="noplaners"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.newstatesman.com/200609110028 |title=Meet the No Planers |work=New Statesman |location=London |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Shayler appeared in Ireland with [[Annie Machon]] and [[William Rodriguez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.ie/article/80546?search_text=corruption%20ireland&amp;userlanguage=ga&amp;save_prefs=true|title=Rodriguez, Shayler &amp; Machon come to Cork Tuesday Feb 27th|publisher=Indymedia |date=22 January 2007|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Shayler and his former partner, Machon, have repeatedly claimed that the mainstream British media has misreported their statements and judgments passed against them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e9b_1221182366|title=Annie Machon, ex-MI5 agent, reveals government false-flag terrorism operations|publisher=LiveLeak.com|date=15 June 2008|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spies, Lies, and Whistleblowers. MI5, MI6 and the Shayler Affair&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to smear their reputations.

===Claims of divinity===
Shayler speaks positively about [[David Icke]], another individual who has claimed to be the son of God: "David has done some enormously important work. I see him as the John the Baptist to my Christ. I have spoken to him on the phone and suggested we meet." Shayler has said he is committed to destroying what he calls the "Zionist empire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Milmo|first=Cahal|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/what-renegade-mi5-officer-david-shayler-did-next-1763246.html|title=What renegade MI5 officer David Shayler did next...|work=[[The Independent]]|date=27 July 2009|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transvestism===
In an article in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' in 2009, Shayler further discussed the Messiah claim and revealed that he was living as a woman in a squat in Abinger Hammer, Surrey. His former girlfriend, Annie Machon, claims Shayler's long battle with the intelligence services led him to suffer a breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/meet-delores-the-exmi5-officer-now-living-as-a-woman-6801922.html|title=Meet Delores, the ex-MI5 officer now living as a woman|work=London Evening Standard|date=17 July 2009|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shayler has since told newspapers that his [[transvestite]] '[[alter ego]]' is called '''Delores Kane'''.&lt;ref name="milmo"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/what-renegade-mi5-officer-david-shayler-did-next-1763246.html|title=What renegade MI5 officer David Shayler did next...|last=Milmo|first=Cahal|date=28 July 2009|work=The Independent|accessdate=28 July 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom}}
'''Freedom of religion in Germany''' is guaranteed by article 4 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] (constitution). This states that "the freedom of religion, conscience and the freedom of confessing one's religious or philosophical beliefs are inviolable. Uninfringed religious practice is guaranteed." In addition, article 3 states that "No one may be prejudiced or favored because of his gender, his descent, his race, his language, his homeland and place of origin, his faith or his religious or political views." Any person or organization can call the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] for free help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/organisation/vb_merkblatt.html Fact sheet on the constitutional complaint at the Federal Constitutional Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906021058/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/organisation/vb_merkblatt.html |date=2011-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German system of state support for otherwise independent religious institutions assists all religions equally in principle, though in practice it has been unable to fully encompass some [[minority religion|minority faiths]].&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany|title=Germany|work=|publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|date=|accessdate=2011-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012004817/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany|archive-date=2013-10-12|dead-url=yes|df=}} See drop-down essay on "Religious Freedom in Germany"&lt;/ref&gt; The government has granted most of the country's major religious communities "public law corporation" (PLC) status – ''Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts'' in German – which allows for numerous benefits. Traditions that lack a centrally organized national structure – most notably [[Islam in Germany|Islam]] – have had difficulty attaining PLC status and the benefits that come with it.&lt;ref name="georgetown1"/&gt;

== Legal situation ==
The freedom of religion in the Grundgesetz (Basic Law) means one may adopt any kind of religious or non-religious belief, practice it in private or in public, confess it, or keep it for oneself. The state does not identify with any religious organization.

Religious freedom, like the other basic rights of the Grundgesetz, is limited where it collides with the core value of [[human dignity]] or with the basic rights of others, or if it is misused to fight against the basic constituency of free democracy.

Art. 4 sec. III provides for the right to refrain from [[military service]] in the name of religion (lit. "[[conscience]]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview4/archives/2001/2/rob12.pdf Religious Freedom in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Collective" freedom of religion ===
German law on freedom of religion distinguishes between ''individual'' and ''collective'' freedom of religion. Collective freedom of religion additionally covers the legal statutes of religious organizations. Of special interest is the statute of ''corporate body under public law'', which allows the organization to collect [[church tax]] and hold religious education in state schools.

==== Types of legal statutes ====
A [[religion in Germany|religious group in Germany]] can be formed under all legal statutes. It can be organised as a [[company]] under [[Corporate law]], but tax regulations, company duties, and responsibilities are often seen as disadvantages. A [[voluntary association]] can be formed by anybody. Registration as an "[[eingetragener Verein]]" (abbreviated e.V.) gives the advantage of legally functioning as a corporate body ([[juristic person]]), rather than a simple group of individuals. It can by used by any secular or religious group.

====Non-profit corporation====
Two other types of organizations are often employed: the most frequent are ''gemeinnützige'' [[not-for-profit corporation]]s, which can be companies or registered associations.  This status requires not only limitation to non-commercial activities, but similar to American non-profit organizations, it is limited to those whose primary objective is to support an issue or matter of private interest or public concern for non-commercial purposes. Like many other countries, nonprofits may apply for [[tax exemption status]], so that the organization itself may be exempt from taxes. In some cases, financial donors may claim back any [[income tax]] paid on their [[donation]]s, or deduct from their own tax liability the amount of the donation.

====Corporate body under public law====
The second is a ''Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts'' (''corporate body under public law''), a status which is specifically granted to religious groups. Some smaller communities may have this status in one state, while they maintain a different status in another. The status has a string of benefits attached. Religious communities which are organized under public law have the right to collect contributions ([[church tax]]) according to laws which are similar to general tax laws. Religious communities enjoy further privileges regarding building and tax regulations, the ability to teach religion as a regular course in state schools, and the ability to be represented in media consulting committees.

===== The right to collect church tax =====
The so-called "[[church tax]]" ({{lang-de|Kirchensteuer}}) for ''corporate bodies under public law'' is collected with the regular state tax by the state from all registered members of these denominations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icnl.org/research/journal/vol3iss2/art_1.htm][https://archive.is/20041030023915/http://www.natcath.com/NCR_Online/archives/012999/012999f.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of tax regulations within the limits set by state laws, communities may either request the state to collect fees from members in the form of a surcharge of the income tax assessment (the authorities would then withhold a collection fee), or they may choose to collect the tax themselves.

In the first case, membership to the community is registered onto a taxation document (''Lohnsteuerkarte''). The member's employer must then withhold church tax prepayments from the income of the employee in addition to the prepayments on the annual income tax. In connection with the final annual income tax assessment, the state revenue authorities also finally assess the church tax owed. In case of self-employed persons or other tax payers not employed, state revenue authorities collect prepayments on the church tax together with prepayments on the income tax.

In case of own collection, collecting communities may demand the tax authorities to reveal taxation data of their members, in order to be able to calculate the contributions and prepayments owed. In particular, smaller communities (e.g. the Jewish Community of [[Berlin]]) chose to collect taxes by themselves in order to save the collection fee{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Collection of church tax may be used to found institutions and foundations or to pay ministers.

The church tax is only paid by members of the respective religious ''corporate body under public law'' . Those who are not members of a tax collecting denomination are not required to pay it. Members of a religious community which is a ''corporate body under public law'' may formally declare to state authorities that they wish to leave the community (this is commonly referred to as "leaving the church"). With such declaration, the obligation to pay church taxes ends. The concerned religious organisations usually refuse to administer [[rites of passage]], such as marriages and burials of (former) members who had seceded. To rejoin a religious ''corporate body under public law'' one would get one's declaration of re-entry officially recorded. The [[Conference of the German Bishops]], however, considers the declaration to "leave the church" to be a [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] act to be punished automatically by [[excommunication]].

The church tax is historically rooted in the pre-Christian Germanic custom where the chief of the tribe was directly responsible for the maintenance of priests and religious cults. During the Christianization of Western Europe, this custom was adopted by the churches into the concept of ''Eigenkirchen'' (churches owned by the landlord), which stood in strong contrast to the central church organization of the Roman Catholics. Despite the resulting medieval conflict between the emperor and pope, the concept of church maintenance by the ruler remained the accepted custom in most Western European countries. In Reformation times,&lt;ref&gt;Zippelius, Reinhold: Staat und Kirche, 2. Auflage, Mohr Siebeck, 2009, ch. 9, 12&lt;/ref&gt; the local princes in Germany officially became heads of the church in Protestant areas, and were legally responsible for the maintenance of churches; the aforementioned practice is legally referred to as ''Summepiscopat''. Only in the 19th century did the financial flows of churches and state get regulated to a point where the churches became financially independent – the church tax was introduced to replace the state benefits the churches had obtained before.

=====Fee for leaving a religious corporate body under public law=====

In July 2008, the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] had to decide whether a fee for leaving a religious corporate body under public law ("leaving the church") was in accordance with the constitution. Ultimately, the court decided it was an unconstitutional infringement of religious liberty.&lt;ref name="SP08082008"&gt;[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel Online]], August 8, 2008, [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,570854,00.html Länder dürfen für Kirchenaustritt Gebühren kassieren] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Decision  of the Federal Constitutional Court (Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts): [http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rk20080702_1bvr300607.html BVerfG, 1 BvR 3006/07 vom 2.7.2008]&lt;/ref&gt; As the state of affairs in August 2008 noted, declaring that one is no longer a member of a church costs between 10 and 30 € in most federal states. It is free in [[Berlin]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Bremen]], and [[Thuringia]]; in some [[Township|communities]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], in contrast, it may cost up to 60 €.&lt;ref&gt;Decision  of the Federal Constitutional Court (Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts): [http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rk20080702_1bvr300607.html BVerfG, 1 BvR 3006/07 vom 2.7.2008], para. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In its decision, the Federal Constitutional Court also clarified that the legislator is required by the constitution to reduce the fee, in cases where the person who wants to "leave the church" does not have any personal income.&lt;ref&gt;Decision  of the Federal Constitutional Court (Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts): [http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rk20080702_1bvr300607.html BVerfG, 1 BvR 3006/07 vom 2.7.2008], para. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The German atheist group [[IBKA]] disagreed with the decision and took the issue to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Internationaler Bund der Konfessionslosen und Atheisten / International league of non-religious and atheists: [http://www.ibka.org/en/fee-european-court Fee for leaving church is brought before European Court of Human Rights], press release, December 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The right to provide religious education at state schools=====
Education is the responsibility of the 16 federal states (''Bundesländer''), and each state can decide how to organise religious education.
In most states, religious education is obligatory. The curriculum is provided by the churches and approved by the state. Usually the Roman Catholic Church and one Protestant Church each provide school lessons for members of their own denominations, and for members of other denominations that wish to participate. Smaller denominations and some other religious minorities either co-operate with one of the big ones or may decide to conduct classes outside school. In the latter case they can provide the school with details of pupils' performance, so that this information can be included in school reports.

Children who do not want to participate in religious education are obliged to attend an alternative class called "ethics", in which various issues of philosophy, society, and morals are discussed.

In most cases, even if pupils that stay in one class for almost all their lessons, they are divided into three groups (Roman Catholic, Protestant, Ethics) for their religious education, joining other pupils they might not know very well, but who belong to the same denomination.

The position is reversed in some states (Berlin, Brandenburg): the default option, similar to "ethics", is called "knowledge of life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/13377308 God and Berlin], The Economist, Mar 26th 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Pupils may choose instead to attend a denominational course. As the city has many Muslim immigrant children, Berlin also offers Islamic classes, although Muslim associations are not ''corporate bodies under public law''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/city-profiles/berlin/ Islam in Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states (Bremen, Hamburg) have different systems of their own.
=== Blasphemy law ===
{{#section-h::Blasphemy law|Germany}}

== Historical development ==
The [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 changed the legal situation from a uniform Roman Catholic area to the ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' principle, which defined freedom of religion for territorial princes, while their subjects had to follow them{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}. Individuals had at best the possibility to move into an area where their confession was practiced. Depending on the reigning prince, there could exist a certain tolerance towards other denominations, but not as a common law.

In the first half of the 17th century, Germany was laid to waste by the [[Thirty Years' War]], where the lines between enemies within Germany followed mainly denominational borders between the areas of the [[Catholic League (German)]] and those of the [[Protestant Union]], resulting in a time of harsh intolerance. Pastor and hymn writer [[Paul Gerhardt]] was forced out of office in 1755 due to his staunch Lutheran convictions in a Berlin ruled by a reformed prince. In the 18th century, the idea of freedom of religion was promoted by cultural leaders like philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] and dramatist [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], but their stress was on the freedom of the individual to believe or to not adhere to the beliefs of a dominant state church.

The [[German Empire]] of 1871 recognized a basic religious freedom for individuals. The constitution of Weimar of 1919 defined individual freedom of religion in article 136: the civil and civic rights and duties are neither qualified nor restricted by exercise of freedom of religion. No one can be forced to attend an ecclesiastical act or ceremony or be forced to take part in religious exercises or use a religious formula of oath.

Article 137 was about religious associations. Main points include the omission of recognition of a state church. Religious associations manage their own affairs within the limits of general law. Religious offices are given without the influence of the state. Religious associations are legal entities. Religious associations which are "bodies of public law" keep this status. Other religious associations can request the same rights, if they can show by their constituency and number of members that they are permanently established. Associations with the purpose of cultivating a world view have the same status as religious associations.

During the time of the Third Reich, there was a very real danger of religious persecution for adherents of any religious association beside the [[Protestant Reich Church]].

In 1949, West Germany formulated religious freedom in the Grundgesetz. On the other hand, communist East Germany did officially claim religious freedom, which existed in actual practice only for low-key private exercise of religion, and did not interfere with any duties towards the state. Outspoken pastors had to face prison in extreme cases, but the more frequent way of dealing with openly confessing Christians and clerics was subtle repression, like strict observance by the state security, or forbidding admission to college for their children.

== Social and cultural dimension ==

While church and state in Germany are legally separated, and have been so since the [[Weimar Republic]], there remains the fact that Germany has been under the dominating social and cultural influence of one single church, be it Protestant or Roman Catholic. This influence determined education, arts, music, customs, festivals, lifestyle, and even, to some degree, architecture. In eastern Germany and in urban areas, this cultural influence of religion has been substantially reduced; but, in rural areas, it still can be felt in Bavaria, and in some areas of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and the [[Siegerland]].

==Individual freedom of religion==
Besides ''collective'', German law protects ''individual'' freedom of religion, which is to be distinguished into ''positive'' and ''negative'' freedom of religion. ''Negative'' freedom of religion covers the right ''not'' to confess your faith unless legally required (i. e. registration for [[church tax]]) and the right ''not'' to be exposed to religion while in a position of "subordination" where one is legally required to attend. Landmark decisions are the Crucifix Decision&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the German Federal Constitution Court (Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts) [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv093001.html BVerfGE 93, 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Headscarf Decision.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the German Federal Constitution Court (Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts) [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv108282.html# BVerfGE 108, 282]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crucifix Decision===
In the Crucifix Decision the German Federal Constitution Court in 1995 decreed a law that insisted on the presence of religious symbols (crucifixes) in public institutions to be illegal, excluding in some Roman Catholic elementary schools. The court further demanded that the symbols must be removed if a parent does not agree with them. In 1973, a Jew complained successfully that his freedom of religion was violated by the obligation to speak in a German courtroom decorated by a cross.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the German Federal Constitution Court (Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts) [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv035366.html BVerfGE 35, 366]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Headscarf Decision===
In 2004, the German Supreme court denied a [[Muslim]] teacher the right to wear a [[headscarf]] in class, on the basis that she had to represent [[Objectivity (philosophy)|neutrality]]. In this case, freedom of religion (of teachers) had to be brought into "balance" with the state's authority over schools (art. 7), the freedom not to be exposed to religion while in a state of subordination (art. 4), resp. the parents' rights to raise their children (art. 6), and the specific duties of teachers as state servants (art. 33). German courts rarely hold the freedom of religious and non-religious belief to be infringed, as freedom of religion is limited by the exertion of other basic rights (and duties) guaranteed by the ''Grundgesetz''. Already in the late 1970s, a teacher had also been denied the right to wear the distinct clothing of his religion at the workplace.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In Germany, high school students are not excused from classes on [[sexual education]]&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the German Federal Constitution Court (Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts) [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv047046.html BVerfGE 47, 46]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[evolution theory]] on the basis of religion, as it collides with the state's authority over schools (art. 7) and the legal duty to attend schools. Homeschooling for religious reasons is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/8576769.stm Where homeschooling is illegal]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apostasy ===
To leave a church or an officially registered religious group, authorities in almost all states demand citizens to pay an administrative fee between €30 and €60. It is not possible to leave an officially registered religion (and to end the tax duty on the income) by just declaring the rejection of the belief to this religious group.&lt;ref name="FOTR17de"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/europe-western-europe/germany/ |title=Germany |work=Freedom of Thought Report 2017 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union |date=4 December 2017 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cults, sects, and new religious movements ==

=== State-issued information on NRM ===
The German government provides information about [[cult]]s, [[sect]]s, and [[new religious movement]]s. In 1997, the parliament set up a commission for ''Sogenannte Sekten und Psychogruppen''  (literally "so-called sects and psychic groups") which delivered an extensive report on the situation in Germany regarding NRMs in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agpf.de/Bundestag-Enquete-english.pdf Final report of the  commission of the Bundestag on the investigation into so-called sects and psycho groups]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main point of critics against ''Sekten'' from the governmental side is that they propagate a concept of the ideal human (''Menschenbild [[:de:Menschenbild]]'') which is very different of the concept underlying the ''Grundgesetz'' (Basic Law). For example, some cults may stress the inequality of social groups, races or sexes, and foster a culture where blind obedience and [[fundamentalism]] are welcomed. The ''Grundgesetz'', however, says that all people are equal and envisages people who are open-minded, discerning and tolerant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agpf.de/Bundestag-Enquete-english.pdf  Final report of the  commission of the Bundestag on the investigation into so-called sects and psycho groups], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Germany's Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the German government had violated its constitution in its treatment of the [[Osho movement]], using deprecating expressions about it that were not based on fact.&lt;ref name="Seiwert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seiwert|first=Hubert|title=Freedom and control in the unified Germany: governmental approaches to alternative religions since 1989|journal=Sociology of Religion|issue=Fall 2003|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SOR/is_3_64/ai_109568884/pg_4/|accessdate=2009-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Constitutional Court took eleven years to come to its decision, and the overall duration of proceedings from the original complaint lasted over 18 years; Germany was subsequently fined by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for the excessive duration of the case.&lt;ref name="Seiwert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.123recht.net/article.asp?a=33813&amp;ccheck=1|title=Deutschland wegen langen Verfahrens zu Bhagwan-Bewegung verurteilt|date=2008-11-06|publisher=123recht.net|accessdate=2009-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echrblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/negative-labelling-of-osho-movement.html|title=Negative Labelling of Osho Movement |last=Buyse|first=Antoine|work=ECHR blog|publisher=Netherlands Institute of Human Rights (SIM), Utrecht University|accessdate=2009-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECHR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=842916&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=Press release issued by the Registrar: Chamber judgments concerning  Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Russia, Switzerland, "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" and Ukraine|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the limits set by the Federal Constitutional Court on the permitted scope of government actions in 2002, the European Court of Human Rights found that Germany was not in violation of Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion), Article 10 (freedom of expression) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but found that it had violated Article 6 § 1 (right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time).&lt;ref name="ECHR" /&gt;

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
Since the 1990s, German courts have repeatedly denied the request of the Jehovah's Witnesses to become a corporate body under public law for various reasons, one of them being that the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] would discourage their members from taking part in state elections, and would not respect the ''Grundgesetz''.

In March 2005, Jehovah's Witnesses were granted the status of a ''body of public law'' for the state of Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionnewsblog.com/10682 Jehovah's Witnesses Granted Legal Status in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the alleged lack of fidelity towards the state had not been convincingly proven. The decision on the group's status in Berlin was upheld by the Federal Administrative Court in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102006286 ''Awake!'', August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, corresponding decisions were made in 12 other states.&lt;ref name="rp-online.de"&gt;[http://www.rp-online.de/panorama/deutschland/Zeugen-Jehovas-klagen-gegen-Rheinland-Pfalz_aid_971549.html Jehovah's Witnesses file complaint against Rhineland-Palatinate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ad-hoc-news.de/zeugen-jehovas-nun-auch-in-bayern-koerperschaft-des--/de/Regional/Bayern/20226009 Jehovah's Witnesses now corporate body under public law in Bavaria]&lt;/ref&gt; In the states of Baden-Württemberg,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lto.de/de/html/nachrichten/2398/baden-wuerttemberg-verweigert-koerperschaftsstatus-die-zeugen-jehovas-zwischen-bibeltreue-und-rechtstreue/ Baden-Württemberg refuses to grant status of corporate body under public law]&lt;/ref&gt; and Bremen,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weser-kurier.de/Artikel/Bremen/Vermischtes/376426/Keine-Anerkennung-als-Koerperschaft.html No recognition as corporate body under public law]&lt;/ref&gt; the group was denied the status in 2011.

Due to their status of corporate body under public law (in some states), Jehovah's Witnesses in 2010 filed a complaint for broadcasting time at Germany's international broadcaster, [[Deutsche Welle]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article8338648/Zeugen-Jehovas-klagen-auf-eigenen-Sendeplatz.html  Jehovah's Witnesses file complaint for broadcasting time], Welt Online, 06.07.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the issue of blood transfusions, the Federal Constitutional Court has held that transfusing blood to an unconscious [[Jehovah's Witness]] violated the person's will, but did not constitute a [[battery (crime)|battery]].&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court: [http://www.uni-koeln.de/jur-fak/inststaa/gesundheitsrecht.net/urteile/sterbebegleitung/bverfgzeugenjehovas.pdf]  BVerfG, 1 BvR 618/93 vom 2.8.2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientology ===
German courts have come to different decisions on employees and members of [[Scientology]] regarding their religious status.&lt;ref name="BundestagRFRW"&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/wissen/analysen/2007/rechtliche_fragen_zu_religions-_und_weltanschauungsgemeinschaften.pdf bundestag.de: Legal questions concerning religious and worldview communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305161053/http://www.bundestag.de/wissen/analysen/2007/rechtliche_fragen_zu_religions-_und_weltanschauungsgemeinschaften.pdf |date=2009-03-05 }}, prepared by the Scientific Services staff of the German Parliament {{Link language|de}}&lt;!--German--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The German government considers Scientology "an organization pursuing commercial interests".&lt;ref name="BundestagRFRW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German Embassy, Washington D.

([[eingetragener Verein]], or registered association). Germany has been criticized over its treatment of Scientologists in United States human rights and religious freedom reports, and the U.S. government has repeatedly expressed its concern over the matter.&lt;ref name=Bonfante&gt;Bonfante, Jordan; van Voorst, Bruce (1997-02-10).

===Illegality of religious TV advertisements===
In 2002, there was a legal controversy regarding the  "[[Power for Living]]" campaign by the [[Christian]] Arthur S. DeMoss Foundation featuring celebrities [[Cliff Richard]] and [[Bernhard Langer]]. The TV advertisings for their book were banned because they were considered as "advertising a worldview or religion", which is forbidden by § 7 section 8 of the state treaty on broadcasting (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag) and European laws on media. For its posters, newspaper adverts and leaflets, however, there was no such problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aref.de/news/medien/2002/kraft-zum-leben.htm Religious TV advertisements are illegal in Germany – "Power for Living" ads banned by the state media authorities]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Display of neo-pagan symbols===
There have been cases of groups in Germany which practice [[Germanic neopaganism]] facing legal sanctions because of their display of symbols, such as [[runes]] or the [[Celtic cross]], which prosecutors have deemed illegal under laws against [[neo-Nazi]] propaganda. Using "unconstitutional symbols", namely the [[swastika]], is an offense punishable by up to three years in jail or a fine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,570353,00.html Swastika Funeral Alienates NPD from Militant Neo-Nazis]&lt;/ref&gt; according to § 86a of the [[German Criminal Code]].

'''Halāhala''' ([[Sanskrit]] हलाहल) or '''kālakūṭa''' ([[Sanskrit]] कालकूटं, literally: 'black mass' or 'time puzzle' &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=kalakuta+poison&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xarXHnRrhj&amp;sig=PRLbnSX0Y0977TnvLXHlI2Sn81Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Wz0xTuOwJ5DKiAKbuvGaBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kalakuta%20poison&amp;f=false The Presence of Siva By Stella Kramrisch]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the name of a poison (as per [[Hindu mythology]]) created from the sea when [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s (Deities) and [[Asura]]s (Demons) churned it (see [[Samudra manthan]]) in order to obtain [[Amrita]], the nectar of immortality.

Fourteen different ''rathnas'' ([[Gemstone|gems]]) were recovered in this exercise, mostly retained by the Deities after the Demons tried to cheat them. But before [[Amrita]] could be formed, Halāhala was produced, which started injuring both sides. As no one could bear the lethal fumes emitted by the poison, both Devas and Asuras began to collapse due to [[asphyxiation]]. They ran for help to [[Brahma]], who directed them to Vishnu, who refused and advised them that only [[Shiva]] could help them. So both parties went to [[Mount Kailash]] and prayed to Lord [[Shiva]] for help. Shiva chose to consume the poison and thus drank it. His wife, the goddess [[Parvati]], was alarmed, as she gripped her husband's neck with both hands in order to stop the poison, thus earning him the name '''Viṣakaṇṭha''' (the one who held poison in his throat). He was later saved by the [[mahavidya]] Tara, a form of Parvati. The poison turned his throat blue; hence, he is also known as '''Nīlakaṇṭha'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=TQ Team C0118142 |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0118142/orient/shiva.php |title=The Orient: Shiva's Blue Throat |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124063843/http://library.thinkquest.org/C0118142/orient/shiva.php |archivedate=2013-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the one with a blue throat).

==Cham Hindus==
{{Main article|Cham people}}
The majority of Cham in [[Vietnam]] (also known as the Eastern Cham) are Hindu while their Cambodian counterparts are largely Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Tajikistan-to-Zimbabwe/Cham.html|title=Cham - Introduction, Location, Language, Folklore, Religion, Major holidays, Rites of passage|website=www.everyculture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hindu Chams are called Balamon Cham or Balamon Hindu&lt;ref&gt;https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140616-south-china-sea-vietnam-china-cambodia-champa/&lt;/ref&gt;.They practice a form of Shaivita Brahmanism &lt;ref&gt;https://www.everyculture.com/East-Southeast-Asia/Cham-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;.Most of the Cham Hindus belong to the [[Kshatriya#Nagavanshi|Nagavamshi Kshatriya]] [[caste]],&lt;ref&gt;India's interaction with Southeast Asia, Volume 1, Part 3 By Govind Chandra Pande, Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy, and Culture, Centre for Studies in Civilizations (Delhi, India) p.231,252&lt;/ref&gt; but a considerable minority are [[Brahmins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35433.htm |title=Vietnam |work=International Religious Freedom Report 2004 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]: [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |date=2002-10-22 |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Ninh Thuận Province, where most of the Cham in Vietnam reside, Cham Balamon (Hindu Cham) numbers 32,000; out of the 22 villages in Ninh Thuận, 15 are Hindu.&lt;ref name="hardy105"&gt;''Champa and the archaeology of Mỹ Sơn (Vietnam)'' by Andrew Hardy, Mauro Cucarzi, Patrizia Zolese p.105&lt;/ref&gt;Only four temples are still worshiped in nowadays: Po Inu Nugar, Po Rome, Po Klaung Girai and Po Dam. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=5491&lt;/ref&gt;

The main festival of Cham Hindus is the Kate festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldhindunews.com/2018/10/13/62305/exhibition-on-vietnam-hindu-cham-brahman-community-opens/&lt;/ref&gt;or Mbang Kate.It is celebrated for 3 days at the beginning of October.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vietnamonline.com/destination/ninh-thuan/kate-festival.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the census of 2009, there are a total of 56,427 Cham Hindus in Vietnam. Out of this number, 40,695 are in Ninh Thuận, and another 15,094 are in Bình Thuận. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gso.gov.vn/Modules/Doc_Download.aspx?DocID=12724&lt;/ref&gt;In [[Ninh Thuan]] and [[Binh Thuan]] provinces they form 22% and 4.8% of the population respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gso.gov.vn/Modules/Doc_Download.aspx?DocID=12724&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tamil Hindus== 
There are 4,000 Indian(Tamil) Hindus in [[Ho Chi Minh City]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduhumanrights.info/hindus-of-vietnam/&lt;/ref&gt;.The [[Mariamman Temple, Ho Chi Minh City]] is their focal point.It is also considered sacred by many native Vietnamese and Chinese.It is also believed to have miraculous powers and is dedicated to the Hindu goddess, [[Mariamman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://mediaindia.eu/news-india-outbound/ho-chi-minh-city-tourism-holds-roadshow-in-new-delhi/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hornedjitef''' was an  [[Ancient Egypt]]ian  priest in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|Temple of Amun]] at [[Karnak]] during the reign of [[Ptolemy III]] (246-222 BC).  He is known from his elaborate coffins, mummy mask and mummy, dating from the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Early Ptolemaic Period]] (around 220 BC) and excavated from Asasif, Thebes, Egypt, which are all held in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/o/outer_coffin_of_the_priest_h-1.aspx |title=Outer coffin of the priest Hornedjitef |publisher=British Museum |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706100551/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/o/outer_coffin_of_the_priest_h-1.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/i/inner_coffin_of_the_priest_h-1.aspx |title=Mummy of Hornedjitef › The British Museum |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123011525/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/i/inner_coffin_of_the_priest_h-1.aspx |archivedate=2010-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/m/mummy_mask_of_hornedjitef.aspx |title=Mummy mask of Hornedjitef |publisher=British Museum |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310191642/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/m/mummy_mask_of_hornedjitef.aspx |archivedate=2010-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These related objects were chosen as the first of the hundred objects selected by British Museum Director [[Neil MacGregor]] in the 2010 [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Taylor, Curator, British Museum |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/sogITE3FSKStlk12qd2W3w |title=A History of the World - Object: Mummy of Hornedjitef |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Imagine'''" is a song co-written and performed by English musician [[John Lennon]]. The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrics encourage the listener to imagine a world at peace without the barriers of borders or the divisions of religion and nationality and to consider the possibility that the whole of humanity would live unattached to material possessions. Shortly before his death, Lennon said that much of the song's "lyric and content" came from his wife [[Yoko Ono]], and in 2017, she received a co-writing credit.&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{cite news|first= Christopher D. |last= Shea |title= Yoko Ono: 'Imagine' |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 10 October 2018 |accessdate= 7 November 2018 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/oct/10/yoko-ono-john-lennon-imagine-warzone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and [[Imagine (John Lennon album)|album of the same name]] with [[Phil Spector]]. Recording began at Lennon's home studio at [[Tittenhurst Park]], England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the [[Record Plant]], in New York City, during July. One month after the September release of the LP, Lennon released "Imagine" as a single in the United States; the song peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the LP reached number one on the UK chart in November, later becoming the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career. Although not originally released as a single in the United Kingdom, it was released in 1975 to promote a compilation LP and it reached number six on the chart that year. The song has since sold more than 1.6 million copies in the UK; it reached number one following [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon's murder]] in December 1980. In 1985, the [[Central Park Conservancy]] memorialised a portion of the park in honour of Lennon, called [[Strawberry Fields (memorial)|Strawberry Fields]], with a mosaic that reads "Imagine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Strawberry Fields |publisher= [[Central Park Conservancy]] |accessdate= 9 February 2016 |url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/strawberry-fields.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] named "Imagine" one of the 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century. The song ranked number 30 on the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s list of the 365 [[Songs of the Century]] bearing the most historical significance. It earned a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. A UK survey conducted by the ''[[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums|Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book]]'' named it the second best single of all time, while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it number three in their list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]". Since 2005, event organisers have played it just before the New Year's [[Times Square Ball]] drops in New York City. Dozens of artists have [[cover version|performed or recorded]] versions of "Imagine", including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Elton John]] and [[Diana Ross]]. [[Emeli Sandé]] recorded a cover for the [[BBC]] to use during the end credits montage at the close of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] coverage in August 2012. "Imagine" subsequently re-entered the UK Top 40, reaching number 18.

==Composition and writing==
Several poems from [[Yoko Ono]]'s 1964 book ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit]]'' inspired Lennon to write the lyrics for "Imagine"{{sfn|Sheff|1981|pp=212–13}}—in particular, one which [[Capitol Records]] reproduced on the back cover of the original ''[[Imagine (John Lennon album)|Imagine]]'' LP titled "Cloud Piece", reads: "Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Bruce |last= Spizer |authorlink= Bruce Spizer |title= The Beatles Solo on Apple Records |year= 2005 |publisher= 498 Productions, LLC |page= 54 |isbn= 978-0-9662649-5-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon later said the composition "should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it—the lyric and the concept—came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of ''Grapefruit''."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with [[David Sheff]] for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Lennon told Sheff that [[Dick Gregory]] had given Ono and him a [[Christian prayer]] book, which inspired him the concept behind "Imagine".

{{quote|The concept of positive prayer ... If you can ''imagine'' a world at peace, with no denominations of religion—not without religion but without this my God-is-bigger-than-your-God thing—then it can be true ... the World Church called me once and asked, "Can we use the lyrics to 'Imagine' and just change it to 'Imagine ''one'' religion'?" That showed [me] they didn't understand it at all. It would defeat the whole purpose of the song, the whole idea.{{sfn|Sheff|1981|pp=212–13}}}}

{{listen|filename=Imagine.ogg|title="Imagine"|description=An excerpt from the second chorus}}
With the combined influence of "Cloud Piece" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as "a humanistic [[paean]] for the people".{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} Blaney wrote, "Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[David Fricke]] commented: "[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class."{{sfn|Fricke|2012|p=59}}

Lennon stated: "'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} He told ''[[NME]]'': "There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} Ono described the lyrical statement of "Imagine" as "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people."{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} ''Rolling Stone'' described its lyrics as "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself".{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}}{{refn|group=nb|The lyrical content of "Imagine" relates to Lennon's concept of [[Nutopia]]: The Country of Peace, which he invented in 1973. Lennon included a symbolically mute anthem to this country on his album ''[[Mind Games (John Lennon album)|Mind Games]]'' released later that year.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=82}}}} Some observers have described the song has having a distinctly anti-religious viewpoint, to the point that some have embraced it as an "atheist anthem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Hermione |last= Eyre |title= Atheists should be louder and prouder |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= 1 November 2006 |accessdate= 23 March 2014 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/hermione-eyre-atheists-should-be-louder-and-prouder-422404.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon composed "Imagine" one morning in early 1971, on a [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] piano, in a bedroom at his [[Tittenhurst Park]] estate in [[Ascot, Berkshire]], England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session.{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} Described as a [[Ballad|piano ballad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Scott |last= Floman |title= John Lennon – Overview |accessdate= 22 July 2014 |url= http://sfloman.com/johnlennon.html#2 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023950/http://sfloman.com/johnlennon.html#2 |archivedate= 29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Gary |last= Trust |title= A History Of Hit Piano Ballads On The Hot 100 |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 10 April 2013 |accessdate= 22 July 2014 |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1556769/a-history-of-hit-piano-ballads-on-the-hot-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed in the [[soft rock]] genre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Jef |last= Otte |title= Imagine that: John Lennon fans turn into zealots over Cee Lo's change in lyrics |newspaper= [[Westword]] |date= 11 January 2012 |accessdate= 22 July 2014 |url= http://www.westword.com/2012-01-12/music/john-lennon-fans-mad-at-cee-lo/full/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the song is in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[C major]].{{sfn|Lennon|1983|pp=5–9}} Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; then G&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, before resolving back to C.{{sfn|Lennon|1983|pp=5–9}} The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and E before ending on E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar [[Conclusion (music)|outro]] begins with F, then G, before resolving on C. With a duration of 3 minutes and 3 seconds and a [[time signature]] of 4/4, the song's tempo falls around 75 [[beats per minute]].&lt;ref&gt;For the musical notation to "Imagine" see: {{harvnb|Lennon|1983|pp=5–9}}; for the piano on which Lennon composed "Imagine" see: {{cite news|title= George Michael buys Lennon's piano |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date= 18 October 2000 |accessdate= 2 September 2012 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/974485.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording and commercial reception==

Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and album with [[Phil Spector]], who commented on the track: "We knew what we were going to do ... It was going to be John making a political statement, but a very commercial one as well ... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem."&lt;ref&gt;For Spector co-producing with Lennon and Ono see: {{harvnb|Du Noyer|1971|pp=1–14}}; for "I always thought that song was like the national anthem" see: {{harvnb|Levy|2005|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that—[Ono] and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well' ... I'll get the initial idea and ... we'll just find a sound from [there]."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|pp=50–51}}

Recording took place on 27 May 1971 at [[Ascot Sound Studios]], Lennon's newly built home studio at Tittenhurst Park, with string overdubs taking place on 4 July 1971 at the [[Record Plant]], in New York City.{{sfn|Madinger|Raile|2015|pp=239, 247}} Relaxed and patient, the sessions began during the late morning, running to just before dinner in the early evening. Lennon taught the musicians the chord progression and a working arrangement for "Imagine", rehearsing the song until he deemed the musicians ready to record.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} In his attempt to recreate Lennon's desired sound, Spector had some early tapings feature Lennon and [[Nicky Hopkins]] playing in different octaves on one piano. He also initially attempted to record the piano part with Lennon playing the white [[Grand piano|baby grand]] in the couple's all-white room. However, after having deemed the room's acoustics unsuitable, Spector abandoned the idea in favour of the superior environment of Lennon's home studio.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} They completed the session in minutes, recording three takes and choosing the second one for release.{{sfn|Fricke|2012|p=58}} The finished recording featured Lennon on piano and vocal, [[Klaus Voormann]] on bass guitar, [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] on drums and the Flux Fiddlers on strings.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=53}}

Issued by [[Apple Records]] in the United States in October 1971, "Imagine" became the best-selling single of Lennon's solo career.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=292}} It peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=57}} and reached number one in Canada on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' national singles chart, remaining there for two weeks.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= RPM 100  Singles |volume= 16 |issue= 16 |magazine= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |date= 4 December 1971 |accessdate= 21 May 2016 |url= http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.7566&amp;URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.7566.gif&amp;Ecopy=nlc008388.7566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: "Imagine there's no heaven".{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=382}} When asked about the song during one of his final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with [[the Beatles]].{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted ...

In 1972, Lennon and Ono released an 81-minute [[Imagine (1972 film)|film]] to accompany the ''Imagine'' album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their [[Berkshire]] property at Tittenhurst Park as well as in New York City.{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=378}} A full-length documentary rock video, the film's first scene features a shot of Lennon and Ono walking through a thick fog, arriving at their house as the song "Imagine" begins. Above the front door to their house is a sign that reads: "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the room and Ono opening shutters see: {{cite book|first= Jacqueline |last= Edmondson |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood]] |title= John Lennon: A Biography |isbn= 978-0-313-37938-3 |page= 140}}; for the title of Ono's then New York art show see: {{harvnb|Harry|2000|pp=907–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Philip |last= Norman |authorlink= Philip Norman (author) |title= John Lennon: The Life |year= 2008 |publisher= ECCO ([[HarperCollins|Harper Collins]]) |page= 763 |isbn= 978-0-06-075401-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several celebrities appeared in the film, including [[Andy Warhol]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Jack Palance]], [[Dick Cavett]] and [[George Harrison]]. Derided by critics as "the most expensive home movie of all time", it premiered to an American audience in 1972.{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=378}} In 1986, [[Zbigniew Rybczyński]] made a [[music video]] for the song, and in 1987, it won both the "[[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity|Silver Lion]]" award for Best Clip at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and the Festival Award at the [[Festival do Rio|Rio International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Artist/VIP gallery: Zbigniew Rybczynski |publisher= Polish American Film Society |accessdate= 25 September 2012 |url= http://www.polishfilmla.org/wocms.php?siteID=13&amp;ID=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released as a single in the United Kingdom in 1975 in conjunction with the album ''[[Shaved Fish]]'', "Imagine" peaked at number six on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Following [[Death of John Lennon|Lennon's murder]] in 1980, the single re-entered the UK chart, reaching number one, where it remained for four weeks in January 1981.

==Recognition and criticism==

''Rolling Stone'' ranked "Imagine" number three on its list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]", describing it as "an enduring hymn of solace and promise that has carried us through extreme grief, from the shock of Lennon's own death in 1980 to the unspeakable horror of [[September 11 attacks|September 11th]]. It is now impossible to imagine a world without 'Imagine', and we need it more than he ever dreamed."{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} Despite that sentiment, Clear Channel Communications (now known today as [[iHeartMedia]]) included the song on its [[2001 Clear Channel memorandum|post-9/11 "do not play" list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Tom |last= Morello |title= The New Blacklist: The nation's largest radio network's list of 'questionable' songs |publisher= [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]] |date= 1 November 2001 |accessdate= 23 March 2014 |url= http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/the-new-blacklist/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|In 1991, the BBC restricted "Imagine" from airplay during the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Ian |last= Peddie |title= The Resisting Muse: Popular Music And Social Protest |year= 2006 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing, Ltd |isbn= 0-7546-5114-2 |page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Urish and Bielen criticised the song's instrumental music as overly sentimental and melodramatic, comparing it to the music of the pre-rock era and describing the vocal melody as understated.{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=27}} According to Blaney, Lennon's lyrics describe hypothetical possibilities that offer no practical solutions; lyrics that are at times nebulous and contradictory, asking the listener to abandon political systems while encouraging one similar to [[communism]].{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} Author Chris Ingham indicated the hypocrisy in Lennon, the millionaire rock star living in a mansion, encouraging listeners to imagine living their lives without possessions.{{sfn|Ingham|2009|p=99}} Others argue that Lennon intended the song's lyrics to inspire listeners to imagine if the world ''could'' live without possessions, not as an explicit call to give them up.{{sfn|Ingham|2009|p=99}} Blaney commented: "Lennon knew he had nothing concrete to offer, so instead he offers a dream, a concept to be built upon."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}}

Blaney considered the song to be "riddled with contradictions. Its hymn-like setting sits uncomfortably alongside its author's plea for us to envision a world without religion."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} Urish and Bielen described Lennon's "dream world" without a heaven or hell as a call to "make the best world we can here and now, since this is all this is or will be".{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=27}} In their opinion, "because we are asked merely to imagine—to play a 'what if' game, Lennon can escape the harshest criticisms".{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=27}} Former Beatle [[Ringo Starr]] defended the song's lyrics during a 1981 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], stating: "[Lennon] said 'imagine', that's all.

In addition to its general popularity, she noted its musical simplicity, its key of C major, "the plainest and least complicated key, with no [[sharp (music)|sharps]] or [[flat (music)|flats]]" aside from one passage with "a plaintive [[major seventh chord]] that allows a tiny bit of [[E minor]] into the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]". That piano part, "gentle as a rocking chair", underpins lyrics that, Waldman says, "belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth". This understanding is also compounded by the historical context of Lennon's own violent death, "remind[ing] us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people". Ultimately, the song "captures the fragility of our hope after a violent or destructive event ... [bu]t also reveals its tenacity".&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;

In June 2017, the [[National Music Publishers Association]] awarded "Imagine" a Centennial Song Award and recognized Lennon's desire to add Yoko Ono as a co-author of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Jem |last= Aswad |title= Yoko Ono to Receive Songwriting Credit on John Lennon's 'Imagine' |magazine= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date= 14 June 2017 |accessdate= 15 June 2017 |url= https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/yoko-ono-to-receive-songwriting-credit-on-john-lennon-imagine-1202466645/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bahá'í sidebar}}
The '''Counsellors''' are part of the [[Bahá'í administration|administrative order]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and are part of a greater administrative branch called the '''Institution of the Counsellors''', established by the [[Universal House of Justice]] in 1968.

The Counsellors are appointed by the Universal House of Justice, and collectively in each continent are referred to as a Continental Board of Counsellors. Nine of them, referred to as International Counsellors, are specifically assigned to the [[International Teaching Centre]], which coordinates the international efforts of all the Counsellors. The Counsellors appoint [[Bahá'í administration#Auxiliary Boards|Auxiliaries]] collectively referred to as Auxiliary Boards in smaller regional areas, who in turn appoint their own assistants to work in localities.

The primary responsibilities of the Institution of the Counsellors are the protection and propagation of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in all parts of the world. Each Auxiliary Board Member is assigned to either protection or propagation.

There are currently 81 Counsellors, and they are appointed for a renewable five-year term which starts on the [[Bahá'í Holy Days|Bahá'í holy day]] called the [[Day of the Covenant (Bahá'í)|Day of the Covenant]].

==History==
With the eventual passing of the individual [[Hands of the Cause]] appointed by [[Shoghi Effendi]] and without a [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] to appoint additional Hands, the Universal House of Justice saw the need for developing an institution for the purpose of performing the Hands’ function of protection and propagation of the Faith. In 1968 the Continental Board of Counselors was formed. Their duties were: 
* to direct the [[Bahá'í administration#Auxiliary Boards|Auxiliary Boards]],
* to consult and collaborate with [[Spiritual Assembly#National Spiritual Assemblies¦National Spiritual Assemblies]],
* to keep the Hands of the Cause and the Universal House of Justice informed concerning the conditions of the Cause in their areas. 

The remaining Hands residing in the Holy Land were instructed to act as liaison between the Universal House of Justice and the newly formed Continental Boards of Counselors.(''Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1968-1973'', [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_messages_1968_1973#5 pp. 5-8])

In 1973, the International Teaching Centre was formed, which leads the work and actitivies of the Continental Counsellors.

{{Islam by country}}

'''Islam in Denmark''' being the country's largest minority religion plays a role in shaping its social and religious landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Report on International Religious Freedom - Denmark|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USDOS,,DNK,,4cf2d0a2c,0.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416010245/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USDOS,,DNK,,4cf2d0a2c,0.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 April 2013|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=13 November 2012|date=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 2018 estimate, little more than 300.000 people or 5.3% of the population in [[Denmark]] is [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name=jac2018/&gt; The figure has been increasing for the last several decades.

The majority of Muslims in Denmark are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], with a sizeable [[Shia]] minority.&lt;ref&gt;http://pakistan.um.dk/en/info-about-denmark/muslims-in-denmark/&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Islamic denominations]] represented in [[Denmark]] include [[Ahmadiyya]]. In the 1970s Muslims arrived from Turkey, Pakistan, Morocco and the former Yugoslavia to work. In the 1980s and 90s the majority of Muslim arrivals were refugees and asylum seekers from Iran, Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia.&lt;ref name=bbcountryguide /&gt; In addition, some ethnic [[Danes]] have [[converted to Islam]]; an estimated 2,800 Danes have converted and about seventy Danes convert every year.&lt;ref name=euro-islam&gt;{{cite web|title=An increasing number of Danes are converting to Islam|website=euro-islam.info|publisher=Euro-Islam: News and Analysis on Islam in Europe and North America|accessdate=31 August 2015|date=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

Danish historian Jørgen Bæk Simonsen documents that encounters between Denmark and the Muslim world date back to [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]] when the Danish military participated in the [[Crusades]] to take control of [[Jerusalem]] from [[Fatimid Caliphate|Muslim rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsson|2009|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederick V of Denmark]] also travelled to [[South Arabia]] to collect information, plants, and artifacts. Among his co-voyagers was [[Carsten Niebuhr]] who observed and noted the customs of the region. One of the first Danish converts to Islam was [[Knud Holmboe]], a journalist and writer of ''[[Desert Encounter]]'', in which he detailed his first-hand account of the [[Pacification of Libya|Libyan Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsson|2009|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1880 Danish census recorded 8 "Mohammadans" in the country. Censuses continued to be carried out until 1970.&lt;ref name="Cesari 2014 392"&gt;{{harvnb|Cesari|2014|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale immigration from Muslim countries began in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Cesari 2014 394"&gt;{{harvnb|Cesari|2014|p=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first purpose-built mosques belonged to Ahmadi Muslims and was constructed in 1967.&lt;ref name="Cesari 2014 392"/&gt; In 1973, the Danish government stopped free migration to the country. Rules were laxed in 1974 so that people with family in Denmark, people marrying someone in Denmark, or people seeking asylum could come to the country.&lt;ref name="Cesari 2014 394"/&gt;

[[Freedom of religion]] is guaranteed by the [[Constitution of Denmark]], but the [[Church of Denmark]] enjoys certain privileges such as state subsidies that other religious groups in the country do not. As of 2013, 23 different Muslim communities are recognized as "acknowledged religious communities," giving them certain tax benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2014|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The asylum seekers comprise about 40% of the Danish Muslim population.&lt;ref name="Islam_Denmark"/&gt;

In 2014 [[halal]] [[Ritual slaughter|slaughter]] without electrical stunning was banned in Denmark citing [[animal welfare]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-bans-halal-and-kosher-slaughter-as-minister-says-animal-rights-come-before-religion-9135580.html|title=Denmark bans kosher and halal slaughter as minister says ‘animal rights come before religion’|date=2014-02-18|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, two imams, one of which is the head of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia)|Hizb ut-Tahrir in Australia]] were added to the Danish list of hate preachers which meant they could not enter Denmark, bringing the total to ten. The list also comprised [[Salman al-Ouda]] and [[Bilal Philips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE9809445/stoejberg-har-foejet-to-personer-til-listen-over-hadpraedikanter/|title=Støjberg har føjet to personer til listen over »hadprædikanter«|access-date=2017-08-31|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 2017, the Danish parliament (Danish: [[Folketinget]]) agreed to adopt a law prohibiting people to wear "attire and clothing masking the face in such a way that it impairs recognizability". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-ban-full-face-covering-burqa-jakob-ellemann-jensen-a7986561.html|title=Denmark is about to ban the burqa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/864315/denmark-burka-ban-scandinavian-county-set-to-ban-full-face-veils-muslim-women|title=Denmark burka ban: Scandinavian country set to become latest to ban full-face veils|first=David|last=Pilditch|date=9 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full ban on both niqabs and burqas was announced on 31 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44319921|title=Denmark passes ban on niqabs and burkas|date=31 May 2018|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban came into force on 1 August 2018 and carries a fine of 1000 [[Danish krone|DKK]], about 134 euro, by repeat offending the fine may reach 10 000 DKK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/fra-i-dag-kan-ayesha-faa-en-boede-gaa-paa-gaden-jeg-tager-aldrig-min-niqab-af|title=Fra i dag kan Ayesha få en bøde for at gå på gaden: 'Jeg tager aldrig min niqab af'|work=DR|access-date=2018-08-03|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then targets all garments that covers the face, such as fake beards or balaclavas.&lt;ref name="fr24"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20180531-denmark-islam-veil-niqab-burqa-europe-women-ban-full-face-public|title=Joining other European countries, Denmark bans full-face veil in public  - France 24|date=2018-05-31|work=France 24|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the ban claim that the ban facilitates integration of Muslims into Danish society while [[Amnesty International]] claimed the ban violated women's rights.&lt;ref name="fr24" /&gt; A protest numbering 300-400 people was held in the [[Nørrebro]] district of Copenhagen organised by [[Socialist Youth Front]], ''Kvinder i Dialog'' and ''Party Rebels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/hestehoveder-og-niqaber-demonstranter-daekker-ansigtet-til-i-protest-mod-forbud|title=Hestehoveder og niqaber: Demonstranter dækker ansigtet til i protest mod forbud|work=DR|access-date=2018-08-03|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to polls among Muslims in Denmark conducted in 2006 and 2018, religiosity shows an escalation over time, whereas 37% prayed five times a day in 2006, by 2018 this number had increased to 50%. This was contrary to expectation where Muslims had been expected to conform to mainstream Danish society where not many people are not particularly devoted to religion. The possible cause of the trend, according to sociologist Brian Arly Jacobsen at [[University of Copenhagen|Copenhagen University]] was that in the construction of 20-30 new mosques in the intervening 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE8103969/Danske-muslimer-g%C3%A5r-mere-op-i-b%C3%B8n-t%C3%B8rkl%C3%A6der-og-Koranen/|title=Danske muslimer går mere op i bøn, tørklæder og Koranen|access-date=2018-09-26|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

The Danish government does not collect data on citizens' religion so the exact number of Muslims in Denmark is not known with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2015|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish researcher Brian Jacobsen, who makes regular estimations based on the national origin of immigrants and their descendants, estimates that by October 2017 Muslims made up 306.000 persons or 5.3% of the Danish population.&lt;ref name=jac2018&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.religion.dk/religionsanalysen/hvor-mange-indvandrer-lever-i-danmark|title=Hvor mange muslimer bor der i Danmark?|work=religion.dk|access-date=2018-02-08|language=da-DK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 70% of Muslims in Denmark are Danish citizens,&lt;ref name=jac2018/&gt; and the majority are first- or second-generation immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cesari|2014|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, roughly 2,000 to 5,000 Danish Muslims were converts to the religion.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen 2014 190"&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2014|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims are unevenly distributed around Denmark with the majority concentrated in major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2014|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 47.4% of Danish Muslims live in Greater [[Copenhagen]], 9.4% in [[Aarhus]], and 5.5% in [[Odense]].&lt;ref name="Jacobsen 2015 195"&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2015|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnicity===
In 2014, the largest ethnic group of Muslims in Denmark were Turks (22.2% of all Danish Muslims), followed by Iraqis (10.2%), Lebanese (9.5%), Pakistanis (8.7%), Somalis (7.3%), and Afghanis (6.3%).&lt;ref name="Jacobsen 2014 190"/&gt;

==Branches==
{{see also|Islamic schools and branches|Ahmadiyya in Denmark}}
According to a 2008 survey of immigrants to Denmark from Muslim-majority countries by ''IntegrationsStatus'', 45% were Sunni, 11% were Shia, and 23% belonged to another branch of Islam (such as Ahmadi, etc.). The other 21% belonged to another religion or had no religion.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen 2014 190"/&gt;

==Identity==
A 2017 [[Fundamental Rights Agency]] report found that on a scale from 1 (not at all attached) to 5 (very strongly attached), the average Danish Muslim felt a 3.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey: Muslims – Selected findings|url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2017/eumidis-ii-muslims-selected-findings|website=[[Fundamental Rights Agency]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|page=20|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religiosity==
A 2002/2003 study of Danish youth in upper secondary school found that 100% of Muslims believed in God and 90% believed in heaven, hell, angels and devils. Only 52% of non-Muslim Danes in the survey said they believed in God while 15-25% said they believed in heaven, hell, angels and devils. Roughly half of the Muslims in the survey said they prayed often, while a third claimed to visit a mosque once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cesari|2014|pp=402–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 survey, 40% of Muslim immigrants and their descendants participated in religious ceremonies/services compared to 60% of Roman Catholic immigrants/ descendants did the same. In a 2008 survey of immigrants from Turkey, Pakistan, ex-Yugoslavia, Iran, Iraq, and Somalia, 37% considered themselves very little/little religious, 33% considered themselves moderately religious, 24% considered themselves very religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cesari|2014|p=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 survey found that 37% of Danish Muslims were [[Cultural Muslim|non-practicing Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cesari|2014|p=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 survey, 82% of Danish Muslim parents answered that religion was an important issue in the ubringing of children compared to 67% of Danish non-Muslims who answered the same.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen 2014 199"&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2014|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Roughly 3,000 Shia Muslims march annually in Nørrebro during [[Ashura]].&lt;ref name="Cesari 2014 408"&gt;{{harvnb|Cesari|2014|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, Muslim organizations such as the Danish Muslim Union and Minhaj-ul-Qur'an have held a "Peace March" to celebrate [[Mawlid]] with hundreds in attendance.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen 2014 199"/&gt;

In September 2017, the Danish bureau Unique Models became the first and only fashion agency in the country to include a Muslim woman who wears a hijab when they hired the 21-year-old Amina Adan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danish fashion agency hires first hijab-wearing model|url=https://www.thelocal.dk/20170921/danish-fashion-agency-hires-first-hijab-wearing-model|website=[[The Local]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interfaith relations===
Several Sunni Muslim youth organizations work to make contact with Danish society as a whole by inviting locals to mosques and representing Islam in a positive light.&lt;ref name="Cesari 2014 407"&gt;{{harvnb|Cesari|2014|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the Islamic-Christian Study Centre was set up by Muslims and Christians. It has an equal number of Muslims and Christians as board members and strives to build positive relations between citizens of both religions. The members focus on counselling, lectures, study groups, excursions, and publications. A report titled ''Conversation Promotes Understanding'' published by the Church of Denmark in 2000 put an emphasis on increasing dialogue with Muslims. Margrethe Vestager, the then Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs, supported the conclusion of the report. The Church of Denmark has held friendship dinners for Muslims during Ramadan and Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2014|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Annette H. Ihle’s 2007 study of Muslim School (also called Free Schools) have a higher rate of students continuing into high school than national public schools (41% to 26%).&lt;ref name="Cesari 2014 408"/&gt; A more recent 2016 analysis by the politically independent think-tank Kraka concluded that students with a non-western background attending Muslim private schools achieved significantly better grades in their 9th grade exit examinations than their counterparts at Danish public schools. The difference between the students' final examination marks was 1.4 grade points–an average 4.6 at the public schools and 6.0 at the Muslim private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=W|first1=Ray|title=Study: Muslim private schools in Denmark producing better students than public schools|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/study-muslim-private-schools-in-denmark-producing-better-students-than-public-schools.html|website=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious issues==

In 1967 the Nusrat Jahan Mosque&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dis-danmark.dk/kirkeimg/view_kirke.asp?KirkeID=1606|title= Kirker i Danmark - en billeddatabase|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built in [[Hvidovre]], a [[Copenhagen]] suburb. This [[mosque]] is used by adherents of the [[Ahmadiyya]] faith.

Other mosques exist but are not built for the explicit purpose. It is not forbidden to build mosques or any other religious buildings in Denmark but there are very strict zoning laws. One piece of land has been reserved for a grand mosque at [[Amager]] (near [[Copenhagen]]), but financing is not settled. Danish Muslims have not succeeded in cooperating on the financing of the project and do not agree on whether it should be financed with outside sources, such as Saudi money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanityinaction.org/docs/Goldberg__Krasner,_2001.pdf Making a Mosque, Realizing a Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306123413/http://www.humanityinaction.org/docs/Goldberg__Krasner,_2001.pdf |date=6 March 2009 }}, Helene Hemme Goldberg and Abigail Krasner (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisements by the Danish People's Party, which promote anti-mosque legislation, contend that [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] are sources of funding. These are considered despotic regimes by the DPP.&lt;ref&gt;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_U54NM9QE5VY/Sqdnjlm_0rI/AAAAAAAAH8I/Nf2mPgSs-ZI/s400/Dansk_Folkeparti_an_193964e.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven Danish [[cemeteries]] have separate sections for Muslims. Most of the Danish Muslims are buried in those cemeteries, with about 70 being flown abroad for burial in their countries of origin. A separate Muslim cemetery was opened in [[Brøndby]] near [[Copenhagen]] in September 2006.

In 2009, the U.S. Department of State released a report on religious freedom in Denmark. One finding was that there were a few isolated incidents of discrimination against immigrants, which included desecration of graves:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There were isolated incidents of anti-immigrant sentiment, including graffiti, low-level assaults, denial of service, and employment discrimination on racial grounds. Societal discrimination against religious minorities was difficult to distinguish from discrimination against ethnic minorities. The Government criticized the incidents and investigated several, but it brought few cases to trial specifically on charges of racial discrimination or hate crimes. Reports continued of incidents of desecration of ethnic and religious minority gravesites.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Masjid Al-Faruq mosque ===
In May 2017 an imam of the Masjid Al-Faruq mosque in [[Nørrebro]] held a service where he preached a vision of the [[caliphate]] and the [[Antisemitism|murder of Jews]]. The sermon was uploaded to Youtube and after having been translated, it was reported to police as a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/kirke-tro/praediken-i-dansk-moske-ses-som-opfordring-til-drab-paa-joeder|title=Prædiken i dansk moské ses som opfordring til drab på jøder|work=Kristeligt Dagblad|access-date=2017-05-25|language=da-DK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began in July 2018.

=== Grimhøj mosque ===
In 2014, regional police authorities (Danish: ''Østjyllands Politi'') found that of the 27 individuals who had travelled from the Gellerup area to participate in the war in Syria and Iraq, 22 had been visitors to Grimhøj mosque. The former chairman of the mosque Oussama El-Saadi was killed and previously in a 2014 [[DR (broadcaster)|DR documentary]] about the mosque he expressed sympathies for the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.b.dk/nationalt/moskeen-man-gang-paa-gang-forsoeger-at-lukke|title=Moskeen, man gang på gang forsøger at lukke|date=2016-02-29|work=www.b.dk|access-date=2018-07-14|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 journalists visited the [[Grimhøjmoskeen|Grimhøj mosque]] with a hidden camera and imam Abu Bilal preached that women who were unfaithful to their husbands should be [[Stoning|stoned to death]] or whipped and infidels (who did not take part in Ramadan fasting) should be killed.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.fhs.se/download/18.4b864adf165e41044d153f4f/1539249384748/Mellan%20salafism%20och%20salafistisk%20jihadism%20P%C3%A5verkan%20mot%20och%20utmaningar%20f%C3%B6r%20det%20svenska%20samh%C3%A4llet.pdf|title=Mellan salafism och salafistisk jihadism - Påverkan mot och utmaningar för det svenska samhället|last=Magnus Ranstorp, Filip Ahlin, Peder Hyllengren, Magnus Normark|first=|publisher=[[Swedish Defence University]]|year=|isbn=|location=2018|pages=131|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020144915/https://www.fhs.se/download/18.4b864adf165e41044d153f4f/1539249384748/Mellan%20salafism%20och%20salafistisk%20jihadism%20P%C3%A5verkan%20mot%20och%20utmaningar%20f%C3%B6r%20det%20svenska%20samh%C3%A4llet.pdf|archive-date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

In 2007, a hijab-wearing Muslim woman named [[Asmaa Abdol-Hamid]] attempted to run for [[Folketing]], gaining the candidacy for a [[Copenhagen]] seat for the [[Red–Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]]. She is listed seventh on the party's parliamentary candidate list. Her candidacy caused debate in Denmark over the fact that she intends to serve wearing a [[hijab]]. Although she was not elected, she may still appear in the parliament as a substitute for [[Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen|Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen.]]&lt;ref name="Larsson 2009 48"&gt;{{harvnb|Larsson|2009|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danish People's Party]] MP [[Søren Krarup]] compared Abdol-Hamid’s headscarf to a Nazi swastika, saying they were both symbols of totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsson|2009|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Mikkel Rytter stated that there is a "'litmus-test' of Muslim politicians" regarding whether a practicing Muslim could be trusted to protect human rights and separation of church and state in government.&lt;ref name="Larsson 2009 48"/&gt;

In 2014, three Muslim brothers formed the [[National Party (Denmark)|National Party]] to focus on what they saw as an attack on traditional Danish values of tolerance and openness. The political party focuses on anti-racism and allowing public expression of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2015|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious infrastructure==

A 2006 report estimated that 20% to 25% of Danish Muslims were associated with a mosque association.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen 2014 190"/&gt; Sociologist of religion, Lene Kühle, estimated in 2006 that there were 115 mosques in Denmark. Of these, 11 were Shia,&lt;ref name="Cesari 2014 407"/&gt; and 2 were Ahmadi.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen 2015 195"/&gt;

===Schools===
In Denmark, religious studies is named "Christian studies" and focuses on the Church of Denmark. Parents have the right to withdraw their students from these religious courses but Muslim parents rarely do. The first Muslim private school was founded in 1978 and called the Islamic Arabic School ({{lang-da|Islamisk Arabiske Skole}}) in [[Helsingør]]. Since then, over 30 such schools have been opened and many offer Arabic language classes and Islamic studies. However, the majority of Muslim students still go to non-religious public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2014|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest school is Dia Privatskole in [[Nørrebro]] with about 410 students. Two Pakistani schools teach in Urdu as mother tongue and several Turkish schools have Turkish instruction. Most other schools cater to [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Kbh/Tema/Muslimeridk/Samfund/20060211190639.htm Historien om de muslimske friskoler], Danmarks Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 study material in Arabic which promoted martyrdom and [[jihadism]] was found in the Islamic school ''Nordvest Privatskole'' (tr: Northwest Private School)  in Copenhagen during an unannounced visit by Danish education authorities. The school's building was sold in June 2017 to the investor Ali Laibi Jabbar from shia Almuntadar congregation in [[Malmö]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.b.dk/nationalt/laereboeger-om-jihad-fundet-i-kopirum-paa-muslimsk-friskole|title=Lærebøger om jihad fundet i kopirum på muslimsk friskole|date=2017-07-14|work=www.b.dk|access-date=2017-07-19|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish school inspection did not believe the principal of ''Nordvest'' when he claimed the investor would have no influence in how the school is run and stopped state funding of the school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.b.dk/nationalt/forstaa-balladen-om-de-muslimske-friskoler-paa-fire-minutter|title=Forstå balladen om de muslimske friskoler på fire minutter|date=2017-09-07|work=www.b.dk|access-date=2017-09-10|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Iqra Privatskole'' in Copenhagen immigrant-dominated district of [[Nørrebro]] it was discovered that vice principal and imam Shahid Mehdi for years had run a web page where he discouraged Muslim youth from having non-Muslim friends. Shahid Mehdi was sentenced in Malmö for having sexually assaulted a woman in a park by baring his genitals and chasing her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result of these investigations, the school was placed under stricter supervision by authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ''Roser Skolen'' in [[Odense]] was placed under supervision by authorities during the investigation about whether controversial imam Abu Bashar from Vollsmose are running the school through front men after it was discovered his 28-year-old son was hired in a managerial position at the school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Al-Salam school in [[Odense]] authorities investigated whether the principal spoke Danish and whether the teaching was primarily done in [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bt.dk/nyheder/staten-stopper-tilskud-til-endnu-en-friskole-her-er-moedet-der-vakte-saerlig|title=Staten stopper tilskud til endnu en friskole: Her er mødet, der vakte særlig undren|work=www.bt.dk|access-date=2017-09-10|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
===Islamic dress===
In 2005, the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court of Denmark]] upheld a law allowed business to ban women from wearing headscarves as part of a uniform. In 2009, judges and jurors were banned from wearing any religious symbols, including headscarves. The law was met with opposition by several [[bar association]]s. Some schools have banned face veils in class. The Danish People's Party has called for a ban on face veils nationwide as well as a ban on headscarves in parliament but neither of these proposals have passed as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2014|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy===
{{main|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy}}
[[File:Naser Khader-2011-09-09.jpg|thumb|[[Naser Khader]], one of the founders of [[Democratic Muslims in Denmark|Democratic Muslims]]]]

A Danish newspaper, ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' printed [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|12 caricatures]] of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in September 2005. These cartoons sparked an international controversy, ultimately resulting in the scorching of two Danish diplomatic missions, a boycott of Danish goods in several countries, and a large number of protests around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article723266.ece|work=TimesOnline|title=Denmark faces international boycott over Muslim cartoons|first=Anthony|last=Browne|date=31 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of protests caused an increase in support for the anti-immigration [[Danish People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2006/03/09/460200.html|work=Dagbladet|title=Kraftig høyrebølge i Skandinavia|first=Mina Hauge|last=Nærland|date=9 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006 after the escalation of the cartoons controversy the political organization [[Democratic Muslims in Denmark|Democratic Muslims]] ({{lang-da|Demokratiske muslimer}}) was founded by [[Naser Khader]], [[Yildiz Akdogan]] and other [[Muslim]]s. Its goal is a peaceful co-existence of [[Islam and democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ritzau]]: [http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/6654:Danmark--Ny-formand-for-Demokratiske-Muslimer Ny formand for Demokratiske Muslimer] [[Kristeligt Dagblad]], (in Danish) 26 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Naser Khader left his position as leader in 2007. In 2009 and 2011, it was reported that the organization had few members and little activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.dk/politik/naser-khaders-ry-bremser-muslimsk-forening Naser Khaders ry bremser muslimsk forening] (in Danish) [[Berlingske Tidende]], 16 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sappho.dk/de-demokratiske-muslimer-hvor-blev-de-af.htm De demokratiske muslimer – hvor blev de af?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124063239/http://www.sappho.dk/de-demokratiske-muslimer-hvor-blev-de-af.htm |date=24 January 2011 }} (in Danish), Sappho.dk, 13 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013 Ahmed Akkari, who had taken a major role in the affair and was the spokesman for a tour of Imams to the Middle East to protest the cartoons, expressed his regret for his role in the Imams' tour of the Middle East, stating that "I want to be clear today about the trip: It was totally wrong. At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad. We have not changed our position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahmad Akkari, Danish Muslim: I was wrong to damn Muhammad cartoons|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/ahmad-akkari-islam-danish-cartoons-muhammad|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamism and terrorism===
In 2014, the [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service]] estimated that roughly 100 people from Denmark had travelled to fight in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that, per capita, Denmark has the second largest group of citizens fighting in Syria from a Western country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2015|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish National Centre for Social Research released a report commissioned by the Ministry of Children, Integration and Social Affairs documenting 15 extremist groups operating in Denmark. The majority of these organizations were non-Muslim far-right or far-left groups, but five were Islamist groups. These Islamist groups include ''Hizb ut-Tahrir'', ''Dawah-bœrere'' (Dawah Carriers), ''Kaldet til Islam'' (The Call to Islam), ''Dawah-centret'' (The Dawah Centre), and the ''Muslimsk Ungdomscenter'' (The Muslim Youth Centre). All of these Islamist groups operate in Greater Copenhagen with the exception of ''Muslimsk Ungdomscenter'', which operates in Aarhus. Altogether, roughly 195 to 415 Muslims belong to one of these organizations and most are young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2015|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, thousands of Muslims in Copenhagen and Aarhus protested against [[ISIS]]. The initiative was titled "Vi siger NEJ til (U)Islamisk stat!" or "We say NO to an (un)Islamic state" and it was endorsed by ''Muslimernes Fællesråd'' (The United Council of Muslims).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2015|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
A 2008 study by Brian Arly Jacobsen compared parliamentary debates over Islam from 1967-2005 to parliamentary debates of Jewish immigrants from 1903-1925. The study concluded that while both minority groups have been seen as alien, Jews were often seen as biologically and racially different whereas Muslims are seen having a culture incompatible with Danish society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cesari|2014|pp=408–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, about 200 Danes in Copenhagen wielding torches and placards marched in Denmark's first anti-Islam [[PEGIDA]] rally. The protesters marched from the [[National Gallery of Denmark|National Art Museum]] to ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'', and were opposed along the way in [[Nørrebro]] by anti-racist counter-demonstrators holding signs reading "Refugees and Muslims are welcome." Some Muslims attended a counter-protest nearby and despite confrontations with PEGIDA supporters no violence ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brabant|first1=Malcolm|title=PEGIDA Denmark takes cue from Germany|url=http://www.dw.com/en/pegida-denmark-takes-cue-from-germany/a-18201808|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9087">'''Jama Masjid''' ({{Nastaliq|جَامع مَسجد}}), also spelled '''Jame Mosque''', '''Jami Masjid''', '''Jameh Mosque''', '''Jamia Masjid''', or '''Jomeh Mosque''', refers to the main mosque, of a town, city, area or village, which hosts the [[Jumu'ah|special Friday noon prayers]] and, in case there is no allocated open space ([[Musallah]] or [[Eidgah]]) available or nearby, the [[Eid prayers]]. These are sometimes called '''Congregational mosques''' or '''Friday mosques'''.&lt;ref name="UnescoBalkh"&gt;{{citation |work=The [[UNESCO]] |title=Balkh |url=https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/balkh |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Language and etymology==
The term "Jama Masjid" or "Jame Masjid" comes from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Masjed-e Jame'' ({{Nastaliq|مسجد جامع}}), from {{lang-ar|مَسْجِد جَامِع|Masjid Jāmi‘}}, meaning "congregational mosque" (in Arabic, the term is simplified to "جَامِع ''Jāmi‘''"). In non-Arab Muslim nations, the word ''jāmi‘'' ("that which gathers, congregates or assembles") is often, though erroneously, conflated with another word from the same root, ''jumu‘ah'' ({{lang-ar|جُمُعَة}} "assembly, gathering"), a term which is used for the Friday noon prayers ({{lang-ar|صَلَاة الْجُمُعَة|Ṣalāṫ al-Jumu‘ah}} literally "prayer of assembly") and the day itself ({{lang-ar|يَوْم الْجُمُعَة|Yawm al-Jumu‘ah}} literally "Day of Assembly").&lt;ref name="Cite quran|62|9|e=11|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|62|9|e=11|s=ns}},{{cite quran|62|10|e=11|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that the Friday prayers (or [[Jumu'ah|Jumu'ah prayers]]), which require congregations, are only held in congregational mosques, usually the main mosque or central mosque, and hence they are also sometimes known as Friday mosques.&lt;ref name="UnescoBalkh"/&gt;

The '''Jewish Cemetery of Funchal''' is a [[Jewish cemetery]] located in Rua do Lazareto, Funchal, Madeira. Sephardi Jews as well as Ashkenazi Jews are buried here.

==History==

The cemetery was built in 1851, the last burial took place in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sephardicgen.com/databases/FunchalSrchFrm.html

Jews from Morocco arrived in 1819 and set themselves up in the cloth and wine trades. The Abudarham family were involved in the [[Madeira wine]] industry from the early 1860s onwards.

The Jewish community grew due to the [[Evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II]] to Madeira, which included a number of Jews, some of which are buried in the Jewish Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jewishphotolibrary.smugmug.com/AFRICA/AFRICAislands/MADEIRA/PTFunchalJewishCemetery/i-MqcfhkQ

[[Tito Benady]], a historian on Gibraltar Jewry, noted that when some 200 Jews from [[Gibraltar]] were evacuated as non combatants to Funchal, Madeira, at the start of [[World War II]], they found a Jewish cemetery that belonged to the Abudarham family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://picasaweb.google.com/108923459519108739457/CemiterioHebreu

'''Kapilavastu''' was an ancient city on the [[Indian subcontinent]] which was the capital of [[Shakya]].
King [[Śuddhodana]] and [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Queen Māyā]] are believed to have lived at Kapilavastu, as did their son Prince Siddartha Gautama until he [[Gautama Buddha#Renunciation and ascetic life|left the palace]] at the age of 29.&lt;ref name=EoB2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Trainor|first=K|editor-last=Keown|editor-first=D|editor2-last=Prebish|editor2-first=CS|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|chapter=Kapilavastu|pages=436–7|publisher=Routledge|location=Milton Park, UK|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-55624-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFpcAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=kapil#v=onepage&amp;q=kapilavatthu&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Buddhist texts]] such as the [[Pāli Canon]] claim that Kapilavastu was the childhood home of [[Gautama Buddha]], on account of it being the capital of the [[Shakya]]s, over whom his father ruled.&lt;ref name=EoB2010/&gt; Kapilavastu is the place where Siddhartha Gautama spent his 29 years of his life.

The 19th-century search for the historical site of Kapilavastu followed the accounts left by [[Faxian]] and later by [[Xuanzang]], who were Chinese [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] who made early pilgrimages to the site.&lt;ref&gt;[[Beal, Samuel]] (1884).

'''Khmer Renovation''' ({{lang-km|គណបក្ស កំណែទម្រង់ខ្មែរ}}; {{Lang-fr|parti de rénovation Khmère}}), also translated as "Khmer Renewal", was an anti-communist, nationalist and royalist political party founded in Cambodia in September 1947. In 1955, it became one of the core elements of the [[Sangkum]] political movement of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]].

The party is mainly significant because key members [[Lon Nol]] and Prince [[Sisowath Sirik Matak]] would go on to lead the right-wing [[Cambodian coup of 1970|coup of 1970]] against Sihanouk and his Sangkum regime.

==History==

The party was formed by the politician and soldier [[Nhiek Tioulong]] and police chief Lon Nol.&lt;ref name=corfield57&gt;Corfield, J. ''History of Cambodia'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; Its nominal leader was the respected Prince [[Sisowath Monipong]], one of the two sons of King [[Sisowath Monivong]] and one of the candidates for the throne passed over in favour of Sihanouk in 1941. Other prominent members included [[Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum]], who acted as an adviser to Tioulong and Nol in founding the party, and Chuop Hell.

The party, known informally as the "Renos",&lt;ref name=corfieldsummers&gt;Corfield, J. and Summers, L. ''Historical Dictionary of Cambodia'', Scarecrow Press, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; had a socially conservative and royalist programme - albeit far more pro-independence than that of the similarly conservative [[Liberal Party (Cambodia)|Liberal Party]] of Prince [[Norodom Norindeth]] - and attracted high-ranking bureaucrats and several members of the royal family as well as military officers.&lt;ref name=fukui642&gt;Fukui, Haruhiro. ''Political parties of Asia and the Pacific'', V.1, Greenwood Press, 1985, p.642&lt;/ref&gt; Khmer Renovation's "quasi-feudalist" perspective, which emphasised Cambodia and its monarchy's place in world history and the postcolonial order, was symbolised by its chosen [[electoral symbol|symbol]] of the Earth Goddess superimposed on a map of the protectorate.&lt;ref name="corfieldsummers"/&gt; It published a newspaper, ''Khmera'' or ''Rénovation'', in both French and Khmer versions.&lt;ref name="corfieldsummers"/&gt; Monipong was to become the [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]] of a 'unity' government between June 1950 and February 1951.

Lon Nol led the party to the polls in the 1951 elections, where - despite receiving 9.1% of the total vote - it won a total of 2 seats in the Assembly.&lt;ref name="fukui642"/&gt;

Although the Khmer Renovation Party had only limited electoral success - neither Lon Nol nor Sirik Matak, later to become prominent politicians, won seats while a party member - it became one of the main political groupings behind the formation of the Sangkum of Prince Sihanouk.&lt;ref name=kiernan&gt;Kiernan, B. ''How Pol Pot came to Power'', Yale University Press, 2004, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; Nhiek Tioulong was to become Prime Minister under the Sangkum, and was later to become a prominent figure in the pro-royalist [[FUNCINPEC]] organisation. Lon Nol was also to become Prime Minister, but along with Sirik Matak was to lead the 1970 coup deposing Sihanouk and instigating the Khmer Republic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2606">'''Mandali''' from the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[mandala]]'' meaning circle, connection, community,&lt;ref&gt;''Sacred Sanskrit Words: For Yoga, Chant, And Meditation'',
by Leza Lowitz and Reema Datta, Stonebridge Press, Berkeley, Ca. 2005, p. 123 {{ISBN|1-880656-87-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term that [[Meher Baba]] used for his closest disciples.

==Inner circle==
Mandali are considered to include those close disciples that lived permanently or for extended periods with Meher Baba at his [[ashram]]s. However, not all of Meher Baba's mandali lived with him. According to Meher Baba the [[Avatar]] always has 10 concentric circles of 12 men and/or women each. The inner circle consists of 12 men plus two women, for a total of 122 mandali.&lt;ref&gt;''Baba Words; The Master's Glossary'', by Frank Davis (under the term "Circle") [http://www.avatarmeherbaba.org/erics/glossc-d.html]&lt;/ref&gt; But Meher Baba also said, "Those who do my work are my ''mandali''. If we were to list their names, it would fill a volume."&lt;ref&gt;''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba,'' by Bhau Kalchuri, ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986. p. 4753&lt;/ref&gt; At another time Baba said, "By ''mandali'' I mean those who have been with me for several years, but ask for nothing... In short, I would say that the mandali means those whose intimacy I feel."&lt;ref&gt;''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba,'' by Bhau Kalchuri, ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986. p. 4277&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Shintoism}}
{{Nihongo|'''Misogi'''|禊}} is a Japanese [[Shinto]] practice of [[ritual purification]] by washing the entire body. Misogi is related to another Shinto purification ritual called ''[[Harae]]'' &amp;ndash; thus both being collectively referred to as {{Nihongo|Misogiharae|禊祓}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1483 |title=Misogi |work=Encyclopedia of Shinto |publisher=Kokugakuin University |author=Nishioka Kazuhiko |date=March 31, 2007 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kyoto]], people douse themselves under [[Kiyomizu]] Temple's ''Otowa no taki'' (Sound-of-Wings) waterfall, although the majority of visitors drink from the waters rather than plunging into them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://farstrider.net/Japan/Kyoto/Kiyomizudera.htm Kiyomizu-dera]&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, many groups take [[pilgrimage]]s to sacred waterfalls, lakes and rivers, either alone or in small groups, to perform misogi. Mount Ontake, the Kii mountain range and Mount Yoshino are but a few examples of ancient and well known areas for Misogi in Japan. In the United States misogi is performed at the [[Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America]] at the Konryu Myojin no Taki waterfall each morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsubakishrine.com/misogishuho/index.html|title=Misogi Shuho|publisher=Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before encountering misogi, members generally undergo some sort of preliminary purification. Such things as prayers, fasting, or some sort of physical activity is common. Generally, women put on a special white [[kimono]] ([[robe]]) and a headband and men put on a [[fundoshi]] ([[loin cloth]]) and head band. They then begin ''furitama'' (降り魂) or "spirit shaking" by clenching their hands in front of the stomach and shaking them up and down, vibrating the upper torso. The purpose of this is to become aware of/unified with the spirit's presence within. Following this is a "warm-up" or [[calisthenics]] (''tori-fune'' 鳥船 or "bird boat" rowing). These two aforementioned practices are sometimes accompanied by special prayers or incantations. After, the leader begins to speak out invocations/prayers that are said to activate the [[spirit]]. The followers generally speak along with them, thus affirming the potential for realizing one's own spirit, and thus unifying them with the [[kami]] around them.
 
The above exercises are done so participants raise their [[metabolism]] and some groups accompany this with deep breathing. They may be sprinkled with purifying salt and may be given [[sake]] to spit into the waterfall in three mouthfuls. Sometimes the participants are given salt to throw into the waterfall as they enter. In some groups, the leader counts to nine and then cuts the air while shouting the word "''yei!''{{-"}} to dispel this impurity. The participants then enter the waterfall while continuously chanting the phrase {{Nihongo|''harai tamae kiyome tamae rokkon shōjō''|祓い給え清め給え六根清浄}} This phrase asks the ''kami'' to wash away the impurity from the six elements that make up the human being, the five senses and the mind. The practice of this varies from group to group, each having their own traditions or methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csuchico.edu/~gwilliams/tsa/Appendix_c.html Kami no Michi: The Life and Thought of a Shinto Priest. Appendix C: Misogi and Spiritual Exercises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219003348/http://www.csuchico.edu/~gwilliams/tsa/Appendix_c.html |date=2012-02-19 }}. Guji Yukitaka Yamamoto. California State University.  Retrieved 2011-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Misogi is also used in some forms of martial arts, especially [[aikido]], to prepare the mind for training and to learn how to develop one's ''[[Dantian]]'', or centre. The founder of aikido, [[Morihei Ueshiba]], regularly used this form of meditation to complement his training and search for perfection. The Sen Shin tei Misogi Well at [[Ki Society]] Headquarters in Japan is a well-known place for people performing misogi with cold water before sunrise.

'''Momolianism''' is a belief system, of the [[Kadazan-Dusun]] people of [[Sabah]], formerly [[North Borneo]]. The belief is that land is a gift from the creator, the earth is a centre of the universe and that the land connects them to the past, present and future. This system of belief, inherited from the ancestors, was passed down through the [[Bobohizan]], (Kadazan term) or Bobolian (Dusun term) priestesses, and has guided and ensured the survival of the Kadazan-Dusun people, throughout their social evolution from small community of settlers in what was said to be a 10 household longhouse at [[Nunuk Ragang]] to the present population of more than half a million individuals (2010 Malaysian Census figure). The term Momolianism itself is derived from word Bobolian.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Origin==
This belief system has its origin in the first ancestors' interaction with the natural and spiritual environment at [[Nunuk Ragang]] the legendary ancestral home of the Kadazan-Dusun. This belief system was an integral part of the Kadazan-Dusun life before the advent of [[organized religion]]. Central to Momolianism is the belief that the Kadazan-Dusun live in an environment consisting of the "seen material world" and the "unseen spirit world". It was most important to ensure continuity of the balance and order between the natural and spirit environment.&lt;ref&gt;Segunda, Patrick (2004)''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qtJp7aAZV_oC&amp;lpg=PA718&amp;vq=180&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q=180&amp;f=false "Biodiversity in Malaysia" in the book The Sacred Earth: Religion, Nature, Environment]''.  New York: Routledge. p.180-185&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars would equate this to [[animism]].

==Basic belief==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
; Communications with the spirit world
The Kadazan-Dusun believed that there is as much effort on the part of the denizens of the spirit world to communicate with the denizens of the material world as are the denizens of this material world attempting to communicate with the denizens of the spirit world. This effort at communication gave birth to the office of the Bobolians, categories of members of Kadazan-Dusun people with special gifts and abilities to communicate with the counterpart in the spirit world. The Bobolian's counterpart in the spirit world is known as the "Susukuon" or "reference spirit being".  The ability to communicate with each other is described as "kih gimbaran" or "osundu" (in possession of spiritual power). This power is at the same level as another category of members of Kadazan-Dusun people known as "osiou" (in possession of fearlessness in war/warrior).
It was for this reason that in past times when the early egalitarian Kadazan-Dusun community faced unprecedented crisis, the Bobolians would provide the spiritual guidance whilst the warriors rendered their warfare services.   
Gifts and sacrifice play an important part in establishing communication between the material world and the spirit world. To initiate communication, a bobolian has to initially provide gifts to the counterpart spirit in the form of prepared food(boiled chicken flesh and egg) and drink(fermented sweet tapai/lihing).
The counterpart spirit or spirits in the spirit world may also establish communication with humans via medium that impact directly on human senses such as hearing, sight, smell, touch and taste. Thus, for example a Kadazan-Dusun on his way to the farm is informed by a spirit of impending danger by the frantic warning call of the "Lokiu" bird (a woodpecker bird) or a "lontugi" (giant millipede) stationary on his or her pathway. He or she would then desist from continuing with her journey.

; Salvation
The Kadazan-Dusun believed that in the past the community had experienced a unique salvation event. This salvation experience was not for the purpose of easing or to guarantee a place in paradise. It was to ensure the survival of the Kadazan-Dusun race. In that event, [[Huminodun]], a human maiden daughter of [[Kinoringan]] and his wife Sumunundu, allowed herself to be sacrificed, her body parts dispersed over the earth to later sprouts as food plants for the people facing extinction during a devastating famine. From henceforth The Kadazan-Dusun people celebrate Huminodun's sacrifice as the [[Tadau Kaamatan]] or Harvest Festival thanksgiving to her.

; The Name
The name of the Kadazan-Dusun deity is still debated, with some considering Kinoingan or Kinorohingan as just a deified and worshiped human ancestors whilst others think that a more appropriate approached would be to refer to their God as "[[Minamangun]]" ([[Creator deity|creator]]). This contrasting stand may be the result of influence from members of the community who had embraced other organized religions such as Christianity or the Islamic faith and the need to thread with care so as not to seen to going against their new faith. During the preparation of the first Kadazan-English Dictionary by the European missionary, certain word, including the word for God, were wrongly translated by the translators.&lt;ref&gt;Luping, Herman. (2011) The kinoingan Question ''in the Daily express'' 4th September 2011.Kota Kinabalu.&lt;/ref&gt;

; The dead
The belief system of the Kadazan-Dusun has no concept of heaven and hell. The dead were believed to have just passed on to another realm of life and moved to the new home Nabahu or Akinabalu (from the word "aki" meaning "old man"), later officially named Mount Kinabalu. The body of the dead, consigned to burial as immediately as possible (also referred to as "lisok" or hide), to prevent foreign spirit invasion, and the spirit (referred to as "koduduo" or "your second"  sent off by vigorous hitting of the floor on which the coffin was laid. On the seventh day a ceremonial "popouli" (to invite home) was conducted to allow for the koduduo to reenter the earthly home so as to enable it to "retrieve any forgotten belongings". This ceremony includes "momisok" or switching off lights so as not to scare off the koduduo. The Bobolian's role in this ceremony is to ensure that the koduduo is properly sent off. In 2015 a major earthquake which caused the loss of several lives occurred at Mount Kinabalu, presumed by Bobolians to have been caused by the misbehavior of several European men and women who stripped naked on Mount Kinabalu's peak. The dead ancestors of the Kadazan-Dusun were said to be angered by the desecration of the home.

==Traditional healing==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Momolianism is closely tied to traditional healing because all the Bobolians are traditional healers. The process of healing in Momolianism is referred to as "manampasi", which is somewhat akin to salvation, only that it involves a process of ritual "negotiation with denizens of the spirit world" so as to temporarily not accept the koduduo's entry to Nabahu.

==Evolution of Momolianism==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Momolianism began as a belief system to guide the early small community of settlers life interactions with the highly forested natural environment of Nunuk Ragang. As the environment changed due to human exploitation the belief system also undergo changes to accommodate to new reality of community life.

; Forest Phase
The need to evade a crisis of overpopulation at site and over exploitation of the forest resources at Nunuk Ragang led to the introduction of the Minorit (tiny spiritual beings) concept so as to spur migration and dispersal. The Bobolians' advice to the Nunuk Ragang warrior leadership(s) to initiate the abandonment of Nunuk Ragang was fully complied with by the people leading to the migration up the Liwagu Kogibangan (left fork) and the Liwagu Kowananan (right fork) rivers. This point to the strong influence of Momolianism in ensuring continued existence and population growth of the Kadazan-Dusun people.

; Paddy Cultivation Phase
After the introduction of paddy planting, the community was subjected to another major crisis involving severe crop failure and consequent famine. This led to the introduction of concept of worship of Kinorohingan and Huminodun (Traditional Tadau Kaamatan festival). This phase of evolution of Momolianism could not have happened at Nunuk Ragang. The Nunuk Ragang inhabitants were not wet paddy planters, but practice vegeculture, i.e. cultivating and propagating the yams, sweet potato and cassava using suckers and cuttings. The [[Rumanau people]] ethnic group were the first Kadazan-Dusun to acquire the skill of wet paddy planting. Hence their name "Rumanau" which means "one who cultivate wet paddy".

; The Gusi Cult Phase
Worship of Jars began among the Tuaran Kadazan-Dusuns.

; The Guritom Cult Phase
Veneration of skulls at Sunsuron. This phase developed in tandem with the advent of the headhunting phase among the Kadazan-Dusun. At Nunuk Ragang the Kadazan-Dusun families, being small community, were at peace with one another and the Guritom was non-existent. The Guritom (house of skulls) at Sunsuron, Tambunan had been removed and the skulls transferred to the Sabah Museum. Another site at Sogindai, Ranau was previously being used as a Guritom. The Guritom Phase came about as a result of the absence of the Law and as an attempt at presenting visual warning to any party deviating from the norm in relationship among the descendants of the Nunuk Ragang settlers.

; The Syncretistic Phase
The coming of European influence had a major impact on Momolianism. The largely tolerant Catholic religion, allowed for dual practice of Momolianism and Christian Faith to exist side by side.

[[File:DSC04629 Istanbul - Sehzade camii - Foto G. Dall'Orto 29-5-2006.jpg|thumb|The later plain type hanging in [[Istanbul]]]]

'''Mosque lamps''' of [[enamelled glass]], often with [[gilding]], survive in considerable numbers from the [[Islamic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], especially the 13th and 14th centuries, with [[Cairo]] in Egypt and [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] in Syria the most important centres of production.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  They are [[oil lamp]]s, usually with a large round bulbous body rising to a narrower waist, above which the top section is flared.  There is usually a foot so they can be placed on a surface, but they were normally used suspended by chains that went through a number of loops on the outside of the body.  They were used to light mosques and other buildings in mosque complexes, in large spaces in groups hanging from a circular metal frame.  The circular frames continue to be used in many mosques today, but with plain or frosted glass lamps for electric lighting.

==Manufacture==
The techniques used are typical of contemporary [[Islamic glass]], with the enamel decoration applied to a pre-fired plain body, and the whole then fired for a second time. 
The coloured decoration may include [[Qur'anic]] verses, especially the first part of the ''[[Ayat an-Nur]]'' or "Verse of Light" (24:35, see below), inscriptions and heraldic emblems recording the donor, as well as purely decorative motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 134; [http://www.wallacecollection.org/whatson/treasure/38 A mid-14th-century Islamic glass mosque lamp from Cairo (XXVB94)] [[Wallace Collection]]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 15th century production of all types of fine glass was in steep decline, a sign of which is that in 1569 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Grand Vizier]] [[Sokullu Mehmed Pacha]] ordered 600 plain lamps of [[Venetian glass]], perhaps to be decorated elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O821/mosque-lamp/ Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottomans]] also made lamps of similar form in [[Iznik pottery]], and [[Shah Abbas I]] of Persia gave plain silver lamps to hang by the tomb of [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili|Shaykh Safi]] at [[Ardabil]]; [[Persian miniature]]s show other examples from the 16th century in gold or brass and silver.  Such opaque materials were much less effective as lighting, but the purpose of the lamp was symbolic as well as practical, related to the "Verse of Light".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/m/ottoman_mosque_lamp.aspx Lamp for the Ottoman restoration of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem], British Museum; Canby, 85, 180; Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosque lamps are often shown in profile at the head of a [[prayer rug]] for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  The decoration of the lamps often includes either the name or the symbol from [[Islamic heraldry]] of the donor, who usually gave a group of lamps.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Jones &amp; Mitchell, 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;  Other types of lighting in mosques were large metal lamp stands, like very wide candlesticks, which were also used in secular buildings.  These could be very intricately decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later types==
[[File:Amman BW 33.JPG|thumb|Modern electric lighting in [[Amman]]]]
The elaborate decorated types were mostly succeeded by plain glass oil lamps with a simple rim at the top, by which they were attached to (typically) a circular metal bar. Often these hang in tiers. Mosques today typically retain the hanging circular fittings, but use electric lights and glass shades of various sorts, not essentially different from other glass [[lampshade]]s used in lighting other buildings.

==Collecting==

'''Nalanda Monastery''' (Fr: ''le monastère Nalanda'', f. 1981) is the first Western monastery of the [[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition]] (FPMT), an international network of [[Gelugpa]] [[dharma center]]s. Named for [[Nalanda|Nalanda Monastery]] in ancient India, the French institution is located near [[Lavaur, Tarn|Lavaur]], about forty kilometers from [[Toulouse]], and not far from another FPMT center, the [[Institut Vajra Yogini]].

==History==
The site was purchased by Elizabeth Drukier, then director of the Institut Vajra Yogini, with the intention of using it as the European headquarters of the International Mahayana Institute (IMI), a group of Western monks following FPMT co-founders [[Thubten Yeshe|Lama Yeshe]] and [[Thubten Zopa|Lama Zopa]]. The monastery opened in a converted farmhouse, with Geshe Jampa Tegchog as its first abbot (served 1981-1994, afterwards abbot of [[Sera Monastery|Sera Je]]) and Ven.

[[File:Holte Kirke 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Church of Denmark]] parish church in [[Holte]], with the [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] flying in its [[kirkyard]]]]
A '''national church''' is a [[Christian church]] associated with a specific [[ethnic group]] or [[nation state]]. The idea was notably discussed during the [[Christianity in the 19th century|19th century]], during the emergence of modern [[nationalism]].

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in a draft discussing the question of [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] around 1828 wrote that 
:"a National Church might exist, and has existed, without [Christianity], because before the institution of the ''Christian'' Church - as [...] the Levitical Church in the Hebrew Constitution, [and] the [[Druidical]] in the Celtic, would suffice to prove".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AkiXWLPqoi8C On the Constitution of the Church and State]''. Classic Books Company; 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-7426-8368-6}}. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AkiXWLPqoi8C&amp;pg=PA59 59].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wordsworth]], Bishop of Salisbury, wrote about the National Church of Sweden in 1911, interpreting the [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Church of England]] as national churches of the Swedish and the English peoples, respectively. Lake (1987) traces the development of [[Presbyterianism]] in 16th-century England from the status of a "godly minority" which saw itself surrounded by the corrupt or hostile mass of the population, into a "genuine national church".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lake, [[Maria Dowling]], ''Protestantism and the national church in sixteenth century England'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1987, ISBN, 9780709916819, ch. 8 (193ff.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a national church remains alive in the Protestantism of England and Scandinavia in particular. While, in a context of England, the national church remains a common denominator for the Church of England, some of the Lutheran "'''folk churches'''" of Scandinavia, characterized as national churches in the ethnic sense as opposed to the idea of a state church, emerged in the second half of the 19th century following the lead of [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]].&lt;ref&gt;Dag Thorkildsen, "Scandinavia: Lutheranism and national identity" in ''World Christianities, c. 1815-1914'', vol. 8 of ''The Cambridge history of Christianity'', eds. Sheridan Gilley, Brian Stanley, Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81456-0}}, pp. 342–358.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in countries in which the state church (also known as the established church) has the following of the majority of citizens, the state church may also be the national church, and may be declared as such by the government e.g. [[Church of Denmark]],&lt;ref name="Shadid1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shadid|first=W. A. R.|title=Religious Freedom and the Position of Islam in Western Europe|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=9789039000656|page=11|quote=Denmark has declared the Evangelical Lutheran church to be that national church (par. 4 of the Constitution), which corresponds the fact that 91.5% of the population are registered members of this church. This declaration implies that the Danish State does not take a neutral stand in religious matters. Nevertheless, freedom of religion has been incorporated in the Constitution. Nielsen (1992, 77) gives a short description of the position of the minority religious communities in comparison to that of the State Church: The Lutheran established church is a department of the state. Church affairs are government by a central government ministry, and clergy are government employees. The registration of births, deaths and marriages falls under this ministry of church affairs, and normally speaking the local Lutheran pastor is also the official registrar. The other small religious communities, viz. Roman Catholics, Methodists, Baptists and Jews, have the constitutional status of 'recognised communities of faith'. ... Contrary to the minority religious communities, the Lutheran Church is fully financed by the Danish State.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of Greece]],&lt;ref name="EnyediMadeley2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enyedi|first1=Zsolt|last2=Madeley|first2=John T.S.|title=Church and State in Contemporary Europe|date=2 August 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135761417|page=228|quote=Both as a state church and as a national church, the Orthodox Church of Greece has a lot in common with Protestant state churches, and even with Catholicism in some countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Protestantism|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816069835|page=283|quote=When Iceland obtained home rule in 1874, the new constitution, while granting religious freedom, maintained the Evangelical Lutheran Church as "a national church . . . supported by the State." This was reaffirmed in the 1944 constitution of the new independent Republic of Iceland. Democratic reforms were adopted early in the 20th century that allowed for some independent decision making in parish councils, and let congregations choose their own pastors. Under a 1998 law, the church became largely autonomous, though it is still designated established church, supported by government taxes. At the end of the 19th century, Lutherans who wanted freedom from the state church founded the Evangelical Free Church of Iceland, which now has in excess of 7,000 members. The majority of Icelanders are members of the state church. Almost all children are baptized as Lutheran and more than 90 percent are subsequently confirmed. The Church conducts 75 percent of all marriages and 99 percent of all funerals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nihonshoki tanaka version.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Page from a copy of the ''Nihon Shoki'', early [[Heian period]]]]
{{Shintoism}}
The {{nihongo|'''''Nihon Shoki'''''|日本書紀}}, sometimes translated as '''''The Chronicles of Japan''''', is the second-oldest book of classical [[Japanese history]]. The book is also called the {{Nihongo|'''''Nihongi'''''|日本紀||"Japanese Chronicles"}}. It is more elaborate and detailed than the ''[[Kojiki]]'', the oldest, and has proven to be an important tool for historians and [[archaeologists]] as it includes the most complete extant historical record of ancient Japan. The ''Nihon Shoki'' was finished in [[720 in poetry|720]] under the editorial supervision of [[Prince Toneri of Japan|Prince Toneri]] and with the assistance of [[Ō no Yasumaro]] dedicated to [[Empress Genshō]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to AD 697 | author-link = William George Aston | first = William George | last = Aston | page = xv | chapter = Introduction | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | edition = Tra | date = July 2005 | origyear = 1972 | ISBN = 978-0-8048-3674-6}}, from the original Chinese and Japanese.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nihon Shoki'' begins with the [[Japanese creation myth]], explaining the origin of the world and the first seven generations of divine beings (starting with [[Kuninotokotachi]]), and goes on with a number of myths as does the ''[[Kojiki]]'', but continues its account through to events of the 8th century. It is believed to record accurately the latter reigns of [[Emperor Tenji]], [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jitō]]. The ''Nihon Shoki'' focuses on the merits of the virtuous [[Emperor of Japan|rulers]] as well as the errors of the bad rulers. It describes episodes from [[Japanese mythology|mythological]] eras and [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] contacts with other countries. The ''Nihon Shoki'' was written in [[classical Chinese]], as was common for official documents at that time. The ''Kojiki'', on the other hand, is written in a combination of Chinese and phonetic transcription of Japanese (primarily for names and songs). The ''Nihon Shoki'' also contains numerous [[transliteration]] notes telling the reader how words were pronounced in Japanese. Collectively, the stories in this book and the Kojiki are referred to as the Kiki stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.equinoxpub.com/books/showbook.asp?bkid=184 | title = Equinox Pub}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale of [[Urashima Tarō]] is developed from the brief mention in ''Nihon Shoki'' ([[Emperor Yūryaku]] Year 22) that a certain child of Urashima visited [[Horaisan]] and saw wonders. The later tale has plainly incorporated elements from the famous anecdote of "Luck of the Sea and Luck of the Mountains" ([[Hoderi]] and [[Hoori]]) found in ''Nihon Shoki''. The later developed Urashima tale contains the [[Rip Van Winkle]] motif, so some may consider it an early example of fictional [[time travel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Malchronia: Cryonics and Bionics as Primitive Weapons in the War on Time|first=Christopher|last=Yorke|journal=[[Journal of Evolution and Technology]]|volume=15|issue=1|date=February 2006|pages=73–85|url=http://jetpress.org/volume15/yorke-rowe.html|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs of Shintoism===

==Process of compilation==
''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'' notes that "先是一品舍人親王奉勅修日本紀。至是功成奏上。紀卅卷系圖一卷" in the part of May, 720. It means "Up to that time, &lt;!--一品--&gt;Prince Toneri had been compiling ''Nihongi'' on the orders of the emperor; he completed it, submitting 30 volumes of history and one volume of genealogy". The volume of genealogy is no longer extant.

===Contributors===
The process of compilation is usually studied by stylistic analysis of each chapter. Although written in classical Chinese, some sections use styles characteristic of Japanese editors, while others seem to be written by native speakers of Chinese. According to recent studies, most of the chapters after No.&amp;nbsp;14 (Emperor Yūryaku chronicle) were contributed by native Chinese, except for Chapters 22 and 23 (the Suiko and Jomei chronicle).{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Also, as Chapter 13 ends with the phrase "see details of the incident in the chronicle of Ōhastuse (Yūryaku) Emperor" referring to the assassination of Emperor Ankō, it is assumed that this chapter was written after the compilation of subsequent chapters. Some believe Chapter 14 was the first to be completed.

===References===
The ''Nihon Shoki'' is a synthesis of older documents, specifically on the records that had been continuously kept in the Yamato court since the sixth century. It also includes documents and folklore submitted by clans serving the court. Prior to ''Nihon Shoki'', there were ''[[Tennōki]]'' and ''[[Kokki]]'' compiled by [[Prince Shōtoku]] and [[Soga no Umako]], but as they were stored in Soga's residence, they were burned at the time of the [[Isshi Incident]].

The work's contributors refer to various sources which do not exist today. Among those sources, three [[Baekje]] documents ''(Kudara-ki,etc.)'' are cited mainly for the purpose of recording diplomatic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0774803797&amp;id=7jDuhnI6r9UC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=paekche+nihon+shoki&amp;vq=paekche+nihon&amp;sig=xBY33KY86TN2LOHQVltH4RJLI6Y Sakamoto, Tarō. (1991). ''The Six National Histories of Japan: Rikkokushi,'' John S. Brownlee, tr.] pp. 40–41; [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0521223520&amp;id=x5mwgfPXK1kC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=paekche+nihon+shoki&amp;sig=4ELqFjEjdGoi8XkYV1lvXsbv92M Inoue Mitsusada. (1999). "The Century of Reform" in ''The Cambridge History of Japan'', Delmer Brown, ed. Vol. I], p.170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Records possibly written in Baekje may have been the basis for the quotations in the ''Nihon Shoki''. Textual criticism shows that scholars fleeing the destruction of the Baekje to Yamato wrote these histories and the authors of the ''Nihon Shoki'' heavily relied upon those sources.&lt;ref&gt;Sakamoto, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; This must be taken into account in relation to statements referring to old historic rivalries between the ancient [[Korea]]n kingdoms of [[Silla]], [[Goguryeo]], and [[Baekje]]. The use of Baekje's place names in ''Nihon Shoki'' is another piece of evidence that shows the history used Baekje documents.

Some other sources are cited anonymously as ''aru fumi'' (一書; other document), in order to keep alternative records for specific incidents.

==Exaggeration of reign lengths==
Most scholars agree that the purported founding date of Japan (660 BCE) and the earliest emperors of Japan are legendary or mythical.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrc6rzKkbgcC&amp;pg=PA555&amp;dq=Kigensetsu&amp;lr=&amp;sig=xcynKUdTgWPJT_98ys0YV341tso Rimmer, Thomas ''et al.'' (2005). ''The Columbia Anthology of Modern Japanese Literature''], p. 555 n1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|sate=February 2015|date=February 2015}}&lt;!-- The exact wording of Note 1 is "Empire Founding Day (Kigensetsu), February 11, was established in 1872 as the anniversary of the legendary Emperor Jinmu's accession to the throne in 660 B.C., which is said to have marked the beginning of the Japanese nation. After the Pacific War, it was abolished and then, in 1966, reinstated as Nation Founding Day (Kenkoku kinen no hi)." -- How anyone could read this as supporting the material in this sentence I don't know. --&gt; This does not necessarily imply that the persons referred to did not exist, merely that there is insufficient material available for further verification and study.&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;Kelly, Charles F. [http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/kofun.html  "Kofun Culture,"] [http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/index.htm  Japanese Archaeology.] April 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dates in the ''Nihon Shoki'' before the late 7th century were likely recorded using the [[Genka calendar]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Gina Lee. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=GLAo-bLJw4EC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=genka+reki&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OpTlUKOEDNGu0AHhroC4Dg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=genka%20reki&amp;f=false  ''State Formation in Japan: Emergence of a 4th-Century Ruling Elite,'' p. 226 n.5].&lt;/ref&gt;

For those monarchs, and also for the Emperors [[Emperor Ōjin|Ōjin]] and [[Emperor Nintoku|Nintoku]], the lengths of reign are likely to have been exaggerated in order to make the origins of the imperial family sufficiently ancient to satisfy numerological expectations. It is widely believed that the [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of 660 BCE was chosen because it is a "xīn-yǒu" year in the [[sexagenary cycle]], which according to [[Taoist]] beliefs was an appropriate year for a revolution to take place. As Taoist theory also groups together 21 sexagenary cycles into one unit of time, it is assumed that the compilers of ''Nihon Shoki'' assigned the year 601 (a "xīn-yǒu" year in which Prince Shotoku's reformation took place) as a "modern revolution" year, and consequently recorded 660 BCE, 1260 years prior to that year, as the founding epoch.

===''Kesshi Hachidai''===
For the eight emperors of Chapter 4, only the years of birth and reign, year of naming as Crown Prince, names of consorts, and locations of tomb are recorded. They are called the ''Kesshi Hachidai'' (欠史八代, "eight generations lacking history") because no legends (or a few, as quoted in ''[[Nihon Ōdai Ichiran]]''{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}) are associated with them. Some{{which|date=February 2015}} studies support the view that these emperors were invented to push Jimmu's reign further back to the year 660 BCE. ''Nihon Shoki'' itself somewhat elevates the "tenth" [[emperor Sujin]], recording that he was called the ''Hatsu-Kuni-Shirasu'' (御肇国: first nation-ruling) emperor.

'''Nino Pecoraro''' (1899–1973) was an Italian spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]] who was exposed as a fraud.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro|Polidoro, Massimo]]. (2001). ''Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle''. Prometheus Books. pp. 127-128. {{ISBN|1-57392-896-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. p. 215. {{ISBN|0-486-26167-0}} "Nino Pecoraro specialized in producing physical manifestations of spirits of the departed while he was "tied up" in a cabinet. Toward the end of his life, Percoraro related how he had deceived many famous people, including the novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (who was easily fooled); he also wrote a confession in which he admitted that all his phenomena were faked."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pecoraro from [[Naples]] worked as a spiritualist medium. He claimed his [[spirit guide]] was [[Eusapia Palladino]], a deceased medium.&lt;ref name="Christopher 1975"&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1975). ''Mediums, Mystics &amp; the Occult''. Thomas Y. Crowell. pp. 189-190. {{ISBN|0-690-00476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] introduced Pecoraro to the spiritualist [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in America.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"/&gt; Pecoraro who was tied up during a [[séance]] by Carrington, managed to impress Doyle by making musical instruments play.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1998). ''Houdini''. Gramercy Books. p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carrington persuaded Pecoraro to participate in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' contest. In four days in December, 1923 he was tested by members of the committee. He was tied to a chair with sixty feet of [[rope]]. Beside him was placed a table with musical instruments. During the séances various movements and sounds of objects were heard. He had managed to impress some of the committee members who considered the phenomena genuine. However, [[Orson Desaix Munn|O. D. Munn]], the publisher of the ''Scientific American'', suspected that he had freed his hand to play the instruments.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"/&gt;

The magician [[Harry Houdini]] had not been informed of the test sessions, but managed to get to the fourth séance. Houdini suggested that Percorao was an  [[Escapology|escape artist]] who freed himself from the rope that bound him to his chair. Before the séance, Houdini had cut the rope into shorter pieces and tied Pecoraro to the chair. Because of the tight control, no phenomena occurred.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher 1975"/&gt; In 1931, Pecoraro confessed his fraud in a newspaper interview.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ely Jacques Kahn|Kahn, Ely Jacques]]. (1979). ''Far-Flung and Footloose: Pieces from the New Yorker, 1937-1978''. Putnam Publishing Group. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life he became an artist.  Two of his paintings are on exhibit at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, PA.

'''Ori Gersht''' (born 1967) is an [[Israel]]i [[fine art photographer]]. He is a professor of photography at the [[University for the Creative Arts]] in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], Kent, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucreative.ac.uk/index.cfm?articleid=15756 Ori Gersht, UCA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ori Gersht was born in Tel Aviv. He graduated in Photography, Film and Video from [[University of Westminster]], London and studied for an M.A. in Photography from the [[Royal College of Art]], London.
==Art career==
Gersht has exhibited widely in museums and galleries since the early 1990s. He is represented by Angles Gallery in Los Angeles, [[CRG Gallery]] in New York, Ben Brown Fine Arts in London, and [http://nogagallery.com/ Noga Gallery] in Tel Aviv. In 2012, Gersht's show ''History Repeating'' was mounted at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/arts/design/ori-gersht-history-repeating-at-museum-of-fine-arts-in-boston.html?pagewanted=all Beauty, Tender and Fleeting, Amid History’s Ire]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic themes==
Gersht engages the themes of life, death, violence, and beauty. His photographs and films transcribe  images of sites of historical significance—the [[Judean Desert]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Auschwitz]], the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] region of [[Ukraine]], the Lister Route in the [[Pyrenees]] (on which [[Walter Benjamin]] made his ill-fated exodus from Nazi-occupied France)—into ciphers of psychological disruption. Such scenes may not seem out of the ordinary unto themselves, but, through the artist’s focused attention and treatment they evoke the emotional resonance of what has transpired—most often, violence, and, more significantly, the ghosts of war’s most egregious detritus, its refugees.
Pervasive in Gersht’s work is the [[landscape]], as a place, an idea, and an art historical trope. His films and photographs may be compared to paintings in their display—from their unhindered access (no Plexiglas separates their surfaces from the viewer) to the frames surrounding the monitors on which the films often play. Moreover, the vistas and horizons of, for instance, "Between Places" (1998–2000), "White Noise" (1999–2000), "The Clearing/Liquidation" (2005), and "Evaders" (2009), recall Romantic depictions of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. They conjure precedents in both photography, such as the breathtaking vistas of [[Andreas Gursky]] and the landscapes of the American South by [[Sally Mann]], and painting, by [[J.M.W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]], and even [[Mark Rothko]].

In his  [[still life]] series Gersht investigated the relationships between [[photography]], [[technology]] and optical perception, at a pivotal moment in the history of photography where [[digital technology]] both threatens a crisis and promises a breakthrough. Research into the early history of the medium of photography is brought together with theoretical discourse, creating, still image and films that (literally) explode the genre of still life, the beautiful and destructive results captured using cutting-edge technology. In "Pomegranate", a film that references [[Juan Sanchez Cotan]]’s 17th-century still life and [[Harold Edgerton]]’s stroboscopic photography, a high velocity bullet flies across the frame in slow motion and obliterates a suspended [[pomegranate]] fruit, bursting it open and wheeling it slowly into the air like a smashed violated mouth spraying seeds. A peaceful image is transformed into bloodshed, and a dialogue is established between stillness and motion, peace and violence.

Gersht’s photographs and films provide a meditation on life, loss, destiny and chance.  Allusions to the catastrophic violence of the [[French Revolution]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], the bombing of [[Hiroshima]], and the suicide bombs that Gersht anticipated during his childhood in [[Israel]] can all be found in this work.  As such, it reminds us of our past, present, and future, and, above all, the fragility of life itself.

'''Our Lady of Perpetual Help'''  (also known as '''Our Lady of Perpetual Succour''')&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] of 1911 uses the latter name: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11699b.htm John Magnier, "Our Lady of Perpetual Succour" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1911); but the former is more prevalent today.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Roman Catholic]] title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] as represented in a celebrated 15th-century [[Byzantine art|Byzantine icon]] also associated with the same [[Marian apparition]].

The [[icon]] originated from the [[Keras Kardiotissas Monastery]] and has been in [[Rome]] since 1499. Today it is permanently enshrined in the [[Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori, Rome|Church of Saint Alphonsus]], where the official [[Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help]] text is prayed weekly. 

On 23 June 1867, [[Pope Pius IX]] granted the image its [[Canonical Coronation]] along with its present title. The Redemptorist priests are the only religious order currently entrusted by the [[Holy See]] to protect and propagate a Marian religious work of art. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] [[iconography]], the image is known as the ''”Virgin [[Theotokos]] of the Passion''” due to the instruments of the [[Passion of Jesus Christ]] present on the image.

The feast day of the image is celebrated on June 27, with novena devotions held every Wednesday. Under [[Pope Pius XII]]'s Pontificate, the image was designated as the national [[Patroness]] of the [[Republic of Haiti]] and [[Almoradi]], Spain. In addition, [[Pope John Paul II]] issued a [[canonical coronation]] for a similar image in [[Jaworzno]], [[Poland]] in 16 June 1999&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanktuariumjaworzno.wiara.org.pl/historia.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Due to the propagation of the [[Redemptorist]] Priests since 1865, the image has become very popular among Roman Catholics. Modern reproductions are oftentimes displayed in residential homes, commercial establishments, and public transportation.

==Description==
[[File:Arcangelmiguel.JPG|thumb|Detail of the icon, showing the [[Archangel Michael]].]]
The original wooden icon is suspended on the altar, measures 17" × 21" inches and is written on hard nut wood with a gold leaf background.&lt;ref&gt;''Fest-schrift zum Andenken an die Wieder-Eröffnung der St. Peter's Kirche'', St. Peter's Church Philadelphia, 1901, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; The image depicts the following symbols: 

* The Blessed Virgin Mary — wearing a dress of dark red, representing the Passion of Jesus, with a blue mantle, representing her [[Perpetual virginity of Mary|perpetual virginity]], and cloaked veil, which represents her pure modesty. 
* The subject shows Mary looking towards the faithful, while pointing at her son, [[Jesus Christ]] who is frightened by the instruments of [[crucifixion]] and is depicted with a fallen sandal.
* The left side is [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael Archangel]] —  carrying the [[Holy Lance|lance]] and [[Holy Sponge|sponge]] of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. 
* On the right side is [[Gabriel (archangel)|Saint Gabriel Archangel]] carrying a [[Patriarchal cross|3-bar cross]] used by Popes at the time and [[Nail (relic)|nails]]. 
* The [[Virgin Mary]] has a star on her forehead signifying her role as [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]] while the cross on the side has been claimed as referring to the Greek monastery which produced the icon. 

Byzantine depictions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in art have three stars, one star each on the shoulder and one on the forehead. This type of icon is called [[Hodegetria]], where Mary is pointing to her Son, known as a ''Theotokos of the Passion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=theotokos+of+the+passion&amp;qpvt=theotokos+of+the+passion&amp;FORM=IGRE |title=Types of Theotokos of the Passion |publisher=Bing.com |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary has long slender nose, thin lips, and smoothly arched eyebrows, evidence of being made by a Greek artist. The veil and her face itself are rounded, indicating holiness. The size of the mother is also out of proportion to her son, a deliberate intent by the artist Mary as larger than life.

The Greek inscriptions read '''MP-ΘΥ''' (Μήτηρ Θεοῦ, ''Mother of God''), '''ΟΑΜ''' (Ὁ Ἀρχάγγελος Μιχαήλ, ''Michael the Archangel''), '''ΟΑΓ''' (Ὁ Ἀρχάγγελος Γαβριήλ, ''Gabriel the Archangel'') and '''[[Christogram|IC-XC]]''' (Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, ''Jesus Christ''), respectively. 

The icon has a gold background on a walnut panel, believed to be from Crete. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Icons-Saints-Eastern-Orthodox-Church/dp/0892368454|title=''Icons and saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church''|author=Alfredo Tradigo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cretan School]] was the source of the many icons imported into Europe from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance. The gold background represents the Kingdom of God.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;[http://trinityacres.blogspot.com/2014/07/our-lady-of-perpetual-help.html Trinity Acres]&lt;/ref&gt; The round halo surrounding the Virgin Mary's head is styled called ''Estofado'', which is an artistic effect created by making dented holes into the icon to reflect light from the gold background. The icon was cleaned and restored once in 1866 and again in the year 1940.

==Pious legends==
Popular legends claim that the icon to be a true copy of a painting that according to legend was painted by [[Saint Luke]] using the meal table of the [[Holy Family]] in [[Nazareth]], and in [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition was often identified with the ''Hodegetria'' icon,&lt;ref name="OUR LADY OF FATIMA CRUSADER BULLETIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salvemariaregina.info/SalveMariaRegina/SMR-112.html |title=Our Mother of Perpetual Help |publisher=Salvemariaregina.info |date=1921-07-30 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consider it to be a miraculous imprint of the Virgin Mary both in the [[Latin Church|Latin]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] communities. This belief is common in many [[Hodegetria]] icons who have similar claims of Lucan legends.

==Origin and discovery==
[[File:Arcangelgabriel.JPG|thumb|Close-up of the [[Archangel Gabriel]].]]
The earliest written account of the image comes from a Latin and [[Italian language|Italian]] plaque placed in the church of [[San Matteo in Via Merulana]] where it was first venerated by the public in 1499. The writer of the icon is unknown, but according to a parchment attached to the painting that accompanied the icon, it was stolen by a merchant sailing to [[Rome]] from the island of [[Crete]]. (The [[Keras Kardiotissas Monastery]] is regarded as the monastery from which the icon was stolen.)&lt;ref&gt;http://orthodoxcrete.com/en/places/holy-monastery-of-kera-kardiotissa/&lt;/ref&gt;

The image remained in the private possession of a Roman merchant and his family until March 27, 1499, when the icon was transferred to the church of San Matteo&lt;ref&gt;[https://redemptorists.net/redemptorists/devotion-to-omph/ "Our Mother of Perpetual Help", The Redemptorists]&lt;/ref&gt;  where it remained for 300 years. The picture was then popularly called the Madonna di San Matteo.

==Transfer==
In 1798, [[France|French]] troops under [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] occupied Rome as part of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], establishing the
short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] and taking [[Pope Pius VI]] prisoner. Among the several churches demolished during the French occupation was San Matteo in Via Merulana, which housed the icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquinasandmore.com/catholic-articles/who-is-our-lady-of-perpetual-help/article/110 |title=Who is Our Lady of Perpetual Help? |publisher=Aquinasandmore.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Augustinians|Augustinian friars]] who rescued the icon first took it to the nearby Church of St. Eusebius, then later set it up on a side altar in the Church of Santa Maria in Posterula.

In January 1855, the Redemptorist priests purchased ''Villa Caserta'' in Rome along the Via Merulana and converted it into their headquarters. Without realizing it, the property they had purchased was once the church and monastery of Saint Matthew, the site which the Virgin reportedly chose as the icon's shrine.

Decades later, [[Pope Pius IX]] invited the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist Fathers]] to set up a Marian house of veneration in Rome, in response to which the Redemptorists built the [[Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori, Rome|Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori]] at that location. The Redemptorists were thus established on the Via Merulana, not knowing that it had once been the site of the Church of San Matteo and shrine of the once-famous icon.

==Present caretaker==
[[File:Manosdelaperpe.JPG|left|thumb|Detail of the hands of the virgin.]]
[[Pope Pius IX]] sent a letter dated 11 December 1865 to Father General Mauron, C.Ss.R., ordered that the image be once again publicly venerated in Via Merulana, the new church of Saint Alphonsus. The same Pontiff directed the Augustinian friars to surrender the icon to the Redemptorist priests, on condition that the Redemptorists must supply the Augustinians with another picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Help or a good copy of the icon in exchange as a gesture of goodwill.
Pope Pius IX instructions to the [[Redemptorists]] were:

{{quote|The Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda will call the Superior of the community of Sancta Maria in Posterula and will tell him that it is Our desire that the image of Most Holy Mary, referred to in this petition, be again placed between Saint John and St. Mary Major; the Redemptorists shall replace it with another adequate picture.''&lt;ref name="The History of the Icon"/&gt;}}

Upon its official transfer, Pope Pius IX finally gave his Apostolic Blessing and titled the icon ''Mater de Perpetuo Succursu'' (Mother of Perpetual Help). On 23 June 1867, the image was given a [[Canonical Coronation]] by the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Vatican]] [[chapter (religion)|Chapter]] in a solemn and official recognition of the Marian icon under that title. 

On 21 April 1866, the Redemptorist Superior General gave one of the first copies of the icon to [[Pope Pius IX]]. This copy is preserved in the chapel of the Redemptorists' Generalate in Rome. The original icon remains under the care of the Redemptorist Fathers at the Church of St. Alphonsus with the latest restoration of the icon having taken place in 1990.&lt;ref name="The History of the Icon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssr.com/english/whoarewe/iconstory.shtml |title=The History of the Icon |publisher=Cssr.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Antesrestaur.png|thumb|250px|Photograph of the icon prior to its restoration in 1866.]]

In 1866, the icon underwent restoration by the Polish painter Leopold Nowotny (1822-1870).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cssr.com/english/whoarewe/iconstory.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the icon was taken down from its altar for new photography and image restoration commissioned by the General Government of Redemptorists. The Redemptorist Order entered into contract with the Technical Department at the [[Vatican Museum]] to restore the icon and prevent further fungal damage to the icon. The restoration process involved [[X-ray]], [[infra-red]] scanning, technical analysis of the paint and [[ultra-violet]] testing along with a [[Carbon Dating|Carbon-14-test]] which placed the icon between the year 1325-1480. Artistic analysis of the icon revealed that the facial structure of the icon was altered due to previous overpainting, resulting in a combination of "oriental and occidental" features of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssr.com/english/whoarewe/iconstory.shtml |title=Official Website of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer. Superior General, Michael Brehl, C.SsR. - Latest Restoration of the Icon |publisher=Cssr.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
Our Lady of Perpetual Help has been venerated across many cultures and thus bears several titles in different languages, such as "Mother of Perpetual Succour", ''Mutter von immerwährenden Hilfe'', ''Nuestra Señora del Perpetuo Socorro'', ''Notre-Dame du Perpétuel Secours'', ''Mater del Perpetuo Succursu'', and ''Ina ng Laging Saklolo''. 

===United States of America===
In 1878, the [[Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] obtained a certified copy of the icon being the first in the [[United States]]. Between 1927 and 1935, the first American novena service dedicated to the icon was recited in [[St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, St. Louis|Saint Alphonsus "The Rock" church]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and various other Redemptorist stations around the United States.

===The Philippines===
[[File:NationalShrineofOurMotherofPerpetualHelpjf9967 07.JPG|thumb|The National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help (also called [[Baclaran Church]]) is one of the Philippines' largest Marian shrines. It is authorised by the [[Holy See]] to remain open 24 hours a day throughout the year.]]

Our Lady of Perpetual Help is widely venerated by [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Filipino Catholics]] and [[Overseas Filipino]] communities. A German copy of the icon is venerated in the [[National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help]] in [[Baclaran, Parañaque City]], [[Metro Manila]] – the country's centre of devotion to the icon. Pope [[John Paul II]] once said Mass at the shrine as [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and later prayed before the icon during his first pastoral visit to the country in February 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1981/february/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19810217_manila-baclaran_en.html |title=Vatican website: Pope John Paul II in the Philippines |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1981-02-17 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all Catholic churches and chapels in the Philippines have a replica of the icon, often enshrined in a [[Bye-altar|side altar]]. Copies of the icon can also be found in countless houses, businesses, and even public utility vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Customs-Philippines-Cultures-World/dp/0313304157 Culture and Customs of the Philippines (Cultures and Customs of the World)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Relations-Between-Religions-Cultures-Southeast/dp/1565182502/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503193741&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Relations+between+religions+and+cultures+in+Southeast+Asia Relations Between Religions and Cultures in Southeast Asia: Indonesian Philosophical Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Wednesday, many congregations hold services where they publicly recite the [[rosary]] and [[Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help|the icon's associated novena]], along with a priest delivering [[Benediction]] and celebrating a [[votive Mass]] in its honour. Devotees today still use the same Novena booklet first published by [[Ireland|Irish]] Redemptorists, who introduced the icon and its devotion to the Philippines in the early 1900s. The Filipino Diaspora continue keeping the Wednesday Novena, holding novena services in their respective parishes overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Asian-American-Religions-Boundaries-Ethnicity/dp/081471630X Asian American Religions: The Making and Remaking of Borders and Boundaries (Religion, Race, and Ethnicity) ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Religion-Corner-Bliss-Nirvana-Communities/dp/0822345471/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503193875&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Religion+at+the+corner+of+bliss+and+nirvana+Lois+Ann+Lorentzen Religion at the Corner of Bliss and Nirvana: Politics, Identity, and Faith in New Migrant Communities]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Saint John the Baptist Parish, [[Garcia Hernandez, Bohol]], the feast of the image is held on April 27 instead of the usual liturgical date. The 48 sub-chapels in the parish participate in the annual feast, while every 27th month has each chapel's respective congregations holding a procession of the icon. This form of the devotion began in 1923 when two missionary priests, a Dutchman named Thomas and a German named Jorge, brought the icon to the town. The original icon can still be seen in a chapel of the parish; its reverse bears a Latin inscription attesting to its dedication.

===Patronage===
The town of [[Almoradi]], [[Spain]] invokes the patronage of Our Mother of Perpetual Help. In 1918, the son of Marquis of Rioflorido, Jose Carlos fell ill with [[pleurisy]]. His mother, the noble lady Desamparado Fontes fed him a silk fabric cloth touched to the icon of Perpetual Help in Rome which resulted in an instantaneous healing later claimed to be miraculous. As a token of thanksgiving, the lady Fontes officially donated funds to begin the Confraternity of Almoradi. On 29 May 1919, Our Lady of Perpetual Help was officially enthroned in Saint Andrew's Parish as the official patroness of the town. In 1945, [[Pope Pius XII]] confirmed this patronage by a pontifical decree. On its 50th anniversary in 1969, a public coronation of this image was held and the crowns were made by [[Santo (art)|Santero]] artist ''Jose David'' by the town mayor and its authorities. 

In addition to this, Our Lady of Perpetual Help is the designated the national [[patron saint]] of [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/patrons-of-haiti/ |title=patrons of Haiti |publisher=Saints.sqpn.com |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman Catholic [[Bishop]] [[Guy Sansaricq]], former Haitian president [[Élie Lescot]] and his cabinet petitioned the [[Holy See]] to make Our Mother of Perpetual Help the national [[Patroness]] of Haiti in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netny.net/currents/video/stories/haitians-pray-for-perpetual-help-for-their-homeland-62911/ |title=Haitians pray for perpetual help for their homeland 6/29/11 : Currents |publisher=Netny.net |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2014-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721114632/http://netny.net/currents/video/stories/haitians-pray-for-perpetual-help-for-their-homeland-62911/ |archivedate=July 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Haitians credit the Virgin Mary under this title in performing miracles to prevent a [[cholera]] and [[smallpox]] outbreak which ravaged the country in 1882. The Holy See approved the request for patronage under the Pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]]. The Our Lady of Perpetual Help is also present in numerous Haitian public stamps used by the Haitian postal office. In January 2010, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] invoked Our Lady of Perpetual Help for Haiti's earthquake relief through Archbishop Louis Kébreau.

Our Lady of Perpetual Help is also the patroness of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina|Diocese of Salina]], Kansas in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://salinadiocese.org/home/about-us/salina-arms|title=Salina Arms|website=salinadiocese.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Middlesbrough|Diocese of Middlesbrough]] in England, and of the Catholic Diocese of Issele-Uku in Nigeria.

'''Poe divination''' ({{zh|t=掷筊|p=zhì jiǎo|l=throwing poe}}, also called as "bwa bwei", "cast moon blocks") is a traditional [[Culture of China|Chinese]] [[divination]] method, in which the divination seeker throws or drops two little wooden pieces on the floor and gets the divine answer by the positions of the pieces whether the future course being contemplated is recommended or not. The pieces, called "Poe" (Bwei) in [[Taiwanese language (disambiguation)|Taiwanese]] or [[Jiaobei]] in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], look somewhat like two shells of a [[Bivalvia|clam]] or bivalve mollusk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=t5WuKcnQn3gIW6S4g1lOvDmCpFQoZcxauvgqCt9Mp3gfv105aGgSoc0YJSw05QmL Poe Divination (Baidu Encyclopedia)] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%83%9D%E3%82%A8 Poe (Kotobank)] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe divination can be observed at [[Taoist]] temples, such as [[Guan Yu#Worship in Taoism|Guangdi temples]] and [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu temples]], not only in [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], but also in the rest of the world.

'''Rabban Bar Ṣawma''' ({{abbr|c.|circa}} 1220–1294) ([[Syriac language]]: {{lang|syc|ܪܒܢ ܒܪ ܨܘܡܐ}}; {{IPA-syr|rɑbbɑn bɑrsˤɑwma}}), also known as '''Rabban Ṣawma''' or '''Rabban Çauma''',&lt;ref name=mantran&gt;Mantran, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh|c=拉賓掃務瑪|p=lābīn sǎowùmǎ}}), was a Turkic Chinese monk turned diplomat of the "Nestorian" [[Church of the East in China]]. He is known for embarking on a pilgrimage from [[Yuan dynasty|Mongol-controlled China]] to [[Jerusalem]] with one of his students, Rabban Markos. Due to military unrest along the way, they never reached their destination, but instead spent many years in [[Ilkhanate]]-controlled [[Baghdad]].

The younger Markos was eventually elected [[Yahballaha III]], [[Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch of the Church of the East]] and later suggested his teacher Rabban Bar Ṣawma be sent on another mission, as Mongol ambassador to Europe. The elderly monk met with many of the European monarchs, as well as the Pope, in attempts to arrange a [[Franco-Mongol alliance]]. The mission bore no fruit, but in his later years in Baghdad, Rabban Bar Ṣawma documented his lifetime of travel. His written account of his journeys is of unique interest to modern historians, as it gives a picture of [[medieval Europe]] at the close of the [[Crusades]], painted by a keenly-intelligent, broadminded, and statesmanlike observer.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rabban Bar Sauma |volume=22 |page=767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bar Ṣawma's travels occurred prior to the return of [[Marco Polo]] to Europe, and his writings give a reverse viewpoint, of the East looking to the West.

Rabban ("Master") Bar Ṣawma was born c. 1220 in or near modern-day [[Beijing]], known then as [[Zhongdu]],&lt;ref name="encyclopedia britannica raban bar sauma"&gt;Kathleen Kuiper &amp; editors of Encyclopædia Britannica (Aug 31, 2006).

Accessed 6 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; later as [[Khanbaliq]] under Mongol rule. According to [[Bar Hebraeus]] he was of [[History of the Uyghur people|Uyghur origin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Thomas Francis|authorlink=Thomas Francis Carter|title=The invention of printing in China and its spread westward|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZRFAAAAMAAJ|year=1955|publisher=Ronald Press Co.|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese accounts describe his heritage as [[Ongud|Öngüd]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]] classified as members of the "Mongol" caste under Yuan law.&lt;ref&gt;Moule, A.

He was a follower of the "[[Church of the East|Nestorian]]" faith (see: [[Church of the East in China]]), and became an ascetic monk around the age of 20 and then a religious teacher for decades.

==Pilgrimage to Jerusalem==
In his middle age, Rabban Bar Sauma and one of his younger students, Rabban Markos, embarked on a journey from Yuan China to make pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA377 |title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=376|pages=|accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They travelled by way of the former [[Tangut people|Tangut]] country, [[Khotan]], [[Kashgar]], [[Taraz]] in the [[Syr Darya]] valley, [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (now [[Afghanistan]]), [[Maragha]] (now [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]]) and [[Mosul]], arriving at [[Ani]] in the [[Kingdom of Georgia]]. Warnings of danger on the routes to southern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] turned them from their purpose,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and they traveled to Mongol-controlled Persia, the [[Ilkhanate]], where they were welcomed by Patriarch [[Denha I]] of the Church of the East. The Patriarch requested the two monks to visit the court of the Mongol Ilkhanate ruler [[Abaqa Khan]], in order to obtain confirmation letters for Mar Denha's ordination as Patriarch in 1266.  During the journey, Rabban Markos was declared a "Nestorian" bishop. The Patriarch then attempted to send the monks as messengers back to China, but military conflict along the route delayed their departure, and they remained in Baghdad. When the Patriarch died, Rabban Markos was elected as his replacement, Yaballaha III, in 1281.  The two monks traveled to [[Maragheh]] to have the selection confirmed by Abaqa, but the Ilkhanate khan died before their arrival, and was succeeded by his son, [[Arghun]].

[[Image:RabbanBarSauma.svg|thumb|120px|Chinese characters representing "Rabban Ṣawma"]]
It was Arghun's desire to form a strategic Franco-Mongol alliance with the Christian Europeans against their common enemy, the Muslim [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate at Cairo]].  A few years later, the new patriarch Yaballaha III suggested his former teacher Rabban Bar Ṣawma for the embassy, to meet with the [[Pope]] and the European monarchs.

==Ambassador to Europe==
{{further information|Europeans in Medieval China}}
In 1287, the elderly Bar Sauma embarked on his journey to Europe, bearing gifts and letters from Arghun to the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] emperor, the Pope, and the European kings.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He followed the embassy of another "[[Church of the East|Nestorian]]", [[Isa Kelemechi]], sent by Arghun to [[Pope Honorius IV]], in 1285.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7FLUMVIqIvwC&amp;pg=PA169 ''The Mongols and the West, 1221-1410'' Peter Jackson p.169]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BxRwJUrnr20C&amp;pg=PA370 ''The Cambridge history of Iran'' William Bayne Fisher, John Andrew Boyle p.370]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabban Bar Sauma traveled with a large retinue of assistants, and 30 riding animals. Companions included the Church of the East Christian (''archaon'') Sabadinus; Thomas de Anfusis or Tommaso d'Anfossi),&lt;ref name="Rossabi2014 1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris Rossabi|title=From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia: The Writings of Morris Rossabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXejBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387 |date=28 November 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28529-3|pages=387–}}&lt;/ref&gt; who helped as interpreter and was also a member of a famous [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] banking company;&lt;ref name=phillips-102&gt;Phillips, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; and an Italian interpreter named Uguetus or Ugeto (Ughetto).&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, p.845&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossabi, pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; Bar Sauma likely did not speak any European languages, though he was known to be fluent in Chinese, Turkish, and Persian.&lt;ref name="Rossabi2014 2"&gt;{{cite book

He traveled overland through Armenia to the [[Empire of Trebizond]] or through the [[Sultanate of Rum]] to the [[Samsun|Simisso]]&lt;ref&gt;Zehiroğlu, Ahmet M. (2014) [https://www.academia.edu/11320426/Bar_Saumas_Black_Sea_Journey_1287_ Bar Sauma's Black Sea Journey]&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Black Sea]], then by boat to [[Constantinople]], where he had an audience with [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]]. Bar Sauma's writings give a particularly enthusiastic description of the beautiful [[Hagia Sophia]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He next travelled to Italy, again journeying by ship.  As their course took them past the island of [[Sicily]], he witnessed and recorded the great eruption of [[Mount Etna]] on June 18, 1287. A few days after his arrival, he also witnessed a naval battle in the [[Bay of Sorrento]] on [[John the Baptist|St. John's Day]], June 24, 1287, during the conflict of the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. The battle was between the fleet of [[Charles II of Naples|Charles II]] (whom he calls "Irid Shardalo", i.e. "Il re Charles Due"), who had welcomed him in his realm, and [[James II of Aragon]], king of [[Sicily]] (whom he calls ''Irid Arkon'', i.e. "Il re de Aragon"). According to Bar Sauma, James II was victorious, and his forces killed 12,000 men.

He next travelled to [[Rome]], but too late to meet Pope [[Honorius IV]], who had recently died.  So Bar Sauma instead engaged in negotiations with the [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and visited [[St. Peter's Basilica]].

Bar Sauma next made stops in [[Tuscany]] (''Thuzkan'') and the [[Republic of Genoa]], on his way to [[Paris]]. He spent the winter of 1287–1288 in Genoa, a famous banking capital.&lt;ref name=phillips-102/&gt; In France (''Frangestan''), he spent one month with King [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who seemingly responded positively to the arrival of the Mongol embassy, gave him numerous presents, and sent one of his noblemen, [[Gobert de Helleville]], to accompany Bar Sauma back to Mongol lands. Gobert de Helleville departed on February 2, 1288, with two clercs Robert de Senlis and Guillaume de Bruyères, as well as ''arbaletier'' (crossbowman) Audin de Bourges. They joined Bar Sauma when he later returned through Rome, and accompanied him back to Persia.&lt;ref&gt;"Histoires des Croisades III", Rene Grousset&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gascony]] in southern France, which at that time was in English hands, Bar Sauma met King [[Edward I of England]], probably in the capital of [[Bordeaux]]. Edward responded enthusiastically to the embassy, but ultimately proved unable to join a military alliance due to conflict at home, especially with the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scots]].

Upon returning to Rome, Bar Sauma was cordially received by the newly elected [[Pope Nicholas IV]], who gave him communion on [[Palm Sunday]], 1288, allowing him to celebrate his own [[Eucharist]] in the capital of Latin Christianity.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  Nicholas commissioned Bar Sauma to visit the Christians of the East, and entrusted to him a precious tiara to be presented to Mar Yaballaha &lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;(Rabban Bar Sauma's former student, Markos). Bar Sauma then returned to Baghdad in 1288, carrying messages and many other gifts from the various European leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, in Camb. Hist. Iran V, pp. 370-71; Budge, pp. 165-97. [http://www.encyclopediairanica.com/articles/v10f2/v10f216a.html Source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404215845/http://www.encyclopediairanica.com/articles/v10f2/v10f216a.html |date=2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The delivered letters were in turn answered by Arghun in 1289, forwarded by the Genoese merchant [[Buscarello de Ghizolfi]], a diplomatic agent for the Il-khans.  In the letter to Philip IV, Arghun mentions Bar Sauma:&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica [http://www.encyclopediairanica.com/articles/v10f2/v10f216a.html Source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404215845/http://www.encyclopediairanica.com/articles/v10f2/v10f216a.html |date=2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ArghunLetterToPhilippeLeBelExtract1289.jpg|thumb|Extract of the letter of Arghun to Philip IV, in the [[Uyghur-Mongolian script]], dated 1289, in which Rabban Bar Sauma is mentioned.

{{quote|"Under the power of the eternal sky, the message of the great king, Arghun, to the king of France..., said: I have accepted the word that you forwarded by the messengers under Saymer Sagura (Rabban Bar Sauma), saying that if the warriors of Il Khaan invade Egypt you would support them. We would also lend our support by going there at the end of the Tiger year’s winter [1290], worshiping the sky, and settle in Damascus in the early spring [1291].

If you send your warriors as promised and conquer Egypt, worshiping the sky, then I shall give you Jerusalem. If any of our warriors arrive later than arranged, all will be futile and no one will benefit. If you care to please give me your impressions, and I would also be very willing to accept any samples of French opulence that you care to burden your messengers with.

I send this to you by Myckeril and say: All will be known by the power of the sky and the greatness of kings. This letter was scribed on the sixth of the early summer in the year of the Ox at Ho’ndlon."|France royal archives&lt;ref&gt;[http://chass.colostate-pueblo.edu/history/seminar/sauma/saumaletter.htm Source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618170019/http://chass.colostate-pueblo.edu/history/seminar/sauma/saumaletter.htm |date=2008-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The exchanges towards the formation of an alliance with the Europeans ultimately proved fruitless, and Arghun's attempts were eventually abandoned.&lt;ref name=mantran/&gt; However, Rabban Bar Sauma did succeed in making some important contacts which encouraged communication and trade between the East and West.  Aside from King Philip's embassy to the Mongols, the Papacy also sent missionaries such as [[Giovanni da Montecorvino]] to the Mongol court.

==Later years==
After his embassy to Europe, Bar Sauma lived out the rest of his years in Baghdad. It was probably during this time that he wrote the account of his travels, which was published in English in 1928 as ''The Monks of Kublai Khan, Emperor of China'' or ''The History of the Life and Travels of Rabban Sawma, Envoy and Plenipotentiary of the Mongol Khans to the Kings of Europe, and Markos Who as Mar Yahbh-Allaha III Became Patriarch of the [[Church of the East]] in Asia'', translated and edited by Sir [[E. A. Wallis Budge]].  The narrative is unique for its observations of medieval Europe during the end of the Crusading period, through the eyes of an observant outsider from a culture thousands of miles away.

Rabban Bar Sauma died in 1294, in Baghdad.

Religious observance and practice is generally lax and polls have shown that, compared to the populations of other countries, few Albanians consider religion to be a dominant factor in their lives. When asked about religion, people refer to their family's historical religious legacy and not to their own choice of faith. Being a secular country, people are free to choose to believe or not, and to change their faith. Religion is separated from the public sphere and citizens show strong support for secularism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.al.undp.org/content/dam/albania/docs/ALBANIA%20FINAL%20REPORT%2018.10.2017.pdf |title=NATIONAL LGBTI REPORT UNDP 2017 |website= |access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Amphitheatre of Butrint 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In the late Roman era, Christianity was preached in amphitheaters like this one in [[Butrint]] ]]
{{See also|Paleo-Balkanic religion}}[[Christianity]] spread to urban centers in the region of Albania, at the time composed mostly [[Epirus Nova]] and part of south [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], during the later period of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] invasion and reached the region relatively early. [[St. Paul]] preached the Gospel 'even unto Illyricum' (Romans 15:19). Schnabel asserts that Paul probably preached in [[Shkodra]] and [[Durrës]].&lt;ref&gt;Schnabel, Sckhard. ''Paul the Missionary: Realities, Strategies, and Methods.'' Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2008. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The steady growth of the Christian community in [[Dyrrhachium]] (the Roman name for Epidamnus) led to the creation of a local bishopric in 58 AD. Later, episcopal seats were established in [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]], Buthrotum (modern [[Butrint]]), and Scodra (modern [[Shkodra]]).

One notable Martyr was [[Saint Astius]], who was Bishop of [[Durrës|Dyrrachium]], who was crucified during the persecution of Christians by the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]]. Saint Eleutherius (not to be confused with the later Saint-Pope) was bishop of [[Messina]] and Illyria. He was martyred along with his mother Anthia the anti-Christian campaign of [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAtQZ0vjf5gC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=shen+lefter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o6FxFNkNiN&amp;sig=3Ih7tuivngZOPsGOtWJBLI4bCRs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw2Y7qyKrUAhUL5oMKHW8xCuQQ6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=shen%20lefter&amp;f=false |title=A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture |last=Elsie |first=Robert |date=2001 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-2214-5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the main language used to spread the Christian religion was Latin,&lt;ref&gt;Lloshi p.92&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the 4th to the 5th centuries it was [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Epirus]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] in [[Praevalitana]] and [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]].Christianity spread to the region during the 4th century. The following centuries saw the erection of characteristic examples of [[Byzantine architecture]] such as the churches in Kosine, Mborje and Apollonia.

Christian bishops from what would later become eastern Albania took part in the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. Arianism had at that point extended to Illyria, where Arius himself had been exiled to by [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kr-FWwruKa0C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Arianism+illyria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p0TZxDgqNu&amp;sig=FM2lv-BnzJiSC7rqb9AO7TAABkk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjct_Pn0arUAhXqyoMKHeJ7D-cQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=illyria&amp;f=false |title=Augustine and the Arians: The Bishop of Hippo's Encounters with Ulfilan Arianism |last=Sumruld |first=William A. |date=1994 |publisher=Associated University Presse |isbn=978-0-945636-46-5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Kisha e Manastirit Te Rubikut 08.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ruins of a 12th-century medieval Catholic Church in [[Rubik, Albania|Rubik]]]]
Since the early 4th century AD, Christianity had become the established religion in the [[Roman Empire]], supplanting pagan polytheism and eclipsing for the most part the humanistic world outlook and institutions inherited from the Greek and Roman civilizations. Ecclesiastical records during the Slavic invasions are slim. Though the country was in the fold of Byzantium, Christians in the region remained under the jurisdiction of the Roman pope until 732. In that year the iconoclast Byzantine emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], angered by archbishops of the region because they had supported Rome in the Iconoclastic Controversy, detached the church of the province from the Roman pope and placed it under the patriarch of Constantinople. When the [[East-West schism|Christian church split in 1054 between the East and Rome]], southern Albanian regions retained their ties to [[Constantinople]] while the northern areas reverted to the jurisdiction of Rome.

[[File:Labova e Kryqit3.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The 12th century Orthodox Church in [[Labova e Kryqit]].]]
The Albanians first appear in the historical record in [[Byzantine]] sources of the 11th century. At this point, they are already fully Christianized. Most Albanian regions belonged to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] after the schism, but regional Albanian populations gradually became Catholic to secure their independence from various Orthodox political entities&lt;ref name="Stavrianos2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Leften Stavros Stavrianos |title=The Balkans Since 1453 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcp7OXQE0FMC&amp;pg=PA497 |accessdate=17 July 2013 |date=January 2000 |publisher=C.

Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Krujë, however, became an important center for the spread of Catholicism. Its bishopric had been Catholic since 1167. It was under direct dependence from the pope and it was the pope himself who consecrated the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Lala (2008), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Local Albanian nobles maintained good relations with the Papacy. Its influence became so great, that it began to nominate local bishops. The Archbishopric of Durrës, one of the primary bishoprics in Albania had initially remained under the authority of Eastern Church after the split despite continuous, but fruitless efforts from the Roman church to convert it to the Latin rite.

==== After the Fourth Crusade ====
[[File:Palazzo Reale di Napoli - Carlo I d'Angiò.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Charles I established ''Regnum Albaniae'', officially Catholic]]
However, things changed after the [[Fourth Crusade|fall of Byzantine Empire in 1204]]. In 1208, a Catholic archdeacon was elected for the archbishopric of Durrës. After the reconquest of Durrës by the [[Despotate of Epirus]] in 1214, the Latin Archbishop of Durrës was replaced by an Orthodox archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;Lala (2008), p. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; According to Etleva Lala, on the edge of the Albanian line in the north was Prizren, which was also an Orthodox bishopric albeit with some Catholic parochial churches,&lt;ref&gt;''Acta Albaniae'' I, no 74&lt;/ref&gt; in 1372 received a Catholic bishop due to close relations between the Balsha family and the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Lala(2008). ''Regnum Albaniae''. Page 153: "the town of Prizren, which was also an Orthodox bishopric with some catholic parochial churches until then... received a real catholic bishop (1372) as a result of the good connections between Balsha and Rome"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kingdom of Albania.png|thumb|150px|right|Regnum Albaniae, the Kingdom of Albania]]
[[File:Ardenica Monastery (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|130px|left|[[Ardenica Monastery]], built by the Byzantines after a military victory]]
After the [[Fourth Crusade]], a new wave of Catholic dioceses, churches and monasteries were founded, a number of different religious orders began spreading into the country, and papal missionaries traversed its territories. Those who were not Catholic in Central and North Albania converted and a great number of Albanian clerics and monks were present in the Dalmatian Catholic institutions.&lt;ref name="Lala"&gt;Lala (2008), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the [[Regnum Albaniae|Kingdom of Albania]] in 1272, with links to and influence from [[Western Europe]], meant that a decidedly Catholic political structure had emerged, facilitating the further spread of Catholicism in the Balkans.&lt;ref name=Lala9195 /&gt; Durrës became again a Catholic archbishopric in 1272. Other territories of the Kingdom of Albania became Catholic centers as well. Butrint in the south, although dependent on Corfu, became Catholic and remained as such during 14th century. The bishopric of Vlore also converted immediately following the founding of the Kingdom of Albania.&lt;ref&gt;Lala (2008), p. 147-148&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during the rule of [[Helen of Anjou]], as Queen consort of the Serbian Kingdom, in North Albania and in Serbia.&lt;ref name=Lala9195&gt;Lala (2008), p. 91-95&lt;/ref&gt; New bishoprics were created especially in North Albania, with the help of Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Lala (2008) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; As Catholic power in the Balkans expanded with Albania as a stronghold, Catholic structures began appearing as far afield as Skopje (which was a mostly Serbian Orthodoxy city at the time&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Lala, Etleva. ''Regnum Albaniae''. Page 153&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1326, with the election of the local bishop there being presided upon by the Pope himself;&lt;ref&gt;Lala, Etleva. ''Regnum Albaniae''. Page 74&lt;/ref&gt; in the following year, 1327, Skopje sees a Dominican appointed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

However, in Durrës the Byzantine rite continued to exist for a while after Angevin conquest. This double-line of authority created some confusion in the local population and a contemporary visitor of the country described Albanians as ''nor they are entirely Catholic or entirely schismatic''. In order to fight this religious ambiguity, in 1304, [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were ordered by [[Pope Benedict XI]] to enter the country and to instruct the locals in the Latin rite. Dominican priests were also ordered as bishops in Vlorë and Butrint.&lt;ref&gt;Lala (2008), p. 149-153&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Yalens: expand with Lala, as she talks about how later the Catholic rulers came to tolerate their Orthodox subjects more--&gt;

In 1332 a Dominican priest reported that within the Kingdom of Rascia (Serbia) there were two Catholic peoples, the "Latins" and the "Albanians", who both had their own language. The former was limited to coastal towns while the latter was spread out over the countryside, and while the language of the Albanians was noted as quite different from Latin, both peoples are noted as writing with Latin letters. The author, an anonymous Dominican priest, writing in favor of a Western Catholic military action to expel Orthodox Serbia from areas of Albania it controlled in order to restore the power of the Catholic church there, argued that the Albanians and Latin and their clerics were suffering under the "extremely dire bondage of their odious Slav leaders whom they detest" and would eagerly support an expedition of " one thousand French knights and five or six thousand foot soldiers" who, with, their help, could throw off the rule of Rascia.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie, Robert. ''Texts and Documents of Albanian History''. [http://www.albanianhistory.net/1332_Making-the-Passage/index.html 1332 Anonymous: Initiative for Making the Passage]. "...it is inhabited by two peoples, i.e. the Albanians and the Latins who, in their beliefs, their rites and their obedience, both abide by the Roman Catholic Church... The Latins have six towns with bishops: firstly Antibarum (Bar), the seat of the archbishop, then Chatarensis (Kotor), Dulcedinensis (Ulcinj), Suacinensis (Shas) (2), Scutarensis (Shkodra) and Drivascensis (Drisht) (3), which are inhabited by the Latins alone. Outside the town walls, the Albanians make up the population throughout the diocese. There are four Albanian towns: Polatum Maius (Greater Pult) (4), Polatum Minus (Lesser Pult), Sabatensis (Sapa) (5) and Albanensis (Albanopolis) (6) which, together with the towns of the Latins, are all legally subject to the Archbishop of Bar and his church as their metropolitan. The Albanians indeed have a language quite different from Latin. However they use Latin letters in all their books (7). The sway of the Latins is thus confined to the limits of their towns. Outside the towns, they do possess vineyards and fields, but there are no fortifications or villages actually inhabited by the Latins. The Albanians for their part, the larger of the two peoples, could assemble over fifteen thousand horsemen for warfare according to the custom and manner of the country, who would be courageous and industrious warriors. Since the said Latins and Albanians suffer under the unbearable yoke and extremely dire bondage of their odious Slav leaders whom they detest – the people being tormented, the clergy humiliated and oppressed, the bishops and abbots often kept in chains, the nobles disinherited and held hostage, episcopal and other churches disbanded and deprived of their rights, and the monasteries in decay and ruin – they would all to a man believe that they were consecrating their hands in the blood of the aforementioned Slavs if a French prince were to appear... With the help of the aforementioned Albanians and Latins, one thousand French knights and five or six thousand foot soldiers could without a doubt easily conquer the whole length and breadth of this kingdom."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Serbian rulers at earlier times had at times relations with the Catholic West despite being Orthodox, as a counterbalance to Byzanitne power, and therefore tolerated the spread of Catholicism in their lands, under the reign of Stephan Dushan the Catholics were persecuted, as were also Orthodox bishops loyal to Constantinople. The Catholic rite was called ''Latin heresy'' and, angered in part by marriages of Serbian Orthodox with "half-believers" and the Catholic proselytization of Serbians, [[Dušan's Code|Dushan's code, the ''Zakonik'']] contained harsh measures against them.&lt;ref&gt;Lala, Etleva. ''Regnum Albaniae''. Page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the persecutions of local Catholics did not begin in 1349 when the Code was declared in Skopje, but much earlier, at least since the beginning of 14th century. Under these circumstances the relations between local Catholic Albanians and the papal curia became very close, while the previously friendly relations between local Catholics and Serbians deteriorated significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Lala (2008), p. 118-119: "...called the Catholic rite the 'Latin heresy', the good relations between the local Catholic population and the Serbs came to an end... In this situation the good relations between the papacy and Catholic Albanians became very tight"&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1350 and 1370, the spread of Catholicism in Albania reached its peak. At that period there were around seventeen Catholic bishoprics in the country, which acted not only as centers for Catholic reform within Albania, but also as centers for missionary activity in the neighboring areas, with the permission of the pope.&lt;ref name="Lala" /&gt; At the end of the 14th century, the previously Orthodox Autocephalous Archbishopric of Ohrid was dismantled in favor of the Catholic rite.&lt;ref name=LalaOhrid&gt;Lala, Etleva. ''Regnum Albaniae''. Page 153: "at the end of the fourteenth century, there was a dismantling of the autocephalous archbishopric of Ochrid in favor of the Catholic rite"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
{{Main|Islamization of Albania}}
[[File:Scanderbeg young.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, an Albanian noble who converted to Islam while a boy in the Ottoman court, then converted again to Christianity as he launched a resistance against the Ottomans that lasted decades]]
[[File:Holy Mary holding Baby Jesus in her right arm, c. 1500.jpg|thumb|140px|Fresco from 16th century Berat]]
Christianity was later overshadowed by [[Islam]], which became the predominant religion during the invasion from the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the 15th century until the year 1912. Many Albanians embraced Islam in different ways.

Albania differs from other regions in the [[Balkans]] in that the peak of [[Islamization of Albania|Islamization in Albania]] occurred much later: 16th century Ottoman census data showed that sanjaks where Albanians lived remained overwhelmingly Christian with Muslims making up no more than 5% in most areas ([[Lake Ohrid|Ohrid]] 1.9%, [[Shkodra]] 4.5%, [[Prizren]] 1.9%, [[Elbasan]] 5.5%, [[Vlora]] 1.8%, [[Dukagjin highlands|Dukagjin]] 0%) while during this period Muslims had already risen to large proportions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] (Bosnia 46%, Herzegovina 43%, urban Sarajevo 100%), Northern [[Greece]] ([[Trikala]] 17.5%), [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] ([[Skopje]] and [[Bitola]] both at 75%) and Eastern [[Bulgaria]] ([[Silistra]] 72%, [[Ormenio|Chirmen]] 88%, [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] 22%). Later on, in the 19th century, when the process of Islamization had halted in most of the Balkans and some Balkan Christian peoples like [[Greeks]] and [[Serbs]] had already claimed independence, Islamization continued to make significant progress in Albania, especially in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anton Minkov |title=Conversion to Islam in the Balkans |pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rule, Ottoman rule largely tolerated Christian subjects but it also discriminated against them, turning them into second-class citizens with much higher taxes and various legal restrictions like being unable to take Muslims to court, have horses, have weapons, or have houses overlooking those of Muslims. While Catholicism was chronically held in suspicion by Ottoman authorities, after the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]], the Ottomans largely allowed the Orthodox church to function unhindered, except during periods when the church was considered politically suspect and thus suppressed with expulsions of bishops and seizure of property and revenues. Conversion during Ottoman times was variously due to calculated attempts to improve social and economic status, due to the successful proselytizing by missionaries, or done out of desperation in very difficult times; in the latter case, the converts often practiced [[crypto-Christianity]] for long periods. During the Ottoman period, most Christians as well as most Muslims employed a degree of syncretism, still practicing various pagan rites; many of these rites are best preserved among mystical orders like the Bektashi.&lt;ref&gt;Vryonis, Spyros. ''Religious Changes and Patterns in the Balkans, 14th–16th centuries''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some other areas of the Balkans, such as [[Bulgaria]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], for the first couple centuries of Ottoman rule, up until the 1500s, Islam remained confined to members of the co-opted aristocracy and a couple scattered military settlements of [[Yuruks]] from [[Anatolia]], while the native Albanian peasantry remained overwhelmingly Christian.&lt;ref name="Zhelyaz"&gt;Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‘’Albanian Identities’’. Sofia, 2000: International Center for Minority Studies and Intercultural Relations.

Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1594, the Pope incited a failed rebellion among Catholic Albanians in the North, promising help from [[Spain]]. However the assistance did not come, and when the rebellion was crushed in 1596, Ottoman repression and heavy pressures to convert to Islam were implemented to punish the rebels.&lt;ref name="Zhelyaz" /&gt;

Between 1500 and 1800, impressive ecclesiastical art flourished across Southern Albania. In [[Moscopole]] there were over 23 churches during the city's period of prosperity in the mid 18th century.&lt;ref name="Winnifrith"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winnifrith |first=Tom |title=Badlands, Borderlands A History of Northern Epirus-Southern Albania |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dkRoAAAAMAAJ |year=2002 |publisher=Gerald Duckworth, Limited |isbn=978-0-7156-3201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Byzantine architectural style is prevalent in the region, e.g. in [[Vithkuq]], Labove, [[Mesopotam]], [[Dropull]].&lt;ref name="Ruches 1965"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruches |first=Pyrrhus J. |title=Albania's Captives |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2k9pAAAAMAAJ |year=1965 |publisher=Argonaut |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramadan Marmullaku noted that, in the 1600s, the Ottomans organized a concerted campaign of Islamization that was not typically applied elsewhere in the Balkans, in order to ensure the loyalty of the rebellious Albanian population.&lt;ref name="Bieber" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marmullaku, ‘’Albania and the Albanians’’. London: C. Hurst &amp; co., 1975. Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were certain instances of violently forced conversion, usually this was achieved through debatably coercive economic incentives – in particular, the head tax on Christians was drastically increased.&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich, Barbara. ‘’History of the Balkans.’’ Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983. Pages 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; While the tax levied on Albanian Christians in the 1500s amounted to about 45 akçes, in the mid-1600s, it was 780 akçes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‘’Albanian Identities’’. Page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion to Islam here was also aided by the dire state of the Catholic church in the period— in the entirety of Albania, there were only 130 Catholic priests, many of these poorly educated.&lt;ref name="ElsieCatholics"&gt;Elsie, Robert. ‘’The Historical Dictionary of Albania, Second Edition’’. Lanham, 2010: The Scarecrow Press, Inc. Page 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, many Christian Albanians fled into the mountains to found new villages like [[Theth]], or to other countries where they contributed to the emergence of [[Arvanites]], [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]], and [[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]] communities in Greece, [[Italy]], and [[Croatia]]. While in the first decade of the 17th century, Central and Northern Albania remained firmly Catholic (according to Vatican reports, Muslims were no more than 10% in Northern Albania&lt;ref&gt;Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‘’Albanian Identities’’. Page 21&lt;/ref&gt;), by the middle of the 17th century, 30–50% of Northern Albania had converted to Islam, while by 1634 most of [[Kosovo]] had also converted.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie, Robert. ‘’Historical Dictionary of Albania’’. Pages 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw the emergence of [[Albanian literature]], written by Christians such as [[Pjetër Bogdani]]. Some of these Christian Albanian thinkers, like Bogdani himself, ultimately advocated for an Albania outside of Ottoman control, and at the end of the 17th century, Bogdani and his colleague Raspasani, raised an army of thousands of [[Kosovar Albanians]] in support of the [[Austrians]] in the [[Great Turkish War]]. However, when this effort failed to expel Ottoman rule from the area yet again, many of Kosovo's Catholics fled to [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel (1998). ‘’Kosovo: a short history’’. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1700, the Papacy passed to [[Pope Clement XI]], who was himself of Albanian-Italian origins and held great interest in the welfare of his Catholic Albanian kinsmen, known for composing the [[Illyricum sacrum]]. In 1703 he convened the Albanian Council (''Kuvendi i Arbënit'') in order to organize methods to prevent further apostacy in Albania, and preserve the existence of Catholicism in the land.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie, Roberts. ''Historical Dictionary of Albania''. Page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread survival of Catholicism in northern Albania is largely attributable to the activity of the Franciscan order in the area&lt;ref name="ElsieCatholics" /&gt;

In addition to Catholicism and Sunni Islam, there were pockets of Orthodox (some of whom had converted from Catholicism) in [[Kavajë]], [[Durrës]], [[Upper Reka]] and some other regions, while Bektashis became established in [[Kruja]], [[Lumë|Luma]], [[Bulqiza]], [[Tetovo|Tetova]], and [[Gjakova]]. Especially in the [[Albanian tribes|tribal regions]] of the North, religious differences were often mitigated by common cultural and tribal characteristics, as well as knowledge of family lineages connecting Albanian Christians and Albanian Muslims. In the 17th century, although many of the rebellions of the century were at least in part motivated by Christian sentiment, it was noted that many Albanian Muslims also took part, and that, despising Ottoman rule no less than their Christian brethren, Albanian Muslims would revolt eagerly if only given the slightest assistance from the Catholic West.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Christianity and Islam in the South under Ottoman Rule ===

[[File:Albania church mosque.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Rural church and mosque]]
In the late 17th and 18th centuries, especially after numerous rebellions including during the [[Great Turkish War]] and subsequent clashes with Orthodox Russia, Ottoman rulers also made concerted efforts to convert the Orthodox Albanians of Southern and Central Albania (as well as neighboring regions of Greece and Macedonia).&lt;ref name="IsufiChams"&gt;Isufi, Hajredin (2004). "Aspects of Islamization in Çamëri". ‘’Historical Studies’’ (in Albanian). Tirana, Albania: Institute of History. ‘’’3’’’ (4) : 17–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giakoumis"&gt;Giakoumis, Kosta (2010). "The Orthodox Church in Albania Under the Ottoman Rule , 15th- 19th Century". In Rathberger A. [ed.] (2010), ‘’Religion und Kultur im albanischschprachen sudosteuropen’’. Page 8-11&lt;/ref&gt; Like in the North, conversion was achieved through a diverse motley of violent, coercive&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Oliver Jens. ‘’Religion und Kultur im albanischsprachigen Südosteuropen. Page 86: "In 1739, twenty-five villages in Thesprotia were forced to convert to Islam en masse&lt;/ref&gt; and non-coercive means, but raised taxes were the main factor. Nevertheless, there were specific local cases: in Vlora and the surrounding region, the Christians converted en masse once the area was recaptured from the Christian forces in 1590, because they feared violent retribution for their collaboration.&lt;ref name="Giakoumis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arno E (1935). "Venezia e l’Albania", ‘’Rassegna Italiana’’, version 14. Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In Labëri, meanwhile, mass conversion took place during a famine in which the bishop of Himara and Delvina was said to have forbidden the people from breaking the fast and consuming milk under threat of interminable hell. Across Orthodox regions of Albania, conversion was also helped by the presence of [[List of Christian heresies|heresies]] like [[Arianism]] and the fact that much of the Orthodox clergy was illiterate, corrupt, and conducted sermons in Greek, a foreign language, as well as the poverty of the Orthodox church.&lt;ref name="Giakoumis" /&gt; The clergy, largely from the Bosphorus, was distant from its Albanian flocks and also corrupt as well, abusing church tax collection and exacting a heavy tax regime that aggregated on top of punitive taxes imposed directly by the Ottoman state on the rebellious Albanian Christian population aimed at sparking their conversion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Orthodox areas further north, such as those around Elbasan, were first to convert, during the 1700s, passing through a stage of Crypto-Christianity&lt;ref&gt;Çarçani, Leonard (2007). ‘’Besimet Fetare në Prefekturen e Elbasanit’’. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; although in these regions scattered Orthodox holdouts remained (such as around Berat, in Zavalina, and the quite large region of Myzeqe including [[Fier]] and [[Lushnjë]]) as well as continuing Crypto-Christianity around the region of Shpati among others, where Crypto-Christians formally reverted to Orthodoxy in 1897.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Further south, progress was slower. The region of Gjirokastra did not become majority Muslim until around 1875, and even then most Muslims were concentrated in the city of Gjirokastra itself.&lt;ref name="Giakoumis" /&gt; The same trajectory was true of Albanians in Chamëria, with the majority of [[Cham Albanians]] remaining Orthodox until around 1875— at which point Ottoman rule in the Balkans was already collapsing and many Christian Balkan states had already claimed independence (Greece, Serbia, Romania).&lt;ref name="IsufiChams" /&gt;

At the end of the Ottoman period, Sunni Islam held a slight majority (or plurality) in the Albanian territories. Catholicism still prevailed in the Northwestern regions surrounding Lezha and Shkodra, as well as a few pockets in Kosovo in and around Gjakova, Peja, Vitina, Prizren and Klina. Orthodoxy remained prevalent in various pockets of Southern and Central Albania (Myzeqeja, Zavalina, Shpati as well as large parts of what are now the counties of Vlora, Gjirokastra and Korca). The syncretic Bektashi sect, meanwhile, gained adherence across large parts of the South, especially Skrapari and Dishnica where it is the overwhelming majority. This four-way division of Albanians between Sunnis (who became either a plurality or a majority), Orthodox, Bektashis and Catholics, with the later emergence of Albanian Uniates, Protestants and atheists, prevented Albanian nationalism as it emerged from tying itself to any particular faith, instead promoting harmony between the different confessions and using the shared Albanian language, Albanian history and Albanian ethnic customs as unifying themes. Despite this, Bektashi tekkes in the South and Catholic churches in the North were both used by the nationalist movement as places of dissemination of nationalist ideals.

{{See also|Secularism in Albania}}During the 20th century after Independence (1912) the [[democracy|democratic]], [[monarchy|monarchic]] and later the [[totalitarian state|totalitarian]] regimes followed a systematic [[State atheism|dereligionization]] of the nation and the national culture. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom after its restoration in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stavro |last=Skendi |authorlink=Stavro Skendi |title=Albania |publisher=Frederick A.

=== Monarchy ===
[[File:Fan Noli 1939.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Bishop [[Fan Noli]], founded the [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania]] ]]
Originally under the monarchy, institutions of all confessions were put under state control. In 1923, following the government program, the Albanian Muslim congress convened at [[Tirana]] decided to break with the [[Caliphate]], established a new form of prayer (standing, instead of the traditional salah ritual), banished polygamy and did away with the mandatory use of veil (hijab) by women in public, which had been forced on the urban population by the Ottomans during the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727115,00.html |title=Albania |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=14 April 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the Albanian Orthodox Church was declared autocephalous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,881789,00.html |title=Swiss Laws, Greek Patriarch |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=15 April 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, in 1930, the first official religious census was carried out. Reiterating conventional Ottoman data from a century earlier which previously covered double the new state's territory and population, 50% of the population was grouped as Sunni Muslim, 20% as Orthodox Christian, 20% as Bektashi Muslim and 10% as Catholic Christian.

The monarchy was determined that religion should no longer be a foreign-oriented master dividing the Albanians, but a nationalized servant uniting them. It was at this time that newspaper editorials began to disparage the almost universal adoption of Muslim and Christian names, suggesting instead that children be given neutral Albanian names.

Official slogans began to appear everywhere. "Religion separates, patriotism unites." "We are no longer Muslim, Orthodox, Catholic, we are all Albanians." "Our religion is Albanism." The national hymn characterized neither Muhammad nor Jesus Christ, but King Zogu as "Shpëtimtari i Atdheut" (Savior of the Fatherland). The hymn to the flag honored the soldier dying for his country as a "Saint." Increasingly the [[mosque]] and the church were expected to function as servants of the state, the patriotic clergy of all faiths preaching the gospel of Albanism.

Monarchy stipulated that the state should be neutral, with no official religion and that the free exercise of religion should be extended to all faiths. Neither in government nor in the school system should favor be shown to any one faith over another. Albanism was substituted for religion, and officials and schoolteachers were called "apostles" and "missionaries." Albania's sacred symbols were no longer the cross and the crescent, but the Flag and the King. Hymns idealizing the nation, Skanderbeg, war heroes, the king and the flag predominated in public-school music classes to the exclusion of virtually every other theme.

The first reading lesson in elementary schools introduced a patriotic catechism beginning with this sentence, "I am an Albanian. My country is Albania." Then there follows in poetic form, "But man himself, what does he love in life?" "He loves his country." "Where does he live with hope? Where does he want to die?" "In his country." "Where may he be happy, and live with honor?" "In Albania."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edwin |last=Jacques |title=The Albanians, an ethnic history from prehistoric times to the present}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italian occupation ===
On 7 April 1939, [[Italian invasion of Albania|Albania was invaded]] by Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]], which had long taken an interest in gaining dominance over Albania as an Italian sphere of influence during the interwar period.&lt;ref name="Fischer52125"&gt;{{harvnb|Fischer|1999|pp=5, 21–25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians attempted to win the sympathies of the Muslim Albanian population by proposing to build a large mosque in Rome, though the Vatican opposed this measure and nothing came of it in the end.&lt;ref name="Fischer5258"&gt;{{harvnb|Fischer|1999|pp=52–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian occupiers also won Muslim Albanian sympathies by causing their working wages to rise.&lt;ref name="Fischer5258" /&gt; Mussolini's son-in-law [[Count Ciano]] also replaced the leadership of the Sunni Muslim community, which had recognized the Italian regime in Albania, with clergy that aligned with Italian interests, with a compliant "Moslem Committee" organization, and Fischer notes that "the Moslem community at large accepted this change with little complaint".&lt;ref name="Fischer5258" /&gt; Most of the Bektashi order and its leadership were against the Italian occupation and remained an opposition group.&lt;ref name="Fischer5258" /&gt; Fischer suspects that the Italians eventually tired of the opposition of the Bektashi Order, and had its head, Nijaz Deda, murdered.&lt;ref name="Fischer5258" /&gt;

The Albanian Orthodox hierarchy also acquiesced in the occupation, according to Fischer. The primate of the church, [[Christopher of Albania|Archibishop Kisi]], along with three other bishops, expressed formal approval of the Italian invasion in 1939.  Metropolitan [[Visarion Xhuvani]] was part of the delegation which carried the Albanian throne to [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emanuel III]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Fischer5258" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://shqiptarja.com/kulture/2730/patriot--apo-tradh-tar----209564.html |title=Shqiptarja.com – Patriotë apo tradhëtarë?! |work=''Shqiptarja.com'' |access-date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church and many Catholics were supportive of the invasion, but Fischer states there were many exceptions, particularly of among the village priests since most of them were trained in Albania and were quite nationalistic. Some of them even left Albania after the Italian invasion. But the hierarchy on the other hand was quite supportive, with the apostolic delegate seeing it as a possibility to give more freedom to Albanians who wanted to become Catholic. The Catholic Church had also the most financial support per member during the Italian occupation.&lt;ref name="Fischer5258" /&gt;

=== Communism ===

[[File:Mutter Teresa von Kalkutta.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Mother Teresa]] was a world-renowned missionary of [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian]] birth.]]
Before the Communists took power in 1944, it was estimated that of Albania's population of roughly 1,180,500 persons, about 70% belonged to Islamic sects while 30% belonged to Christian sects. Among the Muslims, at least 200,000 (or 17%) were Bektashis, while most of the rest were Sunnis, in addition to a collection of much smaller orders. Among the Christians, 212,500 (18%) were Orthodox while 142,000 (12%) were Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keefe |first=Eugene K. |title=Area Handbook for Albania |date=January 1971 |page=95 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32129/32129-h/32129-h.htm#Page_95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Land reform in Albania|Agrarian Reform Law]] of August 1946 nationalized most property of religious institutions, including the estates of monasteries, orders, and dioceses. Many clergy and believers were tried, tortured, and executed. All foreign Roman Catholic priests, monks, and nuns were expelled in 1946.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-186.html |title=Albania – Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious communities or branches that had their headquarters outside the country, such as the [[Jesuit]] and [[Franciscan]] orders, were henceforth ordered to terminate their activities in Albania. Religious institutions were forbidden to have anything to do with the education of the young, because that had been made the exclusive province of the state. All religious communities were prohibited from owning real estate and from operating philanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals.
Although there were tactical variations in First Secretary of the Communist Party [[Enver Hoxha]]'s approach to each of the major denominations, his overarching objective was the eventual destruction of all organized religion in Albania. Between 1945 and 1953, the number of priests was reduced drastically and the number of Roman Catholic churches was decreased from 253 to 100, and all Catholics were stigmatized as fascists.&lt;ref name="country-data.com" /&gt;

The campaign against religion peaked in the 1960s. Beginning in 1967 the Albanian authorities began a violent campaign to try to eliminate religious life in Albania. Despite complaints, even by [[Party of Labour of Albania]] members, all churches, mosques, [[tekkes]], monasteries, and other religious institutions were either closed down or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, or workshops by the end of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-170.html |title=Albania – The Cultural and Ideological Revolution |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1967, religious institutions had been forced to relinquish all 2,169 churches, mosques, cloisters, and shrines in Albania, many of which were converted into cultural centres for young people. As the literary monthly Nendori reported the event, the youth had thus "created the first atheist nation in the world."&lt;ref name="country-data.com" /&gt;

The clergy were publicly vilified and humiliated, their vestments taken and desecrated. More than 200 clerics of various faiths were imprisoned, others were forced to seek work in either industry or agriculture, and some were executed or starved to death. The monastery of the Franciscan order in Shkodër was set on fire, which resulted in the death of four elderly monks.&lt;ref name="country-data.com" /&gt;

A major center for anti-religious propaganda was the National Museum of Atheism ({{lang-al|Muzeu Ateist}}) in Shkodër, the city viewed by the government as the most religiously conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Miranda |last=Vickers |first2=James |last2=Pettifer |publisher=NYU Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-8147-8805-X |title=Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity |pages=99,109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm8TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mentor |last=Mustafa |chapter=What Remained of Religion in an "Atheist" State and the Return of Religion in Post-Communist Albania |editor1-last=Repič |editor1-first=Jaka |editor2-last=Bartulović |editor2-first=Alenka |editor3-last=Sajovec Altshul |editor3-first=Katarina |title=MESS and RAMSES II.

Article 37 of the [[Constitution of Albania|Albanian Constitution]] of 1976 stipulated, "The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bjoerna.dk/dokumentation/Albanian-Constitution-1976.htm#C.%20Education,%20Science,%20Culture |work=The constitution of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania |title=Education, science, culture |date=March 2005 |publisher=Bjoern Anderse}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for "religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature." A new decree that in effect targeted Albanians with Islamic and religiously-tinged Christian names stipulated that citizens whose names did not conform to "the political, ideological, or moral standards of the state" were to change them. It was also decreed that towns and villages with religious names must be renamed. Hoxha's brutal antireligious campaign succeeded in eradicating formal worship, but some Albanians continued to practice their faith clandestinely, risking severe punishment. Individuals caught with Bibles, icons, or other religious objects faced long prison sentences. Religious weddings were prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-184.html |title=Albania – Social Structure under Communist Rule |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents were afraid to pass on their faith, for fear that their children would tell others. Officials tried to entrap practicing Christians and Muslims during religious fasts, such as Lent and Ramadan, by distributing dairy products and other forbidden foods in school and at work, and then publicly denouncing those who refused the food, and clergy who conducted secret services were incarcerated.&lt;ref name="country-data.com" /&gt;
The article was interpreted as violating The [[United Nations Charter]] (chapter 9, article 55) which declares that [[religious freedom]] is an inalienable human right. The first time that the question of religious oppression in Albania came before the United Nations' [[Commission on Human Rights]] at Geneva was as late as 7 March 1983. A delegation from Denmark got its protest over Albania's violation of religious liberty placed on the agenda of the thirty-ninth meeting of the commission, item 25, reading, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief." There was little consequence at first, but on 20 July 1984 a member of the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]] inserted an article in one of Denmark's major newspapers protesting the violation of religious freedom in Albania.

After the death of [[Enver Hoxha]] in 1985, his successor, [[Ramiz Alia]], adopted a relatively tolerant stance toward religious practice, referring to it as "a personal and family matter." Émigré clergymen were permitted to reenter the country in 1988 and officiate at religious services. [[Mother Teresa]], an ethnic Albanian, visited Tirana in 1989, where she was received by the foreign minister and by Hoxha's widow. In December 1990, the ban on religious observance was officially lifted, in time to allow thousands of Christians to attend Christmas services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-187.html |title=Albania – The Revival of Religion |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atheistic campaign had significant results especially to the Greek minority, since religion which was now criminalized was traditionally an integral part of its cultural life and identity.&lt;ref name=Stoppel&gt;{{citation |author1=Nußberger Angelika |author2=Wolfgang Stoppel |title=Minderheitenschutz im östlichen Europa (Albanien) |year=2001 |publisher=Universität Köln |language=German |url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/jur-fak/ostrecht/minderheitenschutz/Vortraege/Albanien/Albanien_Stoppel.pdf |location=p. 19-20: "Vor allem für die griechische Minderheit hatte das Verbot verheerende Folgen, da für sie Kirche und Religion traditionell Teil ihres kulturellen Lebens wie ihrer nationalen Identität beinhalten, was nunmehr kriminalisiert und in den Untergrund gedrängt wurde.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{See also|Islam in Albania|Islam in Albania (1800–1912)|Islam in Albania (1913–1944)|Islam in the People's Socialist Republic of Albania}}
[[File:Great Mosque of Durres 2016 Albania.jpg|230px|thumb|left|[[Great Mosque of Durrës]]]]
Islam was first introduced to Albania in the 15th century after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the area.&lt;ref name="Crampton38"&gt;{{harvnb|Crampton|2014|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boehm307"&gt;{{harvnb|Boehm|1994|p=307}}. "The Ottoman Turks first introduced Islam into Albania when they conquered the country in the late 15th century."&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest religion in the country, representing 58.79% of the population according to the 2011 census.&lt;ref name="instat1" /&gt; One of the major legacies of nearly five centuries of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule was that the majority of Albanians, had converted to [[Islam]]. Therefore, the nation emerged as a Muslim-majority country after Albania's independence in November 1912.

In the North, the spread of Islam was slower due to the resistance of the Roman Catholic Church and the region's mountainous terrain. In the center and south, however, Catholicism was not as strong and by the end of the 17th century the region had largely adopted the religion of the growing Albanian Muslim elite. The existence of an Albanian Muslim class of [[pasha]]s and [[beys]] who played an increasingly important role in Ottoman political and economic life became an attractive career option for most Albanians. Widespread illiteracy and the absence of educated clergy also played roles in the spread of Islam, especially in northern Albanian-inhabited regions. During the 17th and 18th centuries Albanians converted to [[Islam]] in large numbers, often under sociopolitical duress experienced as repercussions for rebelling and for supporting the Catholic powers of Venice and Austria and Orthodox Russia in their wars against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name=Ramet&gt;Ramet, Sabrina (1998).

[[File:Qendra Botërore Bektashiane.jpg|230px|thumb|right|World Headquarters of the [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] in [[Tirana]]]]
In the 20th century, the power of Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox clergy was weakened during the years of monarchy and it was eradicated during the 1940s and 1950s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories.

During the Ottoman invasion the Muslims of Albania were divided into two main communities: those associated with [[Sunni]] Islam and those associated with [[Bektashi]] [[Shiism]], a mystical [[Dervish]] order that came to Albania through the Albanian Janissaries that served in the Ottoman army and whose members practiced Albanian pagan rites under a nominal Islamic cover.{{citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=among other things the statement of pagan practices sounds like a slur and not fact}} After the Bektashis were banned in Turkey in 1925 by [[Atatürk]], the order moved its headquarters to [[Tirana]] and the Albanian government subsequently recognized it as a body independent from Sunnism. Sunni Muslims were estimated to represent approximately 50% of the country's population before 1939, while Bektashi represented another 20%. There is also a relatively small minority which belongs to the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]. Muslim populations have been particularly strong in eastern and northern Albania and among Albanians living in [[Kosovo]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].

==== Sunnism ====
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}[[File:Elbasan - Naziresha Mosque (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|left|150px|Mosque in [[Elbasan]]]]
Sunni Muslims have historically lived in the cities of Albania, while Bektashis mainly live in remote areas, whereas [[Orthodox Christians]] mainly live in the south, and [[Roman Catholics]] mainly live in the north of the country. However, this division does not apply nowadays. In a study by Pew Research, 65% of Albanian Muslims did not specify a branch of Islam that they belonged to.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The Albanian census doesn't differentiate between Bektashis and Sunnis, but instead between Bektashis and "Muslims", but since Bektashis are in fact Muslim many were listed as Muslims. Bektashi-majority areas include Skrapari, Dishnica, Erseka and Bulqiza while Bektashis also have large, possibly majority concentrations in Kruja, Mallakastra, Tepelena, large pockets of the Gjirokastër and Delvina Districts (i.e. Gjirokastër itself, Lazarat, etc.), and Western and Northeastern parts of the Vlora district. There are also historically substantial Bektashi minorities around Elbasan, Berat, Leskovik, Perm, Saranda and Pogradec. In Kosovo and Macedonia there were pockets of Bektashis in Gjakova, Prizren and Tetova. In the Albanian census, a few of these areas, such as Skrapari and Dishnica, saw the Bektashi population mostly labeled "Bektashi" while in most other areas such as Kruja it was mostly labeled "Muslim". One must note also that the classification of children of mixed marriages between Sunnis and Bektashis or the widespread phenomenon of both groups marrying Orthodox Albanians also have inconsistent classification and oftentimes the offspring of such unions associate with both of their parents' faiths and occasionally practice both.

In December 1992 Albania became a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]).

==== Bektashism ====
{{expand section|date=July 2017}} &lt;!-- Yalens : I have tons of sources and will write this section after my self-block expires! --&gt;

==== "Alevian" Communities ====
{{original research|section|date=June 2018}}
Of the remaining mystical orders in Albania besides the Bektashi, there are those that associate with the mainline Sunni establishment, as well as those who feel themselves to be distant from both the Sunnis and Bektashis, and in terms of organization have oscillated between association with the Sunni establishment, with the Bektashis, and as their own independent organization. Today, these sects, the largest of them being the [[Halveti Order]], and are organized and collectively referred to in Albania as the "Alevian Community" ({{lang-sq|Komuniteti Alevjan}}) or the "Alevian Sects" ({{lang-sq|Sektet Alevjan}}). There are other mystical orders who associate more with the Sunni establishment. There is no known direct relation of Alevjans to Turkish ''Alevis'' or Syrian ''Alawites'' except their ambiguous position between Sunnism and Shi'ism, also a characteristic of Bektashism.

Another, though smaller, Sufi-influenced sect of Muslims in Albania are the Halvetis. The Halveti order first started to spread in Southern Albania in the 16th century and gained many followers later. Less numerous than the Bektashis (and occasionally confused with them) but still significant. During periods of suppression of the Bektashis by the Ottoman authorities, Bektashi tekkes were often conferred upon the Halvetis, such as happened in Kanina, near Vlora&lt;ref name="ElsieHalvetis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Elsie |first=Robert |title=Historical Dictionary of Albania |pages=39,181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are large concentrations of Halvetis in Devoll, Tropoja, Luma (around Kukes) and in mountainous valleys in the Kurvelesh region. Halvetis also live near Bektashis in Mallakastra, Tepelena, Gjirokastra, Delvina, Permet, Leskovik, Korca, and the city of Berat. The first Albanian Halveti tekke however was in [[Ioannina]], now Greece. After the fall of communism, in 1998, it was reported that there were 42 Bektashi tekkes in Albania.&lt;ref name="ElsieHalvetis" /&gt; On the census Halvetis are not reported and are usually grouped under generalized "Muslims", although in public discourse they are frequently grouped with Bektashis. Halvetis are said to dislike both the dominance of mainline Sunnis in the generic "Muslim" community and the non-recognition of their sect's separate existence, but also the dominance of Bektashis in the Dervish scene.

[[File:Teqeja e Melanit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Melani Tekke]]
Besides the two most popular Dervish orders in Albania (Bektashis and Halvetis), there are three other significant Dervish orders: the Kadris (also known as "Kadris" or "Zinxhiris"), the Sadis and the Rufais.

The Rufais originated in Iraq as the "Rifa'is", from the teachings of the jurist Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Rifa'i. Little is known about how they spread to the Balkans, but in the Balkans they became known as the "howling dervishes" because of ritual practices including piercing of lips and cheeks, eating of glass and burning of skin. Most of these practices have ceased but they still occur in Prizren, in Kosovo. In the late 19th century there was a flourishing Rufai community around Gjakova, in Kosovo, which helped spread the sect in various parts of Albania. During the early years of the 20th century some Rufai tekkes became Bektashi. At the same time, in the same period the order spread to Tropoja, Tirana, Petrela and parts of Southern Albania. In Albania all of their tekkes were closed due to the banning of religion under Communism, but in Yugoslavia the order continued to operate major tekkes in Gjakova, Mitrovica, Skopje, Peja, Rahovec and Prizren. After the fall of Communism, the order reconstituted itself in Albania and opened a tekke in Tirana in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie, Robert. ''Historical Dictionary of Albania''. Pages 386–387.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sa'dis originated in Damascus and in Albania have a close relationship with the Bektashis. Both were favored by Ali Pasha and they looked after and venerated each other's holy places and tombs. There was a Sa'di tekke in Gjakova in 1600, and two Sa'di tekkes in Tepelena two centuries later, as well as some historical presence in Tropoja, Gjirokastër, Elbasan and Peza. In 1980 in Kosovo, there are 10 operating Sa'di tekkes.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie, Robert. ''Historical Dictionary of Albania. Pages 393–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kadris first originated as a distinct sect in Istanbul in the 17th century, then were spread to the Balkans as the "Zindjiris" by Ali Baba of Crete, originally spreading from within the Bektashi community. There are Kadri tekkes in Tirana, Berat and Peqin, but the main center of the Kadris is Peshkopia in Diber County. In 1945 they were finally recognized as a distinct religious community; since the fall of Communism, they have reconstituted themselves and now have an operating tekke in Peshkopia.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie.

The full quote for affiliation (google translate) is "Albanian Muslims are 56.70%, 10.03% Catholics, 6.75% Orthodox, 2.09% Bektashi, 0.14% evangelicals. 5.49% other and 2.5% atheists. The number of those who preferred not to answer this question is 13.79% of the total population"&lt;/ref&gt; Albania once numbered eighteen episcopal Sees, some of them having uninterrupted activity from the dawn of the Catholicism until today. The country has been a Roman Catholic bridgehead in the [[Balkans]], with Catholic Albanians playing a role not unlike the [[Croats]] in the [[former Yugoslavia]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], Albania was ruled by many Catholic rulers, including natives but notably the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] and it became a site of the spread of Catholicism in the Balkans at the expense of Orthodoxy as previously Orthodox Albanian nobles and their subjects converted as they grew increasingly loyal to the Western powers as a way to fend off threats coming from Orthodox political entities. Despite the ascendance of Catholicism at the time, Orthodox minorities remained. Before long, Durrës and Kruja became major centers of Balkan Catholicism, and in 1167 it was a significant event when Kruja became a Catholic bishopric, with the new bishop consecrated by the Pope himself.&lt;ref&gt;Lala, Etleva (2008). "''Regnum Albania'', the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility". Budapest, Hungary: Central European University, 2008.  page 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Vlora and Butrint also saw Catholicization, and at the peak of Catholic power in the Balkans with Albania as a stronghold, Catholic structures began appearing as far afield as Skopje in 1326.&lt;ref&gt;Lala, Etleva (2008). ''Regnum Albaniae''. Page 74&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 14th century, the previously Orthodox Autocephalous Archbishopric of Ohrid was dismantled in favor of the Catholic rite.&lt;ref name=LalaOhrid /&gt;

However, Ottoman rule ultimately vastly decreased the number of Catholics in Albania and elsewhere in the Balkans, with waves of conversions to Islam and to a lesser extent Orthodoxy occurring especially in the 17th century after a series of failed rebellions and punitive measures which involved drastic raises in the taxes of the Catholic population. The tribal population of Mirdita saw very few conversions because the ease they had defending their terrain meant the Ottomans interfered less in their affairs. Today, Catholic Albanians are mostly found in the areas of Malesia e Madhe, Kiri, Puka, Tropoja (where they are a minority), Mirdita, parts of northwestern Mat, Kurbin, Lezhe, Zadrima, Shkodër and Ulqin (where they live alongside very large numbers of Sunni Muslims), minorities in Kruja and some major cities, as well as scattered pockets throughout Gheg-inhabited areas. While there remained a small Albanian Catholic community in Vlore during Ottoman times, larger numbers of Catholics started were reported in the South after the fall of Communism, often in traditionally Orthodox areas.
[[File:Tirana_-_Papa_Fran%C3%A7eskut_Bust_(2018).jpg|thumb|left|Pope Francis bust in Tirana erected in honor of his 2014 visit to Albania]]

For four centuries, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Albanians defended their faith, aided by [[Franciscan]] missionaries, beginning in the middle of the 17th century, when persecution by Ottoman Turkish lords in Albania started to result in the conversion of many villages to the Islamic faith.

The College of Propaganda at Rome played a significant role in the religious and moral support of the Albanian Catholics. During the 17&lt;small&gt;th&lt;/small&gt; and 18&lt;small&gt;th&lt;/small&gt; centuries, the College contributed in educating young clerics appointed to service on Albanian missions, as well as to the financial support of the churches. Work was done by the Austrian Government at the time, which offered significant financial aid in its role as Protector of the Christian community under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.

Church legislation of the Albanians was reformed by [[Clement XI]], who convoked a general ecclesiastical visitation, held in 1763 by the [[Archbishop of Antivari]], by the end of which a national synod was held. The decrees formulated by the Synod were printed by the College of Propaganda in 1705, and renewed in 1803. In 1872, [[Pius IX]] convoked a second national synod at [[Shkodër]], for the revival of the popular and ecclesiastical life. Owing to Austrian interest in Albania, the institution of the Catholic bishops of Albania was obtained through a civil decree released by the Vilajet of [[Berat]].

Albania was divided ecclesiastically into several [[Ecclesiastical province|archiepiscopal provinces]]:
* [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Tivari]] Since 1878 part of the principality of [[Montenegro]]. Since 1886, it has been separate from [[Shkodër|Scutari]], with which it had been united in 1867 on equal terms.
* [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shkodër-Pult|Scutari]], with the suffragan ''Sees of Alessio, Pulati, Sappa'' and (since 1888) the Abbatia millius of St. Alexander of Orosci.
* [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tiranë-Durrës|Durazzo]]
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Skopje|Uskup]]
The last two archiepiscopal provinces did not have any suffragans, and depended directly on the [[Holy See]]. A seminary, founded in 1858 by Archbishop Topich of Scutari, was destroyed by the [[Ottomans]], but was later re-established on [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] territory and placed under imperial protection.

==== Eastern Orthodoxy ====
{{Main|Orthodoxy in Albania}}
[[File:BERAT Unesco Albania 2016.jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Holy Trinity Church, Berat|Holy Trinity Church]] of [[Berat]]]]
According to the [[Demographics of Albania|2011 Census]], 6.75% of the Albanian population adhere to the [[Albanian Orthodox Church]]. Three ethnic groups, Albanians, [[Greeks in Albania|Greeks]], and [[Aromanians]], account for the vast majority of Albania's Orthodox believers. Metropolitan Theofan [[Fan Noli]] established the Albanian Orthodox Mission under the [[United States|American]] diocese.

Although [[Orthodox Christianity]] has existed in Albania since the 2nd century AD, and the Orthodox historically constituted 20% of the population {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} of Albania, the first Orthodox liturgy in the Albanian language was celebrated not in Albania, but in [[Massachusetts]]. Subsequently, when the [[Orthodox Church]] was allowed no official existence in communist Albania, Albanian Orthodoxy survived in exile in Boston (1960–89). It is a curious history that closely entwines Albanian Orthodoxy with the Bay State. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Between 1890 and 1920, approximately 25,000 Albanians, the majority of them Orthodox Christians from southeastern Albania, emigrated to the United States, settling in and around [[Boston]]. Like many other Orthodox immigrants, they were predominantly young, illiterate, male peasants. Like so many other [[Balkan]] immigrants, a large number (almost 10,000) returned to their homeland after [[World War I]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Since the 2nd century AD, the liturgical services, schools and activities of the Orthodox Church in Albania had been conducted in [[Greek language|Greek]]. When [[Albania (toponym)|Albania]] came under Ottoman influence in the 15th century the Orthodox people of Albania were members of the [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]] which was officially recognized by the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Egro |first=Dritan |editor=Schmitt, Oliver Jens |chapter=Islam in the Albanian lands (XVth to the XVIIth Century) |title=Religion und Kultur im albanischsprachigen Südosteuropa |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aCdYHU9PtiIC |volume=4 |year=2010 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-60295-9 |page=25 |quote=The Orthodox Albanians ...religiously ... were members of the church that was officially recognized by the Ottoman state....

[[File:Orthodox Church Tirana 2016 albania.jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Resurrection Cathedral, Tirana|Resurrection Cathedral]] in [[Tirana]]]]
Those Albanian Orthodox, who, in the fashion of 19th century Balkan nationalism, sought to see their church as an ''Albanian'' rather than ''Greek'' body, were frequently excommunicated by the Greek-speaking hierarchy. Considering that identity during the Ottoman centuries was defined primarily by religious affiliations, such questions in the post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period loomed large in the burgeoning national and cultural identities. After the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]] in Constantinople lost in 1870 jurisdictional control over the [[Bulgarian exarchate|Bulgarians]] in the Ottoman Empire, the Patriarchate did not desire further schisms within its ranks. Indeed, so strong was the rivalry of Greeks with Orthodox Albanians who opted for separate cultural activities, that some of the latter category such as [[Papa Kristo Negovani]], a priest educated in Greek schools, [[Sotir Ollani]], [[Petro Nini Luarasi]], [[Nuci Naco]] and others were murdered for their patriotic efforts.

Nationalist fervor ran high in Albanian immigrant communities in North America.  When, in 1906, a Greek priest from an independent Greek parish in [[Hudson, Massachusetts]], refused to bury an Albanian nationalist, an outraged Albanian community petitioned the missionary diocese to assist them in establishing a separate Albanian-language parish within the missionary diocese. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Fan Noli]], an ardent Albanian nationalist and former parish cantor, was subsequently ordained in February 1908 by a sympathetic Metropolitan Platon to serve this new Albanian parish. Noli went on to organize five additional Albanian parishes, mainly in Massachusetts, as an ''Albanian Orthodox Mission in America'' under the auspices of the American diocese.
Noli later emigrated to Albania, served as the Albanian delegate to the [[League of Nations]], was consecrated [[Bishop]] and Primate of the independent Orthodox Church in Albania in 1923, and even served briefly as Prime Minister of Albania (came in power with the so-called ''The Revolution of 1924'') but was overthrown in a coup by [[Ahmet Zogu]] on the same year. After years in exile in Germany, Noli returned to the United States in 1932, studied at [[Harvard]], translated [[Shakespeare]] into Albanian and Orthodox Scriptures and services into English, and led the Albanian Orthodox community in this country until his death in 1965. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Albanian Greek Catholic Church]] exists in southern Albania and is under an Apostolic Administration.  It has less than 4,000 members.

==== Protestantism ====
{{Main|Protestantism in Albania}}
In the early 19th century, in accordance with the Protestant practice of making the [[Sola scriptura|Scriptures available to all]] people in their common tongue, the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] began to make plans for the translation, printing, and distribution of the New Testament in Albanian. Soon Alexander Thomson, a Scottish missionary, joined the Society and visited Albania in 1863. [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]] also joined the Society to translate the Scriptures in both Geg and Tosk dialects. In the late 19th century the Society's workers traveled throughout Albania distributing Bibles, under the leadership of Gjerasim Qiriazi who converted, preached the Gospel in [[Korça]], and became the head of the first "Evangelical Brotherhood".&lt;ref name="Kisha Protestante"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kishaprotestante.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=230&amp;Itemid=116&amp;lang=en |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302123418/http://www.kishaprotestante.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=230&amp;Itemid=116&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2 March 2014 |title=Development of the Protestant church amongst Albanians |publisher=Kosova Protestant Evangelical Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qiriazi sought official government recognition for the Albanian Evangelical Church in 1887, a pursuit which would not be fulfilled until 10 March 2011 by Law No. 10394.&lt;ref&gt;FLETORJA ZYRTARE E REPUBLIKËS SË SHQIPËRISË.

The history of the [[Jews]] in Albania dates back at least 2,000 years dating back to 70 CE. Albanian Jews, predominantly [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]], have only constituted a very small percentage of the population in modern times .

In 1673 the charismatic Jewish prophet [[Sabbatai Zevi]] was exiled by the Turkish sultan to the Albanian port of [[Ulqin]], now in [[Montenegro]], dying there some years later.&lt;ref name="Publisher C.

Over the course of [[World War II]] Albania saw its Jewish population increase. During the [[Communism|communist]] [[dictatorship]] of [[Enver Hoxha]], the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]] banned all religions, including [[Judaism]], in adherence to the doctrine of [[state atheism]]. In the post-Communist era, these policies were abandoned and freedom of religion was extended, although the number of practicing Jews in Albania today remains small, with many Jews having made [[aliyah]] to Israel. Today Jews number around 150. In December 2010 Israeli Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar installed Rabbi Yoel Kaplan as the country's first Chief Rabbi. Recognition of Judaism as an official religion and Rabbi Kaplan as Chief Rabbi were the result of Prime Minister Sali Berisha's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Ynetnews: [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3997848,00.html 1st chief rabbi inaugurated in Albania], 17 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 census, 58.79% of Albanians declared themselves to be [[Muslim]]s, making [[Islam]] the largest [[religion]] in the country. The majority of Albanian Muslims are secular [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] with a significant [[Bektashi]] Shia minority. [[Christianity]] was declared by 16.99% of the population, making it the 2nd largest religion in the country. The remaining portion of the population is either [[irreligious]] or belongs to other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instat.gov.al/media/177358/njoftim_per_media_-_fjala_e_drejtorit_te_instat_ines_nurja_per_rezultatet_finale_te_census_2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 March 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326091156/http://www.instat.gov.al/media/177358/njoftim_per_media_-_fjala_e_drejtorit_te_instat_ines_nurja_per_rezultatet_finale_te_census_2011.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslim]]s are found throughout the country, while Orthodox followers are concentrated in the south and Catholics are concentrated in the north. However, this division is not strict, particularly in many urban centers, which have mixed populations. Members of the Greek minority, concentrated in the south, belong almost exclusively to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. In addition to the four traditional religious groups, there are substantial numbers of followers of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, [[Baha'is]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), and other religious groups.

According to other older sources, up to 75 percent of the population in Albania has declared no religious affiliation since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"Instantanés d’Albaníe, un autre regard sur les Balkans" (2005), Etudiants en Tourisme et Actions Patrimoniales.

The State Committee on Cults reported a total of 245 religious groups, organizations, and foundations in addition to the 4 traditional faiths. This number includes 34 different [[Islamic]] organizations and 189 Protestant organizations, mostly associated with the Albanian Evangelical Brotherhood (Vëllazëria Ungjillore Shqiptare).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

These are only the official statistics of 1935, however, and since then much has changed.  Bashkim Zeneli, former Albanian ambassador to Greece, said that about 900,000 Albanians have emigrated to Greece in 20 years, and around 200,000 of them have returned to Albania. From this, around 240,000 are said to be Muslim by heritage, and around 85,000 have returned to Albania. Although they presently live in Albania, a lot of them continue to be Orthodox.

According to the 2007–2008 Gallup polls, 63% of Albanians state that religion does not play an important role in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://worldview.gallup.com/signin/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fdefault.aspx |title=Gallup Poll |publisher=worldview.gallup.com}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a census performed before [[World War II]], a rough distribution of the population was 70% Muslim, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholic. 65% of Albanian Muslims did not associate with particular sect of Islam in a Pew survey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation".

Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project. 9 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, religious practices were officially [[State atheism#Albania|banned in Albania]], making the country the first and only constitutionally atheist state to ever exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bjoerna.dk/dokumentation/Albanian-Constitution-1976.htm#C.%20Education,%20Science,%20Culture |title=The Albanian Constitution of 1976 |publisher=Bjoern Andersen, Sociologist |accessdate=9 April 2013}} Article 37: "The state recognizes no religion whatever and supports atheist propaganda for the purpose of inculcating the scientific materialist world outlook in people."&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of state communism, in 1991 religious activities resumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/al.html |work=The World Factbook |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among people who follow any of the four major religions in [[Albania]], there is a mixture of various religious traditions and pagan traditions coming from the time before Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Albanian faiths blend together after hard times |url=http://www.tribuneonline.org/commentary/20110414com7.html |newspaper=The Daily Tribune |date=14 April 2011 |agency=Agence France-Presse |accessdate=5 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518095110/http://www.tribuneonline.org/commentary/20110414com7.html |archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaith marriages between Muslims and Christians are held to be "common" and "unremarkable" in Albania with little social repercussion, although there is little statistical data on their prevalence. During the communist period, it is known that during the period of 1950–1968, the rates of mixed marriages ranged from 1.6% in Shkodër, 4.3% in Gjirokastër to 15.5% among the textile workers in Tiranë.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/50c05ac62.pdf "Albania – Researched and compiled by the Refugee Documentation Centre of Ireland on 13 November 2012 "]&lt;/ref&gt; In the district of Shkodër they reached 5% in the year 1980.&lt;ref&gt;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00189819/document&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even among those who declared themselves to be adherents of a religion, the majority of the population in Albania has a more secular interpretation of religion than that which would be found in other countries. In August 2012, a Pew Research study found that only 15% of the Muslim population for example, considers religion to be a very important factor in their lives, which was the lowest percentage in the world amongst countries with significant Muslim populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-infographic/ |title=Infographic: The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity |date=9 August 2012 |work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey conducted by Gallup Global Reports 2010 shows that religion plays a role to 39% of Albanians, and lists Albania as the thirteenth least religious country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/Gallup-Global-Reports.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927170052/http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/Gallup-Global-Reports.aspx |archivedate=27 September 2012 |title=World |author=Gallup, Inc. |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Albania the majority of the males are not circumcised (as demanded by [[Khitan (circumcision)|Islamic custom]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR230/FR230.pdf WHO page 236&lt;/ref&gt;

A medical study from 2008 in Tirana on the relationship between religious observance and acute coronary syndrome found out that 67% of Muslims and 55% of Christians were completely religiously non-observant. The regular attendance of religious institutions (at least once every 2 weeks) was low in both denominations (6% in Muslims and 9% in Christians), and weekly attendance was very low (2% and 1%, respectively). Frequent praying (at least 2 to 3 times per week) was higher in Christians (29%) than in Muslims (17%) Praying several times daily (as required of devout Muslims) was rare (2% in Muslims and 3% in Christians). Regular fasting during Ramadan or Lent was similarly low in Muslims and Christians (5% and 6%, respectively). Generally Christians in the study were more observant then Muslims (26% vs 17%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Burazeri |first=Genc |last2=Goda |first2=Artan |last3=Kark |first3=Jeremy D. |date=December 2008 |title=Religious observance and acute coronary syndrome in predominantly Muslim Albania: a population-based case-control study in Tirana |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=937–945 |doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2008.09.001 |issn=1873-2585 |pmid=19041593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study on the Albanian youth aged 16–27 found that total of 80 percent of young people in Albania are not religion practitioners and practice their religion only during the main religious holidays and festivities. Specifically 23 percent of the respondents never practised their religion, while 61 percent practised it only in religious holidays. From the rest, 11 percent practiced it 1-2 times a week, while 5 percent practiced it everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Albanian Youth 2015 |url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/albanien/12300.pdf |journal="Friedrich Ebert" Foundation |pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Values Survey in 2008, Albania had the highest unbelief in the life after death among all other countries, with 74.3% not believing in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dimitris, |first=Ballas, |title=The social atlas of Europe |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/859446932 |others=Dorling, Daniel,, Hennig, Benjamin, |isbn=1-4473-1353-4 |oclc=859446932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a WIN/Gallup International study in 2016 about the beliefs of the Albanians:

* '''80%''' believed there's God
* '''40%''' believed in Life after death
* '''57%''' believed that people have a soul

=== Reactions to the 2011 Census ===
The results of the 2011 census, however, have been criticized as questionable on a number of grounds. The [[Albanian Orthodox Church]] refused to recognize the results, saying they had drastically underrepresented the number of Orthodox Christians and noted various indications of this and ways in which it may have occurred.&lt;ref name="OrthDeclaration"&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Declaration: The results of the 2011 Census regarding the Orthodox Christians in Albania are totally incorrect and unacceptable |url=http://orthodoxalbania.org/old/index.php/eng/news/181-official-announcements/868-official-declaration |publisher=orthodoxalbania.org |accessdate=22 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714225100/http://orthodoxalbania.org/old/index.php/eng/news/181-official-announcements/868-official-declaration |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orthodox church claimed that from its own calculations, the Orthodox percentage should have been around 24%, rather than 6.75%. Meanwhile, the Bektashi leadership also lambasted the results, which even more drastically reduced their representation down to 2%, also rejected the results and said it would conduct its own census to refute the results.

Minority organizations of Greeks (mostly Orthodox) and Roma (mostly Muslim) also claimed that minorities were underrepresented and the Greek organization Omonia argued that this was linked to the under-representation of the Orthodox population.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite news |title=Final census findings lead to concerns over accuracy |url=http://www.tiranatimes.com/news.php?id=14605&amp;cat=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226154037/http://www.tiranatimes.com/news.php?id=14605&amp;cat=1 |archivedate=26 December 2012 |work=Tirana Times |date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orthodox percentage reported might be lower than the actual value due to boycotts of the census, but also because the census staff failed to contact a very large number of people in the south which is traditionally an Orthodox stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top-channel.tv/lajme/artikull.php?id=248098 |title=Kisha Ortodokse: S’njohim censusin |trans-title=Orthodox Church: S'njohim census |language=sq |publisher=Top Channel |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/18/ak-i-ben-kerkese-zyrtare-nishanit-hiqi-urdhrin-e-skenderbeut-janullatosit/ |title=AK- Nishanit: Hiqi ‘Urdhrin e Skënderbeut’ Janullatosit, dekoro themeluesit e Kishës Autoqefale Shqiptare (LETRA) |work=Gazeta Tema |accessdate=14 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516082020/http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/18/ak-i-ben-kerkese-zyrtare-nishanit-hiqi-urdhrin-e-skenderbeut-janullatosit/ |archive-date=2015-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazeta Tema"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/19/prifti-ne-shqiperi-ka-nje-axhende-antiortodokse/ |title=Prifti: Në Shqipëri ka një axhendë anti-ortodokse |work=Gazeta Tema |accessdate=14 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729004347/http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/19/prifti-ne-shqiperi-ka-nje-axhende-antiortodokse/ |archive-date=2017-07-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/19/intervista-vangjel-dule-autoret-e-censusit-manipulatore-te-realitetit-rezoluta-came-historia-nuk-ribehet/ |title=INTERVISTA/ Vangjel Dule: Autorët e censusit, manipulatorë të realitetit.

The Albanian Catholic Bishops Conference also casted doubts on the census, complaining that many of its believers where not contacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arkivalajmeve.com/Katoliket-kunder-Censusit-Do-te-regjistrojme-besimtaret.1047134631/ |title=Katolikët kundër Censusit: Do të regjistrojmë besimtarët – Arkiva Shqiptare e Lajmeve |website=''arkivalajmeve.com'' |access-date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Council of Europe]] ("Third Opinion of the Council of Europe on Albania adopted 23.11.2011,") the population census "cannot be considered to be reliable and accurate, raises issues of compatibility with the principles enshrined in Article 3 of the Framework Convention…The Advisory Committee considers that the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on the protection of national minorities."&lt;ref&gt;"Third Opinion on Albania, adopted on 23 November 2011.

Moreover, the [[World Council of Churches]] (WCC) general secretary Rev. Dr Olav Fykse Tveit has expressed concern at the methodology and results of the Albania Census 2011. He has raised questions in regard to the reliability of the process which, he said, has implications for the rights of religious minorities and religious freedoms guaranteed in the country's constitution. Tveit expressed this concern in letters issued at the beginning of May to the WCC president Archbishop Anastasios, to Prof. Dr Heiner Bielefeldt, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, and to the Albanian government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/general-secretary/messages-and-letters/letter-of-concern-at-the-albania-census-2011 WCC general secretary]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were other serious allegations about the conduct of the census workers that might have impacted on the 2011 census results. There were some reported cases where workers filled out the questionnaire about religion without even asking the participants or that the workers used pencils which were not allowed.&lt;ref name="gazetatema.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/19/censusi-shume-prej-pyetjeve-plotesoheshin-nga-vete-anketuesit/ |title=Censusi, shumë prej pyetjeve plotësoheshin nga vetë anketuesit |work=Gazeta Tema |accessdate=14 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021012/http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/19/censusi-shume-prej-pyetjeve-plotesoheshin-nga-vete-anketuesit/ |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases communities declared that census workers never even contacted them.&lt;ref name="Concerns" /&gt; Additionally, the preliminary results released seemed to give widely different results, with 70% of respondents refusing to declare belief in any of the listed faiths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ateistet.info/lm1209730r |title=Regjistrimi: 70% e banorëve nuk kanë deklaruar besimin fetar |publisher=Ateistët |accessdate=18 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808113529/https://ateistet.info/lm1209730r |archive-date=2017-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.shqiperia.com/lajme/lajm/nr/15988/Censusi-permbys-fete-70-per-qind-refuzojne-ose-nuk-e-deklarojne-besimin |title=Censusi permbys fete, 70 per qind refuzojne ose nuk e deklarojne besimin |publisher=Shqiperia.com |accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared with only 16% of atheists and undeclared in the final results.

== Freedom of religion ==
{{Main|Freedom of religion in Albania}}
[[File:Marche Charlie Hebdo Paris 02.jpg|thumb|220px|Leaders of Albania's four main denominations in 2015 in [[Paris]] in response to the [[Charlie Hebdo attack]]]]
The Constitution extends freedom of religion to all citizens and the government generally respects this right in practice. The Albanian Constitution declares no official religion and provides for equality of all religions; however, the predominant religious communities (Bektashi, Sunni Muslim, Orthodox and Roman Catholic) enjoy a greater degree of official recognition (e.g. national holidays) and social status based on their historical presence in the country. All registered religious groups have the right to hold bank accounts and to own property and buildings. Religious freedoms have in large part been secured by the generally amicable relationship among religions. The Ministry of Education has the right to approve the curricula of religious schools to ensure their compliance with national education standards while the State Committee on Cults oversees implementation. There are also 68 vocational training centers administered by religious communities.&lt;ref name="State Dept"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2004/35434.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2004: Albania |year=2004 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2 June 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free exercise of religion. The government is [[secularism|secular]] and the Ministry of Education asserts that public schools in the country are secular and that the law prohibits ideological and religious indoctrination. Religion is not taught in public schools.&lt;ref name="State Dept" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1536">'''''Religious Experience Reconsidered''''' is a book by [[Ann Taves]] on the study of [[religious experience]]. She proposes a new approach, which takes into account the [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]] of religious meaning to specific events, using the term "specialness."&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9060.html Princeton University Press, ''Religious Experience Reconsidered'']&lt;/ref&gt; "The focus of the book is on experiences deemed religious (and, by extension, other things considered special) rather than "religious experience.""&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;

==Reception==
Kim Knott calls Taves approach an encompassing framework, which can take into account a multitude of things. She doubts, though, if the term "specialness" can replace the term "sacredness."{{sfn|Knott|2010}}

The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gorizia''' ({{lang-la|Archidioecesis Goritiensis}}) is an [[Archdiocese]] of the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic church]] in [[Italy]]. The [[episcopal see|archiepiscopal see]] of [[Gorizia]] ([[Friulian language|Friulian]]: ''Gurizza/Gurizze''; {{lang-de|Görz}}; {{lang-sl|Gorica}}) was founded in 1751 when the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (Episcopal)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]] was divided. It was suppressed in 1788 and re-established in 1797 as the Diocese of Görz-Gradisca. It was raised again to an [[archdiocese]] in 1830. The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana|diocese of Ljubljana]] (Laibach), [[Diocese of Trieste|Trieste-Koper]] (Capo d'Istria), [[Diocese of Poreč and Pula|Poreč-Pula]] (Parenzo-Pola), and [[Diocese of Krk|Krk-Rab]] (Veglia-Arbe) were formerly under the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] jurisdiction of this archdiocese; however, now the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trieste|Diocese of Trieste]] is its only suffragan diocese.

The territory of the Archdiocese was identical with the [[Austro-Hungarian]] [[County of Gorizia and Gradisca]] until 1918 when it was transferred to [[Italy]] at the conclusion of the [[First World War]]. Also from 1766 the archbishop was Prince of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2506">The '''Sirotci''' ("Orphans"; {{lang-de|Waisen}}), officially '''Orphans' Union''' ({{lang-cz|Sirotčí svaz}}), were followers of a radical wing of the [[Hussites]] in [[Crown of Bohemia|Bohemia]]. This force, founded in 1423 originally under the name '''Lesser [[Tábor]]''', consisted mostly of poorer burghers and some members of the lower aristocracy, who joined with commander [[Jan Žižka]] and the eastern Bohemian Hussites, the so-called [[Orebites]] (''Orebité'').

After the Žižka's death (1424) "orphaned" combatants adopted their new name. From 1424 till 1428 they were led by the priest Ambrož of [[Hradec Králové|Hradec]], subsequently by another priest [[Prokop the Lesser]]. ''[[Hejtman]]'' [[Jan Čapek of Sány]] was elected as their military commander (1431–34).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5342">The '''China Assemblies of God Taiwan General Council''' is a Chinese [[Pentecostal]] church that was established in Taiwan in 1952. The church was founded by and continues to have strong ties to the [[Springfield, Missouri]] based [[Assemblies of God]], the largest of the American Pentecostal denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua C. Yang, pp. 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
In 1914, the leaders of the emerging Pentecostal movement founded the [[Assemblies of God]] in the United States. Its purpose, they asserted, was to preserve the harvest of newly won souls. The new denomination soon became the largest and best organized of the various emerging Pentecostal churches.&lt;ref&gt;Hollenweger, ''The Pentecostals'', p.29-33&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1916, a Foreign Mission Division was established and its leaders then attempted to bring under its banner the independent Pentecostals and the missionaries of the theologically similar Christian and Mission Alliance missionaries. This effort had pretty much succeeded by the early 1920s. The Foreign Mission Division of the Assemblies of God now began the task of recruiting new [[missionary|missionaries]], supplying [[Funding|funds]] for their support, and providing direction over their efforts in the field.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, ''This Gospel Shall Be Preached'', p.74-104&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1920s, there were already forty-seven missionaries who served the Assemblies of God. they included [[Victor Plymire]], who explored the provinces of western China and [[Tibet]] and whose son would serve in the Taiwan mission. The difficult years of the 1920s and 1930s, when the Protestant and Catholic mission establishments found themselves threatened by overt Chinese hostility, were even more dangerous for AG missionaries, many of whom worked in remote sections of the hinterland. Not all survived these treacherous times. W.E. Simpson was slain in a [[bandit]] [[ambush]] in 1932, but the mission continued to grow.
By 1933, there were sixty-seven missionaries in China located at twenty-six stations. The missionaries had also recruited a number of local workers. That same year, 155 Chinese helped the Westerners as evangelists and Bible workers.
After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] and the disruption it brought (in some cases Pentecostal missionaries were interned by the Japanese), the Foreign Mission Division began an extensive reassessment of their efforts. As a result of meetings held in [[Springfield, Missouri]] in 1945, they committed themselves to an overall expansion of their enterprise in China. One hundred and forty eight churches had been planted.

In 1952, the Assemblies of God Mission Board committed its men and women from the main-land to the island in the hope of establishing Pentecostal churches in the militarily secure Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;The China-based missionaries of the Assemblies, a church well established on the mainland, decided that these efforts were being threatened by the civil war and in 1948 took a tentative step to develop another Chinese field that would prove to be both a safe haven for its missionaries and a new starting point for evangelism. Two families of missionaries from the Assemblies of God were sent from Shanghai to Taiwan in 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been there ever since. On Taiwan these missionaries and their Chinese co-workers have been able to develop a small but dedicated body of believers who are part of the worldwide Assemblies of God network. In [[Taipei]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]], and [[Kaohsiung]] and in the villages in the reservation areas of the island's rugged interior are found Assemblies of God churches made up of [[Chinese Mainlander|mainlanders]], [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]], and [[Taiwanese Aborigines|mountain people]].
There is a Bible school in Taichung run by the mission and a large A/G run and financed correspondence school now operating in Taipei. Radio ministries such as that established by Jimmy Swaggart, a former A/G pastor, now operate as well and serve to attract Chinese to the church. The Assemblies mission on Taiwan is one that is rather traditional in its operating style.&lt;ref&gt;On the concept of the traditional mission paradigm see Rubinstein, ''The Protestant Community'', pp. 59-94&lt;/ref&gt;

While some progress has been made, the Assemblies of God missionaries have not been able to expand among the Taiwanese majorities or make much progress among the Taiwanese Aborigines. The Assemblies missionaries knew of the work of the other churches when they began their own efforts but decided that there were unreached peoples in the mountain areas. They have been able to carve out a place for themselves but it has not been easy.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this has been detailed in Assemblies of God, Clip Flip materials. The most useful of these documents is Fred and Peggy Martin, "Development of the National Church", pp. 20-23&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, the Taiwan Assemblies of God exists as a small church within the larger Protestant community. It holds fast to its Western roots and maintains close ties to its American founders.

In the literature of Hinduism, '''Vinchai''' are proclamations and instructions to the newly born child Vaikundar, by his father [[Narayana]], also known as Vishnu, one of the three godheads in [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]], the source of [[Ayyavazhi mythology]]. Three such Vichais took place during the period of Vaikundar; the first in Thiruchendur, immediately after his incarnation; the venue second and third Vinchais are in [[Muttapathi]] (sea), one by one between his incarnational activities.

== The proclamation and instructions (Vinchai) ==

The proclamations were as follows:

*I, the Narayana Pantaram, born in the sea, in the year 1008 Masi, has taken my abode in Detchanam (south).
*I, Narayanan, do not want offerings, bribes, and [[kavati]] and I want to do away with these activities henceforth.
*As I am born as the Vaikundar, the Dharma Yukam is unfolding. All those worthy of this [[Dharma Yukam]] only will survive the annihilation of [[kali Yukam]].
*Undertake a rigorous tavam for six years in order that the Dharma Yukam may dawn upon the world. Your tavam will excel all tavam performed hitherto. Let the demons know the effect of your tavam''.(See: [[Tavam of Vaikundar]])''
*Do not accept any blood sacrifice as done by the bloodthirsty demons.
*Those struck by the Kali will despise you, and try to disrupt your tavam. Persevere in your endeavour. Forbearance and fortitude will make you great.
*Be sure, we, the three god-heads are in you. You yourself are [[Sivan]], [[vethan]] and [[Thirumal]].
*Once you complete the tavam, your wish will materialise. I will give you the reigns of the world, and you will rule it under one banner. You will rule all the castes as equals .

Mayon then gave the following exhortations to his child, Vaikundar, in order to perform an effective tavam: 

*Do not be deceived by the love of deceitful people
*Rest assured that Dharmam alone is the greatest virtue
*Uplifting the lowly is Dharmam, be not intemperate
*Do not hate anyone even if they are evil-mongers
*Be thoughtful in your conversation
*Forbearance and fortitude only will make you great
*Do charity to all
*Live with dignity and self-respect
*Cast away all the demons and the eighteen castes into the sea, fire and to the mountains
*Announce that there are no more taxes to be paid .
