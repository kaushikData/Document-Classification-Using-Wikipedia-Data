'''Aaya Ram Gaya Ram''' expression in politics of [[India]] means frequent floor-crossing by legislatures. The term was coined when [[Gaya Lal]] a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] from [[Haryana]] in 1967 changed party thrice in a fortnight first from the [[Indian National Congress]] to United Front, back to Congress and then within nine hours to United Front again. When Gaya Lal decided to quit the United Front and join the Congress, then Congress leader [[Rao Birendra Singh]] brought him to [[Chandigarh]] press and declared "Gaya Ram was now Aya Ram". It became the subject of numerous jokes and cartoons. In 1985 the Constitution amended the anti-defection act. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/here-is-all-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-anti-defection-law/story-49d09jR4iSNmKI5w83u2IL.html&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent such defections.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-21/chandigarh/30542163_1_bhajan-lal-bansi-lal-vinod-bhayana&lt;/ref&gt; It was included in constitution by Rajiv Gandhi Government as the tenth schedule of Indian constitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5554">'''Active labour market policies''' (ALMPs) are government programmes that intervene in the [[labour market]] to help the [[unemployment|unemployed]] find work. Many of these programmes grew out of earlier [[public works]] projects, particularly those implemented under the [[New Deal]], designed to combat widespread unemployment in the developed world during the [[interwar period]]. Today, academic analysis of ALMPs is associated with economists such as [[Lars Calmfors]] and [[Richard Layard]].&lt;ref&gt;Calmfors, L. ''Active labour market policy and unemployment: a framework for the analysis of crucial design features'', OECD Economic Studies, 1994
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Layard, R., S. Nickell and R. Jackman, ''Unemployment: macroeconomic performance and the labour market'', Oxford University Press, 1991
&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aggregate demand|Demand-side]] policies are policies used by the government to control the level of Aggregate demand (AD).

There are three main categories of ALMP:

*''Public employment services'', such as job centres and labour exchanges, help the unemployed improve their job search effort by disseminating information on vacancies and by providing assistance with interview skills and writing a [[curriculum vitae]].
*''Training schemes'', such as classes and [[apprenticeship]]s, help the unemployed improve their vocational skills and hence increase their employability.
*''Employment subsidies'', either in the public or private sector, directly create jobs for the unemployed. These are typically short-term measures which are designed to allow the unemployed to build up work experience and prevent skill atrophy.

Active labour market policies are prominent in the economic policy of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, although over the 1990s they grew in popularity across Europe. Notable examples include the [[New Deal (UK)|New Deal]] in the UK and many [[welfare-to-work]] programmes in the US.

A number of authors&lt;ref&gt;Boix, C. ''Political parties, growth and equality : conservative and social democratic economic strategies in the world economy'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1998&lt;br&gt;
Esping-Andersen, G. ''The three worlds of welfare capitalism'', Cambridge, Polity, 1990&lt;br&gt;
Huo, J., M. Nelson, and J. Stephens, ''Decommodification and activation in social democratic policy: resolving the paradox'', Journal of European Social policy 18: 5-20, 2008
&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that countries with stronger left wing political parties and [[trade union]]s have more developed ALMP. On the other hand, social democratic parties may not promote ALMP if their constituents are well protected workers and hence face little risk of being unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Rueda, D. ''Social democracy inside out. Partisanship and labour market policy in industrialised democracies'', Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the notion that different types of ALMP have similar political determinants has been contested.&lt;ref&gt;Bonoli, G.''The political economy of active labour market policy'', Politics &amp; Society 38(4): 435-457, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vlandas, T. ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1884931 The dependent variable problem in quantitative studies of Active Labour Market Programmes: Uncovering hidden dynamics?]'', Recwowe Working paper, REC-WP 03/2011, 2011.

&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Great Britain, fragmented and under-resourced ALMPs have been attributed as a factor in the rise of populist backlash politics in the [[Rust Belt]] and [[post-industrial]] [[northern England]] during the mid-2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/11/08/the-us-failure-to-provide-vocational-training-is-a-massive-policy-failure-which-supports-donald-trump/|title=The US’ failure to provide vocational training is a massive policy failure which supports Donald Trump|author=Dennis Snower|date=2016-11-08|publisher=London School of Economics US Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/news/this-chart-helps-explain-why-people-in-the-rust-belt-are-fed-up|title=This chart helps explain why people in the Rust Belt are fed up|author=Pacific Standard staff|date=2017-01-24|publisher=Pacific Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cer.eu/sites/default/files/ditchley_2016_report_12dec16.pdf|title=Conference report: Brexit and the economics of populism|date=2016-12-05|publisher=Centre for European reform|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-`Asifah''' ({{lang-ar|العاصفة}}, {{transl|ar|al-‘āṣifah}}, ''the Storm'') was the mainstream armed wing of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] political party and militant group [[Fatah]]. Al-Asifah was jointly led by [[Yasser Arafat]] and [[Khalil Wazir]].&lt;ref name="Aburish"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aburish |first=Said K. |authorlink=Said K. Aburish |title=From Defender to Dictator |year=1998 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |pages=62–65 |location=New York |isbn=1-58234-049-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On New Year's Day 1965,  [[Fatah]] announced the formation of its military wing, called the al-Asifah forces, in Military Communique No. 1. This statement reported Asifah's first guerrilla attacks against Israel and officially declared the launch of the armed struggle for Palestinian independence. At the time, Fatah was far from ready for sustained military activity. Although al-Asifah was rooted in the organized guerrilla movements known as the [[Palestinian fedayeen|Fedayeen]], it had few trained volunteers and even fewer serviceable arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quandt|first=William|title=The Politics of Palestinian Nationalism|year=1965|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first attempted raid occurred on December 31, 1964, but was hindered when the fighters were detained by the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] while planning to demolish a pumping station of the Israeli national water carrier. The following night a second al-Asifah unit infiltrated the border south of [[Lake Tiberius]] and laid explosive satchel in a water canal, which never detonated.In its early years, al-Asifah's direct military impact was negligible and their activities remained limited in scope and effectiveness. By the end of its first year, al-Asifah claimed to have carried out over 110 operations within Israeli territory. However, Israeli sources credit al-Asifah with a total of only 35 operations for the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quandt|first=William|title=The Politics of Palestinian Nationalism|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berekely}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, al-Asifah only had limited success in spearheading an armed struggle against Israel. Its operations were more symbolic than effective, and their impact was more psychological than physical. Over time, the majority of al-Asifah forces were incorporated into the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] armed wing, the [[Palestinian Liberation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sayigh|first=Yezid|title=Palestinian Armed Struggle: Means and Ends|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|year=1986|volume=16|issue=1|pages=95–112|doi=10.1525/jps.1986.16.1.00p0008e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some units retained the name al-Asifah throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Fatah eventually re-branded its armed wing from al-Asifah to the [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] following the outbreak of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Aqsa Brigades Website|url=http://www.3asfa.com/aqsa/|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with Arab countries==
Most Arab countries viewed al-Asifah's [[Guerilla warfare|guerilla]] activities as reckless adventurism that could result in an untimely war with Israel. In 1965, the Lebanese Army Command requested that the Lebanese press stop publishing al-Asifah communiques and news of its operations. In January 1966, Arab representatives of the Mixed Armistice Commission demanded an end to activities by al-Asifah on the grounds that they were ineffective and causing Israeli reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quandt|first=William|title=The Politics of Arab Nationalism|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures to curb such incursions were agreed on. King [[Hussein of Jordan]] quietly but forcefully tried to prevent al-Asifah from operating in Jordanian territory. The first one of al-Asifah's men to die in action was killed by Jordanian border patrols while his unit was returning from a mission in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quandt|first=William|title=The Politics of Palestinian Nationalism|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=165–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only country to support the position of al-Asifah was Syria. The Baathist regime in power in 1966 had officially adopted the strategy of popular war of liberation as the only adequate method for achieving the liberation of Palestine. They offered to host al-Asifah's headquarters and allowed its members freedom of movement in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayigh|first=Yezid|title=Armed Struggle and the Search for State: The Palestinian National Movement, 1949 - 1993|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of women==
Only after the pan-Arab defeat in the [[Six-Day War]] did leading al-Asifah authorities, including its leader Yasser Arafat, begin to seriously consider the inclusion of women in its militias. Al-Asifah began tacitly recruiting women fighters who participated in armed activities from 1967-68. It was not until 1981 that al-Asifah initiated an overt general mobilization campaign in which hundreds of young female students were being trained in military tactics by al-Asifah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nakhleh|first=Khalil|title=Sociology of Palestinians|year=1980|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, very few women who participated in the campaign were actually called upon to serve in actions against Israel. Once the women who participated in these training camps were finished with their training they were generally sent back home and not matriculated into the ranks of al-Asifah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adwan|first=Abdel Jafar|title=Al-Intifada al-Thawra: Dirasah min al Dakhil|year=1988|publisher=Zaytuna lil Alam wa al Nashr|location=Tunis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dalal Mughrabi]] is one of al-Asifah's most famous female militants. She participated in the 1978 [[Coastal Road massacre|Coastal Road]] attack in which a group of al-Asifah fighters hijacked a bus, leading to a shoot-out with Israeli authorities. Mughrabi died during the course of the attack, and has since been hailed as an important Palestinian martyr and national hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Victor|first=Barbara|title=Army of Roses: Inside the World of Palestinian Women Suicide Bombers|year=2003|publisher=Rodale|location=New York|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Algerian Academy of Amazigh Language''' is the pre-eminent [[Algeria]]n council for matters pertaining to the [[Amazigh language]]. The Academy was officially established in 27 December 2017 by [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]].

== History ==
The [[President of Algeria]] [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] before the [[Cabinet of Algeria|Council of Ministers]] meeting on December 27, 2017, had mandated its [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] [[Ahmed Ouyahia]] to implement the directives issued.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aps.dz/algerie/68241-tamazight-l-academie-aura-pour-mission-de-filtrer-les-travaux-realises-sur-la-langue-amazighe&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Ahmed Ouyahia had convened and chaired an [[Ministerial committee|interministerial council]] on January 8, 2018 devoted to the revitalization of [[Tamazight]]'s teaching and the preparation of the organic bill for the creation of an Algerian Academy of the Amazigh language.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.algeriepatriotique.com/2018/01/09/enseignement-de-tamazight/&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Ministerial committee|interministerial council]] had resulted in a series of measures, including the allocation of additional budget posts, to strengthen the teaching of [[Tamazight]] in the [[Education in Algeria|Algerian education system]], and to expand training and research in [[Tamazight]] at the level of [[List of universities in Algeria|Algerian universities]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kabyle.com/revue-de-presse/academie-tamazight-2018-26495&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, an interministerial working group would be set up at the [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]]'s Office to work on the preparation of a draft bill for the creation of this [[Language Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reporters.dz/index.php/item/89409-tamazight-la-loi-organique-a-l-apn-en-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This text will follow the usual course at the level of the [[List of heads of government of Algeria|Government]] and the [[Cabinet of Algeria|Council of Ministers]] before reaching the Algerian Parliament in the first half of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.premier-ministre.gov.dz/fr/gouvernement/actualites-du-gouvernement/pm-ahmed-ouyahia-preside-un-conseil-interministeriel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amerasia''''' was a journal of [[Far East]]ern affairs best known for the 1940s "Amerasia Affair" in which several of its staff and their contacts were suspected of espionage and charged with unauthorized possession of government documents.

==Publication==
In 1937 ''Amerasia'' was founded by [[Frederick Vanderbilt Field]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frederick Vanderbilt Field|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/16/guardianobituaries2|accessdate=January 3, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=February 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also chaired the editorial board,&lt;ref&gt;FBI Report: Institute of Pacific Relations, Internal Security – C, November 4, 1944 ([http://Ultra-Secret.info/PDFs/IPR01.pdf FBI file: Institute of Pacific Relations, Section 1]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, PDF p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philip Jaffe]], a naturalized American born in Russia. It was edited by Jaffe and [[Kate L. Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;Klehr and Radosh, ''The Amerasia Spy Case'', 44&lt;/ref&gt; Field was the publication's chief financial backer. Jaffe was a friend of [[Earl Browder]], general secretary of the [[Communist Party of the United States]]. The journal's staffers and writers included a number Communists or former Communists, including [[Ji Chaoding|Chi Ch'ao-ting]], and at one time [[Joseph Milton Bernstein]], who has been alleged to be a Soviet agent. The journal had a small circulation and sold for fifteen cents a copy.&lt;ref&gt;Klehr and Radosh, ''The Amerasia Spy Case'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; It ceased publication in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuwu Song|title=Encyclopedia of Chinese-American Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJc-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=April 22, 2017|date=July 18, 2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9164-3|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government documents case==
Kenneth Wells, an analyst for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), noticed that an article printed in the January 26, 1945, issue of ''Amerasia'' was almost identical to a 1944 report he had written on Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Klehr and Radosh, ''The Amerasia Spy Case'', 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; OSS agents investigated by breaking into the New York offices of ''Amerasia'' on March 11, 1945, where they found hundreds of classified documents from the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], the [[United States Navy|Navy]], and the OSS.

The OSS notified the State Department, which asked the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to investigate. The FBI's investigation indicated that Jaffe and Mitchell had probably obtained the documents from Emanuel Larsen, a State Department employee, and Andrew Roth, a lieutenant with the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]. Other suspects were free-lance reporter [[Mark Gayn]], whose coverage of the war in Asia appeared regularly in ''Collier's'' and ''Time'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;Klehr and Radosh, ''The Amerasia Spy Case'', 50ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States Department of State|State Department]] "[[China Hands|China Hand]]" [[John S. Service]].

FBI surveillance established that Jaffe met with Service several times in Washington and New York and reported that at one meeting "Service, according to the microphone surveillance, apparently gave Jaffe a document which dealt with matters the Chinese had furnished to the United States government in confidence."&lt;ref&gt;Report of the United States Senate Subcommittee on the Investigation of Loyalty of State Department Employees, 1950, appendix, p. 2051.&lt;/ref&gt;

An FBI summary reported that Jaffe visited the Soviet consulate in New York and that two days after a meeting with Service Jaffe had a four-hour meeting in his home with [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] Secretary [[Earl Browder]] and Tung Pi-wu, the Chinese Communist representative to the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|United Nations Charter Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;FBI Amerasia file, Section 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In carrying out its investigation, the FBI broke into the offices of ''Amerasia'' and the homes of Gayn and Larsen and installed [[Covert listening device|bugs]] and [[Telephone tapping|phone taps]].

On June 6, 1945, the FBI arrested Jaffe, Mitchell, Larsen, Roth, Gayn and Service.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1945/06/07/archives/fbi-seizes-6-as-spies-two-in-state-dept-arrested-by-the-fbi-in.html "FBI Seizes 6 as Spies, , Two in State Dept.", June 7, 1945], accessed April 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the ''Amerasia'' offices were raided and 1,700 classified State Department, Navy, OSS, and [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] documents were seized.

Because no evidence was found indicating that any documents had been forwarded directly to a foreign power, the [[United States Justice Department|Justice Department]] decided not to seek an indictment under the [[Espionage Act]]. Instead, it sought to indict the six for unauthorized possession and transmittal of government documents. Service, the only State Department officer arrested, had given Jaffe approximately eight documents, copies of his own reports on conditions in China, that represented non-sensitive intelligence that diplomats routinely shared with journalists. The [[grand jury]] voted unanimously against indicting him.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Newman, ''The Cold War Romance of Lillian Helman and John Melby'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1989), 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand jury indicted Jaffe, Larsen, and Roth. Before the trial began, Larsen's defense attorney learned of the FBI's illegal break-in at Larsen's home. The Justice Department, fearing a loss at trial if evidence were excluded because it was obtained illegally, arranged a deal. Jaffe agreed to plead guilty and pay a fine of $2,500, while Larsen pleaded no contest and was fined $500. The charges against Roth were dropped.

==Congressional investigations==
The "Amerasia Affair" became a touchstone for those who wanted to raise alarms about espionage and the possible Communist infiltration of the State Department.  Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] often spoke of the case in these terms, maintaining it was a security breach and cover-up of immense proportions.&lt;ref&gt;M. Stanton Evans, ''[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=453 McCarthyism: Waging the Cold War in America]'', Human Events, May 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, a House Judiciary subcommittee chaired by Rep. [[Samuel F. Hobbs]] and, in 1950, the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Investigation of Loyalty of State Department Employees, commonly known as the [[Tydings Committee]], investigated the ''Amerasia'' case. In 1955, the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] sought the ''Amerasia'' materials from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]. The records were declassified and the Justice Department delivered 1,260 documents to the Subcommittee in 1956 and 1957.

The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee published a two-volume report, ''The Amerasia Papers: A Clue to the Catastrophe of China'', in 1970. It ascribed the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution in China]] in part to the Communist sympathies of the Chinese policy experts in the Foreign Service, known as the "[[China Hands]]".

{{Amnesty International UK Media Awards Side Navbar}}
The '''Amnesty International Media Awards''' are a unique set of awards which pay tribute to the best human rights journalism in the UK. [[Kate Allen (Amnesty International)|Kate Allen]], [[Amnesty International]] UK’s director, said that the awards recognise the "pivotal role of the UK media industry in informing and shaping public opinion" and pays tribute to their "often dangerous work". The awards acknowledge the creativity, skills and sheer determination that it takes to get the news out in an educational and engaging way.

In particular, these awards highlight the unique relationship that exists between Amnesty International and the media. Sir [[Trevor McDonald]] explained the inextricably linked nature of this relationship: "Amnesty persists where journalism leaves off. We visit these scenes and then move on. Amnesty has the virtue of sticking with the story and making sure the truth comes out."&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

The most recent awards ceremony was held on 26 November 2015 at the [[Barbican Centre]] in central London. The shortlist and the winners are available below.

== History  ==
Amnesty International has always championed the importance of media in exposing human rights abuses. Amnesty itself began as a media story. In 1961, [[Peter Benenson]], the founder of Amnesty, was so enraged that two Portuguese students were jailed for seven years for toasting to freedom during the autocratic regime of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], that he wrote a letter to ''[[The Observer]]''.

His "Appeal for Amnesty" letter called for the release of six political prisoners from around the world. It began: "Open your newspapers - any day of the week – and you will find a report from somewhere in the world of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government. The newspaper readers feel a sickening sense of impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust all over the world could be united into common action, something effective could be done"

Amnesty began with a sentiment expressed through the media and to celebrate the unique relationship Amnesty shares with the media industry, the Amnesty International UK Media Awards were launched in 1992.

== Purpose of the awards ==
Amnesty believes that by recognising excellence in human rights journalism, journalists and commissioners will be encouraged to increase the quality and quantity of their human rights coverage. Good quality media coverage is important as highlighted by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], Burmese pro-democracy leader, at the 2011 awards ceremony because it is "through the media that the rest of the world gets to hear about what we have to undergo".&lt;sup&gt;[53]&lt;/sup&gt;

In addition to honouring journalists, [[Lindsey Hilsum]], the [[Channel 4 News]] International Editor who was the host of the 2014 awards, emphasises that the Amnesty Awards play a very important role in encouraging editors to allow journalists to cover more obscure stories that are far away and expensive. She said that when: “you point out that you won an Amnesty Award for a similar story a couple of years ago. It makes editors think that they will get some sort of kudos from this, and that it matters within the industry. So I think it’s tremendously important and I think Amnesty is doing a tremendous job by giving us these awards so that we can use them to say: ‘Yes, we’ve got to carry on reporting human rights, it really matters’."&lt;sup&gt;[54]&lt;/sup&gt;

However, more specifically as pointed out by Amy Mackinnon, 2012 winner of the student award and a current journalist: "The Amnesty International UK awards are a heartening reminder that, in the right hands, journalism can be a potent force for good."&lt;sup&gt;[50]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Gaby Rado Memorial Award===

The '''Gaby Rado Memorial Award''', first awarded in May 2004, recognizes a journalist who has been covering national or international human rights stories in broadcast or print media for less than five years.&lt;ref name="GRadoAward002"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/2004/winners/rado.shtml |title=Gaby Rado Award |publisher=Amnesty International UK (AIUK) |year=2004 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040817081409/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/2004/winners/rado.shtml |archivedate=17 August 2004 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRadoAward003"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/may/27/channel4.broadcasting |title=Amnesty creates award in honour of Rado |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 May 2003 |author=Byrne, Ciar |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DWPA9R1H?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/may/27/channel4.broadcasting/print |archivedate=8 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was established with the help of the family, friends and colleagues of the journalist [[Gaby Rado]], who was found dead in [[Iraq]] in 2003. He had been the recipient of three Amnesty Media Awards: in 1996 for a series of reports on Bosnia/Srebrenica, 1998 for coverage of the Muslim minority [[Uighurs]] in north-western China and 2002 for his "moving account of the human cost of the atrocities committed in the Balkan Wars".&lt;ref name="GRadoAward001000"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/2003/rado.shtml |title=Tribute to Gaby Rado 17 January 1955–30 March 2003 |publisher=Amnesty International UK (AIUK) |year=2003 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040622121632/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/2003/rado.shtml |archivedate=22 June 2004 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Human Rights Reporter Award===
The '''Student Human Rights Reporter Award''' was started in 2010 and first awarded in 2011. Initially the award was run with The NUS ([[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]) and ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/student-human-rights-reporter-of-the-year-award-launched/ | title=Student Human Rights Reporter of the Year Award launched | publisher=NUS | work=NUS News | date=October 5, 2010 | accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is now run in conjunction with the NUS, and ''The Observer''.&lt;ref name="2013 award/"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/node/14548 | title=Final call for entries: Student human rights reporter award a week to go | publisher=Amnesty International UK | work=Press releases | date=February 2013 | accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is open to students in further and higher education, with the prize allowing them to work with sponsors to develop real-world reporting and writing experience for two weeks. In 2013 the top prize was a fellowship with the US-based [[Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting]] and a $2,000 travel grant to cover an under-reported topic of ones choice.&lt;ref name="2013 award/" /&gt;

== Entry criteria ==
Each year there is a call for submissions focusing on the areas of human rights work encompassed by Amnesty's mission, which is "to protect individuals wherever justice, fairness, freedom and truth are denied".&lt;ref name="AIUKMission001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrylockmediasales.co.uk/amnesty-international-magazine.htm |title=Amnesty International magazine |accessdate=8 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DWf3tazE?url=http://www.terrylockmediasales.co.uk/amnesty-international-magazine.htm |archivedate=8 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIUKMission002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walker.co.uk/amnesty.aspx |title=Walker Books and Amnesty International |publisher=[[Walker Books]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DWfLGFmy?url=http://www.walker.co.uk/amnesty.aspx |archivedate=8 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIUKMission003"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=10010 |title=Our Work |publisher=Amnesty International UK (AIUK) |accessdate=8 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DWfQ3n0D?url=http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=10010 |archivedate=8 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners are chosen by a panel of judges. The judges selected are a diverse group of experts in the media, arts and entertainment industries.  Some of the judges for the 2015 awards include BBC contributing editor [[Bridget Kendall]], BuzzFeed political reporter Siraj Datoo, ''Guardian'' journalist [[Gary Younge]], editor of the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' [[Sarah Sands]], ITV News lead anchor [[Nina Hossain]], and BBC presenter [[Naga Munchetty]], to name a few.  Amnesty International senior staff also take part in the judging process but have no final vote over the choice of winners.

Awards may also be made posthumously, such as the 2012 award to [[Marie Colvin]] for her coverage of [[Syria]] where she was killed while covering the siege of [[Homs]].

The winners of 2014 were:

[[File:Warning - Anti-climbing paint - UK.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-climb paint on a gate in the UK]]
'''Anti-climb paint''' (also known as '''non-drying paint''', '''anti-intruder paint''', '''anti-vandal grease''') is a class of [[paint]] consisting of a thick oily coating that is applied with a stiff brush, trowel or by hand using a protective glove. In appearance it is similar to smooth gloss paint when applied but it remains slippery indefinitely thereby preventing any intruder from gaining a foothold.

== Advantage ==
It is used to prevent climbing on objects such as lamp posts, walls and fences. It owes its effectiveness to the fact that it is based on a ''non-drying'' oil and keeps the surface greasy and slippery. As an additional advantage, it leaves its mark on the person touching it and hence makes it possible for intruders to be identified.

== Characteristics ==
Anti-climb paint continues to work in hot or cold weather conditions, adhering to the surfaces to which it is applied.  It can be used on most building materials.  It is particularly effective in preventing climbing on walls, parapets, boundary fences, down pipes, lamp standards and roofs. It has an effective lifetime of around three years, after which a fresh coat is recommended depending on local factors.

== Safety ==
To keep the [[general public]] from being affected by the paint, it is usually applied above a certain height on the object being painted.  Typically it is applied from a height of 8&amp;nbsp;ft / 2.4 metres above the ground. The paint is most effective when an intruder has to climb several feet before being stopped by a band of anti-climb paint.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29324">'''[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]]''' are associated [[belief]]s and [[behavior]]s towards some object.&lt;ref name = "McGuire 1985"&gt;McGuire, W., Lindzey, G., &amp; Aronson, E. (1985). Attitudes and attitude change. Handbook of social psychology: Special fields and applications, 2, 233–346.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not stable, and because of the communication and behavior of other people, are subject to change by [[social influence]]s, as well as by the individual's [[motivation]] to maintain cognitive consistency when [[cognitive dissonance]] occurs—when two attitudes or attitude and behavior conflict. Attitudes and attitude objects are functions of [[affective]] and cognitive components. It has been suggested that the inter-structural composition of an associative network can be altered by the activation of a single node. Thus, by activating an affective or emotional node, attitude change may be possible, though affective and cognitive components tend to be intertwined.&lt;ref name="Eagly&amp;Chaiken1995"&gt;Eagly, A., &amp; Chaiken, S. (1995). Attitude strength, attitude structure and resistance to change. In R. Petty and J. Kosnik (Eds.), Attitude Strength. (pp.&amp;nbsp;413–432). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bases==
There are three bases for attitude change:  [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]], [[identification (psychology)|identification]], and [[internalization]]. These three processes represent the different levels of attitude change.&lt;ref name = "Kelman 1938"&gt;Kelman, H.C. (1938). Compliance, identification, and internalization: Three processes of attitude change. Journal of Conflict Resolution, 2(1), 51–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compliance===
[[Image:Asch experiment.png|thumb|270px|One of the pairs of cards used in the experiment. The card on the left has the reference line and the one on the right shows the three comparison lines.]]

[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]] refers to a change in behavior based on consequences, such as an individual's hopes to gain rewards or avoid punishment from another group or person. The individual does not necessarily experience changes in beliefs or evaluations of an attitude object, but rather is influenced by the social outcomes of adopting a change in behavior.&lt;ref name = "Kelman 1938"/&gt; 
The individual is also often aware that he or she is being urged to respond in a certain way.

Compliance was demonstrated through a series of laboratory experiments known as the [[Asch conformity experiments|Asch experiments]]. Experiments led by [[Solomon Asch]] of [[Swarthmore College]] asked groups of students to participate in a "vision test". In reality, all but one of the participants were confederates of the experimenter, and the study was really about how the remaining student would react to the confederates' behavior. Participants were asked to pick, out of three line options, the line that is the same length as a sample and were asked to give the answer out loud. Unbeknown to the participants, Asch had placed a number of confederates to deliberately give the wrong answer before the participant. The results showed that 75% of responses were in line with majority influence and were the same answers the confederates picked.&lt;ref name = "Asch 1956"&gt;Asch, S. E. (1956). Studies of independence and conformity: A minority of one against a unanimous majority. Psychological Monographs, 70 (Whole no. 416).&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in the experiments showed that compliance rates increased as the number of confederates increased, and the plateau was reached with around 15 confederates. The likelihood of compliance dropped with minority opposition, even if only one confederate gave the correct answer. The basis for compliance is founded on the fundamental idea that people want to be accurate and right.&lt;ref name="Cialdini&amp;Goldstein 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cialdini|first=Robert B.|author2=Goldstein, Noah J.|title=SOCIAL INFLUENCE: Compliance and Conformity|journal=Annu. Rev. Psychol.|year=2004|volume=55|pages=591–621|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.142015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===
[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]] explains one's change of beliefs and affect in order to be similar to someone one admires or likes. In this case, the individual adopts the new attitude, not due to the specific content of the attitude object, but because it is associated with the desired relationship. Often, children's attitudes on race, or their political party affiliations are adopted from their parents' attitudes and beliefs.&lt;ref name = "Kelman 1938" /&gt;

===Internalization===
[[Internalization]] refers to the change in beliefs and affect when one finds the content of the attitude to be intrinsically rewarding, and thus leads to actual change in beliefs or evaluations of an attitude object. The new attitude or behavior is consistent with the individual's value system, and tends to be merged with the individual's existing values and beliefs. Therefore, behaviors adopted through internalization are due to the content of the attitude object.&lt;ref name = "Kelman 1938" /&gt;

The [[expectancy-value theory]] is based on internalization of attitude change. This model states that the behavior towards some object is a function of an individual's intent, which is a function of one's overall attitude towards the action.

==Emotion-based==
[[Emotion]] plays a major role in [[persuasion]], [[social influence]], and attitude change. Much of attitude research has emphasised the importance of affective or emotion components.&lt;ref name = "Breckler &amp; Wiggins, 1992"&gt;Breckler, S. J., &amp; Wiggins, E. C. (1992). On defining attitude and attitude theory: Once more with feeling. In A. R. Pratkanis, S. J. Breckler, &amp; A. G. Greenwald (Eds.) Attitude Structure and Function (pp.&amp;nbsp;407–427). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotion works hand-in-hand with the cognitive process, or the way we think, about an issue or situation. Emotional appeals are commonly found in advertising, health campaigns and political messages. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns (see [[tobacco advertising]]) and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism. Attitude change based on emotions can be seen vividly in serial killers who are faced with major stress.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, E. E. (1965). Attitude change: A review and bibliography of selected research. Paris: Unesco.&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable empirical support for the idea that emotions in the form of fear arousal,&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maddux &amp; Rogers, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; empathy,&lt;ref&gt;Shelton &amp; Rogers, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; or a positive mood&lt;ref&gt;Janis, Kaye, &amp; Kirschner, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; can enhance attitude change under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, H. A. (1970)Findings and theory in the study of fear communications.In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 5, pp. 120-186). Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important factors that influence the impact of emotional appeals include [[self-efficacy]], attitude accessibility, issue involvement, and message/source features. Attitudes that are central to one's being are highly resistant to change while others that are less fixed may change with new experiences or information. A new attitude (e.g. to time-keeping or absenteeism or quality) may challenge existing beliefs or norms so creating a feeling of psychological discomfort known as cognitive dissonance. It is difficult to measure attitude change since attitudes may only be inferred and there might be significant divergence between those publicly declared and privately held.  Self-efficacy is a perception of one's own human agency; in other words, it is the perception of our own ability to deal with a situation.&lt;ref name = "Bandura, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bandura | first1 = A. | year = 1982 | title = Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 122–147 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.37.2.122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important variable in emotional appeal messages because it dictates a person's ability to deal with both the emotion and the situation. For example, if a person is not self-efficacious about their ability to impact the global environment, they are not likely to change their attitude or behaviour about global warming.

[[Affective forecasting]], otherwise known as intuition or the prediction of emotion, also impacts attitude change. Research suggests that predicting emotions is an important component of decision making, in addition to the cognitive processes.&lt;ref name = "Loewenstein, 2007"&gt;Loewenstein, G. (2007). Affect regulation and affective forecasting. In Gross, J. J. (Ed.) Handbook of Emotion Regulation (pp.&amp;nbsp;180–203). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; How we feel about an outcome may override purely cognitive rationales.
In terms of research [[methodology]], the challenge for researchers is measuring emotion and subsequent impacts on attitude. Since we cannot see into the brain, various models and measurement tools have been constructed to obtain emotion and attitude information. Measures may include the use of physiological cues like facial expressions, vocal changes, and other body rate measures.&lt;ref name = "Breckler &amp; Wiggins, 1992" /&gt; For instance, fear is associated with raised eyebrows, increased heart rate and increased body tension.&lt;ref name = "Dillard, 1994"&gt;Dillard, J. (1994). Rethinking the study of fear appeals: An emotional perspective. Communication Theory, 4, 295-323.&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods include concept or network mapping, and using primes or word cues.&lt;ref name = "Shavelson &amp; Stanton, 1975"&gt;Shavelson, R. J., &amp; Stanton, G. C. (1975). Construct validation: Methodology and application to three measures of cognitive structure. Journal of Educational Measurement, 12, 67-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual models: depth of processing==
Many dual process models are used to explain the affective (emotional) and cognitive processing and interpretations of messages, as well as the different depths of attitude change. These include the [[heuristic-systematic model of information processing]] and the [[elaboration likelihood model]].

===Heuristic-systematic model of information processing===
{{main article|Heuristic-systematic model of information processing}}
The heuristic-systematic model of information processing describes two depths in the processing of attitude change, systematic processing and heuristic processing. In this model&lt;ref name = "Chaiken et al, 1989"&gt;Chaiken, S., Liberman, A. &amp; Eagly, A. H. (1989). Heuristic and systematic information processing within and beyond the persuasion context. In J. S. Uleman &amp; J. A. Bargh. (Eds.), Unintended thought, pp. 212-252. New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; information is either processed in a high-involvement and high-effort systematic way, or information is processed through shortcuts known as ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]]''. For example, emotions are affect-based heuristics, in which feelings and gut-feeling reactions are often used as shortcuts.

====Systematic processing====
Systematic processing occurs when individuals are motivated and have high cognition to process a message.&lt;ref name = "Chaiken, 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaiken | first1 = S. | year = 1980 | title = Heuristic Versus Systematic Information Processing and the Use of Source Versus Message Cues in Persuasion. Journal of | url = | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 5| pages = 752–766 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.752}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals using systematic processing are motivated to pay attention and have the cognitive ability to think deeply about a message; they are persuaded by the content of the message, such as the strength or logic of the argument. Motivation can be determined by many factors, such as how personally relevant the topic is, and cognitive ability can be determined by how knowledgeable an individual is on the message topic, or whether or not there is a distraction in the room. Individuals who receive a message through systematic processing usually internalize the message, resulting in a longer and more stable attitude change.

According to the heuristic-systematic model of information processing, people are motivated to use systematic processing when they want to achieve a "desired level of confidence" in their judgments.&lt;ref name = "Wood 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Wendy|title=Attitude Change: Persuasion and Social Influence|journal=Annu. Rev. Psychol.|year=2000|volume=51|pages=539–570|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.539|pmid=10751980}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are factors that have been found to increase the use of systematic processing; these factors are associated with either decreasing an individual's actual confidence or increasing an individual's perceived confidence. These factors may include framing persuasive messages in an unexpected manner;&lt;ref name = "Smith &amp; Petty 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = SM | last2 = Petty | first2 = RE. | year = 1996 | title = Message framing and persuasion: a message processing analysis | url = | journal = Pers. Soc. Psychol. Bull. | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 257–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; self-relevancy of the message.

Systematic processing has been shown to be beneficial in social influence settings. Systematic reasoning has been shown to be successful in producing more valid solutions during group discussions and greater solution accuracy. Shestowsky's (1998) research in dyad discussions revealed that the individual in the dyad who had high motivation and high need in cognition had the greater impact on group decisions.&lt;ref name="Shestowsky 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shestowsky | first1 = D | last2 = Wegener | first2 = DT | last3 = Fabrigar | first3 = LR. | year = 1998 | title = Need for cognition and interpersonal influence: individual differences in impact on dyadic decision | url = | journal = J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 1317–28 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.5.1317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heuristic processing====
Heuristic processing occurs when individuals have low motivation and/or low cognitive ability to process a message.&lt;ref name = " Chaiken, 1980" /&gt; Instead of focusing on the argument of the message, recipients using heuristic processing focus on more readily accessible information and other unrelated cues, such as the authority or attractiveness of the speaker. Individuals who process a message through heuristic processing do not internalize the message, and thus any attitude change resulting from the persuasive message is temporary and unstable.

For example, people are more likely to grant favors if reasons are provided. A study shows that when people said, "Excuse me, I have five pages to xerox. May I use the copier?" they received a positive response of 60%.  The statement, "Excuse me, I have five pages to xerox. I am in a rush. May I use the copier?" produced a 95% success rate.&lt;ref name="Langer, Blank, &amp; Chanowitz1978."&gt;Langer, Blank, &amp; Chanowitz (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

Heuristic processing examples include [[social proof]], [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], [[authority]], and liking.

*[[Social proof]] is the means by which we utilize other people's behaviors in order to form our own beliefs. Our attitudes toward following the majority change when a situation appears uncertain or ambiguous to us, when the source is an expert, or when the source is similar to us. In a study conducted by Sherif, he discovered the power of crowds when he worked with experimenters who looked up in the middle of New York City. As the number of the precipitating group increased, the percentage of passers-by who looked up increased as well.&lt;ref name="Sherif1936"&gt;Sherif (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reciprocity is returning a favor. People are more likely to return a favor if they have a positive attitude towards the other party. Reciprocities also develop interdependence and societal bonds. 
*[[Authority]]  plays a role in attitude change in situations where there are superior-inferior relationships. We are more likely to become obedient to authorities when the authority's expertise is perceived as high and when we anticipate receiving rewards. A famous study that constitutes the difference in attitude change is the [[Milgram experiment]],  where people changed their attitude to "shocking their partner" more when they followed authorities whereas the subjects themselves would have not done so otherwise.
*Liking has shown that if one likes another party, one is more inclined to carry out a favor. The attitude changes are based on whether an individual likes an idea or person, and if he or she does not like the other party, he/she may not carry out the favor or do so out of obligation. Liking can influence one's opinions through factors such as physical attractiveness, similarities, compliments, contact and cooperation.&lt;ref name="Cialdini2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=R.B.|title=Influence: Science and practice (5th edition)|year=2008|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elaboration likelihood model===
{{Main|Elaboration likelihood model}}
The elaboration likelihood model is similar in concept to and shares many ideas with other dual processing models, such as the [[heuristic-systematic model of information processing]].&lt;ref name = "Albarracin 2005"&gt;Albarracin, D., Johnson, B. T., &amp; Zanna, M. P. (20050. Then handbook of attitudes. Mahwah, N.J: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the elaboration likelihood model, cognitive processing is the central route and affective/emotion processing is often associated with the peripheral route.&lt;ref name = "Petty and Cacioppo, 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petty | first1 = Richard E.|last2=Cacioppo | first2= John T.| year = 1986 | title = The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion | url = http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/elm_original_1986.pdf | journal = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 123–205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The central route pertains to an elaborate cognitive processing of information while the peripheral route relies on cues or feelings. The ELM suggests that true attitude change only happens through the central processing route that incorporates both cognitive and affective components as opposed to the more heuristics-based peripheral route. This suggests that motivation through emotion alone will not result in an attitude change.

==Cognitive dissonance theory==
{{Main article|Cognitive dissonance}}
Cognitive dissonance, a theory originally developed by [[Leon Festinger|Festinger]] (1957), is the idea that people experience a sense of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or uneasiness when two linked cognitions are inconsistent, such as when there are two conflicting attitudes about a topic, or inconsistencies between one's attitude and behavior on a certain topic. The basic idea of the Cognitive Dissonance Theory relating to attitude change, is that people are motivated to reduce dissonance which can be achieved through changing their attitudes and beliefs.&lt;ref name="Festinger 1957"&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). A theory of cognitive dissonance. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper &amp; Fazio's (1984) have also added that cognitive dissonance does not arise from any simple cognitive inconsistency, but rather results from freely chosen behavior that may bring about negative consequences.&lt;ref name="Cooper &amp; Fazio 1984"&gt;Cooper J, Fazio RH. 1984. A new look at dissonance theory. Adv. Exp. Soc. Psychol.17:229–66&lt;/ref&gt; These negative consequences may be threats to the consistency, stability, predictability, competence, moral goodness of the self-concept,&lt;ref name="Aronson 1992"&gt;Aronson E. 1992. The return of the repressed:Dissonance theory makes a comeback. Psychol.Inq. 3:303–11&lt;/ref&gt; or violation of general self-integrity.&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"&gt;Steele CM. 1988. The psychology of selfaffirmation.Adv. Exp. Soc. Psychol.21:261–302&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has suggested multiple routes that cognitive dissonance can be reduced. [[Self-affirmation]] has been shown to reduce dissonance,&lt;ref name="Steele 1988" /&gt; however it is not always the mode of choice when trying to reduce dissonance. When multiple routes are available, it has been found that people prefer to reduce dissonance by directly altering their attitudes and behaviors rather than through self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="Stone 1997"&gt;Stone J, Wiegand AW, Cooper J, Aronson E.1997. When exemplification fails: hypocrisy and the motive for self-integrity. J.Pers. Soc. Psychol. 72:54–65.&lt;/ref&gt; People who have high levels of self-esteem, who are postulated to possess abilities to reduce dissonance by focusing on positive aspects of the self, have also been found to prefer modifying cognitions, such as attitudes and beliefs, over self-affirmation.&lt;ref name = "Gibbons 1997"&gt;Gibbons FX, Eggleston TJ, Benthin AC. 1997.Cognitive reactions to smoking relapse: the reciprocal relation between dissonance and self-esteem. J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 72:184–95&lt;/ref&gt; A simple example of cognitive dissonance resulting in attitude change would be when a heavy smoker learns that his sister died young from lung cancer due to heavy smoking as well, this individual experiences conflicting cognitions: the desire to smoke, and the knowledge that smoking could lead to death and a desire not to die. In order to reduce dissonance, this smoker could change his behavior (i.e. stop smoking), change his attitude about smoking (i.e. smoking is harmful), or retain his original attitude about smoking and modify his new cognition to be consistent with the first one--"I also work out so smoking won't be harmful to me". Thus, attitude change is achieved when individuals experience feelings of uneasiness or guilt due to cognitive dissonance, and actively reduce the dissonance through changing their attitude, beliefs, or behavior relating in order to achieve consistency with the inconsistent cognitions.

==Sorts of studies==
[[Carl Hovland]] and his band of persuasion researchers learned a great deal during World War 2 and later at Yale about the process of attitude change.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M:A history of communication study&lt;/ref&gt;
*High-credibility sources lead to more attitude change immediately following the communication act, but a [[sleeper effect]] occurs in which the source is forgotten after a period of time.
*Mild fear appeals lead to more attitude change than strong fear appeals.Propagandists had often used fear appeals. Hoveland's evidence about the effect of such appeals suggested that a source should be cautious in using fear appeals, because strong fear messages may interfere with the intended persuasion attempt.

===Belief rationalization===
The process of how people change their own attitudes has been studied for years. Belief rationalization has been recognized as an important aspect to understand this process.&lt;ref&gt;Albarracin, D., &amp; McNatt, P. S. (2005). Maintenance and decay of past behavior influences: Anchoring attitudes on beliefs following inconsistent actions. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, 719-733.&lt;/ref&gt; The stability of people's past attitudes can be influenced if they hold beliefs that are inconsistent with their own behaviors. The influence of past behavior on current attitudes is stable when little information conflicts with the behavior. Alternatively, people's attitudes may lean more radically toward the prior behavior if the conflict makes it difficult to ignore, and forces them to rationalize their past behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). A theory of cognitive dissonance. Evanston, IL: Row, Peterson.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if you believe that Greece is a beautiful country and that the people there are very hardworking, then your belief will be stable or even become reinforced when you visit the country and are amazed by its beauty. However, when you interact with local Greeks, you realize they are in actuality not as hard-working as you had imagined. This inconsistency becomes difficult to ignore once it stands out.

Attitudes are often restructured at the time people are asked to report them.&lt;ref&gt;Erber, M. W., Hodges, S. D., &amp; Wilson, T. D. (1995). Attitude strength, attitude stability, and the effects of analyzing reasons. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences. Ohio State University series on attitudes and persuasion (Vol. 4, pp. 433-454. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, C. M., &amp; Brauer, M. (1995). Repetition and evaluative extremity. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences. Ohio State University series on attitudes and persuasion (Vol. 4, pp. 43-71). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, inconsistencies between the information that enters into the reconstruction and the original attitudes can produce changes in prior attitudes, whereas consistency between these elements often elicits stability in prior attitudes. Individuals need to resolve the conflict between their own behaviors and the subsequent beliefs. However, people usually align themselves with their attitudes and beliefs instead of their behaviors. More importantly, this process of resolving people's cognitive conflicts that emerges cuts across both self-perception and dissonance even when the associated effect may only be strong in changing prior attitudes

===Comparative processing===
Human judgment is comparative in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Mussweiler, T. (2003). Comparison processes in social judgment: mechanisms and consequences. Psychological Review, 110(3), 472&lt;/ref&gt; Departing from identifying people's need to justify their own beliefs in the context of their own behaviors, psychologists also believe that people have the need to carefully evaluate new messages on the basis of whether these messages support or contradict with prior messages, regardless of whether they can recall the prior messages after they reach a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Crano, W. D., &amp; Prislin, R. (2006). Attitudes and persuasion. Annual Review of Psychology, 57, 345–374.&lt;/ref&gt; This comparative processing mechanism is built on "information-integration theory"&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, N. H. (1959). A test model of opinion change. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 59, 371–381.&lt;/ref&gt; and "social judgement theory".&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, M., &amp; Hovland, C. I. (1961). Placement of items on controversial issues. In M. Sherif &amp; C. Hovland (Eds.), Social judgment (pp. 99–126). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these theories have served to model people's attitude change in judging the new information while they haven't adequately explained the influential factors that motivate people to integrate the information.

More recent work in the area of persuasion has further explored this "comparative processing" from the perspective of focusing on comparing between different sets of information on one single issue or object instead of simply making comparisons among different issues or objects.&lt;ref&gt;Albarracin, D., Wallace, H. M., Hart, W., &amp; Brown, R. D. (2012). How judgments change following comparison of current and prior information. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 34, 44-55&lt;/ref&gt; As previous research demonstrated, analyzing information on one target product may trigger less impact of comparative information than comparing this product with the same product under competing brands.&lt;ref&gt;Gentner, D., &amp; Markman, A. B. (1997). Structural alignment in analogy and similarity. American Psychologist, 52, 45–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muthukrishnan, A. V., Pham, M. T., &amp; Mungale´, A. (2001). Does greater amount of information always bolster attitudinal resistance? Marketing Letters, 12, 131–144&lt;/ref&gt;

When people compare different sets of information on one single issue or object, the effect of people's effort to compare new information with prior information seemed to correlate with the perceived strength of the new, strong information when considered jointly with the initial information. Comparison processes can be enhanced when prior evaluations, associated information, or both are accessible. People will simply construct a current judgment based on the new information or adjust the prior judgment when they are not able to retrieve the information from prior messages. The impact this comparative process can have on people's attitude change is mediated by changes in the strength of new information perceived by receivers. The effects of comparison on judgment change were mediated by changes in the perceived strength of the information. These findings above have wide range of applications in social marketing, political communication, and health promotion. For example, designing an advertisement that is counteractive against an existing attitude towards a behavior or policy is perhaps most effective if the advertisement uses the same format, characters, or music of ads associated with the initial attitudes.

The '''Buckshot War''' was the outbreak of unrest in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] that transpired after the Pennsylvania [[Governor|gubernatorial]] and legislative elections in 1838 when both the Whig and Democratic parties claimed control over the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]].

==The election of 1838==
{{see also|Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 1838}}

After being elected [[governor of Pennsylvania]] in 1835,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Ritner|url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/1790-1879/4283/joseph_ritner/444201|work=Pennsylvania Historical &amp; Museum Commission|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anti-Masonic Party|Anti-Masonic]] and [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[Joseph Ritner]] served a successful term. With the cooperation his unofficial advisor [[Thaddeus Stevens]] and [[Secretary of Commonwealth]] [[Thomas H. Burrows]], Ritner used Public Works as a political instrument via the government owning all internal improvements hence providing thousands jobs.  Thus it came as a shock to Whigs and Anti-Masons that Ritner was defeated for re-election by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[David Rittenhouse Porter]].&lt;ref name=h2g2&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Buckshot War|url=http://www.h2g2.com/approved_entry/A517105|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign was considered very bitter, with Porter winning by a slim majority of 5,496 in a total vote of 250,146.&lt;ref name="Boston Evening Transcript"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Buckshot War|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=sArNgO4T4MoC&amp;dat=19000420&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|accessdate=May 19, 2012|newspaper=Boston Evening Transcript|date=April 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This election was significant in regards to financial [[patronage]] as, if the sitting governor and his party could gain control both branches of legislature, they would have the ability to control all appointments at a state level. The Whigs and Anti-Masons set out to contest Porter's election, and having already gained a majority in the [[Pennsylvania Senate]], they only needed to secure a majority in the House of Representatives to further their aims.

===The Whig returns===
In order to secure the majority in the House of Representatives, Burrows, who was also the Chairman of the Whig Committee, used claims made by [[Charles J. Ingersoll]] to maneuver a tactical plan. Ingersoll, a Democrat,  was defeated in Congress and blamed his defeat on Whig frauds in the [[Northern Liberties District]] (Now known simply as Northern Liberties) in Philadelphia. He was able to persuade the Board of Return judges to disregard all 5000 votes from that polling place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Boston Evening Transcript&lt;/ref&gt; The seven Whig judges on the Board, however, met separately and made certificates to their party candidates in Congress and in the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1838 Buckshot War|url=http://gluedideas.com/content-collection/encyclopedia-americana-4/1838-Buckshot-War.html|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They recognized the four Whig candidates in the Northern Liberties District, which in turn would give the majority of the House of Representatives to the Whigs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  This majority was crucial to the party. With it they would have control of both branches of the Legislature. This would allow them the ability to control all appointments if Porter's election was successfully contested. When the returns were received by Burrows, he immediately claimed them as the legal and official returns and sent them to the House of Representatives.

==The night of December 4, 1838==

===In the House of Representatives===
The House of Representatives met on the night of December 4, where the Clerk of the House, [[Francis R. Shunk]] began with the usual roll call. However, after the names of the members from Philadelphia were read, [[Charles Pray (Philadelphia)|Charles Pray]], a claimed member from Philadelphia said that the four members from the Northern Liberties District were not legally elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About the Buckshot War|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/12/18/106307239.pdf|accessdate=May 18, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 18, 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, he produced his own set of election returns, that had been legally certified. The Whigs demanded that the names of the four Philadelphia members be given their seats. On the other side, the Democrats claimed that Burrows had prepared legal returns that only benefited his party. In response to these two sets of returns being produced, Thaddeus Stevens, the leader of the Whig and Anti-Masonic party in Legislature, made a motion that the House proceed to elect a speaker.&lt;ref name="New York Times, 1887"&gt;New York Times, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amidst the confusion the two bodies elected a speaker,  with the Democrats electing [[William Hopkins]] on a [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll-call]] and the party behind Stevens electing [[Thomas S.S Cunningham]] by a [[voice vote|viva voce vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buckshot War|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Lalor/llCy162.html#V.1,|work=Library of Economics and Liberty|publisher=New York: Maynard, Merrill, and Co.|author1=Frédéric Bastiat |author2=Gustave de Molinari |author3=Henry George |author4=J. B. Say |author5=Francis A. Walker |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After both parties adjourned until the next day, Steven's party went to the Senate Chamber, where Whigs had the majority.

===Unrest in the Senate===
While at the Senate, the atmosphere became that of negativity towards Stevens and his party. While organizing the chamber, a contested seat caught the attention of the large crowd surrounding the ground. [[Charles Brown (congressman)|Charles Brown]], a Democrat, contested the seat of [[James Hanna]], a Whig, on the account of gross fraud.&lt;ref name="New York Times, 1887"/&gt;  However, the speaker of the House [[Charles B. Penrose]] admitted Hanna to his seat, which subsequently outraged Democrats in the crowd for not recognizing or legitimatizing Brown's allegation. It was claimed that the crowd could be heard shouting, "Kill Burrows!", "Kill Stevens!", "Kill Penrose!"&lt;ref name="Boston Evening Transcript, 1990"&gt;Boston Evening Transcript, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  After much aggravation, the crowd broke through the bar of the Senate and headed towards the three Whigs. It was at this time that they had already escaped through the back window of the Senate, in fear of their safety.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Buckshot War, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that the riot was led by the infamous "Balty" Sowers, a gang member from Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="New York Times, 1887"/&gt;  Democrats denied any involvement with Sowers, however, a variety of sources state that his mission was to assassinate Stevens, Burrows and Penrose- all avid Whig enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="Boston Evening Transcript, 1990"/&gt; Hence, suspicions arose around whether Democrats in Pennsylvania were trying to sabotage their opponents.

==Militia and aftermath==
After the commotion in the Senate Chamber, both parties still had no quorum, and remained at odds. The party under Stevens was forced to stay at Wilson's Hotel for their meetings, and out of fear continued aggravation, Governor Ritner demanded militia be brought in to the Capitol. In the fourth article of the [[United States Constitution]], it declares that every state in the Union will be provided aid against domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brinkley|first=Alan|title=The Unfinished Nation|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=A–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Ritner looked at a federal level for assistance. He asked federal troop leader Captain Sumner to bring his troops to Harrisburg, however, the Captain refused on the grounds that the commotion was strictly a result of the political issues belonging to the state.&lt;ref name="Boston Evening Transcript, 1990"/&gt;  When Ritner tried again to insist for help, this time from President [[Martin Van Buren]] himself, he was once again refused, with the president stating that interfering was beyond the federal government's legal duties and would be considered improper as it would be favouring one political party over the other.&lt;ref name="Boston Evening Transcript, 1990"/&gt;  In addition, the riots had not resulted in any sort of physical violence and consequently did not appear to be a threat to the welfare of Pennsylvania's citizens. Just as in the [[Dorr Rebellion]], when President [[John Tyler]] refused to send troops  to [[Rhode Island]] after the insurrection led by [[Thomas Wilson Dorr]],&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; the federal government refused to intervene in the Buckshot War because the domestic violence did not seem to be of a great enough threat, and therefore should be dealt with by the state itself. Thus, the Buckshot War was not just a political issue within its boundaries, but it also addressed the role that the federal government played in less-threatening state political issues, which was very minimal.

After being denied federal troops, Ritner then ordered the state militia under the command of General [[Robert Patterson]] to control any violent mobs. Without being supplied any proper ammunition from federal sources, Ritner ordered that the state troops be given thirteen rounds of [[buckshot]] cartridges,&lt;ref name="The Political Express"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swift|first=Robert|title=Pennsylvania`s Buckshot War|url=http://thepoliticalexpress.com/2011/05/17/pennsylvanias-buckshot-war/|work=The Political Express|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  giving the incident its name. His plan was disrupted, however, when a group of citizens under the command of General Diller, member of the Committee of Safety, took control of the militia's arsenal and began using it against the Governor and his supporters.&lt;ref name="New York Times, 1887"/&gt;  It was at this time that support for Ritner and Stevens had declined. The proprietor of Wilson's hotel closed his door to Cunningham's party, with three of the party's members- [[Chester Butler]], [[John Montelius]] and [[John Sturdevant]], leaving later that week to go to Hopkins's party.&lt;ref name="New York Times, 1887"/&gt;  As a result of this switch, the Hopkins party now had a quorum, and slowly the latter party declined, with only the four members from Philadelphia and Thaddeus Stevens claiming its legality.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Economics and Liberty, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 25, 1838, the Senate recognized that the Hopkins party was the legal body of the House of Representatives, subsequently ending the Buckshot War.&lt;ref name="Probert Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Buckshot War |url=http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Buckshot+War&amp;offset=0 |work=Probert Encylopaedia |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117072430/http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Buckshot+War&amp;offset=0 |archivedate=November 17, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buckshot War increased Democratic support in Pennsylvania, which is reflected in the Pennsylvania gubernatorial election of 1841. During this election, Porter was re-elected over the Whig candidate, John Banks.  The election demonstrates the sentiments that the state citizens felt over the controversial events in December 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rubert |first=Russel |title=David Rittenhouse Porter |url=http://www.norristownpreservationsociety.org/David_Rittenhouse_Porter.html |work=Norris Town Preservation Society |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117211235/http://norristownpreservationsociety.org/David_Rittenhouse_Porter.html |archivedate=January 17, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Burrow's plan to use a second set of returns made by Whig judges and Ritner's call for state militia to protect his party, both men did what they could to protect the interests of their own party, rather than thinking about the state citizens as a whole. As a result of their un-democratic ideals, the gubernatorial election reflects how citizens decided to turn their support to the opposing party.

'''''Café com leite'' politics''' ({{IPA-pt|kaˈfɛ kõ ˈlejtʃi}}, "coffee with milk") was a term that referred to the domination of [[Politics of Brazil|Brazilian politics]] under the [[History of Brazil (1889–1930)|Old Republic]] (1889–1930) by the landed gentries of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] (dominated by the [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee industry]]) and [[Minas Gerais]] (dominated by [[dairy]] interests). São Paulo's coffee interests were by far the stronger of the pair.

The name alludes to the popular coffee beverage [[Café au lait|café com leite]], "coffee with milk", referring to the states' respectively dominant industry.&lt;ref name="Meade2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teresa A. Meade|title=A Brief History of Brazil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6Jw-KNq2QUC&amp;pg=PA123|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-7788-5|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Under [[Brazil]]'s Old Republic, the patron-client political machines of the countryside enabled agrarian [[oligarchy|oligarch]]s, especially coffee planters in the dominant state of São Paulo, to dominate state structures to their advantage, particularly the weak central state structures that effectively devolved power to local agrarian oligarchies.

Under the Old Republic, the politics of ''café com leite'' rested on the domination of the republic's politics by the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais &amp;mdash; the largest in terms of population and wealth. One can illustrate the extent of that domination by noting that the first presidents of the republic were from São Paulo and thereafter succeeded by an alternation between the outgoing governors of the two leading states in the presidency.

The politics of ''café com leite'' rested on an oligarchic system known as ''[[coronelismo]]''. Known as the "rule of the [[colonel]]s", this term referred to the classic [[boss system]] under which the control of [[patronage]] was centralized in the hands of a locally dominant oligarch known as a "colonel", particularly under Brazil's Old Republic, who would dispense favors in return for loyalty.

Meanwhile, other states resented this grip on the central state by São Paulo and Minas Gerais. The severe [[drought]] of 1877 in the Northeast and the ensuing economic collapse &amp;mdash; along with the [[Slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]] in the 1880s &amp;mdash; propelled the mass labor migration of [[Emancipation|emancipated]] slaves and other peasants from Northeast to Southeast, precipitating the decay of established [[sugar]] oligarchies of the North. With the concurrent growth of coffee in the Southeast, São Paulo, now emerging as the central state, began to increase in power under the Old Republic. Northeastern landowners bitterly opposed rival oligarchs in São Paulo, explaining their role in the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|1930 Revolution]].

In time, growing trade, commerce, and industry in São Paulo would serve to undermine the domination of the republic's politics by the landed gentries of the same state (dominated by the coffee industry) and Minas Gerais (dominated by dairy interests) &amp;mdash; known then by observers as the politics of ''café com leite''. Under [[Getúlio Vargas]], ushered into power by the middle class and agrarian oligarchies of peripheral states resentful of the coffee oligarchs, Brazil moved toward a more centralized state structure that has served to regularize and modernize state governments, moving toward more universal suffrage and secret ballots, gradually freeing Brazilian politics from the grips of ''coronelismo''.

However, the legacy of ''café com leite'' is still strongly visible. Brazilian politics is still known for being highly patrimonial, oligarchic, and personalistic and São Paulo and Minas Gerais remain the country's dominant states.

This nomination was given in the mid 20th century by History teachers to memorize the two states more easily, but the oligarchs from Minas Gerais were also coffee farmers, and dairy was not significant to the economical landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1051">The '''Central National Revolutionary Committee''' (ÚNRV) was an [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] resistance organization in [[Slovakia]] during the [[Second World War]]. The idea of forming the ÚNRV had been launched by the underground leadership of the [[Communist Party of Slovakia (1939)|Communist Party of Slovakia]] in late 1941. The committee was constituted, by cooperation between communists and bourgeois anti-fascists, in March 1942. In its initial stage ÚNRV failed to take a prominent role in Slovak politics. The committee was however revived by the Communist Party, as the party opted for a broader approach in building a national front. By April–May 1943, the ÚNRV was crushed by the state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CPCz CC, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CPS CC.

Membership is open to the original signatories and "all other peace-loving states" that accept the terms and obligations set forth in the [[UN Charter]] and, "in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations". According to Chapter II of the UN Charter, in order to be admitted to the UN, a country must first be recommended by the [[UN Security Council]] and then approved by vote of the [[UN General Assembly]]. In addition, the admission must not be opposed by any of the five [[permanent members of the UN Security Council]] ([[China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]), sometimes referred to as the Permanent Five or P5.

Admission to membership in the UN is regarded as an important indicator of [[sovereignty]] and legitimate statehood, especially for [[microstate]]s. Some states have governments that are unofficially recognized as independent, such as [[Taiwan]], but have not been admitted to the UN due to a veto by a P5 member. During the [[Cold War]], the United States and [[Soviet Union]] did not allow rival blocs to be admitted to the UN. When they began letting those countries join, it led to a period of great expansion of UN membership, especially as the number colonies gaining independence increased.

Chapter II also provides for the suspension and expulsion of member states, and for the restoration of rights, by the UN General Assembly upon recommendation from the UN Security Council. Taiwan has questioned the legality of [[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758]], which declared China as the legitimate holder of the Chinese seat, since the resolution expelled the Taiwanese delegation without a recommendation initiated by the UN Security Council (of which Taiwan was a member). In 2005, [[Israel]] called for [[Iran]] to be expelled from the UN based on the position that Iran had "persistently violated" the principles of the UN Charter by calling for Israel's destruction, thus meeting the criteria for expulsion defined in Chapter II, Article 6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4382594.stm Israel urges UN to exclude Iran], BBC News, 27 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21687">The '''Charlotte Three''', consisting of [[Thomas James Reddy|T.J. Reddy]], James Grant, and Charles Parker, were a group of men arrested and convicted in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] for the burning of Lazy B Stables, a horse stable. The burning took place on September 24, 1968, one year after Lazy B Stables was integrated. All three men were arrested and implicated in the arson on December 1971, a full three years after the incident.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"&gt;{{harvp|Michalowski|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men were eventually convicted for their presumed actions, and were unsuccessful in having their appeals accepted, with the Supreme Court rejecting their motions.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"&gt;{{harvp|Waller|2002|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were all well known radical activists in Charlotte and some people claimed their arrest was aimed at stopping their political motives. Many observers believed that this case was a representation of the still heavily racist [[Southern United States]] of the 1970s, and the various underhanded methods prosecutors were willing to utilize to obtain convictions against African Americans.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"/&gt; The Charlotte Three were victims in the eyes of some, of an American South that was still reeling from widespread integration and general mistrust in Black affairs. The men were held against their will incorrectly not for crimes that they did not commit, but because of the social change they worked hard to attain. Finally, in 1979, North Carolina Jim Hunt commuted all three men's sentences after a vigorous campaign by state, national, and international activists on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grimsley|2003|pp=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charlotte ==

Charlotte, North Carolina had a reputation as a forward-thinking city in that it wasn't supposed to have the same racial discrimination that the cities in the [[Deep South]] had.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"&gt;{{harvp|Kusmer|Trotter|2009|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte was called a "New South city" but many of its residents still harbored the same racial discrimination, and "clung to Jim Crow segregation" as strongly as residents of Mobile, Alabama and Jackson, Mississippi, stereotypical anti-black cities.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt; African American dissent towards racism was however very prevalent in Charlotte, as the landmark case [[Brown v. Board of Education]] arose from a school district around Charlotte, and Reginald Hawkins spearheaded protests against segregation in the cities public and private institutions.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt; When residents in Charlotte in January 1965 filed the court case [[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]], the car of civil rights leader "[[Julius Chambers]] was blown to bits" and a year later, "bombs exploded at the homes of four more civil rights leaders".&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt;

== Biographical background ==

One of the residents of Charlotte who had experienced much racial discrimination in his lifetime was T.J. Reddy, who was enrolled in the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]].&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt; T.J. had been a poet and playwright who used his talents to help him pursue his goal of being an urban activist.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"/&gt; He was with his girlfriend Vicky Minar, when he "happened upon a particularly humiliating experience of racial injustice" at the Lazy B Stables.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_194"/&gt; In September 1967, Reddy, his girlfriend, and a group of friends went to Lazy B to enjoy their free time by horseback riding. When the group arrived at the stable, they were rejected from being able to ride since they were black.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"/&gt; Since Reddy did not want to make a scene, he decided to leave and not do anything about the social injustice he just encountered.

After "following traditional protest strategies", the group returned mixed, with whites and blacks, and were allowed to ride the horses the next day.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"&gt;{{harvp|Kusmer|Trotter|2009|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddy was a man who did not like to be treated unfairly or in a derogatory manner, as evidenced by his poetry "ain't nothing funny bout a cracker/calling me a n*****".&lt;ref name="Reddy_58"&gt;{{harvp|Reddy|1974|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he would not seek to create fights when unnecessary, as he liked to "keep his nose/just above" implying that he would not resort to arguments when the matter was cleared.&lt;ref name="Reddy_58"/&gt; Charles Parker, another black man who accompanied Reddy to the stable, was able to ride in public while being watched by the media, thus Reddy believed the matter to be closed.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; Reddy left the incident because in his mind; "management had a change of heart and was willing to allow black people to ride".&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; Parker had been an honors student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and was engaged in antiwar activism through his clubs and activities, and was linked to the movement of "black consciousness".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"&gt;{{harvp|Grimsley|2003|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Another Civil Rights activist who was charged and convicted in the Lazy B Stables case was Dr. James Earl Grant, a dedicated activist against racial discrimination. Though Grant was from [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and received his doctorate degree from Penn State, he was very active in the South's racial playing field, especially that of North Carolina's.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; On May 11, 1970, three white males murdered a black man, Henry Marrow, a father of three children who lived in [[Oxford, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; When news spread that Henry had been murdered, Blacks from across the country, along with Grant, decided they were fed up and organized protests. Most wanted to obtain justice through the tried and true legal system, however a group of "black Vietnam veterans" took matters into their own hands and decided to bomb white businesses in Oxford.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_195"/&gt; Neither Grant nor Reddy were involved in the acts of violence against the white owned businesses, but had their fates sealed when a police officer decided to pull over a car driven by two African Americans while exiting Oxford.

== Alfred Hood and David Washington ==

On May 15, 1970, police officers in Oxford, NC arrested Alfred Hood and David Washington for possessing "seven sticks of dynamite, two rifles, and a pistol".&lt;ref name="Kusmer_196"&gt;{{harvp|Kusmer|Trotter|2009|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were friends affiliated with James Grant and told authorities later that Grant had told the two to drive up to Charlotte with their supplies.&lt;ref name="Schutz_170"&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City Manager of Charlotte, Ragland, remembered Grant as someone who "was an expert in starting fires…he could start a fire in a rainstorm".&lt;ref name="Schutz_170"/&gt; Hood and Washington were subsequently jailed for possessing such deadly weapons, however after a short period of time, the two "jumped bail, and fled to Canada" where they were eventually returned on warrants.&lt;ref name="Waller_126"&gt;{{harvp|Waller|2002|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the two were apprehended a second time, they decided to cut a deal with the prosecutor that was perceived in the black community as indicative of the social climate of the time period. The men had their general living expenditures paid for, and after their testimony, would be relocated completely all on the government's dime.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_196"/&gt;

What Hood and Washington offered for this unique package was the ability to bring in one of the most influential leaders for the movement of reducing racism, James Grant. They testified in April 1972 that Grant had "encouraged them to skip bond" and even helped them "to cross the border into Canada" so that the two could not be extradited back to the United States.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_196"/&gt; The prosecutor had believed that Grant had "trained these little kids…they were the ones doing the big stuff" while Grant was able to sit "behind the scenes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant ended up being convicted of conspiracy and helping out fugitives, and was sentenced to ten years in a federal penitentiary.

Since the prosecutor wanted more from Hood and Washington, he pressed them further, and allegedly started to offer the two men cash for their support in bringing justice to the Charlotte Three for their presumed role in the burning of Lazy B Stables. Assistant Attorney General [[Robert C. Mardian]] "approved a deal giving Hood and Washington cash payments of four thousand dollars each" which was to help persuade the two men to say what the prosecutor wanted to hear.&lt;ref name="Kusmer_196"/&gt; What the prosecutor wanted was to be able obtain a conviction of the Charlotte Three who were all civil rights leaders and proponents for the end of racism in Charlotte.&lt;ref name="Waller_127"/&gt; The three were indicted in January 1972 and this set off a racial firestorm.

The prosecutor however denies this claim and rather implies that Hood and Washington were willing to testify against the Charlotte Three on their own without any outside pressures or rewards. The prosecutor asked the pair "whose driving around in a Cadillac while you're stuck in here" and that the leaders are not doing anything while the pair are "stuck in here paying the price".&lt;ref name="Schutz_174_184"&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|pp=174, 184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI also believed the truth of what Hood and Washington said in that Charlotte FBI Agent Koon wanted to transform Grant into an informant on his other troublemaking friends, but that did not end up panning out.&lt;ref name="Schutz_174_184"/&gt;

== Court case ==

With three black defendants, the lawyers for the Charlotte Three requested that since the grand jury "excludes blacks from participation since it is derived from voter registration laws", the case should be dropped.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Judge Snepp however refuted that point, as he claimed that blacks could register to vote as they pleased. The defendants' lawyers saw this as a systematic attempt to stop blacks from being able to register to vote. At the time, black voters had to take voter tests, unlike their white counterparts, implying an unfair situation.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Similarly, the prosecutor's office decided to appoint no black or Jewish jurors, with a near deaf old black lady as the lone exception.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Since the defense had to waste all their challenges and objections that they are legally allowed to have by removing clearly incompetent jury members, they were left at a considerable disadvantage in the courtroom.

Reporters and journalists questioned the evidence and workings of the case.&lt;ref name="twopaid"&gt;AP. 1974. 'Paper Says Two Paid to Testify'. The Dispatch, March 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the white prosecutor's office did follow all the laws and did not do anything illegal, "the court empaneled a seriously prejudiced jury of white Southern Baptists".&lt;ref name="twopaid"/&gt; During the trial, the only real piece of evidence other than the falsified witness testimony by Hood and Washington was a picture of a bottle that was presumed to be an unused firebomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Waller|2002|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bottle however was never actually placed into the evidence files of the case since it was mysteriously "lost" by the fire marshals, and that the "original photograph was staged".&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Though there seemed to be very little evidence to support the prosecutor's claims, the jury returned a guilty verdict within one hour of the case's arguments ending. T.J. Reddy was sentenced to 20 years, James Grant got 25 years, and Charles Parker received 10 years (8).&lt;ref name="twopaid"/&gt;

The sentencing of the Charlotte Three emphasized a clear dichotomy: the white jurors wanted to be fair in trial, but were worried of the social repercussions that would come about from supporting these black men. There was a fear of a "black revolution" in the South at that time, and by imprisoning the leaders of black movements across the South, whites were able to contain that movement and stymie it.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Many saw the decision as one that favored the persecuting of black leaders for their black revolution ideas, in that Judge Snepp sentenced Grant to 25 years due to his education.

== Problems with testimony ==

Judge Snepp said that since Grant was so educated, with a doctorate, he "showed no gratitude to society" and since he was so well educated, was "an extremely dangerous revolutionary beyond rehabilitation."&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Reddy was in the eyes of Snepp, dangerous since he was a poet and able to use his talents to appeal to the heart of blacks and revolutionize their ways of thinking. Snepp gave Parker the lightest sentence since he was not deemed as harmful as the rest, as Parker was thought to be an "easily led young Black dupe."&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt;

Snepp knew that Hood and Washington "are not exactly A-1 citizens" yet he decided to use their testimony as a key component in the conviction of the Charlotte Three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Myerson|1978|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credibility given to Washington and his statements about Grant and the Charlotte Three were not questioned during the trial, but should have been. He was the "prime suspect in five murders in the Charlotte area" and yet his testimony was used to put men with clean criminal backgrounds in jail.&lt;ref name="Schutz_173"&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; With crime rates rising, famed philosopher Angela Davis's publicized fight with the FBI, George Jackson's "meteoric rise to militant fame as…Black Party Minister of Defense", and the University of Wisconsin's math building bombing, the crimes of Washington were overlooked.&lt;ref name="Schutz_173"/&gt; They were not taken seriously enough since the aforementioned crimes were politically motivated, however Washington's were not, and as put by the District Attorney Tom Moore; "sometimes you must go to hell to get the devil".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was said to have used "heroin, LSD, and large quantities of alcohol and marijuana" which cast considerable doubt on his credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schutz|1999|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

Though the Charlotte Three had been convicted and imprisoned, the general support from Charlotte and the members in the men's' lives never stopped. In the Herald Journal, Grant's father mentions that there were "vigils…held in front of the historic Old State House in Hartford…to keep the case alive".&lt;ref&gt;AP. 1978. 'Vigils Continue in Freedom Fight'. Herald Journal, May 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The men felt they were representing how racially charged Charlotte had become, and its residents did not want the city to be tainted by corrupt judicial officers. In the Black Panther newspaper, a letter campaign by the North Carolina Political Prisoners Committee started to prosper. Local residents were urged to send letters in support of the Charlotte Three to Governor Hunt of North Carolina in an effort to have the men's sentences commuted.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Huey. 1974. 'Community Demands Free the Charlotte 3'. The Black Panther, April 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Reddy received support from his fellow poets, such as Sandra Beck of Charlotte who wrote that she had met "few people so creatively and constructively oriented" and who gave his encouragement to many "young writers and authors".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"/&gt; Ironically, Reddy was labeled as one who was constructively oriented and creative, yet he was accused of demolishing a construction through the brute force method of arson, which has no creativity to it whatsoever. He also had the whole support of the state's art community "who strongly backed the black poet".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"/&gt;

James Grant had received support from individuals in both the North and the South, including Connecticut Governor Ella Grasso, who called her counterpart in North Carolina on Grant's behalf.&lt;ref name="Grimsley_149_150"&gt;{{harvp|Grimsley|2003|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant also had the support of famous Southern prison rights leader L.C. Dorsey who claimed that Grant's imprisonment was a result of wanting to disagree with "a senseless war, racial oppression at home, and the plight of those who had taxation without representation".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_149_150"/&gt;

== Commuted sentence ==

Grant was eventually granted parole from [[Jim Hunt|Governor Hunt]] of North Carolina reducing his sentence, and Reddy and Parker were also set free.&lt;ref name="endvigil"&gt;AP. 1979. 'Parents of Charlotte Three Members See End to Vigil'. Daytona Beach Morning Journal, July 23.&lt;/ref&gt; When Grant learned that he was about to be freed, since he had "made progress towards rehabilitation" in the eyes of the Governor instead of a full pardon, he said that "people have paid higher prices" than he has, and that he is fine with whatever decision he is granted.&lt;ref name="endvigil"/&gt; The sentences were not pardoned however by Governor Hunt, but rather commuted, implying that the men were still guilty of the burning in the eyes of the judicial system.

== Larger context of politics, race, and the civil rights movement ==

The Charlotte Three case was an event that epitomized the larger issues of politics, race, and the civil rights movement in the South. The commuting of the sentences for the men may not have actually been purely due to the reasons publicly stated, but instead for hidden political ones. In 1979, an election year, there was a lot of turmoil and Governor Hunt and the Democratic party were worried about the backlash that would ensue if the men were still imprisoned at the time of the election. Herbert N. Lape who was serving as the vice-chairman of the North Carolina state democratic party stated in a letter to Hunt that many people in the state view "the Charlotte Three [case] as [a] primarily white witch [hunt] that involved racial bigotry".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"/&gt; A secretary by the name of Joseph Grimsley also stated in a memo to Governor Hunt, "[the] state's repressive image is beginning to spill over in this administration to yours personally".&lt;ref name="Grimsley_184"/&gt;

The administration was in a position where it had to save face by reducing the sentences or else face the possibility of losing control to another party. The judge had originally given out the long sentences because he wanted to show that it was "the smashing of a dangerous Black revolution plot".&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; He hoped to set an example of the men, as he was worried of more of these plots in the future.

== Criticism ==

The case of the Charlotte Three was not something that was entirely unique; rather, as historian John Schutz argued, it was the ordinary in the mid 1900s South. By persecuting "black leaders for conventional crimes", the state could follow "civilized" methods that would instead of cause violence, put the leader in jail where he could no longer do any more leading.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; Expert Raymond Michalowski believes these persecutions of blacks were similar to those of the KKK or other "night riders of decades past" but instead of illegal henchmen carrying out the attacks, legal judges and prosecutors were doing so in the courts.&lt;ref name="Michalowski"/&gt; By charging the leaders with crimes, the state was able to make it seem like the leaders were not as viable as they claimed to be. This helped to mute some of the public support the leaders may have originally garnered. Though the South seemed to have overtly fixed its race problem after the passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|federal civil rights legislation in 1964-65]], it was covertly persecuting Black revolutionary leaders. The persecutions were not taking place out on the streets through public lynching as in times past, but instead through illegal backdoor deals supported by the judicial system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8892">The '''Demon Sheep''' or '''Demon Sheep ad''' is a political ad created as part of [[Carly Fiorina]]'s [[United States Senate election in California, 2010|2010 campaign]] for the [[United States Senate]].  The ad gained international attention for its characterization of Fiorina's opponent as a [[wolf in sheep's clothing]], portrayed by a man wearing a sheep costume with glowing red eyes.  Although opinion remains divided as to the effectiveness of the ad in supporting Fiorina's campaign, it is widely regarded as one of the most bizarre and memorable political advertisements ever devised.

==Background==
In 2010, Carly Fiorina, a businesswoman then best known as the former chief executive officer of [[Hewlett-Packard]] from 1999 to 2005, entered the race for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat then held by Democratic Senator [[Barbara Boxer]].  Among her opponents was [[Tom Campbell (California politician)|Tom Campbell]], a former congressman who had served five terms in the U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] between 1989 and 2001, representing California's [[California's 12th congressional district|12th]] and [[California's 15th congressional district|15th]] congressional districts.  Early polling suggested that Campbell held a substantial lead over Fiorina.  For a promotional ad opposing Campbell, the Fiorina campaign turned to [[Fred Davis III|Fred Davis]], an advertising executive who had gained notoriety for his 2008 ad depicting then presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] as a celebrity akin to [[Britney Spears]] and [[Paris Hilton]].  The ad, released on Fiorina's campaign website in February 2010, quickly gained international attention.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;"Fiorina's 'Demon Sheep' Went Down In Political Ad Infamy", from [[National Public Radio]]'s ''It's All Politics: Political News from NPR'', 7 May 2015[https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/07/404977168/-tbt-fiorinas-demon-sheep-went-down-in-political-ad-infamy www.npr.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Demon Sheep==
The ad, which runs about three minutes and twenty seconds, opens with an idyllic scene of sheep running and grazing in a sunny meadow, as a female narrator extols the supposed virtues of fiscally conservative politicians: "purity, piety: our fiscal conservative leaders.  Men we admire; aspire to be: wholesome, honorable, true believers.  Men like Tom Campbell, who would never lead us astray; his pedestal, so high..."  From behind the hillside, a cut-out animation in the style of [[Terry Gilliam]] depicts a sheep rising into the sky on top of a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[column]].  Suddenly, the sky darkens, storm clouds roll in, and lightning strikes the pillar, which vanishes.  The sheep then tumbles end-over-end in slow motion, as ominous music begins to play, and the original narrator gives way to a stern male voice (veteran actor [[Robert Davi]]), questioning Campbell's record and credentials as a fiscal conservative.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

The next part of the ad blames Campbell, who was California's Director of Finance from 2004 to 2005, for California's budget woes, as images of Campbell are alternated with footage of sheets of money being printed, played at increasing speed, and images of pigs, sheep, out-of-business signs, and a close-up of the word "deficit" in a dictionary.  The narrator asks, "who would remember the Tom Campbell Budget?" as pictures of people from various walks of life appear, each of them wearing a concerned expression; the narrator answers his own question: "we would."  As hundred-dollar bills float by in the background, the narrator castigates Campbell for having supported various taxes, especially an increase in the gasoline tax, proposed following the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].  Images of Campbell now alternate with footage of a sheep chewing its cud at increasingly rapid speeds.  In a sarcastic tone of voice, the narrator repeatedly asks "Tom" whether his actions or stances on various issues were "fiscally conservative".  Campbell's support for other taxes, and having been "critical of the [[Bush tax cuts]]" are also mentioned, as an image of Carly Fiorina's signature on the [[Americans for Tax Reform#Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Taxpayer Protection Pledge]] appears.  The ad calls Campbell the "only Republican candidate" not to sign the pledge.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

At this point, the ad returns to footage of sheep in a meadow, and Campbell is described as an "FCINO: Fiscal Conservative In Name Only", while a man wearing a sheep costume with glowing red eyes peers out from behind a tree.  The "Demon Sheep" then crawls on his hands and knees amongst the flock, pretending to eat grass, and repeatedly making sinister glances at the camera.  The narrator explicitly calls Campbell a wolf in sheep's clothing, who has set California on the path to "bankruptcy and higher taxes," as the words "has he fooled you?" appear in the foreground.  The narrator asks, "might there be a better choice?"  The ad abruptly changes tone, shifting to an office setting, with an unnamed woman in a business suit meeting with clients.  The woman is seen only indirectly, but implied to be Carly Fiorina, and the narrator describes her in an approving voice, as a hard-working and proven fiscal conservative.  The ad closes with dramatic music and the address of Fiorina's campaign website.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

==Reception==
Although the full ad was never broadcast on television, it rapidly garnered national and international attention, and was featured on broadcast news as an example of an ad that was either absurdly juvenile or a brilliant lampoon, depending on one's point of view.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;  ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s'' Christopher Bream described it as "confusing and sloppy."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bream, "Violence of the Lambs: the weird genius behind Carly Fiorina's "demon sheep" ad", in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 4 February 2010[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/02/violence_of_the_lambs.single.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Jason Linkins of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' called it "Bonkers."  [[National Public Radio]]'s Jessica Taylor describes it as "one of the most infamous political ads of all time."  Michael Scherer of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' suggested viewing the ad "by pressing play on your cassette tape of [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[The Dark Side of the Moon|Dark Side of The Moon]] just as you click play on YouTube."&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;  However, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist Gail Collins refers to it as "one of the all-time great attack videos,"&lt;ref&gt;Gail Collins, "Beyond the Demon Sheep", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 7 May 2015[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/opinion/gail-collins-beyond-the-demon-sheep.html].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Week]]'' asks whether the "Demon Sheep" was "the best bad campaign ad ever."&lt;ref name="Week"&gt;"The best bad campaign ad ever? Relive Carly Fiorina's glowing-eyed demon sheep video" in ''[[The Week]]'', 4 May 2015[http://theweek.com/speedreads/553129/best-bad-campaign-ad-ever-relive-carly-fiorinas-glowingeyed-demon-sheep-video].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The ad initially appeared to backfire, as Campbell's poll numbers showed his lead over Fiorina increasing after the ad was released.&lt;ref name="Linkins"&gt;Jason Linkins, "Campbell Surges Ahead In CA Senate Race, Despite/Because Of Bonkers Demon Sheep Ad", in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 28 April 2010[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/26/campbell-surges-ahead-in_n_478843.html www.huffingtonpost.com].&lt;/ref&gt;  But either because, or perhaps in spite of the "Demon Sheep" ad, Fiorina soon pulled ahead and defeated Campbell in the Republican primary by a wide margin.  For her campaign against Barbara Boxer, Davis created another memorable ad, depicting Boxer "as a bloated, power-hungry blimp floating over the Capitol and California."&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;  However, in the general election, Fiorina lost to the Democratic incumbent by ten percentage points.  Fiorina would later [[Carly Fiorina presidential campaign, 2016|seek the Republican nomination]] for President in the 2016 election.

Also in the 2010 election cycle, Davis created a spot for [[Christine O'Donnell]], the Republican nominee for the [[United States Senate special election in Delaware, 2010|special Senate election in Delaware]], featuring her denying that she was a witch.  She lost by a wide margin in the general election.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

In 1916, she became the first female [[magistrate]] in Canada, and in the [[British Empire]]. She is best known for her contributions to Canadian feminism, specifically to the question of whether women were "persons" under Canadian law.

Murphy is known as one of "[[The Famous Five (Canada)|The Famous Five]]" (also called "The Valiant Five")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kome|first=Penney|title=Women of Influence: Canadian Women and Politics|year=1985|publisher=Doubleday Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-385-23140-4|pages=31–32|url={{google books|hBQqAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=31}}|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a group of Canadian women's rights activists that also included [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], [[Nellie McClung]], [[Louise McKinney]] and [[Irene Parlby]]. In 1927, the women launched the "Persons Case," contending that women could be "qualified persons" eligible to sit in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]]. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that they were not. However, upon appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council]], the court of last resort for Canada at that time, the women won their case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.historicacanada.ca/content/heritage-minutes/emily-murphy? |title=Emily Murphy |website=Heritage Minutes |publisher=Historica Canada |access-date=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there has been some criticism of her later work, mainly for her role in the [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] and her allegations that a ring of immigrants from other countries, particularly China, would corrupt the white race by getting Canadians hooked on drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Yedlin |first=Deborah |date=18 March 2009 |title=To some, it's the Infamous Five |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/to-some-its-the-infamous-five/article746377/ |newspaper=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''The Black Candle'', she wrote: "It is hardly credible that the average Chinese peddler has any definite idea in his mind of bringing about the downfall of the white race, his swaying motive being probably that of greed, but in the hands of his superiors, he may become a powerful instrument to that end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bourrie |first=Mark |date=30 September 2012 |title=A  pioneer in the war on pot |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/mark-bourrie-on-emily-murphy-a-pioneer-in-the-war-on-pot |newspaper=National Post |location=Toronto |access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Emily Murphy was born in [[Innisfil|Cookstown, Ontario]], the third child of Isaac and Emily Ferguson. Isaac Ferguson was a successful businessman and property owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/030001-1111-e.html |title=Emily Ferguson Murphy |website=Celebrating Women's Achievements |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |date=2 October 2000 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Murphy frequently joined her two older brothers Thomas and Gowan in their adventures; their father encouraged this behaviour and often had his sons and daughters share responsibilities equally.

Murphy grew up under the influence of her maternal grandfather, [[Ogle Robert Gowan|Ogle R. Gowan]] who was a politician that founded a local branch of the [[Orange Order of Canada|Orange Order]] in 1830 and two uncles who were a Supreme Court justice and a Senator, respectively. Her brother also became a lawyer and another member of the Supreme Court. Her family were prominent members of society and she benefited from parents who supported their daughter receiving formal academic education. Her uncle was [[Thomas Roberts Ferguson]], an MP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Charters|editor1-first=C. V.|title=A history of Peel County: to mark its centenary|date=1967|publisher=The County of Peel|location=Brampton ON|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was related to [[James Robert Gowan]], who was a lawyer, judge, and senator.

Murphy attended [[Bishop Strachan School]], an exclusive Anglican private school for girls in Toronto and, through a friend, she met her future husband Arthur Murphy, who was 11 years her senior.

In 1887, they married, and subsequently had four daughters: Madeleine, Evelyn, Doris and Kathleen. Doris died. After Doris' death, the family decided to try a new setting and moved west to [[Swan River, Manitoba]] in 1903 and then to [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]] in 1907.

== Activism ==

===Dower Act===
[[File:emilymurphy.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of Emily Murphy in the monument to [[The Famous Five (Canada)|The Famous Five]], Parliament Hill, Ottawa]]

While Arthur was working as an Anglican priest, Murphy explored her new surroundings and became increasingly aware of the poverty that existed.

At the age of 40, when her children became independent and began their separate lives, Murphy began to actively organize women's groups where the isolated housewives could meet and discuss ideas and plan group projects. In addition to these organizations, Murphy began to speak openly and frankly about the disadvantaged and the poor living conditions that surrounded their society.

Her strong interest in the rights and protection of women and children intensified when she was made aware of an unjust experience of an Albertan woman whose husband sold the family farm; the husband then abandoned his wife and children who were left homeless and penniless. At that time, property laws did not leave the wife with any [[legal recourse]].

This case motivated Murphy to create a campaign that assured the property rights of married women. With the support of many rural women, Murphy began to pressure the Alberta government to allow women to retain the rights of their land. In 1916, Murphy successfully persuaded the [[Alberta legislature]] to pass the Dower Act that would allow a woman legal rights to one third of her husband's property. Murphy's reputation as a women's rights activist was established by this first political victory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Appointment as female magistrate===

[Rear, L-R]: Senators Iva Campbell Fallis, Cairine Wilson (Ottawa).]]

Murphy's success in the fight for the Dower Act, along with her work through the Local Council of Women and her increasing awareness of women's rights, influenced her request for a female magistrate in the women's court.

In 1916, Murphy, along with a group of women, attempted to observe a trial for women who were {{not a typo|labelled}} prostitutes and were arrested for "questionable" circumstances. The women were asked to leave the courtroom on the claims that the statement was not "fit for mixed company". This outcome was unacceptable to Murphy and she protested to the provincial Attorney General. "If the evidence is not fit to be heard in mixed company," she argued, "then the government must set up a special court presided over by women, to try other women".

Murphy's request was approved and she became the first woman police magistrate for the [[British Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Her appointment as a judge, however, became the cause for her greatest adversity concerning women within the law. In her first case in Alberta on July 1, 1916, she found the prisoner guilty. The prisoner's lawyer called into question her right to pass sentence since she was not legally a person. The Provincial Supreme Court denied the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Women's Book of World Records and Achievements|last=Horowitz |first=Janice M.|editor-last=O'Neill |editor-first=Lois Decker|publisher=Anchor Press |year=1979|page=352|chapter=Women in Law and the Justice System|isbn=0-385-12733-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persons case ===
In 1917, she headed the battle to have women declared as "persons" in Canada, and, consequently, qualified to serve in the Senate. Lawyer, Eardley Jackson, challenged her position as judge because women were not considered "persons" under the [[British North America Act 1867]]. This understanding was based on a British common law ruling of 1876, which stated, "women were eligible for pains and penalties, but not rights and privileges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kaye |first=Frances W. |editor-last=Wishart |editor-first=David J. |title=Persons Case |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |url={{google books|rtRFyFO4hpEC|plainurl=yes|page=320}} |date=2004 |p=320 |isbn=0-80324-787-7|access-date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, she presided over the inaugural conference of the [[Federated Women's Institutes of Canada]], which passed a resolution calling for a female senator to be appointed. The [[National Council of Women of Canada|National Council of Women]] and the Montreal Women's Club also supported the resolution, selecting Murphy as their preferred candidate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canadian Women: A History|last=Prentice|first=Alison|last2=Bourne|first2=Paula|last3=Brandt|first3=Gail Cuthbert|last4=Light|first4=Beth|last5=Mitchinson|first5=Wendy|last6=Black|first6=Naomi|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1988|isbn=|location=[[Toronto]]|pages=282–83|quote=|author-link2=Paula Bourne|author-link5=Wendy Mitchinson|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy began to work on a plan to ask for clarification of how women were regarded in the BNA act and how they were to become Senators. In order for her question to be considered, she needed at least five citizens to submit the question as a group.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} She enlisted the help of four other Albertan women and on 27 August 1927 she and human rights activist [[Nellie McClung]], ex MLA [[Louise McKinney]], women's rights campaigners [[Henrietta Edwards]] and [[Irene Parlby]] signed the petition to the [[Federal cabinet of Canada|federal Cabinet]],  asking that the federal government [[Reference question|refer the issue]] to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The women's petition set out two questions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/206/301/lac-bac/famous_five-ef/www.lac-bac.gc.ca/famous5/05300301_e.html |title=Petition of August 27, 1927, containing the five Alberta women's two questions |website=The Famous Five |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |date=27 August 1927 |access-date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the federal government re-framed it as one question, asking the Supreme Court: "Does the word 'person' in Section 24 of the British North America Act include female persons?" The campaign became known as ''The Persons Case'' and reached the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in March 1928. The Court held that women were not qualified to sit in the Senate. The five women then appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain.  On 18 October 1929, in a decision called [[Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)]], the Privy Council declared that 'persons' in Section 24 of the BNA Act of 1867 should be interpreted to include both males and females therefore women were eligible to serve in the Senate.

Despite the ruling, Murphy was never appointed to the Senate. The Prime Minister at the time, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], and Murphy was a partisan Conservative, so she was passed over in favour of philanthropist [[Cairine Wilson]] in 1930. After the Conservatives under [[R. B. Bennett]] won the [[Canadian federal election, 1930|1930 federal election]], Murphy was denied to chance to sit in the Senate again in 1931, because the vacancy had been caused by the death of a Catholic senator, and Murphy was a Protestant. Murphy would die in 1935 without fulfilling her dream of sitting in Canada's upper chamber.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The women were known as the Famous Five and were considered leaders in education for social reform and women's rights. They challenged convention and established an important precedent in Canadian history. In Canada's Senate Chamber, the five women are honoured with a plaque that reads, "To further the cause of womankind these five outstanding pioneer women caused steps to be taken resulting in the recognition by the Privy Council of women as persons eligible for appointment to the Senate of Canada." Murphy, along with the rest of the Famous Five, was featured on the back of one of the Canadian 50 dollar bills issued in 2004 as part of the Canadian Journey Series. In October 2009, the Senate voted to name Murphy and the rest of the Five Canada's first "honorary senators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/albertas-famous-five-named-honorary-senators/article1320491/ |title=Alberta's Famous Five named honorary senators |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=11 October 2009 |access-date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
===Drugs and race===
[[File:BlackCandle.jpg|thumb|200px|The cover of Murphy's 1922 book ''The Black Candle'']]
Although Murphy's views on race changed over the course of her life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Alisa Dawn |last=Smith |title=Rethinking First-Wave Feminism Through the Ideas of Emily Murphy |type=MA thesis |publisher=University of Victoria |date=1997 |oclc=858586557 |p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; the perspective contained in her book ''The Black Candle'' is considered the most consequential because it played a role in creating a widespread "war on drugs mentality" leading to legislation that "defined addiction as a law enforcement problem".{{attribution needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name=Tooley36&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Jennifer |last=Tooley |title=Demon Drugs and Holy Wars: Canadian Drug Policy as Symbolic Action |type=MA thesis |publisher=University of New Brunswick |date=1999 |p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of articles in ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine under her pen name, "Janey Canuck", forms the basis of ''The Black Candle''. Using extensive anecdotes and "expert" opinion, ''The Black Candle'' depicts an alarming picture of [[drug abuse]] in Canada, detailing Murphy's understanding of the use and effects of [[opium]], [[cocaine]], and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]], as well as a "new menace", "[[cannabis (drug)|marihuana]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Emily F. |date=1922 |title=The Black Candle |chapter=Chapter XXIII. Marahuana - A New Menace |location=Toronto, Ontario |publisher=Thomas Allen Publisher |url={{google books|h7cyAQAAMAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=331}} |p=331 |access-date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy's concern with drugs began when she started coming into "disproportionate contact with Chinese people" in her courtroom because they were over-represented in the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Alisa Dawn |last=Smith |title=Rethinking First-Wave Feminism Through the Ideas of Emily Murphy |type=MA thesis |publisher=University of Victoria |date=1997 |oclc=858586557 |p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to professional expertise and her own observations, Murphy was also given a tour of [[opium den]]s in [[Chinatown (Vancouver)|Vancouver's Chinatown]] by [[Vancouver Police Department|local police detectives]].  Vancouver at the time was in the midst of a [[moral panic]] over drugs that was part of the anti-Oriental campaign that precipitated the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ian |last1=MacDonald |first2=Betty |last2=O'Keefe |title=Canadian Holy War: A Story of Clans, Tongs, Murder, and Bigotry |url={{google books|uRwR2xxM8BkC|plainurl=yes|page=9}} |location=Vancouver, British Columbia |publisher=Heritage House |date=2000 |pp=9&amp;ndash;21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian drug historian Catherine Carstairs has argued that Murphy's importance regarding drug policy has been "overstated". Although Murphy's anti-drug screeds were widely read and helped spread the drug panic across Canada, she was not respected by the Division of Narcotic Control because of the creative liberties she took in presenting research they had assisted her with. According to Carstairs, "There were insinuations in the records that the bureaucrats at the division of narcotic control did not think very highly of Emily Murphy and did not pay attention to what she was writing about, and they didn't consider her a particularly accurate or valuable source."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Schartz| last = Daniel| title = Marijuana was criminalized in 1923, but why?| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/marijuana-was-criminalized-in-1923-but-why-1.2630436| publisher =[[CBC News]]|date=3 May 2014 |access-date=18 December 2016 |quote=...it's understandable why people would later link the decision to ''The Black Candle''. But Carstairs says it's probably just happenstance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carstairs also avers that Murphy did not influence the drug panic in Vancouver, but that nevertheless "her articles did mark a turning point and her book&amp;nbsp;... brought the Vancouver drug panic to a larger Canadian audience".&lt;ref name=Carstairs&gt;{{cite journal |first=Catherine |last=Carstairs |title=Deporting "Ah Sin" to Save the White Race: Moral Panic, Racialization, and the Extension of Canadian Drug Laws in the 1920s |url=http://www.cbmh.ca/index.php/cbmh/article/view/1538/1532 |journal=Canadian Bulletin of Medical History |issn=0823-2105 |volume=16 |issue=1 |date=1999 |pp=71&amp;ndash;72 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725023913/http://www.cbmh.ca/index.php/cbmh/article/view/1538/1532 |archivedate=25 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Race permeates ''The Black Candle'', and is intricately entwined with the drug trade and addiction in Murphy's analysis. Yet she is ambiguous in her treatment of non-whites.&lt;ref name=Smith56&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Alisa Dawn |last=Smith |title=Rethinking First-Wave Feminism Through the Ideas of Emily Murphy |type=MA thesis |publisher=University of Victoria |date=1997 |oclc=858586557 |p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one passage, for example, she chastises whites who use the Chinese as "scapegoats",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Emily F. |date=1922 |title=The Black Candle |chapter=Chapter XIII. Girls as Pedlars |location=Toronto, Ontario |publisher=Thomas Allen Publisher |url={{google books|h7cyAQAAMAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=233}} |p=233 |access-date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while elsewhere, she refers to the Chinese man as a "visitor" in this country, and that "it might be wise to put him out" if it turns out that this visitor carries "poisoned lollipops in his pocket and feeds them to our children".&lt;ref name=Carstairs/&gt; Drug addiction, however, not the Chinese immigrant, is "a scourge so dreadful in its effects that it threatens the very foundations of civilization", and which laws therefore need to target for eradication.  Drugs victimize everyone, and members of all races perpetrate the drug trade, according to Murphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Emily F. |date=1922 |title=The Black Candle |chapter=Chapter VI.

In this scheme, the white race was facing degradation through [[miscegenation]], while the more prolific "black and yellow races may yet obtain the ascendancy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Constance |last=Backhouse |title=The White Women's Labor Laws: Anti-Chinese Racism in Early Twentieth-Century Canada |journal=Law and History Review |volume=14 |issue=2 |date=Fall 1996 |jstor=743786 |doi=10.2307/743786 |pp=315&amp;ndash;368}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus threatened to "wrest the leadership of the world from the British".&lt;ref name=Smith56/&gt;

Murphy's distaste for non-whites is reflected in scholarly debates, but what is not controversial is that ''The Black Candle'' was written "for the express purpose of arousing public demands for stricter drug legislation" and that in this she was to some degree successful.&lt;ref name=Tooley36/&gt; This motivation may have influenced her racial analysis by playing to the popular prejudices of her white audiences. On the other hand, she may have deliberately tried to distance herself from those prejudices, especially the ones propagated by the more vulgar and hysterical Asian exclusionists in [[British Columbia]] in order to maximize her own credibility and sway her more moderate readers.&lt;ref name=Carstairs/&gt;

===Eugenics movement===
During the early twentieth century, [[scientific knowledge]] emerged in the forefront of social importance. Advances in science and technology  were thought to hold answers to current and future social problems.

Murphy was among those who thought that societal problems like alcoholism, drug abuse and crime resulted from mental deficiencies. In a 1932 article titled "Overpopulation and Birth Control", she states: "over-population [is a] basic problem of all&amp;nbsp;... none of our troubles can even be allayed until this is remedied". As the politics behind the [[Second World War]] continued to develop, Murphy, who was a [[Pacifism|pacifist]], theorized that the only reason for war was that nations needed to fight for land to accommodate their growing populations. Her argument was that: if there was population control, people would not need as much land. Without the constant need for more land, war would cease to exist.

Her solution to these social issues was [[eugenics]]. Murphy supported selective breeding and the compulsory sterilization of those individuals who were considered mentally deficient. She believed that the mentally and socially inferior reproduced more than the "human thoroughbreds" and appealed to the [[Alberta Legislative Assembly]] for forced sterilization. In a petition, she wrote that mentally defective children were "a menace to society and an enormous cost to the state&amp;nbsp;... science is proving that mental defectiveness is a transmittable hereditary condition". She wrote to Minister of Agriculture and Health, [[George Hoadley (Alberta politician)|George Hoadley]] that two female "feeble-minded" mental patients had already bred several offspring. She called it "a neglect amounting to a crime to permit these two women to go on bearing children".

Due in part to her heavy advocacy of compulsory sterilization, thousands of Albertan men and women were sterilized without their knowledge or consent under the [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] before its repeal in 1972.

==Legacy==
Her legacy is disputed, with her important contributions to [[feminism]] being weighed against her racist and [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] views and her advocation of eugenics. In addition to being against immigration, she was a strong supporter of Alberta's legislation for the ''Sexual Sterilization of the Insane'' at a time when [[compulsory sterilization]] was practised in some North American jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Murphy |first=Emily |date=September 1932 |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/famous5/achievements/reading/sterilization_insane.html |title=Sterilization of the Insane |encyclopedia=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |archive-date=8 December 2010 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/2217/20101208161436/http://www.abheritage.ca/famous5/achievements/reading/sterilization_insane.html |access-date=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wong |first=Jan |date=17 April 1998 |title=Speech presented as part of the Famous Five Foundation Mentorship series |url=http://www.canuck.com/famous5/html/jan_wong__april_17__1998.html |archive-date=21 March 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321085700/http://www.canuck.com/famous5/html/jan_wong__april_17__1998.html |publisher=Famous 5 Foundation |access-date=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent memorializing of the Famous Five, such as the illustration on the back of the fifty-dollar bill, has been used as the occasion for re-evaluating Murphy's legacy. [[Legality of cannabis|Marijuana decriminalization]] activists especially have criticized Murphy as part of the movement to discredit [[Legal history of cannabis in Canada|marijuana prohibition]]. It has been speculated that today's drug laws are built on the racist foundations laid by Murphy and that the drug war has harmed more women than the Persons Case has benefited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Debra |last=Harper |title=Emily's Paradox |website=Cannabislink.ca |url=http://cannabislink.ca/papers/murphy/ |date=November 2004 |access-date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Murphy's defenders note that she was writing at a time when white racism was typical, not exceptional, and that Murphy's views were more progressive than many of her peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erik |last=Floren |title=Emily Murphy's Legacy |work=Edmonton Sun |date=3 October 2004 |url=http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/EdmontonSun/Centennial/2004/10/08/pf-661309.html |archive-url=http://cannabislink.ca/papers/murphy/murphystory.htm |archive-date=22 November 2004 |access-date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emily Murphy's house in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], is on the Canadian Register of Historic People and Places. She lived in this home from 1919 until her death in 1933.  It is now located on the campus of the University of Alberta and houses the Student Legal Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=North Campus Map |url=http://www.campusmap.ualberta.ca/~/media/uofa2/Maps/pdf/northcampus-map.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=University of Alberta |access-date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, she was recognized as a [[Persons of National Historic Significance|Person of National Historic Significance]] by the government of Canada. A plaque commemorating this is installed at Emily Murphy Park on Emily Murphy Park Road in Edmonton.&lt;ref&gt;{{DFHD|895|Murphy, Emily Ferguson 'Janey Canuck' National Historic Person|access-date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "National Persons" case was recognized in 1997 as a [[Events of National Historic Significance (Canada)|National Historic Event]] with a plaque at the same place.&lt;ref&gt;{{DFHD|1809|Persons Case National Historic Event|28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1703">A '''fail-stop''' subset of a [[computer language]] is one that has the same [[formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]] as the original, except in the case where an [[exception handling|exceptional condition]] arises.  The fail-stop subset must report an exceptional condition whenever the superset language reports one, but may additionally report an exceptional condition in other cases.

Fail-stop languages are often used in computer systems where [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]] is very important, since it is easier to make such systems [[fail-fast]].  For example, the "+" operator in many programming languages is not [[Associativity|associative]] because of the possibility of floating-point [[Arithmetic overflow|overflow]].  Repairing these languages to fail fast when commonly assumed properties do not hold makes it much easier to write and verify correct code.

==Examples==
In many widely used programming languages the code below might reduce the bank account value if the deposited amount or old account value is very large, by causing an overflowed value to be assigned to new_bank_account_value.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
  new_bank_account_value = old_bank_account_value + amount_deposited
  // example calculation with 32-bit signed integers to demonstrate, which overflow above 2,147,483,647
  // -2,147,483,646 = 2,147,483,640 + 10
&lt;/source&gt;

But in a fail-stop language that treats overflow as an exceptional condition, it is either correct, or will terminate with an exceptional condition.

'''Germplasm''' are living genetic resources such as seeds or tissues that are maintained for the purpose of [[animal husbandry|animal]] and [[plant breeding]], preservation, and other research uses. These resources may take the form of seed collections stored in [[seedbank|seed bank]]s, trees growing in nurseries, animal breeding lines maintained in animal breeding programs or [[gene bank]]s, etc.  Germplasm collections can range from collections of wild species to elite, domesticated breeding lines that have undergone extensive human selection. Germplasm collection is important for the maintenance of biological diversity and food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/|title=GRIN NPGS|last=Endress|first=Kurt|website=www.ars-grin.gov|access-date=2017-04-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422204654/http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/|archivedate=2008-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israeli apartheid analogy''' compares [[Israel]]'s treatment of [[Palestinians]] to [[South Africa]]'s treatment of non-whites during its [[apartheid era]] within the context of the [[crime of apartheid]].

With respect to the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israeli-occupied West Bank]], [[criticism of Israel|Israel's critics]] have repeatedly denounced it of practising a system akin to apartheid against Arabs and Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel approves 'Jewish nation state' law |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44881554 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |work=BBC News |date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has been described as an "apartheid" state by some scholars, United Nations investigators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/03/report-israel-established-apartheid-regime-170315054053798.html |title=UN report: Israel has established an 'apartheid regime' |website=www.aljazeera.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324174425/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/03/report-israel-established-apartheid-regime-170315054053798.html |archivedate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; human rights groups critical of Israeli policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Uri|title=Apartheid Israel: possibilities for the struggle within|year=2003 |publisher=Zed Books|isbn=1-84277-339-9|pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimoni"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shimoni|first=Gideon|title=Jews and Zionism: The South African Experience 1910–1967|year=1980|publisher=Cape Town: Oxford UP|isbn=0-19-570179-8|pages=310–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supporters of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement against Israel.

==History==
In 1961, the South African prime minister and architect of South Africa's apartheid policies, [[Hendrik Verwoerd]], dismissed an Israeli vote against South African apartheid at the United Nations, saying, "Israel is not consistent in its new anti-apartheid attitude ... they took Israel away from the Arabs after the Arabs lived there for a thousand years. In that, I agree with them. Israel, like South Africa, is an apartheid state."&lt;ref name="Clarno"&gt;The Empire's New Walls: Sovereignty, Neo-liberalism, and the Production of Space in Post-apartheid South Africa and Post-Oslo Palestine/Israel. Andrew James Clarno. 2009. p. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a number of sources have used the apartheid analogy in their examination of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In the early 1970s, Arabic language magazines of the [[PLO]] and [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]] compared the Israeli proposals for a Palestinian autonomy to the [[Bantustan]] strategy of South Africa.&lt;ref name="Clarno"/&gt; In 1979 the Palestinian sociologist Elia Zureik argued that while not ''de jure'' an apartheid state, Israeli society was characterized by a latent form of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Elia Zureik,''The Palestinians in Israel: A Study in Internal Colonialism,'' Routledge &amp; K. Paul, 1979 p. 16:'While official ''de jure'' apartheid of the African variety does not exist in Israel, national apartheid on the latent and informal levels ... is a characteristic feature of Israeli society.' cited by David Lyon 'Identification, colonialism, and control: surveillant sorting in Israel/Palestine', in Elia Zureik, David Lyon, Yasmeen Abu-Laban (eds.), ''Surveillance and Control in Israel/Palestine: Population, Territory and Power,'' Routledge 2011 pp. 49–65, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The concept emerged with some frequency in both academic and activist writings in the 1980–90s,&lt;ref&gt;Shourideh C. Molavi, ''Stateless Citizenship: The Palestinian-Arab Citizens of Israel,''BRILL 2013 p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Uri Davis]], [[Meron Benvenisti]], [[Richard Locke]] and [[A. T. Q. Stewart|Anthony Stewart]] employed the term 'apartheid' to describe Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.

In the 1990s, the term "Israeli apartheid" gained prominence after Israel, as a result of the [[Oslo Accords]], granted the Palestinians limited self-government in the form of the [[Palestinian Authority]] and established a system of permits and checkpoints in the Palestinian Territories. The apartheid accusation has gained additional traction following Israel's construction of the [[West Bank Barrier]].&lt;ref name="Clarno"/&gt; By 2013 the analogy between the West Bank and Bantustans of apartheid-era South Africa was widely drawn in international circles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/689d27cc-7a98-11e2-9cc2-00144feabdc0.html Settler policy imperils Israel's foundations, ''Financial Times'', 21 February 2013]: "Faced with widely drawn international parallels between the West Bank and the Bantustans of apartheid South Africa, senior figures in Mr Netanyahu's Likud party have begun to admit the danger."&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the United States, where the notion had previously been taboo, Israel's rule over the occupied territories was increasingly compared to apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/19/obama-urged-israel-two-state-solution Obama urged: act tough on Israel or risk collapse of two-state solution (''The Guardian'', 19 March 2013)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306041923/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/19/obama-urged-israel-two-state-solution |date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/12/palestinians-draw-parallels-mandela-anti-apartheid Palestinians draw parallels with Mandela's anti-apartheid struggle (The Guardian, 12 December 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130506/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/12/palestinians-draw-parallels-mandela-anti-apartheid |date=4 March 2016 }} "Comparisons between the former regime in South Africa and the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories have become relatively commonplace—not just by Palestinians and their supporters, but also among Israelis and the international community."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heribert Adam]] of [[Simon Fraser University]] and [[Kogila Moodley]] of the [[University of British Columbia]], in their 2005 book-length study ''Seeking Mandela: Peacemaking Between Israelis and Palestinians'', wrote that controversy over use of the term arises because Israel as a state is unique in the region. He writes that Israel is perceived as a Western democracy and is thus likely to be judged by the standards of such a state. Israel also claims to be a home for the worldwide [[Jewish diaspora]].&lt;ref name=AdamXIII&gt;Heriber, Adam &amp; Moodley, Kogila. op cit. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam and Moodley note that Jewish historical suffering has imbued [[Zionism]] with a "subjective sense of moral validity" that the whites ruling South Africa never had.&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Heribert &amp; Moodley, Kogila. op. cit. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; They also suggested that academic comparisons between Israel and apartheid South Africa that see both dominant groups as "settler societies" leave unanswered the question of "when and how settlers become indigenous", as well as failing to take into account that Israeli's [[aliyah|Jewish immigrants]] view themselves as returning home.&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Heribert &amp; Moodley, Kogila. op. cit. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam and Moodley stress, "because people give meaning to their lives and interpret their worlds through these diverse ideological prisms, the perceptions are real and have to be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Heribert &amp; Moodley, Kogila. op. cit. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli historian [[Benny Morris]] said that those that equate Israeli efforts to separate the two populations to apartheid are effectively trying to undermine the legitimacy of any peace agreement based on a two-state solution.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris, Benny: ''One State, Two States'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 203–4, n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‘separation’ ‘’hafrada’’ has become extremely popular during the Process referring to fences built around Palestinian autonomous enclaves, to roads pave in the Territories exclusively for Israelis to the decrease of the number of Palestinians employed in Israel or allowed to enter into it altogether.

In 1973 the [[International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid]] (ICSPCA) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="StJohn2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apartheid By Any Other Name |author=Ronald Bruce St John |publisher=[[Foreign Policy in Focus]] |date=1 February 2007 |accessdate=26 April 2010 |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/stjohn02022007.html |quote=In 1973, the UN General Assembly adopted the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616015824/http://counterpunch.org/stjohn02022007.html |archivedate=16 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICSPCA defines the crime of apartheid as "inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group ... over another racial group ... and systematically oppressing them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3ae6b3c00.pdf |title=International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid |author=United Nations |date=30 November 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |quote=For the purpose of the present Convention, the term 'the crime of apartheid', which shall include similar policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination as practised in southern Africa, shall apply to the following inhuman acts.... |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121225953/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3ae6b3c00.pdf |archivedate=21 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the crime of apartheid was further defined by Article 7 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] as encompassing inhumane acts such as torture, murder, forcible transfer, imprisonment, or persecution of an identifiable group on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, or other grounds, "committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Part 2, Article 7 |author=United Nations |year=2002 |accessdate=26 April 2010 |url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/english/rome_statute(e).pdf |pages=5–6 |postscript= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114001204/http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/english/rome_statute%28e%29.pdf |archivedate=14 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 report, U.N. Special Rapporteur for Palestine John Dugard stated, "elements of the Israeli occupation constitute forms of colonialism and of apartheid, which are contrary to international law" and suggested that the "legal consequences of a prolonged occupation with features of colonialism and apartheid" be put to the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dugard |first=John |title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, John Dugard |url=https://undocs.org/A/HRC/4/17 |accessdate=21 March 2017 |page=3 |id=A/HRC/4/17 |quote=The international community has identified three regimes as inimical to human rights—colonialism, apartheid and foreign occupation.

It is suggested that this question might appropriately be put to the International Court of Justice for a further advisory opinion. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111206/https://undocs.org/A/HRC/4/17 |archivedate=22 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, South Africa's statutory research agency the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] (HSRC) published a legal study finding that, "the State of Israel exercises control in the [Occupied Palestinian Territories] with the purpose of maintaining a system of domination by Jews over Palestinians and that this system constitutes a breach of the prohibition of apartheid." In March 2011, U.N. Special Rapporteur for Palestine [[Richard A. Falk]] said, "The continued pattern of settlement expansion in East Jerusalem combined with the forcible eviction of long-residing Palestinians is creating an intolerable situation ... [and] can only be described in its cumulative impact as a form of ethnic cleansing."&lt;ref name="Falk2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Falk |first=Richard |title=The tactic of arresting Palestinian children |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/07/20117211922998201.html |publisher=al Jazeera English |accessdate=11 July 2011 |date=8 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711010926/http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/07/20117211922998201.html |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether Israelis and Palestinians can be said to constitute "racial groups" has been a point of contention in regard to the applicability of the ICSPCA and Article 7 of the Rome Statute. Political writer Ronald Bruce St John has argued that in regards to the ICSPCA Israeli policy in the West Bank cannot technically be defined as apartheid, because it lacks the racial component. However he then states that with the 2002 introduction of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court "the emphasis shifts to an identifiable national, ethnic or cultural group, as opposed to a racial group," in which case "Israeli policy in the West Bank clearly constitutes a form of apartheid with an effect on the Palestinian people much the same as apartheid had on the non-White population in South Africa."&lt;ref name="StJohn2007" /&gt; The HSRC's 2009 report states that in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Jewish and Palestinian identities are "socially constructed as groups distinguished by ancestry or descent as well as nationality, ethnicity, and religion". On this basis, the study concludes that Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs can be considered "racial groups" for the purposes of the definition of apartheid in international law.&lt;ref name="HSRC2009" /&gt; Jacques De Maio, head of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], rejected the claim that there is apartheid in Israel, saying there is "no regime of superiority of race, of denial of basic human rights to a group of people because of their alleged racial inferiority. There is a bloody national conflict, whose most prominent and tragic characteristic is its continuation over the years, decades-long, and there is a state of occupation. Not apartheid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ICRC official: Israel is not an apartheid state, but there is occupation |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4953648,00.html |agency=Ynet News |date=26 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515095607/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0%2C7340%2CL-4953648%2C00.html |archivedate=15 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis coordinated by Human Sciences Research Council===

In 2009, a study was commissioned and coordinated by the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] of South Africa on Israel’s practices in the occupied Palestinian territories under international law.&lt;ref name="HSRC2009"&gt;{{Cite web |editor-first=Virginia |editor-last=Tilley |editor-link=Virginia Tilley |author1-first=Max |author1-last=du Plessis |author2-first=Fatmeh |author2-last=El-Ajou |author3-first=Victor |author3-last=Kattan |author4-first=John |author4-last=Reynolds |author5-first=Rina |author5-last=Rosenberg |author6-first=Iain |author6-last=Scobbie |author6-link=Iain Scobbie |author7-first=Virginia |author7-last=Tilley |author7-link=Virginia Tilley |date=May 2009 |title=Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid?

[http://www.hsrc.ac.za/Media_Release-378.phtml South African Academic Study Finds that Israel is Practicing Apartheid and Colonialism in the Occupied Palestinian Territories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726165646/http://www.hsrc.ac.za/Media_Release-378.phtml |date=26 July 2010 }}, May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The report cautioned against focusing exclusively on events within Israel proper and avoiding analysis of Israeli policies in the Occupied Territories.&lt;ref&gt;HSRC (2009) ''Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid?—A re-assessment of Israel's practices in the occupied Palestinian territories under international law''. Human Sciences Research Council Report. p. 301 {{cite web|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/lawpeacemideast/publications/file60532.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629074759/http://www.soas.ac.uk/lawpeacemideast/publications/file60532.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that one of the most 'notorious' aspects of the Apartheid policy was the 'racial enclave policy' manifested in the Black Homelands called [[bantustan]]s, and added: "As the apartheid regime in South Africa, Israel justifies these measures under the pretext of 'security'. Contrary to such claims, they are in fact part of an overall regime aimed at preserving demographic superiority of one racial group over the other in certain areas".&lt;ref&gt;HSRC (2009), pp. 205 to 212&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the report Israel's practices in the occupied Palestinian territories correlate almost entirely with the definition of apartheid as established in Article 2 of the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. Comparison to South African laws and practices by the apartheid regime also found strong correlations with Israeli practices, including violations of international standards for due process (such as illegal detention); discriminatory privileges based on ascribed ethnicity (legally, as Jewish or non-Jewish); draconian enforced ethnic segregation in all parts of life, including by confining groups to ethnic "reserves and ghettoes"; comprehensive restrictions on individual freedoms, such as movement and expression; a dual legal system based on ethno-national identity (Jewish or Palestinian); denationalization (denial of citizenship); and a special system of laws designed selectively to punish any Palestinian resistance to the system.

Initially released as a report, the report was later edited and published in 2012 (by Pluto Press) as ''Beyond Occupation: Apartheid, Colonialism and International Law in the Occupied Palestinian Territories''.&lt;ref&gt;Tilley, Virginia (ed). ''Beyond Occupation: Apartheid, Colonialism and International Law in the Occupied Palestinian Territories''. London, UK: Pluto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues in Israel proper==
Adam and Moodley wrote that Israeli Palestinians are "restricted to second-class citizen status when another ethnic group monopolizes state power" because of legal prohibitions on access to land, as well as the unequal allocation of civil service positions and per capita expenditure on educations between "dominant and minority citizens." &lt;ref&gt;Adam, Heribert &amp; Moodley, Kogila. {{cite web|url= http://www.temple.edu/tempress/chapters_1800/1813_ch1.pdf |title=''Seeking Mandela: Peacemaking Between Israelis and Palestinians'' (2005) excerpt }}, University College London Press, p. 20f. {{ISBN|1-84472-130-2}}&lt;br /&gt;''Second-class citizenship:'' "Above all, both Israeli Palestinians and Coloured and Indian South Africans are restricted to second-class citizen status when another ethnic group monopolizes state power, treats the minorities as intrinsically suspect, and legally prohibits their access to land or allocates civil service positions or per capita expenditure on education differently between dominant and minority citizens."&lt;/ref&gt;

South African Judge [[Richard Goldstone]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in October 2011, said that while there exists a degree of separation between Israeli Jews and Arabs, "in Israel, there is no apartheid. Nothing there comes close to the definition of apartheid under the 1998 Rome Statute". Concerning the West Bank, Goldstone wrote that the situation "is more complex. But here too there is no intent to maintain 'an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group'."&lt;ref name="goldstone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/opinion/israel-and-the-apartheid-slander.html |title=Israel and the Apartheid Slander |first=Richard J. |last=Goldstone |date=31 October 2011 |publisher= |via=NYTimes.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216013950/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/opinion/israel-and-the-apartheid-slander.html |archivedate=16 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1g1-271339962.html Goldstone Strikes Fatal Blow to False Apartheid Analogy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116043522/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-271339962.html |date=16 January 2016 }}.

[[Ian Buruma]] has argued that even though there is social discrimination against Arabs in Israel and that "the ideal of a Jewish state smacks of racism", the analogy is "intellectually lazy, morally questionable and possibly even mendacious". Buruma argued that Arabs make up 20% of the Israeli population, and "enjoy full citizen's rights" adding that there is no apartheid within the national territory of the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=Buruma&gt;[[Ian Buruma|Buruma, Ian]].

Fifty-three faculty members from [[Stanford University]] signed a letter expressing the view that "the State of Israel has nothing in common with apartheid" within its national territory. They argued that Israel is a [[liberal democracy]] in which Arab citizens of Israel enjoy civil, religious, social, and political equality. They said that likening Israel to apartheid South Africa was a "smear" and part of a campaign of "malicious propaganda".&lt;ref name="spme53"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spme.org/campus-news-climate/53-distinguished-stanford-faculty-state-publicly-israel-is-not-an-apartheid-state/4536/ |title=SPME: 53 Distinguished Stanford Faculty State Publicly, 'Israel is Not An Apartheid State!' |publisher=Scholars for Peace in the Middle East |accessdate=20 April 2008 |last= |first= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729075858/http://spme.org/campus-news-climate/53-distinguished-stanford-faculty-state-publicly-israel-is-not-an-apartheid-state/4536/ |archivedate=29 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land===

There has been a steady extension of Israeli Arab rights to lease or purchase land formerly restricted to Jewish applicants, such as that owned by the [[Jewish National Fund]] or the Jewish Agency. These groups, established by Jews during the Ottoman period to aid in building up a viable Jewish community in Ottoman Palestine, purchased land, including arid desert and swamps, that could be reclaimed, leased to and farmed by Jews, thus encouraging Jewish immigration. After the establishment of the state of Israel, the [[Israel Lands Authority]] oversaw the administration of these properties. On 8 March 2000, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Israeli Arabs, too, had an equal right to purchase long-term leases of such land, even inside previously solely Jewish communities and villages. The court ruled that the government may not allocate land based on religion or ethnicity and may not prevent Arab citizens from living wherever they choose: "The principle of equality prohibits the state from distinguishing between its citizens on the basis of religion or nationality," Chief Justice Aharon Barak wrote. "The principle also applies to the allocation of state land.... The Jewish character of the state does not permit Israel to discriminate between its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Qadan v. Israel Lands Administration, HCJ (Israeli Supreme Court) 6698/95, 8 March 2000, as cited by Alan Dershowitz, The Case for Israel (Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003), p. 157, n. 7 (see p. 253).&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this ruling, the British philosopher Bernard Harrison has written, in a book chapter dealing with the "apartheid Israel" accusation: "No doubt much more needs to be done. But we are discussing, remember, the question of whether Israel is, or is not, an 'apartheid state'. It is not merely hard, but impossible, to imagine the South African Supreme Court, under the premiership of Hendrik Verwoerd, say, delivering an analogous decision, because to have done so would have struck at the root of the entire system of apartheid, which was nothing if not a system for separating the races by separating the areas they were permitted to occupy."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Harrison, ''The Resurgence of Anti-Semitism: Jews, Israel, and Liberal Opinion'' (Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Chris McGreal]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that as a result of the government's control over most of the land in Israel, the vast majority of land in Israel is not available to non-Jews.&lt;ref name="McGreal2006"/&gt; In 2007 in response to a 2004 petition filed by Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, Attorney General [[Menachem Mazuz]] ruled that the policy was discriminatory, it has been ruled that the JNF must sell land to non-Jews, and will be compensated with other land for any such land to ensure that the overall amount of Jewish-owned land in Israel remains unchanged.&lt;ref name="Pfeffer"&gt;{{cite news|title=High Court delays ruling on JNF land sales to non-Jews |first=Anshel |last=Pfeffer |last2=Stern |first2=Yoav |date=24 September 2007 |accessdate=16 March 2014 |work=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/high-court-delays-ruling-on-jnf-land-sales-to-non-jews-1.229946 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317125654/http://www.haaretz.com/news/high-court-delays-ruling-on-jnf-land-sales-to-non-jews-1.229946 |archivedate=17 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community settlements legislation===

In the early 2000s, several [[Community settlement (Israel)|community settlements]] in the Negev and the Galilee were accused of barring Arab applicants from moving in. In 2010, the Knesset passed legislation that allowed admissions committees to function in smaller communities in the Galilee and the Negev, while explicitly forbidding committees to bar applicants on the basis of race, religion, sex, ethnicity, disability, personal status, age, parenthood, sexual orientation, country of origin, political views, or political affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nevo.co.il/law_word/law14/law-2286.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819223253/http://www.nevo.co.il/law_word/law14/law-2286.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jack Khoury |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-s-high-court-orders-jewish-galilee-town-to-accept-arab-couple-1.384296 |title=Israel's High Court orders Jewish Galilee town to accept Arab couple |newspaper=Haaretz |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228192331/http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-s-high-court-orders-jewish-galilee-town-to-accept-arab-couple-1.384296 |archivedate=28 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, however, say the law gives the privately run admissions committees a wide latitude over public lands, and believe it will worsen discrimination against the Arab minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/24/world/la-fg-israel-arab-laws-20110324 New Israeli laws will increase discrimination against Arabs, critics say] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208081307/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/24/world/la-fg-israel-arab-laws-20110324 |date=8 December 2015 }}. 24 March 2011.

In the Israeli Supreme Court decision on this matter, Deputy Chief Justice [[Mishael Cheshin]] argued that, "Israeli citizens [do not] enjoy a constitutional right to bring a foreign national into Israel ... and it is the right—moreover, it is the duty—of the state, of any state, to protect its residents from those wishing to harm them. And it derives from this that the state is entitled to prevent the immigration of enemy nationals into it—even if they are spouses of Israeli citizens—while it is waging an armed conflict with that same enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.merip.org/mero/mero060106.html |title=Israel's 'Demographic Demon' in Court |publisher=Middle East Report Online |date=1 June 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615082649/http://www.merip.org/mero/mero060106.html |archivedate=15 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was upheld in May 2006, by the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] on a six to five vote.

Separate and unequal education systems were a central part of apartheid in South Africa, as part of a deliberate strategy designed to limit black children to a life of manual labor. Some disparities between Jews and Arabs in Israel's education system exist, although they are not nearly so significant and the intent not so malign.&lt;ref name="McGreal2006"/&gt; The Israeli Pupils' Rights Law of 2000 prohibits educators from establishing different rights, obligations and disciplinary standards for students of different religions.

Israel has Hebrew-language and Arabic-language schools, while some schools are bilingual. Most Arabs study in Arabic, while a small number of Arab parents choose to enroll their children in Hebrew schools. All of Israel's eight universities use Hebrew.&lt;ref name="McGreal2006"/&gt; In 1992 a government report concluded that nearly twice as much money was allocated to each Jewish child as to each Arab pupil.&lt;ref name="McGreal2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/06/southafrica.israel |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Worlds apart |first=Chris |last=McGreal |date=6 February 2006 |accessdate=5 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829233130/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/06/southafrica.israel |archivedate=29 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a 2004 Human Rights Watch report identified significant disparities in education spending and stated that discrimination against Arab children affects every aspect of the education system.

===Population Registry Law===
[[Chris McGreal]], ''The Guardian's'' former chief Israel correspondent, compared Israel's Population Registry Law of 1965, which requires all residents of Israel to register their nationality, to South Africa's Apartheid-era [[Population Registration Act]], which categorized South Africans according to racial definitions in order to determine who could live in what land. According to McGreal, the Israeli identification cards determine where people are permitted to live, affects access to some government welfare programs, and has impact on how people are likely to be treated by civil servants and policemen.&lt;ref name="McGreal2006"/&gt;

==Issues in the West Bank and Gaza Strip==
===Under Israeli military occupation===
[[Leila Farsakh]], associate professor of Political Science at [[University of Massachusetts Boston]] has said that after 1977, "the military government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) expropriated and enclosed Palestinian land and allowed the transfer of Israeli settlers to the occupied territories." She notes that settlers continued to be governed by Israeli laws, and that a different system of military law was enacted "to regulate the civilian, economic and legal affairs of Palestinian inhabitants." She says "[m]any view these Israeli policies of territorial integration and societal separation as apartheid, even if they were never given such a name."&lt;ref name=Farsakh&gt;[[Leila Farsakh|Farsakh, Leila]].

===Under Palestinian Authority===
Arabs living in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], areas occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War and deemed to be occupied territory under [[international law]], are under the civil control of the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]], and are not Israeli citizens. In some areas of the West Bank, they are under Israeli security control.{{Citation need|date=April 2017|reason=this needs more, are the Defense (Emergency) Regulations no longer in effect in Gaza? is this formal or informal? can it be sourced? which areas of the West Bank are not subject to the Regulations?}}

Former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] authored a 2006 book titled ''[[Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid]]''. Carter's use of the term "apartheid" was calibrated to avoid specific accusations of racism against the government of Israel, and carefully limited to the situation in Gaza and the West Bank. In a letter to the Board of Rabbis of Greater Phoenix, Carter made it clear that he was not discussing the circumstances within Israel but exclusively within Gaza and the West Bank.&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/16/america/NA_GEN_US_Jimmy_Carter_Criticism.php |title=Carter explains 'apartheid' reference in letter to U.S. Jews |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=23 April 2007 |quote=The six rabbis... and I... discussed the word 'apartheid', which I defined as the forced segregation of two peoples living in the same land, with one of them dominating and persecuting the other.

In 2007, in advance of a report from the United Nations Human Rights Council, [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] [[John Dugard]] said that "Israel's laws and practices in the OPT [occupied Palestinian territories] certainly resemble aspects of apartheid."

Falk]] reported to the General Assembly Third Committee that "the nature of the occupation as of 2010 substantiates earlier allegations of colonialism and apartheid in evidence and law to a greater extent than was the case even three years ago."

Israeli Defense Minister and former prime minister [[Ehud Barak]] stated in 2010 regarding the occupied territories that "As long as in this territory west of the Jordan River there is only one political entity called Israel it is going to be either non-Jewish, or non-democratic. If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state."&lt;ref name="BarakPeaceOrApartheid"&gt;''[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/03/barak-apartheid-palestine-peace Barak: make peace with Palestinians or face apartheid]'', Rory McCarthy, The Guardian, 3 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TopIsraelisWarnApartheid"/&gt;

In November 2014, former [[Attorney General of Israel]] (1993–1996) [[Michael Ben-Yair]] urged the [[European Economic Union]] to endorse the creation of a Palestinian state, arguing that Israel had imposed an apartheid regime on the West Bank.

[[Henry Siegman]], a former national director of the [[American Jewish Congress]], has stated that the network of [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] in the West Bank has created an "irreversible colonial project" aimed to foreclose the possibility of a viable [[State of Palestine|Palestinian state]]. According to Siegman, in accomplishing this Israel has "crossed the threshold from 'the only democracy in the Middle East' to the only apartheid regime in the Western world". Siegman argues that denial of both self-determination and Israeli citizenship to Palestinians amounts to a "double disenfranchisement", which when based on ethnicity amounts to racism. Siegman continues to state that reserving democracy for privileged citizens and keeping others "behind checkpoints and barbed wire fences" is the opposite of democracy.&lt;ref name="thenation.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100125/siegman|title=Imposing Middle East Peace (The Nation, 7 January 2010)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dugard]] has compared Israel's confiscation of Palestinian farms and land, and destruction of Palestinian homes, to similar policies of Apartheid-era South Africa.&lt;ref name=DUGARDNOV2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/11/201111395153781378.html |title=Apartheid and the occupation of Palestine |first=John |last=Dugard |website=english.aljazeera.net |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110032659/http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/11/201111395153781378.html |archivedate=10 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major 2002 study of Israeli settlement practices by the Israeli human rights organization [[B'Tselem]] concluded: "Israel has created in the Occupied Territories a regime of separation based on discrimination, applying two separate systems of law in the same area and basing the rights of individuals on their nationality. This regime is the only one of its kind in the world, and is reminiscent of distasteful regimes from the past, such as the apartheid regime in South Africa."

===Criminal law===

In 2007, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination reported that Palestinians and Israeli settlers in the occupied territories are subject to different criminal laws, leading to longer detention and harsher punishments for Palestinians than for Israelis for the same offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Israel |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=CERD/C/ISR/CO/13 |work=CERD/C/ISR/CO/13 |publisher=Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination |accessdate=28 October 2010 |date=14 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510040110/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=CERD%2FC%2FISR%2FCO%2F13 |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has reported that in the West Bank, Israeli settlers and soldiers who engage in abuses against Palestinians, including unlawful killings, enjoy "impunity" from punishment and are rarely prosecuted. However Palestinians detained by Israeli security forces may be imprisoned for prolonged periods of time, and reports of their torture and other ill-treatment are not credibly investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/israeloccupied-palestinian-territories/report-2008 |title=Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories |publisher=Amnesty International |year=2008 |accessdate=16 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427092412/http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/israeloccupied-palestinian-territories/report-2008 |archivedate=27 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/israel-occupied-territories |title=Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories &amp;#124; Amnesty International Report 2009 |publisher=Report2009.amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=16 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702224348/http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/israel-occupied-territories |archivedate=2 July 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/1999/11/08israel |title=Creeping annexation of the West Bank |date=1 November 1999 |website=Le Monde diplomatique |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802221055/http://mondediplo.com/1999/11/08israel |archivedate=2 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dugard has compared Israeli imprisonment of Palestinians to policies of Apartheid-era South Africa, saying "Apartheid's security police practiced torture on a large scale. So do the Israeli security forces. There were many political prisoners on [[Robben Island]] but there are more Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails."&lt;ref name=DUGARDNOV2011 /&gt;

===Access to water===
The World Bank found in 2009 that Israeli settlements in the West Bank (which amount to 15% of the population of the West Bank) are given access to over 80% of its fresh water resources, despite the fact that the Oslo accords call for "joint" management of such resources. This has created, according to the Bank, "real water shortages" for the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;Assessment of restrictions on Palestinian water sector development, Sector Note April 2009, {{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReport18Apr2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409075502/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WaterRestrictionsReport18Apr2009.pdf |archivedate=9 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the [[Parliament of France|French parliament]] published a report describing Israel's water policies in the West Bank as "a weapon serving the new apartheid". The report noted that the 450,000 Israeli settlers used more water than the 2.3&amp;nbsp;million Palestinians, "in contravention of international law", that Palestinians are not allowed to use the underground aquifers, and that Israel was deliberately destroying wells, reservoirs and water purification plants. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the report was "loaded with the language of vicious propaganda, far removed from any professional criticism with which one could argue intelligently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravid |first=Barak |title=French parliament report accuses Israel of water 'apartheid' in West Bank |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/french-parliament-report-accuses-israel-of-water-apartheid-in-west-bank-1.407685 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=17 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117111118/http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/french-parliament-report-accuses-israel-of-water-apartheid-in-west-bank-1.407685 |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the [[Begin–Sadat Center for Strategic Studies]] concludes that Israel has fulfilled the water agreements it has made with the Palestinians, and the author has commented that the situation is "just the opposite of apartheid" as Israel has provided water infrastructure to more than 700 Palestinian villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=254047 |title=Government slams French water 'apartheid' report |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119140318/http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=254047 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/MSPS94.pdf |title=The Israeli–Palestinian Water Conflict: An Israeli Perspective |author=Gvirtzman, Haim |journal=Mideast Security and Policy Studies |issue=94 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131065127/http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/MSPS94.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] concluded in 2008 that a segregated road network in the West Bank, expansion of Jewish settlements, restriction of the growth of Palestinian towns and discriminatory granting of services, budgets and access to natural resources are "a blatant violation of the principle of equality and in many ways reminiscent of the Apartheid regime in South Africa". The group reversed its previous reluctance to use the comparison to South Africa because "things are getting worse rather than better", according to spokeswoman Melanie Takefman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/civil-rights-group-claim-israeli-occupation-is-reminiscent-of-apartheid-1056546.html |title=The United States of Anxiety: survey reveals a jittery nation overcome |date=9 September 2003 |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227095745/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/civil-rights-group-claim-israeli-occupation-is-reminiscent-of-apartheid-1056546.html |archivedate=27 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinians living in the non-[[Annexation|annexed]] portions of the West Bank do not have Israeli citizenship or voting rights in Israel, but are subject to movement restrictions of the Israeli government. Israel has created roads and checkpoints in the West Bank with the stated purpose of preventing the uninhibited movement of [[suicide bomber]]s and [[Insurgent|militants]] in the region. The human rights NGO B'Tselem has indicated that such policies have isolated some Palestinian communities and state that Israel's road regime "based on the principle of separation through discrimination, bears striking similarities to the racist apartheid regime that existed in South Africa until 1994".&lt;ref name="B'tselemroad"&gt;{{cite web|title=1 Forbidden Roads Israel's Discriminatory Road Regime in the West Bank |url=http://www.btselem.org/sites/default/files2/publication/200408_forbidden_roads_eng.pdf |publisher=B'tselem |accessdate=3 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309151855/http://www.btselem.org/sites/default/files2/publication/200408_forbidden_roads_eng.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btselem"&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/english/Freedom_of_Movement/Checkpoints_and_Forbidden_Roads.asp Forbidden Checkpoints and Roads] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618180510/http://btselem.org/English/Freedom_of_Movement/Checkpoints_and_Forbidden_Roads.asp |date=18 June 2006 }} at B'Tselem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-semitism and the Abuse of History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qc6Tn-C2B5UC&amp;pg=PR28 |accessdate=3 May 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-24989-9 |page=28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108034823/http://books.google.com/books?id=qc6Tn-C2B5UC&amp;pg=PR28 |archivedate=8 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The International Court of Justice stated that the fundamental rights of the Palestinian population of the occupied territories are guaranteed by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and that Israel could not deny them on the grounds of security.&lt;ref&gt;see ICJ Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) paragraphs 127 and 128&lt;/ref&gt; Marwan Bishara, a teacher of international relations at the [[American University of Paris]], has claimed that the restrictions on the movement of goods between Israel and the West Bank are "a ''de facto'' apartheid system".&lt;ref name=Bishara2&gt;Bishara, Marwan.

Retrieved 21 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Oren]] argues that none of this even remotely resembles apartheid, since "the vast majority of settlers and Palestinians choose to live apart because of cultural and historical differences, not segregation, though thousands of them do work side by side. The separate roads were created in response to terrorist attacks – not to segregate Palestinians but to save Jewish lives. And Israeli roads are used by Israeli Jews and Arabs alike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-oren-israel-apartheid-20140518-story.html |title=Israel isn't, and will never be, an apartheid state |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=17 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105957/http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-oren-israel-apartheid-20140518-story.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permit and [[West Bank Closures|closure system]] was introduced in 1990. [[Leila Farsakh]] maintains that this system imposes "on Palestinians similar conditions to those faced by blacks under the pass laws. Like the pass laws, the permit system controlled population movement according to the settlers' unilaterally defined considerations." In response to the [[al-Aqsa intifada]], Israel modified the permit system and fragmented the WBGS [West Bank and Gaza Strip] territorially. "In April 2002 Israel declared that the WBGS would be cut into eight main areas, outside which Palestinians could not live without a permit."&lt;ref name=Farsakh/&gt; 

[[John Dugard]] has said these laws "resemble, but in severity go far beyond, apartheid's pass system".&lt;ref name="Dugard2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifamericaknew.org/cur_sit/dugard.html |title=Israelis adopt what South Africa dropped |date=November 29, 2006 |first=John |last=Dugard |authorlink=John Dugard |accessdate=16 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320202428/http://ifamericaknew.org/cur_sit/dugard.html |archivedate=20 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamal Zahalka]], an Israeli-Arab member of the [[Knesset]] has also said that this permit system if a feature of apartheid. &lt;ref name=Zahalka&gt;[http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/pubs/20020611ftr.html "New Laws Legalize Apartheid in Israel.

In October 2005 the [[Israel Defense Forces]] stopped Palestinians from driving on [[Highway 60 (Israel)|Highway 60]], as part of a plan for a separate Road Network for Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank. The road had been sealed after the fatal shooting of three settlers near Bethlehem. As of 2005, no private Palestinian cars were permitted on the road although public transport was still allowed. 

In 2011, Major General Nitzan Alon abolished separate public transportation systems on the West Bank, permitting Palestinians to ride alongside Israelis. The measure has been protested by settlers. The IDF order was reportedly overturned by [[Moshe Ya'alon]] who, responding to pressure from settler groups, issued a directive that would deny Palestinians passage on buses running from Israel to the West Bank{{as of|December 2014}}. The decision was said to be made on security grounds, though according to ''Haaretz'', military officials state that Palestinian use of such transport poses no security threat. Justice Minister [[Tzipi Livini]] asked the Israeli [[Attorney General]] Yehuda Weinstein to examine the ban's legality and Weinstein immediately demanded that Ya'alon provide an explanation for his decision.&lt;ref&gt;Revital Hovel and Chaim Levinson,[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.623036 'AG orders Ya'alon: Explain why Palestinians banned from Israeli-run buses in West Bank,'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028014138/http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.623036 |date=28 October 2014 }}[[Haaretz]] 27 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli security sources were quoted saying the decision had nothing to do with public buses and said that the goal was to supervise the entrance into and exit out of Israeli territory, thereby decreasing the chance of terrorist attacks inside Israel.

==Comments by South Africans==
[[Anglican]] Archbishop and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Desmond Tutu]] has commented on the similarities between South Africa and Palestine and the importance of international pressure in ending apartheid in South Africa. He has drawn a parallel between the movement "aiming to end Israeli occupation" and the international pressure that helped end apartheid in South Africa, saying: "If apartheid ended, so can the occupation, but the moral force and international pressure will have to be just as determined."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Verso Books |editor-last=lim |editor-first=Audrea |isbn=978-1-84467-803-7 |title=The Case for Sanctions Against Israel |date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Friel]] writes that Desmond Tutu "views the conditions in the occupied Palestinian territories as resembling apartheid in South Africa."

Human rights lawyer Fatima Hassan, a member of the 2008 ANC delegation, cited the separate roads, different registration of cars, the indignity of having to produce a permit, and long queues at checkpoints as worse than what they had experienced during apartheid. But she also thought the apartheid comparison was a potential "red herring":"... the context is different and the debate on whether this is Apartheid or not deflects from the real issue of occupation, encroachment of more land, building of the wall and the indignity of the occupation and the conduct of the military and police. I saw the check point at Nablus, I met with Palestinians in Hebron, I met the villagers who are against the wall—I met Israeli's and Palestinians who have lost family members, their land and homes. They have not lost hope though—and they believe in a joint struggle against the occupation and are willing in non-violent means to transform the daily direct and indirect forms of injustice and violence. To sum up—there is a transgression that is continuing unabated–call it what you want, apartheid/separation/closure/security—it remains a transgression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ngugi |first=Mukoma Wa |authorlink=Mukoma Wa Ngugi |title=What Palestine is to me: An interview with Fatima Hassan |work=[[Pambazuka News]] |publisher=Fahamu&amp;nbsp;– Networks For Social Justice |date=23 July 2008 |url=http://pambazuka.org/en/category/features/49608 |accessdate=13 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803100841/http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/49608 |archivedate=3 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gideon Shimoni, professor emeritus of Hebrew University, has said that the analogy is defamatory and say it reflects a double standard when applied to Israel and not to neighboring Arab countries, whose policies towards their own Palestinian minorities have been described as discriminatory.&lt;ref name=Gideon/&gt; He has said that while apartheid was characterized by racially based legal inequality and exploitation of Black Africans by the dominant Whites within a common society, the Israel–Palestinian conflict reflects "separate nationalisms," in which Israel refuses exploitation of Palestinians and on the contrary seeks separation and "divorce" from Palestinians for legitimate self-defense reasons.&lt;ref name=Gideon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jcpa.org/article/deconstructing-apartheid-accusations-against-israel/ |last=Shimoni |first=Gideon |date=2 September 2007 |title=Deconstructing Apartheid Accusations Against Israel |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |accessdate=16 March 2014}} Interview by Manfred Gerstenfeld&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sasha Polakow-Suransky notes that Israel's labour policies are very different from those of apartheid-era South Africa, and that Israel has never enacted miscegenation laws, and that liberation movements in South Africa and Palestine have had different "aspirations and tactics."&lt;ref&gt;Sasha Polakow-Suransky, ''The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship with Apartheid South Africa'', (New York: Pantheon Books), 2010, pp. 236–39.&lt;/ref&gt; This notwithstanding, he argues that the apartheid analogy is likely to gain further legitimacy in coming years unless Israel moves to dismantle West Bank settlements and create a viable Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;Polakow-Suransky, ''The Unspoken Alliance'', pp. 239–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Polakow-Suransky also writes that the response of Israel's defenders to the analogy since 2007 has been "knee-jerk" and based on "vitriol and recycled propaganda" rather than an honest assessment of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Sasha Polakow-Suransky, ''The Unspoken Alliance'', pp. 233–235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delegitimization of Israel==

[[Irwin Cotler]], a former lawyer for [[Nelson Mandela]], said it was anti-semitic to call Israel an apartheid state because "it involves a call for ''dismantling'' Israel." He links this to efforts to delegitimize the Jewish State.&lt;ref name="Cotler"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/yiisa/irwincotlerworkingpaper10209.pdf "Global Antisemitism: Assault on Human Rights"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism; Working Paper No. 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian political scientist [[Anne Bayefsky]] wrote that the apartheid label was used by Arab states at the Durban World Conference on Racism in 2001 was part of a campaign to delegitimize Israel and to legitimize violence against Israeli citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bayefsky |first=Anne F. |title=Terrorism and Racism: The Aftermath of Durban |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |date=16 December 2011 |journal=Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism |volume=468 |url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=2&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=442&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=1117&amp;TTL=Terrorism_and_Racism:_The_Aftermath_of_Durban |accessdate=3 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514160443/http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=2&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=442&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=1117&amp;TTL=Terrorism_and_Racism%3A_The_Aftermath_of_Durban |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government responses==
Three sitting Israeli premiers have warned that Israel could become like apartheid South Africa. Israel's first prime minister, [[David Ben Gurion]], warned in 1967 following the [[Six-Day War]] that Israel would become an apartheid state if it did not rid itself of the occupied territories as soon as possible. Prime minister [[Yizhak Rabin]] warned in 1976 that Israel would become an apartheid state if it annexed and absorbed the West Bank's Arab population.&lt;ref name="TopIsraelisWarnApartheid"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-1976-interview-rabin-likens-settlements-to-cancer-warns-of-apartheid/ "In 1976 interview, Rabin likens settler ideologues to ‘cancer,’ warns of ‘apartheid’"], Toi Staff, ''The Times of Israel'', 25 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime minister Ehud Olmert in 2007 warned that if the [[two-state solution]] collapsed, Israel would "face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights, and as soon as that happens, the state of Israel is finished".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.haaretz.com/news/olmert-to-haaretz-two-state-solution-or-israel-is-done-for-1.234201 Olmert to Haaretz: Two-state Solution, or Israel Is Done For]", Barak Ravid et al., ''Haaretz'', November 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] warned that if Israel did not make peace soon, under a two-state solution, it could become an apartheid state.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.timesofisrael.com/kerry-israel-could-become-apartheid-state/ Kerry: Israel could become an 'apartheid state']", Lazar Berman, ''The Times of Israel'', 28 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Kerry's statement, former South African state president [[F. W. de Klerk]] said: "You have Palestinians living in Israel with full political rights.  You don’t have discriminatory laws against them, I mean not letting them swim on certain beaches or anything like that. I think it's unfair to call Israel an apartheid state. If [[John Kerry|Kerry]] did so, I think he made a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/south-africas-de-klerk-israel-not-an-apartheid-state/#ixzz3GrpjBXBe "South Africa's de Klerk: Israel not an apartheid state"] (May 27, 2014), ''The Times of Israel''&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, [[Toronto]] Mayor [[Rob Ford]] has said that he will not allow city funding for the 2011 Toronto [[Pride Week (Toronto)|Pride Parade]] if organizers allow the group [[Queers Against Israeli Apartheid]] (QuAIA) march again this year. "Taxpayers dollars should not go toward funding hate speech," Ford said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/node/87363 Toronto mayor lays down Pride parade law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317110343/http://www.cjnews.com/node/87363 |date=17 March 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2011, the city manager reported to the city's executive committee that the use of the phrase 'Israeli apartheid' does not violate the City's Anti-discrimination policy, nor does it constitute discrimination under the Canadian Criminal Code or the Ontario Human Rights Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/City_manager_releases_report_on_Israeli_apartheid-10010.aspx City manager releases report on 'Israeli apartheid'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907025304/http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/City_manager_releases_report_on_Israeli_apartheid-10010.aspx |date=7 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the Toronto city council voted to condemn the phrase "Israeli apartheid", as part of a resolution recognizing the gay Pride Toronto parade as a "significant cultural event that strongly promotes the ideals of tolerance and diversity". The resolution said it slams the term Israel Apartheid for undermining the values of Pride and diminishing "the suffering experienced by individuals during the apartheid regime in South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/06/07/council-votes-to-condemn-use-of-term-israeli-apartheid|title=Council votes to condemn use of term 'Israeli apartheid'|first1=Don|last1=Peat|first2=City Hall Bureau|last2=Chief|website=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Italy}}
'''Italian Fascism''' ({{lang-it|fascismo italiano}}), also known as '''Classical Fascism''' or simply '''Fascism''', is the original [[Fascism|fascist]] ideology as developed in [[Italy]]. The ideology is associated with a series of three political parties led by [[Benito Mussolini]]: the [[Fascist Revolutionary Party]] (PFR) founded in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;Benito Mussolini (2006), ''My Autobiography with The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism'', Mineloa: NY: Dover Publication Inc., p. 227. Note that some authors refer to Mussolini's first political party as "The Revolutionary Fascist Party".&lt;/ref&gt; the succeeding [[National Fascist Party]] (PNF) which was renamed at the Third Fascist Congress on 7–10 November 1921 and ruled the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from 1922 until 1943 and the [[Republican Fascist Party]] that ruled the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945. Italian Fascism is also associated with the post-war [[Italian Social Movement]] and subsequent Italian [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] movements.

Italian Fascism was rooted in [[Italian nationalism]], [[national syndicalism]], [[Revolutionary Nationalism|revolutionary nationalism]], and the desire to restore and expand [[Italian irredentism|Italian territories]], which Italian Fascists deemed necessary for a nation to assert its superiority and strength and to avoid succumbing to decay.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1922"&gt;Aristotle A. Kallis. ''Fascist ideology: territory and expansionism in Italy and Germany, 1922–1945''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2000, pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascists also claimed that modern Italy is the heir to [[ancient Rome]] and its legacy and historically supported the creation of an [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] to provide ''[[spazio vitale]]'' ("living space") for [[Italian Empire|colonization by Italian settlers]] and to establish control over the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle A. Kallis. ''Fascist ideology: territory and expansionism in Italy and Germany, 1922–1945''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2000. Pp. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Fascism promoted a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] economic system whereby employer and employee [[syndicate]]s are [[Tripartism|linked together]] in associations to collectively represent the nation's economic producers and work alongside the state to set national economic policy.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"&gt;Andrew Vincent. ''Modern Political Ideologies''. Third edition. Malden, Massaschussetts, USA; Oxford, England, UK; West Sussex, England, UK: Blackwell Publishers Ltd., 2010. Pp. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; This economic system intended to resolve [[class conflict]] through [[class collaboration|collaboration between the classes]].&lt;ref&gt;John Whittam. ''Fascist Italy''. Manchester, England, UK; New York City, USA: Manchester University Press, 1995. Pp. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Fascism opposed [[liberalism]], especially [[classical liberalism]] that Mussolini and Fascist leaders denounced as "the debacle of individualism",&lt;ref&gt;Jim Powell, "The Economic Leadership Secrets of Benito Mussolini", ''Forbes'', 22 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but rather than seeking a [[reactionary]] restoration of the pre-[[French Revolution]]ary world, which it considered to have been flawed, it had a forward-looking direction.&lt;ref name="Eugen Weber 1972. Pp. 791"&gt;Eugen Weber. The Western Tradition: From the Renaissance to the present. Heath, 1972. Pp. 791.&lt;/ref&gt; It was opposed to [[Socialist mode of production|Marxist socialism]] because of its typical opposition to nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;Stanislao G. Pugliese.

While fascism in Italy did not initially espouse the explicit [[Nordicism]] and [[antisemitism]] inherent to Nazi ideology, [[Italian Fascism and racism|racist overtones were present]] in fascist thought and policies from the beginning of fascist rule of Italy. As Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany grew politically closer in the latter half of the 1930s, Italian laws and policies became explicitly antisemitic, including the passage of the [[Italian Racial Laws]].

==Principal beliefs==

===Nationalism===
[[File:Has seven 1 a.jpg|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini being cheered by Fascist Blackshirt youth in 1935|Benito Mussolini and Fascist [[Blackshirt]] youth in 1935]]
Italian Fascism is based upon Italian nationalism and in particular seeks to complete what it considers as the incomplete project of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' by incorporating ''Italia Irredenta'' ("unredeemed Italy") into the state of Italy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Terence Ball, Richard Bellamy. The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought. Pp. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Fascist Party]] (PNF) founded in 1921 declared that the party was to serve as "a revolutionary militia placed at the service of the nation. It follows a policy based on three principles: order, discipline, hierarchy".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

It identifies modern Italy as the heir to the [[Roman Empire]] and Italy during the [[Renaissance]] and promotes the cultural identity of ''[[Romanitas]]'' ("Roman-ness").&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Italian Fascism historically sought to forge a strong [[Italian Empire]] as a "[[Third Rome]]", identifying ancient Rome as the "First Rome" and Renaissance-era Italy as the "Second Rome".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Italian Fascism has emulated ancient Rome and Mussolini in particular emulated ancient Roman leaders, such as [[Julius Caesar]] as a model for the Fascists' rise to power and [[Augustus]] as a model for empire-building.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Lazzaro, Roger J. Crum. "Augustus, Mussolini, and the Parallel Imagery of Empire" by Ann Thomas Wilkins, ''Donatello Among The Blackshirts: History And Modernity In The Visual Culture Of Fascist Italy''. Ithaca, New York, USA: Cornell University Press, 2005. Pp. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism has directly promoted [[imperialism]], such as within the ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'' (1932), [[Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by Giovanni Gentile on behalf of Mussolini: {{quote|The Fascist state is a will to power and empire. The Roman tradition is here a powerful force. According to the Doctrine of Fascism, an empire is not only a territorial or military or mercantile concept, but a spiritual and moral one. One can think of an empire, that is, a nation, which directly or indirectly guides other nations, without the need to conquer a single square kilometre of territory.|Benito Mussolini, Giovanni Gentile, ''Doctrine of Fascism'' (1932).}}

====Irredentism and expansionism====
{{further|Spazio vitale|Italia irredenta|Mare Nostrum|Italian Empire|Italianization}}

Fascism emphasized the need for the restoration of the [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] ''[[Risorgimento]]'' tradition that pursued the unification of Italy, that the Fascists claimed had been left incomplete and abandoned in the [[Giovanni Giolitti|Giolittian]]-era Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin. The Nature of Fascism. St. Martin's Press, 1991. Pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism sought the incorporation of claimed "unredeemed" territories to Italy.

To the east of Italy, the Fascists claimed that [[Dalmatia]] was a land of Italian culture whose Italians, including those of Italianized [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] descent, had been driven out of Dalmatia and into exile in Italy, and supported the return of Italians of Dalmatian heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Jozo Tomasevich. War and Revolution in Yugoslavia 1941–1945: Occupation and Collaboration. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2001. P. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini identified Dalmatia as having strong Italian cultural roots for centuries via the Roman Empire and the [[Republic of Venice]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Larry Wolff. Venice And the Slavs: The Discovery of Dalmatia in the Age of Enlightenment. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, P. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascists especially focused their claims based on the Venetian cultural heritage of Dalmatia, claiming that Venetian rule had been beneficial for all Dalmatians and had been accepted by the Dalmatian population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The Fascists were outraged after World War I, when the agreement between Italy and the Entente Allies in the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] of 1915 to have Dalmatia join Italy was revoked in 1919.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The Fascist regime supported annexation of Yugoslavia's region of [[Slovenia]] into Italy that already held a portion of the [[Slovenes|Slovene]] population, whereby Slovenia would become an Italian province,&lt;ref&gt;Allan R.

To the west of Italy, the Fascists claimed that the territories of [[Corsica]], Nice and [[Savoy]] held by France were Italian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle A. Kallis.

P. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of Italian unification in 1860 to 1861, Prime Minister of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]], [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], who was leading the unification effort, faced opposition from [[French Emperor]] [[Napoleon III]] who indicated that France would oppose Italian unification unless France was given Nice and Savoy that were held by Piedmont Sardinia, as France did not want a powerful state having control of all the passages of the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;Adda Bruemmer Bozeman. Regional Conflicts Around Geneva: An Inquiry Into the Origin, ''Nature'', and Implications of the Neutralized Zone of Savoy and of the Customs-free Zones of Gex and Upper Savoy.

Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1949.

Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation during the Second World War. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006. P. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime produced literature on Nice that justified that Nice was an Italian land based on historic, ethnic and linguistic grounds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; The Fascists quoted Medieval Italian scholar [[Petrarch]] who said: "The border of Italy is the Var; consequently Nice is a part of Italy".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; The Fascists quoted Italian national hero [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] who said: "Corsica and Nice must not belong to France; there will come the day when an Italy mindful of its true worth will reclaim its provinces now so shamefully languishing under foreign domination".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; Mussolini initially pursued promoting annexation of Corsica through political and diplomatic means, believing that Corsica could be annexed to Italy through first encouraging the existing autonomist tendencies in Corsica and then independence of Corsica from France, that would be followed by annexation of Corsica into Italy.&lt;ref&gt;John Gooch. ''Mussolini and his Generals: The Armed Forces and Fascist Foreign Policy, 1922–1940''. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2007. Pp. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the north of Italy, the Fascist regime in the 1930s had designs on the largely Italian-populated region of [[Ticino]] and the [[Romansh people|Romansch]]-populated region of [[Graubünden]] in Switzerland (the Romansch are a people with a Latin-based language).&lt;ref name="John F. L 1989. P. 91"&gt;John F. L. Ross. Neutrality and International Sanctions: Sweden, Switzerland, and Collective Security. ABC-CLIO, 1989. P. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1938, Mussolini declared to the Grand Fascist Council: "We shall bring our border to the [[Gotthard Pass]]".&lt;ref&gt;Aurelio Garobbio. ''A colloquio con il duce''. 1998. Mursia, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime accused the Swiss government of oppressing the Romansch people in Graubünden.&lt;ref name="John F. L 1989. P. 91"/&gt; Mussolini argued that Romansch was an Italian dialect and thus Graubünden should be incorporated into Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Skutsch. ''Encyclopedia of the world's minorities, Volume 3''. London, England, UK: Routledge, 2005. P. 1027.&lt;/ref&gt; Ticino was also claimed because the region had belonged to the [[Duchy of Milan]] from the mid-fourteenth century until 1515, as well as being inhabited by Italian speakers of Italian ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinando Crespi. ''Ticino irredento: la frontiera contesa : dalla battaglia culturale dell'Adula ai piani d'invasione'', F. Angeli, 2004, p. 284 {{ISBN|8846453646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claim was also raised on the basis that areas now part of Graubünden in the [[Mesolcina valley]] and [[Hinterrhein District|Hinterrhein]] were held by the Milanese [[Trivulzio]] family, who ruled from the [[Mesocco Castle]] in the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Crespi 2004, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the summer of 1940, [[Galeazzo Ciano]] met with Hitler and Ribbentrop and proposed to them the dissection of Switzerland along the central chain of the [[Western Alps]], which would have left Italy also with the canton of [[Valais]] in addition to the claims raised earlier.&lt;ref name="Knox"&gt;McGregor Knox, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_PwCu_D-HiUC Mussolini Unleashed, 1939–1941: Politics and Strategy in Fascist Italy's Last War]'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1982), 138.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gran Consiglio Fascismo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The session of the [[Grand Council of Fascism|Grand Council]] of 9 May 1936, where the [[Italian Empire]] was proclaimed]]
To the south, the regime claimed the archipelago of [[Malta]], which had been held by the British since 1800.&lt;ref name="rix"&gt;Juliet Rix. ''Malta''. Bradt Travel Guides. 2010. p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini claimed that the [[Maltese language]] was a dialect of Italian and theories about Malta being the cradle of the Latin civilization were promoted.&lt;ref name="rix"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Cole. ''Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia''. ABC-CLIO. 2011. p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Italian had been widely used in Malta in the literary, scientific and legal fields and it was one of Malta's official languages until 1937 when its status was abolished by the British as a response to Italy's invasion of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Berdichevsky. ''Nations, Language, and Citizenship''. McFarland. 2004. pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt; Italian irredentists had claimed that territories on the coast of [[North Africa]] were Italy's [[Fourth Shore]] and used the historical Roman rule in North Africa as a precedent to justify the incorporation of such territories to Italian jurisdiction as being a "return" of Italy to North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Pollard, Iain Banks. Scorched Earth: Studies in the Archaeology of Conflict. p4.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1939, Italy annexed territories in [[Libya]] that it considered within Italy's Fourth Shore, with Libya's four coastal provinces of Tripoli, Misurata, Benghazi and Derna becoming an integral part of metropolitan Italy.&lt;ref name="Jon Wright P. 165"&gt;Jon Wright. History of Libya. P. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, indigenous Libyans were given the ability to apply for "Special Italian Citizenship" which required such people to be literate in the Italian language and confined this type of citizenship to be valid in Libya only.&lt;ref name="Jon Wright P. 165"/&gt; [[Tunisia]] that had been taken by France as a protectorate in 1881 had the highest concentration of Italians in North Africa and its seizure by France had been viewed as an injury to national honour in Italy at what they perceived as a "loss" of Tunisia from Italian plans to incorporate it.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Slyomovics. The Walled Arab City in Literature, Architecture and History: The Living Medina in the Maghrib. Routledge, 2003. p124.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering World War II, Italy declared its intention to seize Tunisia as well as the province of [[Constantine (departement)|Constantine]] of [[Algeria]] from France.&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Paxton. Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order 1940-1944. Columbia University Press, 2001. p74.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south, the Fascist regime held an interest in expanding Italy's African colonial possessions. In the 1920s, Italy regarded Portugal as a weak country that was unbecoming of a colonial power due to its weak hold on its colonies and mismanagement of them and as such Italy desired to annexe Portugal's colonies.&lt;ref name="Lucas F. Bruyning 1990. P. 113"&gt;Lucas F. Bruyning, Joseph Theodoor Leerssen. Italy – Europe. Rodopi, 1990. P. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's relations with Portugal were influenced by the rise to power of the authoritarian conservative nationalist regime of Salazar, which borrowed fascist methods, though Salazar upheld Portugal's traditional alliance with Britain.&lt;ref name="Lucas F. Bruyning 1990. P. 113"/&gt;

====Race====
{{further|Italian Fascism and racism}}

In a 1921 speech in [[Bologna]], Mussolini stated that "Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our [[Aryan race|Aryan]] and [[Mediterranean race]]".&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. ''Fascism''. Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA: University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p.&amp;nbsp;35&lt;/ref&gt; In this speech, Mussolini was referring to Italians as being the Mediterranean branch of the Aryan Race, Aryan in the meaning of people of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] and culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism emphasized that race was bound by spiritual and cultural foundations and identified a racial hierarchy based on spiritual and cultural factors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt; While Italian Fascism based its conception of race on spiritual and cultural factors, Mussolini explicitly rejected notions that biologically "pure" races were still considered a relevant factor in racial classification.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Glenda Sluga. ''The Problem of Trieste and the Italo-Yugoslav Border: Difference, Identity, and Sovereignty in Twentieth-Century''. SUNY Press, 2001. P. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that ''[[italianità]]'' had assimilatory capacity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; It used spiritual and cultural conceptions of race to make land claims on Dalmatia and to justify an Italian sphere of influence in the Balkans based on then-present and historical Italian cultural influence in the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;Glenda Sluga. ''The Problem of Trieste and the Italo-Yugoslav Border: Difference, Identity, and Sovereignty in Twentieth-Century''. SUNY Press, 2001. Pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime justified colonialism in Africa by claiming that the spiritual and cultural superiority of Italians as part of the [[White people|white race]], justified the right for Italy and other powers of the white race to rule over the [[Black people|black race]], while asserting the racial segregation of whites and blacks in its colonies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Aristotle A. Kallis. ''Fascist Ideology: Expansionism in Italy and Germany 1922–1945''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2000. P. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed that Fascism's colonial goals were to civilize the inferior races and defend the purity of Western civilization from racial miscegenation that it claimed would harm the intellectual qualities of the white race.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; It claimed that the white race needed to increase its [[natality]] in order to avoid being overtaken by the black and [[Yellow race|yellow]] races that were multiplying at a faster rate than whites.&lt;ref name=ag43&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London; New York. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eritrean Balilla.jpg|thumb|[[Eritrea]]n children vow allegiance to the Fascist Party.]]
Within Italy, the [[Italian Empire]] and territory identified as ''[[spazio vitale]]'' for Italy a cultural-racial hierarchy that ranked the peoples in terms of value who lived there was clearly defined by 1940, during which plans for Italy's ''spazio vitale'' were being formalized by the regime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War. P53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime considered Italians to be superior to other peoples of the Mediterranean region – including Latin, Slavic and Hellenic peoples – because only Italians had achieved racial unity and full political consciousness via the Fascist regime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Latin, Slavic and Hellenic peoples were regarded as superior to Turkic, Semitic and Hamitic peoples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Amongst indigenous peoples of Africa, the racial hierarchy regarded indigenous North Africans as superior to indigenous people in [[Italian East Africa]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Though believing in the racial superiority of Europeans over non-Europeans, the Fascist regime displayed diplomatic courtesy to non-Europeans. The regime held an alliance with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] within the [[Axis Powers|Tripartite Pact]] between Germany, Italy and Japan. [[Indian independence movement]] leader [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Italy in 1931 and was invited by Mussolini for a personal visit, providing Gandhi full diplomatic courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;Romain Hayes. Bose in Nazi Germany. Random House India.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist official [[Italo Balbo]] during his transatlantic flight from Italy to the [[United States]] in 1933 visited with leaders of the [[Sioux]] tribe and accepted the Sioux's honorary bestowing of his incorporation into the Sioux with the Sioux position and name "Chief Flying Eagle".&lt;ref&gt;Piers Brendon. ''The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s''. New York: Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2000. P. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Fascism strongly rejected the common [[Nordic race|Nordicist]] conception of the Aryan Race that idealized "pure" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Nordicism was divisive because Italians – and especially southern Italians - had faced discrimination from Nordicist proponents in countries like the United States out of the view that non-Nordic southern Europeans were inferior to Nordics.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald R. Gems. Sport and the Shaping of Italian American Identity. Syracuse University Press, 2013. P57, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the influence of Nordicism had a divisive effect in which the influence resulted in Northern Italians who regarded themselves to have Nordic racial heritage considered themselves a civilized people while negatively regarding Southern Italians as biologically inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald R.

Mussolini and other Fascists held antipathy to Nordicism because of what they viewed as an [[inferiority complex]] of people of Mediterranean racial heritage that they claimed had been instilled into Mediterranean people by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus in their view inferior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; However, traditional Nordicist claims of Mediterraneans being degenerate due to having a darker colour of skin than Nordics had long been rebuked in anthropology through the depigmentation theory that claimed that lighter skinned peoples had been depigmented from a darker skin, this theory has since become a widely accepted view in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Ertl. Toward an Understanding of Europe: A Political Economic Précis of Continental Integration. Boca Raton, Florida, USA: Universal Publishers, 2008. P. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon]] in his work ''The races of Europe'' (1939) subscribed to depigmentation theory that claimed that Nordic race's light-coloured skin was the result of depigmentation from their ancestors of the Mediterranean race.&lt;ref&gt;Melville Jacobs, Bernhard Joseph Stern. General anthropology. Barnes &amp; Noble, 1963.

In the early 1930s, with the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany with ''[[Führer]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]]'s staunch emphasis on a Nordicist conception of the Aryan Race, strong tensions arose between the Fascists and the Nazis over racial issues, as Hitler regarded Northern Italians to be strongly Aryan,&lt;ref&gt;David Nicholls. ''Adolf Hitler: A Biographical Companion''. ABC-CLIO. P211.&lt;/ref&gt; but not Southern Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler: diagnosis of a destructive prophet. Oxford University Press, 2000. P418&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis regarded the ancient Romans to have been largely a people of the [[Mediterranean race]], though they claimed that the Roman ruling classes were Nordic, descended from Aryan conquerors from the North and that this Nordic Aryan minority was responsible for the rise of Roman civilization.&lt;ref name="Alan J. Levine 1996. P97"&gt;Alan J. Levine. ''Race Relations Within Western Expansion''. Praeger Publishers, 1996. P97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis viewed the downfall of the [[Roman Empire]] as being the result of the deterioration of the purity of the Nordic Aryan ruling class through its intermixing with the inferior Mediterranean types that led to the empire's decay.&lt;ref name="Alan J. Levine 1996. P97"/&gt; In addition, racial intermixing in the population in general was also blamed for Rome's downfall, claiming that Italians as a whole were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Due to the darker complexion of Mediterranean peoples, Hitler regarded them as having traces of Negroid blood and therefore were not pure Aryans and inferior to those without such heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent. Modern Political Ideologies. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009  P308.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler praised post-Roman era achievements of northern Italians such as [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;R J B Bosworth. Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Dictatorship, 1915-1945&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis ascribed the great achievements of post-Roman era northern Italians to the presence of Nordic racial heritage in such people who via their Nordic heritage had Germanic ancestors, such as Nazi ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] recognizing Michelangelo and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] as exemplary Nordic men of history.&lt;ref name="David B. Dennis 2012. P17-19"&gt;David B. Dennis. ''Inhumanities: Nazi Interpretations of Western Culture''. Cambridge University Press, 2012. P17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nazis did claim that aside from biologically Nordic people that a Nordic soul could inhabit a non-Nordic body.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Groebel, Robert A. Hinde. Aggression and War: Their Biological and Social Bases. Cambridge University Press, 1989. P159.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler emphasized the role of Germanic influence in Northern Italy, such as stating that the art of [[Northern Italy]] was "nothing but pure German".&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 in the aftermath of Austrian Nazis killing Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], an ally of Italy, Mussolini became enraged and responded by angrily denouncing Nazism. Mussolini rebuked Nazism's Nordicism, claiming that the Nazis' emphasizing of a common Nordic "Germanic race" was absurd by saying that "a Germanic race does not exist. ... We repeat. Does not exist. Scientists say so. Hitler says so".&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was indeed acknowledged by prominent Nazi racial theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]] in his book ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (1922) ("Racial Science of the German People"), where Günther recognized Germans as being composed of five racial types: Nordic, Mediterranean, [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]] and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]] while asserting that the Nordics were the highest in a racial hierarchy of the five types.&lt;ref name=Maxwell150 &gt;Anne Maxwell.

By 1936, the tensions between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany reduced and relations became more amicable. In 1936, Mussolini decided to launch a racial programme in Italy and was interested in the racial studies being conducted by [[Giulio Cogni]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Cogni was a Nordicist, but did not equate Nordic identity with Germanic identity as was commonly done by German Nordicists.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 61"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Cogni had travelled to Germany where he had become impressed by Nazi racial theory and sought to create his own version of racial theory.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 1936, Cogni sent Mussolini a copy of his newly published book ''Il Razzismo'' (1936).&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; Cogni declared the racial affinity of the Mediterranean and Nordic racial subtypes of the Aryan race and claimed that the intermixing of Nordic Aryans and Mediterranean Aryans in Italy produced a superior synthesis of Aryan Italians.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 61"/&gt; Cogni addressed the issue of racial differences between northern and southern Italians, declaring Southern Italians were mixed between Aryan and non-Aryan races, which he claimed was most likely due to infiltration by Asiatic peoples in Roman times and later Arab invasions.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; As such, Cogni viewed Southern Italian Mediterraneans as being polluted with orientalizing tendencies.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; He would later change his idea and claim that Nordics and Southern Italians were closely related groups both racially and spiritually, as they were generally responsible for what is the best in European civilization.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; Initially, Mussolini was not impressed with Cogni's work, but         Cogni's ideas entered into the official Fascist racial policy several years later.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt;

In 1938, Mussolini was concerned that if Italian Fascism did not recognize Nordic heritage within Italians, then the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to Italian society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognized Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent and in a meeting with PNF members. In June 1938 in a meeting with PNF members, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was to be replaced by a focus on Aryanism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;

The Fascist regime began publication of the racialist magazine ''[[La Difesa della Razza]]'' in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nordicist racial theorist [[Guido Landra]] took a major role in the early work of ''La Difesa'' and published the ''Manifesto of Racial Scientists'' in the magazine in 1938.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 80"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Manifesto'' directly addressed its conception of racism and emphasized its autonomy from German racial theories by stating:
{{quote|The question of racism in Italy must be treated from a purely biological point of view, without any philosophical or religious implications. The conception of racism in Italy must be essentially Italian and along Aryan-Nordic lines. This does not mean however that German racial theories are being accepted word for word in Italy and that Italians and Scandinavians are the same. It merely wishes to indicate to the Italian people a physical model and even more importantly a psychological model of human race that on account of its purely European characteristics is completely distinct from all extra-European races. This means to elevate the Italian to an ideal of superior consciousness of himself and to a greater sense of responsibility.|''Manifesto of Racial Scientists'', Article 7&lt;ref&gt;Wiley Feinstein. The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-Semites. Rosemont Publish &amp; Printing Corp., 2003. Pp. 301-302.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The emphasis in the ''Manifesto'' on a psychological model of a superior human being was in reference to the Italian antisemitic racial theorists [[Giovanni Papini]] and [[Paolo Orano]] that stated that those Jews who had associated themselves as being Italian were examples of inferior psychological types that were characterized by moral abjection, falseness and cowardice that could not be associated with the Italian community.&lt;ref name="Wiley Feinstein 2003. P. 302"&gt;Wiley Feinstein. The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-Semites. Rosemont Publish &amp; Printing Corp., 2003. P. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; After Article 7 of the ''Manifesto'', the remainder claimed that peoples of the [[Arabid|Oriental]] race, African races and Jews, as not belonging to the Italian race; and in Article 10 declared that the physical and psychological characteristics of the Italian people must not be altered by crossbreeding with non-European races.&lt;ref name="Wiley Feinstein 2003. P. 302"/&gt;

The ''Manifesto'' received substantial criticism, including its assertion of Italians being a "pure race", as critics viewed the notion as absurd.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 80"/&gt; ''La Difesa'' published other theories that described long-term Nordic Aryan amongst Italians, such as the theory that in the [[Eneolithic]] age Nordic Aryans arrived in Italy.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 81"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the writers of ''La Difesa della Razza'' took up the traditional Nordicist claim that the decline and fall of the Roman Empire was due to the arrival of Semitic immigrants.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 81"/&gt; ''La Difesa'''s writers were divided on their claims that described how Italians extricated themselves from Semitic influence.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 80"/&gt;

The Nordicist direction of Fascist racial policy was challenged in 1938 by a resurgence of the Mediterranean faction in the PNF.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-111"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, the Mediterraneanists advocated a nativist racial theory which rejected ascribing the achievements of the Italian people to Nordic peoples.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-111"/&gt; This nativist racial policy was prominently promoted by [[Ugo Rellini]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-111"/&gt; Rellini rejected the notion of large scale invasions of Italy by Nordic Aryans in the Eneolithic age and claimed that Italians were an indigenous people descended from the [[Cro-Magnon]]s.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-112"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; Rellini claimed that Mediterranean and later Nordic peoples arrived and peacefully intermixed in small numbers with the indigenous Italian population.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-112"/&gt;

In 1941, the PNF's Mediterraneanists through the influence of [[Giacomo Acerbo]] put forward a comprehensive definition of the Italian race.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York City, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these efforts were challenged by Mussolini's endorsement of Nordicist figures with the appointment of staunch spiritual Nordicist [[Alberto Luchini]] as head of Italy's Racial Office in May 1941, as well as with Mussolini becoming interested with [[Julius Evola]]'s spiritual Nordicism in late 1941.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; Acerbo and the Mediterraneanists in his High Council on Demography and Race sought to bring the regime back to supporting Mediterraneanism by thoroughly denouncing the pro-Nordicist ''Manifesto of the Racial Scientists''.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; The Council recognized Aryans as being a linguistic-based group and condemned the ''Manifesto'' for denying the influence of pre-Aryan civilization on modern Italy, saying that the ''Manifesto'' "constitutes an unjustifiable and undemonstrable negation of the anthropological, ethnological, and archaeological discoveries that have occurred and are occurring in our country".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; Furthermore, the Council denounced the ''Manifesto'' for "implicitly" crediting Germanic invaders of Italy in the guise of the Lombards for having "a formative influence on the Italian race in a disproportional degree to the number of invaders and to their biological predominance".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; The Council claimed that the obvious superiority of the ancient Greeks and Romans in comparison with the ancient Germanic tribes made it inconceivable that Italian culture owed a debt to ancient Aryan Germans.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; The Council denounced the ''Manifesto'''s Nordicist supremacist attitude towards Mediterraneans that it claimed was "considering them as slaves" and was "a repudiation of the entire Italian civilization".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt;

=====Attitude and policies regarding Jews=====
{{Main|Manifesto of Race|Italian Racial Laws}}
In his early years as Fascist leader, while Mussolini harboured negative stereotypes of Jews he did not hold a firm stance on Jews and his official stances oscillated and shifted to meet the political demands of the various factions of the Fascist movement, rather than having any concrete stance.&lt;ref&gt;Albert S. Lindemann. Esau's Tears: Modern Anti-Semitism and the Rise of the Jews. Cambridge University Press, 1997. P. 466-467.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini had held antisemitic beliefs prior to becoming a Fascist, such as in a 1908 essay on the topic of Nietzsche's Übermensch, in which Mussolini condemned "pallid Judeans" for "wrecking" the Roman Empire; and in 1913 as editor of the [[Italian Socialist Party]]'s (PSI) ''Avanti!'' newspaper again wrote about the Jews having caused havoc in ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;"Mussolini and the Jews on the eve of the March on Rome" by Giorgio Fabre. Joshua D. Zimmerman (ed). Jews in Italy Under Fascist and Nazi Rule, 1922-1945. P. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mussolini held these negative attitudes, he was aware that Italian Jews were a deeply integrated and small community in Italy who were by and large perceived favourably in Italy for fighting valiantly for Italy in World War I.&lt;ref name="Giorgio Fabre 1945. P. 62"&gt;"Mussolini and the Jews on the eve of the March on Rome" by Giorgio Fabre. Joshua D. Zimmerman (ed). Jews in Italy Under Fascist and Nazi Rule, 1922-1945. P. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 117 original members of the ''[[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento]]'' founded on 23 March 1919, five were Jewish.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;William I. Brustein. ''Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust''. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2003. P. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the movement's early years, there were a small number of prominent openly antisemitic Fascists such as [[Roberto Farinacci]].&lt;ref name="Peter Neville. Mussolini. Pp. 117"&gt;Peter Neville. Mussolini. Pp. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also prominent Fascists who completely rejected antisemitism, such as [[Italo Balbo]] who lived in [[Ferrara]] that had a substantial Jewish community that was accepted and antisemitic incidents were rare in the city.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"&gt;Claudio G. Segrè. ''Italo Balbo: A Fascist Life''. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 1999. P. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to his observation of large numbers of Jews amongst the Bolsheviks and claims (that were later confirmed to be true) that the Bolsheviks and Germany (that Italy was fighting in [[World War I]]) were politically connected, Mussolini said antisemitic statements involving the Bolshevik-German connection as being an "unholy alliance between [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and the synagogue".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Albert S. Lindemann. Esau's Tears: Modern Anti-Semitism and the Rise of the Jews. Cambridge University Press, 1997. P. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini came to believe rumours that Bolshevik leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] was of Jewish descent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; In an article in ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' in June 1919, Mussolini wrote a highly antisemitic analysis on the situation in Europe involving Bolshevism following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–1920)|war in Hungary]] involving the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;Wiley Feinstein.

{{quote|If Petrograd (Pietrograd) does not yet fall, if [General] [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] is not moving forward, then this is what the great Jewish bankers of London and New York have decreed. These bankers are bound by ties of blood to those Jews who in Moscow as in Budapest are taking their revenge on the Aryan race that has condemned them to dispersion for so many centuries. In Russia, 80 percent of the managers of the Soviets are Jews, in Budapest 17 out of 22 people's commissars are Jews. Might it not be that bolshevism is the vendetta of Judaism against Christianity?? It is certainly worth pondering. It is entirely possible that bolshevism will drown in the blood of a pogrom of catastrophic proportions. World finance is in the hands of the Jews.

The international plutocracy dominated and controlled by Jews has a supreme interest in all of Russian life accelerating its process of disintegration to the point of paroxysm.

This statement by Mussolini on a Jewish-Bolshevik-plutocratic connection and conspiracy was met with opposition in the Fascist movement, resulting in Mussolini responding to this opposition amongst his supporters by abandoning this stance shortly afterwards in 1919.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; Upon abandoning this stance due to opposition to it, Mussolini no longer said his previous assertion that Bolshevism was Jewish, but warned that due to the large numbers of Jews in the Bolshevik movement the rise of Bolshevism in Russia would result in a ferocious wave of antisemitism in Russia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; He then claimed that "antisemitism is foreign to the Italian people", but warned Zionists that they should be careful not to stir up antisemitism in "the only country where it has not existed".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;

[[Margherita Sarfatti]] was an influential Jewish member of the PNF whom Mussolini had known since he and her had been members of the PSI and she had been his mistress and helped write ''Dux'' (1926), a biography of Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;Stanislao G. Pugliese. ''Fascism, Anti-Fascism, and the Resistance in Italy: 1919 To the Present''. Lanham, Maryland, USA: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2004.

Pp. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; 230 Italian Jews took part in the Fascists' March on Rome in 1922.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; In the early 1920s, Mussolini was cautious on topics of Italian Jewish financiers that arose from time to time from antisemitic elements in the Fascist movement, while he regarded them as untrustworthy he believed that he could draw them to his side.&lt;ref name="Giorgio Fabre 1945. P. 62"/&gt; In 1932, Mussolini made his private attitude about Jews known to the Austrian ambassador when discussing the issue by saying: "I have no love for the Jews, but they have great influence everywhere. It is better to leave them alone. Hitler's antisemitism has already brought him more enemies than is necessary".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;

On the eve of the March on Rome, the leadership of the PNF declared that  "a Jewish question does not exist in our country and let us hope that there never shall be one, at least not until Zionism poses Italian Jews with the dilemma of choosing between their Italian homeland and another homeland".&lt;ref&gt;Michele Sarfatti. The Jews in Mussolini's Italy: From Equality to Persecution. P. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The relations between the regime and Jews as in those practicing the religion of [[Judaism]] was affected by the Fascists' accommodation of the Catholic Church beginning in the early 1920s in which it sought to remove previous provisions of equality of faiths and impose state support of the supremacy of Catholicism.

In 1928, frustration arose in the regime over Zionism in which Mussolini responded to the Italian Zionist Congress by publicly declaring a question to Italy's Jews on their self-identity: "Are you a religion or are you a nation?". Zionist and anti-Zionist Jews responded, the anti-Zionist Jews professed they were religious Jews as part of the Italian nation, while Zionist Jews declared that there was no dispute between Zionism and said that all Italian Jews held patriotic respect for Italy.&lt;ref name="MicheleSarfatti"&gt;Michele Sarfatti. The Jews in Mussolini's Italy: From Equality to Persecution. P. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon these responses arriving, Mussolini declared that these revealed that a Jewish problem existed in terms of Jewish identity in Italy as a result of conflicting national loyalties amongst Zionist Jews by saying: 
{{quote|My intention was to seek a clarification among Italian Jews and to open the eyes of Christian Italians. [...] This goal has been achieved. The problem exists, and it is no longer confined to that "shadowy sphere" where it had been constituted astutely by the former, ingeniously by the latter.|Benito Mussolini, 1928|source=}}

The Fascists at this time were not wholly opposed to Zionism, but took an instrumental approach to it as they were hostile to it when it caused conflict in Italy with the country's Catholic community and when such Zionists were seen as associated with British interests, though they were favourable to Zionists who opposed the British and sought Italy's support as their protector.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Herf, Anti-Semitism and Anti-Zionism in Historical Perspective: Convergence and Divergence. Routledge, 2013. P6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1930s, Mussolini held discussions with Zionist leadership figures over proposals to encourage the emigration of Italian Jews to the mandate of Palestine, as Mussolini hoped that the presence of pro-Italian Jews in the region would weaken pro-British sentiment and potentially overturn the British mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Herf, Anti-Semitism and Anti-Zionism in Historical Perspective: Convergence and Divergence. Routledge, 2013. P6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1934 Montreux Fascist conference]] chaired by the Italian-led ''Comitati d'Azione per l'Universalita di Roma'' (CAUR) that sought to found a Fascist International, the issue of antisemitism was debated amongst various fascist parties, with some more favourable to it and others less favourable. Two final compromises were adopted, creating the official stance of the Fascist International:

{{quote|[T]he [[Jewish question]] cannot be converted into a universal campaign of hatred against the Jews [...] Considering that in many places certain groups of Jews are installed in conquered countries, exercising in an open and occult manner an influence injurious to the material and moral interests of the country which harbors them, constituting a sort of state within a state, profiting by all benefits and refusing all duties, [[Christian civilization]], the Conference denounces the nefarious action of these elements and is ready to combat them.|CAUR, 1934&lt;ref name="Pax Romanizing"&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,754480,00.html Pax Romanizing]".

In a discussion with President of the [[World Zionist Organization]] [[Chaim Weizmann]] over requests for Italy to provide refuge for Jews fleeing Nazi Germany, Mussolini agreed that he would accept Jewish refugees, but warned Weizmann about consequences if such Jews harmed Italy by saying:&lt;ref name="Ray Moseley 2004.

Italian Fascism's attitudes towards Zionism and Jews in general underwent a shift in response to the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. At the outset of the war, Mussolini sought to gain favourable support for Italy's intervention in Ethiopia and appealed to Zionists by offering them a solution to the Jewish question, in which Italy would set aside a certain amount of territory from conquered Ethiopia to be a homeland for Jews.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Mussolini claimed that territory from conquered Ethiopia would make an ideal homeland for the Jews, noting that there were large numbers of [[Beta Israel|Falasha]] already living there who identified as Jews.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} However, Zionist leaders rejected this proposal by saying that they would only live in the Holy Land in the Levant.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Mussolini viewed this as an offensive snub and responded in frustration saying: "If Ethiopia is good enough for my Italians why isn't it good enough for you Jews?".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Afterwards, Mussolini's relations with the Zionist movement cooled{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and became aggravated with his observation that many Jews opposed the Italo-Ethiopian War, to which he responded:&lt;ref name="Ray Moseley 2004.

In 1936, the Fascist regime began to promote racial antisemitism and Mussolini claimed that international Jewry had sided with Britain against Italy during Italy's war with Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="William Brustein 2003.

In 1938, Fascist Italy passed the [[Italian Racial Laws]] which forbid Jews from their citizenship and forbid sexual relations and marriages between Italians and Jews.&lt;ref name="Rodogno2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodogno|first=David|title=Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War|date=3 August 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84515-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of such racial laws was met with opposition from Fascist members including Balbo, who regarded antisemitism as having nothing to do with Fascism and staunchly opposed the antisemitic laws.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt;

===Totalitarianism===
{{see also|Caesarism}}
In 1925, the PNF declared that Italy's Fascist state was to be [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The term "totalitarian" had initially been used as a pejorative accusation by Italy's liberal opposition that denounced the Fascist movement for seeking to create a total dictatorship.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; However, the Fascists responded by accepting that they were totalitarian, but presented totalitarianism from a positive viewpoint.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Mussolini described totalitarianism as seeking to forge an authoritarian national state that would be capable of completing ''Risorgimento'' of the ''Italia Irredenta'', forge a powerful modern Italy and create a new kind of citizen – politically active Fascist Italians.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

The ''Doctrine of Fascism'' (1932) described the nature of Italian Fascism's totalitarianism, stating the following:
{{quote|Fascism is for the only liberty which can be a serious thing, the liberty of the state and of the individual in the state. Therefore for the fascist, everything is in the state, and no human or spiritual thing exists, or has any sort of value, outside the state. In this sense fascism is totalitarian, and the fascist state which is the synthesis and unity of every value, interprets, develops and strengthens the entire life of the people.|Benito Mussolini, Giovanni Gentile, ''Doctrine of Fascism'' (1932)}}

American journalist [[H. R. Knickerbocker]] wrote in 1941: "Mussolini's Fascist state is the least terroristic of the three totalitarian states. The terror is so mild in comparison with the Soviet or Nazi varieties, that it almost fails to qualify as terroristic at all." As example he described an Italian journalist friend who refused to become a Fascist. He was fired from his newspaper and put under 24-hour surveillance, but otherwise not harassed; his employment contract was settled for a lump sum and he was allowed to work for the foreign press. Knickerbocker contrasted his treatment with the inevitable torture and execution under Stalin or Hitler, and stated "you have a fair idea of the comparative mildness of the Italian kind of totalitarianism".&lt;ref name="knickerbocker1941"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal &amp; Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=72–73 | isbn=9781417992775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since World War II historians have noted that in Italy's colonies Italian Fascism displayed extreme levels of violence. The deaths of one-tenth of the population of the Italian colony of Libya occurred during the Fascist era, including from the use of gassings, [[concentration camp]]s, starvation and disease; and in Ethiopia during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] and afterwards by 1938 a quarter of a million Ethiopians had died.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ben-Ghiat. Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945. p126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporatist economics===
Italian Fascism promoted a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] economic system. The economy involved employer and employee [[syndicate]]s being linked together in corporative associations to collectively represent the nation's economic producers and work alongside the state to set national economic policy.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"/&gt; Mussolini declared such economics as a "[[Third Position|Third Alternative]]" to capitalism and [[Marxism]] that Italian Fascism regarded as "obsolete doctrines";{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} he said in 1935 that orthodox capitalism no longer existed in the country. Preliminary plans as of 1939 intended to divide the country into 22 "corporations", which would send representatives to Parliament from each industry.{{r|gunther1940}}

State permission was required for almost any business activity, such as ending employment or expanding a factory. All wages were set by the government. Restrictions on labor were, however, greater. While corporations still could earn profits,&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n273/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | pages=251–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism supported criminalization of strikes by employees and [[Lockout (industry)|lockouts]] by employers as illegal acts it deemed as prejudicial to the national community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;George Sylvester Counts. Bolshevism, fascism, and capitalism: an account of the three economic systems. 3rd edition. Yale University Press, 1970. Pp. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Bolsheviks in Soviet Russia, Mussolini nationalized all independent trade unions into one government-operated syndicate, mandating union members for every worker.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaetano Salvemini]], ''The Fate of Trade Unions Under Fascism'', Chap. 3: "Italian Trade Unions Under Fascism", 1937, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age and gender roles===
The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called ''[[Giovinezza]]'' ("Youth").&lt;ref name="Mark Antliff 2007. Pp. 171"&gt;Mark Antliff. ''Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909–1939''. Duke University Press, 2007. Pp. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people that will affect society.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995. Pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Fascism pursued what it called "moral hygiene" of youth, particularly regarding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47"&gt;Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995. Pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist Italy promoted what it considered normal sexual behaviour in youth while denouncing what it considered deviant sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47"/&gt; It condemned pornography, most forms of [[birth control]] and contraceptive devices (with the exception of the [[condom]]), homosexuality and prostitution as deviant sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47" /&gt; Fascist Italy regarded the promotion of male sexual excitation before [[puberty]] as the cause of criminality amongst male youth.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47"/&gt; Fascist Italy reflected the belief of most Italians that homosexuality was wrong. Instead of the traditional Catholic teaching that it was a sin, a new approach was taken, based on then-modern psychoanalysis, that it was a social disease.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47"/&gt; Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive campaign to reduce prostitution of young women.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47"/&gt;

Mussolini perceived women's primary role to be childbearers while men were warriors, once saying that "war is to man what maternity is to the woman".&lt;ref name="psychoanalysis"&gt;Bollas, Christopher, ''Being a Character: Psychoanalysis and Self-Experience'' (Routledge, 1993) {{ISBN|978-0-415-08815-2}}, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=malagreca-bridgew&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malagreca|first=Miguel|title=Lottiamo Ancora 1:  Reviewing One Hundred and Fifty Years of Italian Feminism|journal=Journal of International Women’s Studies|date=May 2006|volume=7|issue=4|url=http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/May06/ItalianfeminismMiguel.pdf|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to increase birthrates, the Italian Fascist government gave financial incentives to women who raised large families and initiated policies designed to reduce the number of women employed.&lt;ref name="mussolini73"&gt;McDonald, Harmish, ''Mussolini and Italian Fascism'' (Nelson Thornes, 1999) p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism called for women to be honoured as "reproducers of the nation" and the Italian Fascist government held ritual ceremonies to honour women's role within the Italian nation.&lt;ref name="university74"&gt;Mann, Michael. ''Fascists'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004) p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Mussolini declared that employment of women was a "major aspect of the thorny problem of unemployment" and that for women working was "incompatible with childbearing". Mussolini went on to say that the solution to unemployment for men was the "exodus of women from the work force".&lt;ref name="routledge75"&gt;Durham, Martin, ''Women and Fascism'' (Routledge, 1998) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the initial [[Fascist Manifesto]] contained a reference to universal suffrage, this broad opposition to feminism meant that when it granted women the right to vote in 1925 it was limited purely to voting in local elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lomb.cgil.it/8marzo/8marzo99/voto.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526121949/http://www.lomb.cgil.it/8marzo/8marzo99/voto.htm |archivedate=26 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Passmore, Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tradition===
Italian Fascism believed that the success of Italian nationalism required a clear sense of a shared past amongst the Italian people along with a commitment to a modernized Italy.&lt;ref name="lazzaro2005"/&gt; In a famous speech in 1926, Mussolini called for Fascist art that was "traditionalist and at the same time modern, that looks to the past and at the same time to the future".&lt;ref name="lazzaro2005"/&gt;

Traditional symbols of Roman civilization were utilized by the Fascists, particularly the [[fasces]] that symbolized unity, authority and the exercise of power.&lt;ref name="lazzaro1"&gt;Claudia Lazzaro, Roger J. Crum. "Forging a Visible Fascist Nation: Strategies for Fusing the Past and Present" by Claudia Lazzaro, ''Donatello Among The Blackshirts: History And Modernity In The Visual Culture Of Fascist Italy''. Ithaca, New York, USA: Cornell University Press, 2005. Pp. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional symbols of ancient Rome used by the Fascists included the [[Capitoline Wolf|she-wolf of Rome]].&lt;ref name="lazzaro1"/&gt; The fasces and the she-wolf symbolized the shared Roman heritage of all the regions that constituted the Italian nation.&lt;ref name="lazzaro1"/&gt; In 1926, the fasces was adopted by the Fascist government of Italy as a symbol of the state.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"&gt;Denis Mack Smith. ''Italy and its Monarchy''. Yale University Press, 1989. Pp. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, the Fascist government attempted to have the Italian national flag redesigned to incorporate the fasces on it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt; However, this attempt to incorporate the fasces on the flag was stopped by strong opposition to the proposal by Italian monarchists.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt; Afterwards, the Fascist government in public ceremonies rose the national tricolour flag along with a Fascist black flag.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Gentile. The sacralization of politics in fascist Italy. Harvard University Press, 1996. Pp. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; However, years later and after Mussolini was forced from power by the King in 1943 only to be rescued by German forces, the [[Italian Social Republic]] founded by Mussolini and the Fascists did incorporate the fasces on the state's war flag, which was a variant of the Italian tricolour national flag.

The issue of the rule of monarchy or republic in Italy was an issue that changed several times through the development of Italian Fascism, as initially Italian Fascism was [[Republicanism|republican]] and denounced the Savoy monarchy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;John Francis Pollard. The Fascist Experience in Italy. P. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mussolini tactically abandoned republicanism in 1922 and recognized that the acceptance of the monarchy was a necessary compromise to gain the support of the establishment to challenge the liberal constitutional order that also supported the monarchy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt; King Victor Emmanuel III had become a popular ruler in the aftermath of Italy's gains after World War I and the army held close loyalty to the King, thus any idea of overthrowing the monarchy was discarded as foolhardy by the Fascists at this point.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt; Importantly, Fascism's recognition of monarchy provided Fascism with a sense of historical continuity and legitimacy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt; The Fascists publicly identified King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] – the first King of a reunited Italy who had initiated the ''Risorgimento'' – along with other historic Italian figures such as [[Gaius Marius]], Julius Caesar, Giuseppe Mazzini, [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], Giuseppe Garibaldi and others, for being within a tradition of dictatorship in Italy that the Fascists declared that they emulated.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Duggan. Fascist Voices: An Intimate History of Mussolini's Italy. Oxford, England, UK: Oxford University Press, P. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this compromise with the monarchy did not yield a cordial relationship between the King and Mussolini.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt; Although Mussolini had formally accepted the monarchy, he pursued and largely achieved reducing the power of the King to that of a [[figurehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Beasley Sr., Jimmy Lee. ''I Was There When It Happened''. Xlibris Corporation, 2010. Pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} The King initially held complete nominal legal authority over the military through the ''[[Statuto Albertino]]'', but this was ended during the Fascist regime when Mussolini created the position of [[First Marshal of the Empire]] in 1938, a two-person position of control over the military held by both the King and the head of government that had the effect of eliminating the King's previously exclusive legal authority over the military by giving Mussolini equal legal authority to the King over the military.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation during the Second World War. P. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Mussolini became aggravated by the monarchy's continued existence due to envy of the fact that his counterpart in Germany [[Adolf Hitler]] was both head of state and head of government of a republic; and Mussolini in private denounced the monarchy and indicated that he had plans to dismantle the monarchy and create a republic with himself as head of state of Italy upon an Italian success in the then-anticipated major war about to erupt in Europe.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt;

After being removed from office and placed under arrest by the King in 1943, with the Kingdom of Italy's new non-fascist government switching sides from the Axis to the Allies, Italian Fascism returned to republicanism and condemnation of the monarchy.&lt;ref name="lastdays, pp 16-17"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Moseley | first = Ray |title =Mussolini: The Last 600 Days of Il Duce| publisher=Taylor Trade| url =https://books.google.com/?id=UmxaWvOL_IgC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Campo+Imperatore+abruzzo+mussolini | isbn = 1-58979-095-2 | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 1943, Mussolini made his first public address to the Italian people since his rescue from arrest by allied German forces, in which he commended the loyalty of Hitler as an ally while condemning King Victor Emmanuel III of the Kingdom of Italy for betraying Italian Fascism.&lt;ref name="lastdays, pp 16-17"/&gt; On the topic of the monarchy removing him from power and dismantling the Fascist regime, Mussolini stated: "It is not the regime that has betrayed the monarchy, it is the monarchy that has betrayed the regime" and that "When a monarchy fails in its duties, it loses every reason for being...The state we want to establish will be national and social in the highest sense of the word; that is, it will be Fascist, thus returning to our origins".&lt;ref name="lastdays, pp 16-17"/&gt; The Fascists at this point did not denounce the [[House of Savoy]] in the entirety of its history and credited Victor Emmanuel II for his rejection of "scornfully dishonourable pacts" and denounced Victor Emmanuel III for betraying Victor Emmanuel II by entering a dishonourable pact with the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Luisa Quartermaine. Mussolini's Last Republic: Propaganda and Politics in the Italian Social Republic (R.S.I.) 1943-45. Intellect Books, 1 January 2000. P. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Italian Fascism and the Catholic Church was mixed, as originally was highly anti-clerical and hostile to Catholicism, though from the mid to late 1920s anti-clericalism lost ground in the movement as Mussolini in power sought to seek accord with the Church as the Church held major influence in Italian society with most Italians being Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Pollard. The Vatican and Italian Fascism, 1929-32: A Study in Conflict. Cambridge University Press, 1985, 2005. p10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the Italian government signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] with the [[Holy See]], a [[concordat]] between Italy and the Catholic Church that allowed for the creation of a small enclave known as [[Vatican City]] as a sovereign state representing the [[papacy]]. This ended years of perceived alienation between the Church and the Italian government after Italy annexed the [[Papal States]] in 1870. Italian Fascism justified its adoption of antisemitic laws in 1938 by claiming that Italy was fulfilling the Christian religious mandate of the Catholic Church that had been initiated by [[Pope Innocent III]] in the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] of 1215, whereby the Pope issued strict regulation of the life of Jews in Christian lands. Jews were prohibited from holding any public office that would give them power over Christians and Jews were required to wear distinctive clothing to distinguish them from Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley Feinstein.

==Doctrine==
{{main|Fascism}}
[[File:Giovanni Gentile.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Giovanni Gentile]]: [[Actual idealism|philosophic father]] of Italian Fascism]]

''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]'' (''La dottrina del fascismo'', 1932) by the [[Actual idealism|actualist]] philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] is the official formulation of Italian Fascism, published under Benito Mussolini's name in 1933.&lt;ref name="gentile"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregor|first=A. James|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQEjHAAACAAJ&amp;dq=giovanni+gentile|publisher=Transaction Pub|title=Giovanni Gentile: Philosopher Of Fascism|isbn=0-7658-0593-6 |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentile was [[Intellectualism|intellectually]] influenced by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Plato]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Giambattista Vico]], thus his actual idealism philosophy was the basis for Fascism.&lt;ref name="gentile"/&gt; Hence, the ''Doctrine''{{'}}s ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' proposes the world as action in the realm of humanity — beyond the quotidian constrictions of contemporary political trend, by rejecting "perpetual peace" as fantastical and accepting Man as a species continually at war; those who meet the challenge, achieve [[nobility]].&lt;ref name="gentile"/&gt; To wit, actual idealism generally accepted that conquerors were the men of historical consequence, e.g. the Roman [[Julius Caesar]], the Greek [[Alexander the Great]], the Frank [[Charlemagne]] and the French [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. The philosopher–intellectual Gentile was especially inspired by the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC – AD 476, 1453), from whence derives Fascism:&lt;ref name="gentile"/&gt;

{{cquote|The Fascist accepts and loves life; he rejects and despises suicide as cowardly.

In 1925, Mussolini assumed the title ''[[Duce]]'' (Leader), derived from the Latin ''[[dux]]'' ("leader"), a [[Roman Republic]] military-command title. Moreover, although [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] (1922–1943) is historically considered an authoritarian–totalitarian dictatorship, it retained the original "liberal democratic" government façade: the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] remained active as administrators; and King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] could—at the risk of his [[House of Savoy|crown]]—dismiss Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], as in the event he did.&lt;ref name="lastdays"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moseley |first=Ray |title=Mussolini: The Last 600 Days of Il Duce |publisher=Taylor Trade |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmxaWvOL_IgC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Campo+Imperatore+abruzzo+mussolini |isbn=1-58979-095-2 |date=1 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentile defined Fascism as an anti-intellectual doctrine, [[epistemologically]] based on faith rather than reason. [[Fascist mysticism]] emphasized the importance of [[political myth]]s, which were true not as empirical facts, but as "metareality".&lt;ref name="Payne 1996 215"&gt;{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |title=A History of Fascism, 1914–1945 |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |isbn=9781857285956 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist art, [[Fascist architecture|architecture]] and symbols constituted a process which converted Fascism into a sort of a [[civil religion]] or [[political religion]].&lt;ref name="Payne 1996 215"/&gt; ''La dottrina del fascismo'' states that Fascism is a "religious conception of life" and forms a "spiritual community" in contrast to bourgeois materialism.&lt;ref name="Payne 1996 215"/&gt; The slogan ''Credere Obbedire Combattere'' ("Believe, Obey, Fight") reflects the importance of political faith in Fascism.&lt;ref name="Payne 1996 215"/&gt;

[[File:National Fascist Party logo.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Emblem of the [[National Fascist Party]]]]

According to historian Zeev Sternhell, "most syndicalist leaders were among the founders of the Fascist movement", who in later years gained key posts in Mussolini's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, with Mario Sznajder, Maia Asheri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini expressed great admiration for the ideas of [[Georges Sorel]],&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Leib Talmon, ''The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution'', University of California Press, 1981, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; who he claimed was instrumental in birthing the core principles of Italian fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Neither Left nor Right: Fascist Ideology in France, Princeton University Press, 1996, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; J.L. Talmon argued that Fascism billed itself "not only as an alternative, but also as the heir to socialism".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Talmon, ''The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution'', University of California Press, 1981, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

''La dottrina del fascismo'' proposed an Italy of greater living standards under a one-party Fascist system than under the multi-party [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] government of 1920.&lt;ref name="heater"/&gt; As the leader of the [[National Fascist Party]] (PNF, ''Partito Nazionale Fascista''), Mussolini said that democracy is "beautiful in theory; in practice, it is a fallacy" and spoke of celebrating the burial of the "putrid corpse of liberty".&lt;ref name="heater"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spignesi|first=Stephen J |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufXPKUqorS8C&amp;dq=%22Democracy+is+beautiful+in+theory%22|publisher=CITADEL PR|title=The Italian 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential, Cultural, Scientific, and Political Figures, Past and Present|isbn=0-8065-2399-9 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, to give Deputy Mussolini control of the [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] parliamentary government of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] (1861–1946), an economist, the Baron [[Giacomo Acerbo]], proposed – and the [[Italian Parliament]] approved – the [[Acerbo Law]], changing the electoral system from [[proportional representation]] to majority representation. The party who received the most votes (provided they possessed at least 25 per cent of cast votes) won two-thirds of the parliament; the remaining third was proportionately shared among the other parties – thus the Fascist manipulation of [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] law that rendered Italy a [[one-party state]].

In 1924, the PNF won the election with 65 per cent of the votes,&lt;ref name="matteotti"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,797902,00.html|work=Time|title=So Long Ago|date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the [[United Socialist Party (Italy, 1922–1930)|United Socialist Party]] refused to accept such a defeat – especially Deputy [[Giacomo Matteotti]], who on 30 May 1924 in Parliament formally accused the PNF of electoral fraud and reiterated his denunciations of PNF [[Blackshirts|Blackshirt]] political violence and was publishing ''The Fascisti Exposed: A Year of Fascist Domination'', a book substantiating his accusations.&lt;ref name="matteotti"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Italia_-_30_maggio_1924,_Discorso_alla_Camera_dei_Deputati_di_denuncia_di_brogli_elettorali Speech of the 30th of May 1924] the last speech of Matteotti, from it.wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, on 24 June 1924, the ''Ceka'' (ostensibly a party [[secret police]], modelled on the Soviet ''[[Cheka]]'') assassinated Matteotti and of the five men arrested, [[Amerigo Dumini]], also known as ''Il Sicario del Duce'' ("The Leader's Assassin"), was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, but served only eleven months and was freed under amnesty from King Victor Emmanuel III. Moreover, when the King supported Prime Minister Mussolini the socialists quit Parliament in protest, leaving the Fascists to govern unopposed.&lt;ref name="fsmith"/&gt; In that time, assassination was not yet the ''modus operandi'' norm and the Italian Fascist ''Duce'' usually disposed of opponents in the Imperial Roman way: political arrest punished with island banishment.&lt;ref name="farrell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Farrell|first=Nicholas Burgess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSlIzmsxU8oC&amp;dq=new+life+mussolini|publisher=Orion Publishing Group|title=Mussolini: A New Life|isbn=1-84212-123-5 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalist discontent===
After the [[First World War]] (1914–1918), despite the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] (1861–1946) being a full-partner [[Allies of World War I|Allied Power]] against the [[Central Powers]], [[Italian nationalism]] claimed Italy was cheated in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] (1919), thus the Allies had impeded Italy's progress to becoming a "Great Power".&lt;ref name="fsmith"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch12.htm|publisher=FSmitha.com|title=Mussolini and Fascism in Italy|date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thenceforth, the PNF successfully exploited that "slight" to Italian nationalism in presenting Fascism as best-suited for governing the country by successfully claiming that democracy, socialism and liberalism were failed systems. The PNF assumed Italian government in 1922, consequent to the Fascist Leader Mussolini's oratory and Blackshirt paramilitary political violence.

In 1919 at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the Allies compelled the Kingdom of Italy to yield to Yugoslavia the Croatian seaport of Fiume ([[Rijeka]]), a mostly Italian city of little nationalist significance, until early 1919. Moreover, elsewhere Italy was then excluded from the wartime secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] (1915) it had concorded with the [[Triple Entente]];&lt;ref&gt;The Fascist Experience by Edward R. Tannenbaum, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; wherein Italy was to leave the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] and join the enemy by [[declaration of war|declaring war]] against the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] in exchange for territories at war's end, upon which the Kingdom of Italy held claims (see ''[[Italia irredenta]]'').

In September 1919, the nationalist response of outraged war hero [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] was declaring the establishment of the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]].&lt;ref name="macdonal"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonald|first=Hamish|title=Mussolini and Italian Fascism|publisher=Nelson Thornes|url=https://books.google.com/?id=221W9vKkWrcC&amp;pg=PT16&amp;dq=Gabriele+d%27Annunzio+paris+peace|isbn=0-7487-3386-8|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; To his independent Italian state, he installed himself as the Regent ''Duce'' and promulgated the ''Carta del Carnaro'' (''[[Charter of Carnaro]]'', 8 September 1920), a politically [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] constitutional amalgamation of right-wing and left-wing [[Anarchism|anarchist]], proto-fascist and [[Republican democracy|democratic republican]] politics, which much influenced the politico-philosophic development of early Italian Fascism. Consequent to the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] (1920), the metropolitan Italian military deposed the Regency of ''Duce'' D'Annunzio on Christmas 1920. In the development of the fascist model of government, D'Annunzio was a nationalist and not a fascist, whose legacy of political–[[Praxis (process)|praxis]] ("Politics as Theatre") was stylistic (ceremony, uniform, harangue and chanting) and not substantive, which Italian Fascism artfully developed as a government model.&lt;ref name="macdonal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eatwell, ''Fascism: A History'' (1995)p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Mussolini and many of his revolutionary syndicalist adherents gravitated towards a form of "[[Revolutionary Nationalism]]" in an effort to "identify the 'communality' of man not with class, but with the nation".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Giovanni Gentile: Philosopher of Fascism'', New Brunswick: NJ, Transaction Publishers, 2004, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[A. James Gregor]], Mussolini came to believe that "Fascism was the only form of 'socialism' appropriate to the [[proletarian nation]]s of the twentieth century" while he was in the process of shifting his views from socialism to nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Phoenix: Fascism in Our Time'', New Brunswick: NJ, Transaction Press, 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enrico Corradini]], one of the early influences on Mussolini's thought and later a member of his administration, championed the concept of proletarian nationalism, writing about Italy in 1910: "We are the proletarian people in respect to the rest of the world. Nationalism is our socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob L. Talmon, ''The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution: The Origins of Ideological Polarization'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini would come to use similar wording, for instance referring to Fascist Italy during World War II as the "proletarian nations that rise up against the plutocrats".&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini's interview, "Soliloquy for 'freedom' Trimellone island", on the Italian Island of Trimelone, journalist Ivanoe Fossani, 20 March 1945, ''Opera Omnia'', vol. 32.

Given Italian Fascism's pragmatic political [[Syncretic politics|amalgamations]] of [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] socio-economic policies, discontented workers and peasants proved an abundant source of popular political power, especially because of peasant opposition to socialist agricultural collectivism. Thus armed, the former socialist Benito Mussolini oratorically inspired and mobilized country and working-class people: "We declare war on socialism, not because it is socialist, but because it has opposed nationalism". Moreover, for campaign financing in the 1920–1921 period the National Fascist Party also courted the industrialists and (historically feudal) landowners by appealing to their fears of left-wing socialist and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] labor politics and urban and rural strikes. The Fascists promised a good business climate of cost-effective labor, wage and political stability; and the Fascist Party was ''en route'' to power.

Historian Charles F. Delzell reports: "At first, the Fascist Revolutionary Party (PFR) was concentrated in Milan and a few other cities. They gained ground quite slowly, between 1919 and 1920; not until after the scare, brought about by the workers "occupation of the factories" in the late summer of 1920 did fascism become really widespread. The industrialists began to throw their financial support behind Mussolini after he renamed his party and retracted his former support for Lenin and the Russian Revolution. Moreover, toward the end of 1920, fascism began to spread into the countryside, bidding for the support of large landowners, particularly in the area between Bologna and Ferrara, a traditional stronghold of the Left, and scene of frequent violence. Socialist and Catholic organizers of farm hands in that region, Venezia Giulia, Tuscany, and even distant Apulia, were soon attacked by [[Blackshirt]] squads of Fascists, armed with castor oil, blackjacks, and more lethal weapons. The era of ''[[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|Squadrismo]]'', and nightly expeditions to burn Socialist and Catholic labor headquarters had begun. During this time period, Mussolini's fascist squads also engaged in violent attacks against the Church where "several priests were assassinated and churches burned by the Fascists".&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Parmelle, ''Bolshevism, Fascism, and the Liberal-Democratic State'', London: UK; Chapman and Hill, LTD, New York: NY, John Wiley and Son, Inc., 1935, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fascism empowered==

Italy's use of daredevil elite [[shock troops]], known as the ''[[Arditi]]'', beginning in 1917, was an important influence on Fascism.&lt;ref name=rg207&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. Fascism: Fascism and culture. London, England, UK; New York City, US: Routledge, 2004. p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Arditi'' were soldiers who were specifically trained for a life of violence and wore unique blackshirt uniforms and [[fez]]zes.&lt;ref name=rg207/&gt; The ''Arditi'' formed a national organization in November 1918, the ''Associazione fra gli Arditi d'Italia'', which by mid-1919 had about twenty thousand young men within it.&lt;ref name=rg207/&gt; Mussolini appealed to the ''Arditi'' and the Fascists' ''[[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|Squadristi]]'', developed after the war, were based upon the ''Arditi''.&lt;ref name=rg207/&gt;

The [[First World War]] (1914–1918) inflated Italy's economy with great debts, unemployment (aggravated by thousands of demobilised soldiers), social discontent featuring strikes, [[organised crime]]&lt;ref name="fsmith"/&gt; and [[anarchism|anarchist]], socialist and communist insurrections.&lt;ref name="marchonrome"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-9083848/March-on-Rome|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title=March on Rome|date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the elected [[Italian Liberal Party]] Government could not control Italy, the Fascist Revolutionary Party (''Partito Fascista Rivoluzionario'', PFR) leader Mussolini took matters in hand, combating those issues with the [[Blackshirts]], paramilitary squads of First World War veterans and ex socialists when [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]s such as [[Giovanni Giolitti]] allowed the Fascists taking the law in hand.&lt;ref name="giolitti"&gt;{{cite book  |last=De Grand |first=Alexander J|title=The Hunchback's Tailor: Giovanni Giolitti and Liberal Italy from the Challenge of Mass Politics to the Rise of Fascism, 1882–1922|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y5x7hE8hp1UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Giovanni+Giolitti++mussolini|isbn=0-275-96874-X  |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence between socialists and the mostly self-organized squadristi militias, especially in the countryside, had increased so dramatically that Mussolini was pressured to call a truce to bring about “reconciliation with the Socialists”.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlia S. Elazar, ''The Making of Fascism: Class, State, and Counter-revolution, Italy 1919-1922'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Signed in early August 1921, Mussolini and the Italian Socialist Party (PNF) agreed to the [[Pact of Pacification]], which was immediately condemned by most ras leaders in the ''[[squadrismo]]''. The peace pact was officially denounced during the Third Fascist Congress on 7–10 November 1921.

The Liberal Government preferred Fascist [[class collaboration]] to the [[Italian Communist Party|Communist Party of Italy]]'s [[class conflict]], should they assume government, as had [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]] in the recent [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917,&lt;ref name="giolitti"/&gt; although Mussolini had originally praised Lenin's October Revolution&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neville, ''Mussolini'', Oxon, England, UK; New York: NY, Routledge, 2004, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly referred to himself in 1919 as "Lenin of Italy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Modern Italy: A Political History'', University of Michigan Press, 1997, first publish in 1959, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Manifesto of the Fascist Struggle]]'' (June 1919) of the PFR presented the politico-philosophic tenets of Fascism. The manifesto was authored by [[National syndicalism|national syndicalist]] [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elazar |first=Dahlia S. |title=The Making of Fascism: Class, State, and Counter-Revolution, Italy 1919–1928 |year=2001 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location=Westport, Conn [u.a.] |isbn=9780275958640 |url=http://www.abc-clio.com/product.aspx?isbn=9780275958640 |edition=first pub. |accessdate=1 November 2012 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto was divided into four sections, describing the movement's objectives in political, social, military and financial fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Il manifesto dei fasci di combattimento|url=http://web.tiscalinet.it/regno76/testi/manifesti/Il%20manifesto%20dei%20fasci%20di%20combattimento.htm|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:March on Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The March on Rome coup d'état: Mussolini and the PNF paramilitary [[Blackshirts]], October 1922]]

By the early 1920s, popular support for the PFR's fight against Bolshevism numbered some 250,000 people. In 1921, the ''Fascisti'' (Fascists) metamorphosed into the PNF and achieved political legitimacy when Mussolini was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1922.&lt;ref name="fsmith"/&gt; Although the Liberal Party retained power, the governing [[Prime Minister|prime ministries]] proved ephemeral, especially that of the fifth Prime Minister [[Luigi Facta]], whose government proved vacillating.&lt;ref name="fsmith"/&gt;

To [[Deposition (politics)|depose]] the weak [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]], Deputy Mussolini (with military, business and liberal right-wing support) launched the PNF [[March on Rome]] (27–29 October 1922) [[coup d'état]] to oust Prime Minister [[Luigi Facta]] and assume the government of Italy to restore nationalist pride, restart the economy, increase productivity with labor controls, remove economic business controls and impose [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]].&lt;ref name="fsmith"/&gt; On 28 October, whilst the "March" occurred, [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]] withdrew his support of Prime Minister Facta and appointed PNF Leader Benito Mussolini as the sixth Prime Minister of Italy.

The March on Rome became a victory parade: the Fascists believed their success was revolutionary and [[Traditional values|traditionalist]].&lt;ref name="jstororgro"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1852268|publisher=Roland Sarti|title=Fascist Modernization in Italy: Traditional or Revolutionary|date=8 January 2008|volume=75|pages=1029–1045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="appstate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.appstate.edu/~brantzrw/history3134/mussolini.html |publisher=Appstate.edu |title=Mussolini's Italy |date=8 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415145038/http://www.appstate.edu/~brantzrw/history3134/mussolini.html |archivedate=15 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
{{Main|Economy of Italy under Fascism}}

[[File:Fiat 508 Balilla, advertisement, 1939, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|left|1939 [[Fiat]] advertisement]]

Until 1925, when the liberal economist [[Alberto de Stefani]], although a former member of the ''squadristi'', was removed from his post as Minister of Economics (1922–1925), Italy's coalition government was able to restart the economy and balanced the national budget. Stefani developed economic policies that were aligned with classical liberalism principles, as [[inheritance tax|inheritance]], [[luxury tax|luxury]] and foreign capital taxes were abolished;&lt;ref name=Guerin2&gt;[[Daniel Guérin]], ''[[Fascism and Big Business]]'' Chapter IX, Second section, p.193 in the 1999 Syllepse Editions&lt;/ref&gt; [[life insurance]] (1923)&lt;ref name=Guerin&gt;[[Daniel Guérin]] ''[[Fascism and Big Business]]'', Chapter IX, First section, p.191 in the 1999 Syllepse Editions&lt;/ref&gt; and the state communications monopolies were [[Privatisation|privatised]], etc. During Italy's coalition government era, pro-business policies apparently did not contradict the State's financing of banks and industry. Political scientist Franklin Hugh Adler referred to this coalition period between Mussolini's appointment as prime minister on 31 October 1922 and his 1925 dictatorship as "Liberal-Fascism, a hybrid, unstable, and transitory regime type under which the formal juridical-institutional framework of the liberal regime was conserved", which still allowed pluralism, competitive elections, freedom of the press and the right of trade unions to strike.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Hugh Adler, ''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906-1934'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Party leaders and industrialists thought that they could neutralize Mussolini by making him the head of a coalition government, where as [[Luigi Albertini]] remarked "he will be much more subject to influence".&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Lyttelton, ''Seizure of Power: Fascism in Italy, 1919-1929'', London: UK, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1973, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Prime Minister Mussolini's first acts was the 400-million-lira financing of [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.]], one of the country's most important engineering companies. Subsequent to the 1926 [[deflation]] crisis, banks such as the ''Banco di Roma'' (Bank of Rome), the ''Banco di Napoli'' (Bank of Naples) and the ''[[Banco di Sicilia]]'' (Bank of Sicily) also were state-financed.&lt;ref name=Guerin3&gt;[[Daniel Guérin]], ''[[Fascism and Big Business]]'', Chapter IX, Fifth section, p.197 in the 1999 Syllepse Editions&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, a private business enterprise established ''[[Unione Radiofonica Italiana]]'' (URI) as part of the [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] company, to which the Italian Fascist Government granted official radio-broadcast monopoly. After the defeat of Fascism in 1944, URI became ''[[Radio Audizioni Italiane]]'' (RAI) and was renamed ''RAI&amp;mdash;Radiotelevisione Italiana'' with the advent of television in 1954.

[[File:Inaugurazione Littoria 001.jpg|thumb|The inauguration of [[Littoria]] in 1932]]

In addition, given the overwhelmingly rural nature of Italian economy in the period, agriculture was vital to Fascist economic policies and propaganda. To strengthen the domestic Italian production of grain, in 1925 the Fascist Government established [[protectionist]] policies that ultimately failed (see: the [[Battle for Grain]]). Historian [[Denis Mack Smith]] reports: "Success in this battle was... another illusory propaganda victory, won at the expense of the Italian economy in general, and consumers in particular.... Those who gained were the owners of the [[Latifondia|Latifundia]], or "latifondi", and the propertied classes in general.... [Mussolini's] policy conferred a heavy subsidy on the Latifondisti".&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]] (1981), ''Mussolini''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1926 following the [[Pact of the Vidoni Palace]] and the [[Syndical Laws]], business and labour were organized into 12 separate associations, outlawing or integrating all others. These organizations negotiated labour contracts on behalf of all its members with the state acting as the arbitrator. The state tended to favour big industry over small industry, commerce, banking, agriculture, labour and transport even though each sector officially had equal representation.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Sarti, Fascism and the Industrial Leadership in Italy, 1919-40: A Study in the Expansion of Private Power Under Fascism, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Pricing, production and distribution practices were controlled by employer associations rather than individual firms and labour syndicates negotiated collective labour contracts binding all firms in the particular sector. Enforcement of contracts was difficult and the large bureaucracy delayed resolutions of labour disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Sarti, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1929, the Fascist regime countered the [[Great Depression]] with massive [[public works]] programs, such as the draining of the [[Pontine Marshes]], [[hydroelectricity]] development, railway improvement and rearmament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Warwick Palmer |first= Alan |title=Who's Who in World Politics: From 1860 to the Present Day|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YdMWTvXhVlUC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq=mussolini's+achievements |isbn=0-415-13161-8  |date=1 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale]] (IRI – Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) was established to subsidize failing companies and soon controlled important portions of the national economy via [[government-linked companies]], among them [[Alfa Romeo]].

As Prime Minister, Mussolini physically participated with the workers in doing the work; the "politics as theatre" legacy of Gabriele D' Annunzio yielded great propaganda images of ''Il Duce'' as  "Man of the People".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1925b.htm|publisher=Cronologia.it|title=Anno 1925|date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/economy_in_fascist_italy.htm|publisher=HistoryLearningSite.co.uk|title=The Economy in Fascist Italy|date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the creation of the IRI, Mussolini boasted to his Chamber of Deputies: "Three-fourths of the Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state".&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Toniolo, editor, ''The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59; Mussolini's speech to the Chamber of Deputies was on 26 May 1934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schmidt, ''The Corporate State in Action'', London: Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1939, pp. 153–76&lt;/ref&gt; As Italy continued to nationalize its economy, the IRI "became the owner not only of the three most important Italian banks, which were clearly too big to fail, but also of the lion's share of the Italian industries".&lt;ref&gt;Costanza A. Russo, "Bank Nationalizations of the 1930s in Italy: The IRI Formula", ''Theoretical Inquiries in Law'', Vol. 13:407 (2012), p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Mussolini identified his economic policies with "state capitalism" and "state socialism", which later was described as "economic dirigisme", an economic system where the state has the power to direct economic production and allocation of resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván T. Berend]], ''An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe'', New York: NY, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, Fascist Italy attained the highest rate of state–ownership of an economy in the world other than the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Knight, ''Mussolini and Fascism: Questions and Analysis in History'', New York: Routledge, 2003, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; where the Italian state "controlled over four-fifths of Italy's shipping and shipbuilding, three-quarters of its pig iron production and almost half that of steel".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Blinkhorn]], ''Mussolini and Fascist Italy'', 2nd edition, New York: NY, Routledge, 1991, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VaticanCity Annex.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Question]] resolved: Vatican City-State territory, 1929]]

===Relations with the Catholic Church===

In the 19th century, the forces of the Italian ''[[Risorgimento]]'' (1815–1871) had conquered Rome and taken control of it away from the [[Papacy]], which saw itself henceforth as a [[prisoner in the Vatican]]. In February 1929, as Italian Head of Government, Mussolini concluded the unresolved Church–State conflict of the [[Roman Question]] (''La Questione romana'') with the [[Lateran Treaty]] between the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Holy See]], establishing the [[Vatican City]] [[microstate]] in Rome. Upon ratification of the Lateran Treaty, the papacy recognized the state of Italy in exchange for diplomatic recognition of the Vatican City,&lt;ref&gt;,http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/331566/Lateran-Treaty&lt;/ref&gt; territorial compensations, introduction of religious education into all state funded schools in Italy&lt;ref name="heater"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heater|first=Derek Benjamin |url=https://books.google.com/?id=94oMyEWGnXYC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Lateran+Treaty+mussolini|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Our World this Century|isbn=0-19-913324-7 |date=23 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'' (2000), pp. 464–65.&lt;/ref&gt; and 50 million [[pounds sterling]] that were shifted from Italian bank shares into a Swiss company Profima SA. British wartime records from the ''National Archives in Kew'' also confirmed Profima SA as the Vatican's company which was accused during WW II of engaging in "activities contrary to Allied interests". Cambridge historian [[John F. Pollard]] wrote in his book that this financial settlement ensured the "papacy [...] would never be poor again".&lt;ref name="Pollard_2005_book"&gt;[[John F.

Not long after the Lateran Treaty was signed, Mussolini was almost "excommunicated" over his "intractable" determination to prevent the Vatican from having control over education.&lt;ref name="Denis Mack Smith 1983, p. 162"&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini'', New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, the Pope protested Mussolini's "pagan worship of the state" and the imposition of an "exclusive oath of obedience" that obligated everyone to uphold fascism.&lt;ref name="Denis Mack Smith 1983, p. 162"/&gt; Once declaring in his youth that "religion is a species of mental disease",&lt;ref&gt;James A. Haught, ''2000 Years of Disbelief: Famous People with the Courage to Doubt'', Amherst: NY, Prometheus Books, 1996, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini "wanted the appearance of being greatly favoured by the Pope" while simultaneously "subordinate to no one".&lt;ref name="Denis Mack Smith 1983, p. 162"/&gt; Mussolini's widow attested in her 1974 book that her husband was "basically irreligious until the later years of his life".&lt;ref&gt;Rachele Mussolini, ''Mussolini: An Intimate Biography'', New York: NY, Pocket Books, 1977, p. 131.

===Influence outside Italy===
The Fascist government model was very influential beyond Italy. In the twenty-one-year [[interbellum]] period, many [[Political Science|political scientists]] and philosophers sought [[Ideology|ideological]] inspiration from Italy.

Italian Fascism was copied by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party]], the [[Russian Fascist Organization]], the Romanian [[National Fascist Movement]] (the [[National Romanian Fascia]], [[National Italo-Romanian Cultural and Economic Movement]]) and the Dutch fascists were based upon the ''Verbond van Actualisten'' journal of [[H. A. Sinclair de Rochemont]] and [[Alfred Haighton]]. The [[Sammarinese Fascist Party]] established an early Fascist government in [[San Marino]] and their politico-philosophic basis essentially was Italian Fascism. In the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Milan Stojadinović]] established his [[Yugoslav Radical Union]]. They wore green shirts and [[Šajkača]] caps and used the [[Roman salute]]. Stojadinović also adopted the title of ''Vodja''. In Switzerland, pro-Nazi Colonel [[Arthur Fonjallaz]] of the [[National Front (Switzerland)|National Front]] became an ardent Mussolini admirer after visiting Italy in 1932 and advocated the Italian annexation of Switzerland whilst receiving Fascist foreign aid.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Morris Schom, [http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&amp;b=243125 A Survey of Nazi and Pro-Nazi Groups in Switzerland: 1930–1945] for the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; The country was host for two Italian politico-cultural activities: the International Centre for Fascist Studies (CINEF — ''Centre International d' Études Fascistes'') and the 1934 congress of the Action Committee for the Universality of Rome (CAUR — ''Comitato d' Azione della Università de Roma'').&lt;ref&gt;R. Griffin, ''The Nature of Fascism'', London: Routledge, 1993, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the writer [[Ernesto Giménez Caballero]] in ''Genio de España'' (''The Genius of Spain'', 1932) called for the Italian annexation of Spain, led by Mussolini presiding an international Latin Roman Catholic empire. He then progressed to close associated with [[Falangism]], leading to discarding the Spanish annexation to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8533">'''Jewish women in the Holocaust''' refers to women who were [[Jewish]] and imprisoned in [[Europe]] in [[Nazi concentration camps]] or in hiding to prevent capture by the Nazis during the [[Holocaust]] between 1933 and 1945.&lt;ref name="sahistory.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/human-rights-issues-during-and-after-world-war-ii-focus-nazi-germany-grade-12-2 |title=How and why did the Holocaust happen? &amp;#124; South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the estimated six million Jews who were killed&lt;ref name="historyplace.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/holocaust/h-statistics.htm|title=Holocaust Timeline: Statistics of the Holocaust|date=|publisher=The History Place|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Holocaust, 2 million of them were women.&lt;ref name="Hedgepeth2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hedgepeth|first=Sonja|title=Sexual Violence against Jewish Women during the Holocaust|date=2010|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Lebanon|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish women were sexually  harassed, yelled at, beaten, were victims of [[Nazi human experimentation]]s and were brutally murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women During the Holocaust|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005176|accessdate=29 April 2014|author=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Female and male comparison  ==
Some scholars have argued that women were more inclined toward nurturing each other and that this might have posed an advantage to them.  However, others have noted that men also created social support networks in the concentration camps.   The more social women were with each other, the higher chance they had at survival.&lt;ref name="Ringelheim1998"&gt;{{cite book|title=Different Voices: Women and the Holocaust|last=Ringelheim|first=Joan|date=1998|publisher=Paragon House|isbn=978-1557785046}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|379}} An interview (conducted to hear the reflections of women and the Holocaust) of a woman from the Holocaust named Rose described the bonds the women formed:

{{blockquote|...[women were] picking each other like monkeys [for lice]…. Never remember seeing the men do it. The minute they had lice they just left it alone; the women have a different instinct. Housewives. We want to clean…. Somehow the men,… the [lice] ate them alive… [During roll call] the women holding each other and keeping each other warm…. Someone puts their arm around and you remember…. Can you imagine how much it meant to us over there! Men were crouching into themselves- maybe five feet apart [Rose demonstrated how the men she saw put their arms around their own bodies, rather than around the next person for warmth]…. I think more women survived…. As much as I saw in Auschwitz, the men were falling like flies. The woman were somehow stronger…. Woman friendship is different than man friendship you see…. We have these motherly instincts, friend instincts more…the men, no…the men didn’t do that. Men were friends there too. They talked to each other but they didn’t, wouldn’t, sell their bread for an apple for the other guy. They wouldn’t sacrifice nothing. See, that was the difference.&lt;ref name="Ringelheim1998" /&gt;{{rp|380}}}}

==Disadvantages for women compared to men==
Being Jewish and female during the Holocaust doubled one's vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldenberg|first=Myrna|date=November 1996|title=Lessons learned from Gentle Heroism: Women's Holocaust Narratives|journal=The Holocaust: Remembering for the Future|series=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=548|pages=78–93|jstor=1048544}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|80}} Women's reproductive abilities came under assault as a result of the genocidal conditions.  For example, several women from the Holocaust who wrote memoirs noted that they developed [[amenorrhea]] which would ultimately reduce their chances of ever having children.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg1996" /&gt;{{rp|82}} One of the major disadvantages, which coincided with Jewish women’s vulnerabilities during the Holocaust, was the possibility of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinnreich|first=Helene|date=2008|title='And it was something we didn't talk about': Rape of Jewish Women during the Holocaust |url-access=subscription |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17504902.2008.11087214|journal=Holocaust Studies|volume=14|issue=2|pages=1–22|doi=10.1080/17504902.2008.11087214|issn=1750-4902|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women were sometimes raped right before being murdered.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg1996" /&gt;{{rp|83}}
One SS officer was reported to have, "had the custom of standing at the doorway… and feeling the private parts of the young women entering the gas bunker. There were also instances of SS men of all ranks pushing their fingers into the sexual organs of pretty young women."&lt;ref name="Goldenberg1996" /&gt;{{rp|84}}

Childbirth also came as a disadvantage to women’s lives when they were in the concentration camps. This disadvantage struck them physically and emotionally. Once labor was over and the baby was born, the women vulnerable to being killed along with their baby. One memoir describes some of the sadistic acts, which were performed among those who were pregnant: "SS men and women amuse themselves by beating pregnant women with clubs and whips, [being] torn by dogs, dragged around by the hair and kicked in the stomach with heavy German boots. Then when [the pregnant Jewish women] collapsed, they were thrown into the crematory-alive."&lt;ref name="Goldenberg1996" /&gt;{{rp|86}} {{rp|376}}

== Gender versus identity ==

=== Double jeopardy ===
Several Jewish women who wrote their own memoirs reflecting on the Holocaust reported there being a double jeopardy in their everyday lives as prisoners. These vulnerabilities included the biological differences compared to men, gender-specific socialization patterns, and the obligation of being a nurturer.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg1996" /&gt;{{rp|88}} With this said, antisemitism was not the only problem. In her reflection and interview, a Jewish Woman who survived the Holocaust described this double jeopardy: "I had two enemies: Nazis and men."&lt;ref name="Ringelheim1998" /&gt;{{rp|374}} Another account mentions that besides the Nazis, men acted like "animals" too. She said that one day, the SS officers decided to let the men go to the side where the women were. At this point in time, all they wanted to do was have sex.&lt;ref name="Ringelheim1998" /&gt;{{rp|377}} Overall, the experiences that the women faced during the Holocaust were often seen more brutal to their gender rather than their identity (Jew). "Their stories demonstrate shared fears about and experiences of sexual vulnerability as women, not only about mortal danger as Jews."&lt;ref name="Ringelheim1998" /&gt;{{rp|376}}

===Jewish women and motherhood===
It had been noted that major disparities between mother and father figures were caused by the gender roles of Jewish men and women imprisoned during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=Margaret Myers|title=Absent Fathers, Present Mothers: Images of Parenthood in Holocaust Survivor Narratives|journal=Jewish Women in the Economy|date=Spring 2007|volume=13|series=Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women's Studies and Gender Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} Women often described their experiences in the Holocaust in maternal ways.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2007" /&gt;{{rp|156}} The women commonly referred to themselves as surrogate mothers.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2007" /&gt;{{rp|158}} Women were able to use their nurturing and domestic nature to describe their experiences in the camps. To them, being a woman in the Holocaust meant that they were every type of woman. They considered themselves as a sister, a mother, a daughter, etc.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2007" /&gt;{{rp|175}} Motherhood represented their gender as a woman, therefore, they were constantly worried and looking out for their children. One female survivor said, "We were so afraid for our children. We wouldn’t let our children out of our sight when they were going down to play or something."&lt;ref name="Feinstein2007" /&gt;{{rp|174}}

The '''Peasant International''' ({{lang-ru|Крестьянский Интернационал}}), known most commonly by its [[Russian language|Russian]] abbreviation '''Krestintern''' (Крестинтерн), was an international peasants' organization formed by the [[Communist International]] in October 1923. The organization attempted to achieve [[united front]] relations with radical peasant parties in Eastern Europe and Asia, without lasting success. After failing to make headway with important initiatives in [[Bulgaria]], [[Yugoslavia]], and [[China]] in the 1920s, the organization was placed on hiatus at the end of the decade. The so-called Red Peasant International was formally dissolved in 1939.

==Organizational history==
===Background===

The idea for a Red Peasant International is commonly credited to [[Poland|Polish]] [[Communism|Communist]] [[Tomasz Dąbal]], a former member of the Polish Peasant Party and representative elected to the Polish parliament.&lt;ref name=DRR&gt;Graeme Gill, "Peasant International," in George Jackson and Robert Devlin (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Russian Revolution.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1989; pp. 435-436.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 1923, Dąbal published an article in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]'s daily newspaper, ''[[Pravda]],'' noting a surge in popularity of [[agrarianism|peasants' political parties]], particularly in [[Eastern Europe]], and arguing that these organizations might provide fertile soil for the sowing of Communist ideas among the [[peasant|peasantry]].&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; Dąbal suggested that the [[Communist International]] should form such an organization to facilitate the establishment of [[united front]] political activities between communist and peasants' parties in Europe.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt;

The Comintern had already established similar organizations for the radical youth movement and the [[trade union]] movement — the [[Young Communist International]] (KIM) and the [[Profintern|Red International of Labor Unions]] (Profintern), respectively — and the idea that a radical international for peasants should be established under Comintern auspices. With the pro-peasant [[New Economic Policy]] in full swing in Soviet Russia, the idea for international organization of peasants quickly gained institutional traction.

===Establishment===
[[File:V.kolarov.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bulgarian Communist [[Vasil Kolarov]] was head of the Krestintern during its waning years, leading the organization from 1928 until its demise in 1939]]
The Red Peasant International was established at a founding congress held in [[Moscow]] from October 10-16, 1923.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; The gathering was attended by 158 delegates, hailing from 40 countries, with a majority of participants representing countries in Eastern Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; This gathering established a governing body comparable to the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] known as the [[International Peasant Council]].&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; Two major plenary sessions of the International Peasant Council were held — the first in October 1923 and the second in November 1927.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt;

The formal head of the new organization at the time of its formation was [[Aleksandr Petrovich Smirnov|A. P. Smirnov]], although Dąbal emerged as the organization's leading public spokesman.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; Smirnov remained in place as the organization's chief until 1928.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt;

In 1928 Smirnov was replaced as the top official of the Peasant International by [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] Communist [[Vasil Kolarov]], long a top figure of the Comintern.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; Kolarov served as chairman of a new governing body for the organization known as the Executive Committee of the Krestintern.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt;

===Activities===
[[File:Stjepan Radić (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Stjepan Radić]], head of the [[Croatian People's Peasant Party]], who briefly affiliated his organization with the Krestintern in 1924]]

The Krestintern initially sought to build common cause with the [[Bulgarian Peasants Union]], an organization established in exile in [[Yugoslavia]] by two former ministers of the government of [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] following his government's overthrow by a [[military coup]] in June 1923.&lt;ref name=Carr7-209&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926: Volume 3, Part 1.'' London: Macmillan, 1964; pg. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these ministers, K. Todorov, travelled to Moscow early in January 1924 where he conducted negotiations with [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and Vasil Kolarov regarding joint action between their organization and the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party of Bulgaria]] for the overthrow of the newly imposed [[Aleksandar Tsankov]] regime.&lt;ref name=Carr7-209 /&gt; The Bulgarian Communists sought without success for Todorov to align his organization with the newly established Krestintern; for his part Todorov sought money and arms for use against the Tsankov government.&lt;ref name=Carr7-209 /&gt; Some Comintern money changed hands, but no alignment of the Peasants Union with the Peasant International or change of regime in Bulgaria was forthcoming.&lt;ref name=Carr7-209 /&gt;

The Krestintern was largely unsuccessful in its task of gathering and mobilizing non-Communist peasants' political parties to advance Communist ends and was only able to attract a small number of factional grouplets, these frequently being artificial creations of the various national communist parties themselves.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; The sole exception to this rule was the nominal affiliation was the brief and nominal adherence of the [[Croatian People's Peasant Party]] ''(Hrvatska Pučka Seljačka Stranka)'' headed by [[Stjepan Radić]] in 1924 during a visit to Moscow.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; This affiliation is judged by historian [[E. H. Carr|E.H. Carr]] to have had less to do with Communism than with the national aspirations of non-Serbian ethnicities inside [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country,'' vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The close relations between Radić's organization and the Soviets led to a banning of the Croatian Republican Peasant Party and its official publication, the magazine ''Radnik'' (The Worker), were officially banned on July 12, 1924.&lt;ref name=Carr7-228&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country,'' vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal continued to be issued illegally for a short time before being terminated at the end of September.&lt;ref name=Carr7-228 /&gt; 

Radić was imprisoned within months of his return to Yugoslavia and the Central Committee of the now-banned Peasant Party was quick to renounce his seemingly rash decision to affiliate with Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country,'' vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than bolstering the political position of his organization, Radić's dalliance with the Red Peasant International seemed to have gone far to bringing about its demise. Four months after his release from prison in July 1925, Radić and his party endorsed the monarchy and the Yugoslav constitution and joined the government.&lt;ref name=Carr7-405&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country,'' vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] was left to curse Radić for having made a "shameful capitulation."&lt;ref name=Carr7-405 /&gt; The Krestintern's "united front" strategy fell to failure.

The Krestintern published an official organ called ''The Peasant International'' to propagate its political views.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; The magazine was launched in April 1924 and included articles by [[Japan|Japanese]] Communist [[Sen Katayama]] and [[Ho Chi Minh|Nguyễn Ái Quốc]] (Ho Chi Minh) of [[Vietnam]], emphasizing the new International's goal of building the radical agrarian movement of Asia in addition to its plan to build bridges to Eastern European peasant parties.&lt;ref name=Carr8-615&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 615.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 the Krestintern attempted to help broker cooperative relations between the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP) and the [[Kuomintang]] headed by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The presidium of the International Peasant Council, the top leadership of the Peasant International, issued an open letter to the Kuomintang and its peasant section at the end of April of that year, expressing supreme confidence in that organization as "the center which rallies, unites, and organizes all the revolutionary forces against the pressure of the reactionaries and imperialists."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Carr, ''Socialism in One Country,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 784-785.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang parlayed this relationship into Soviet aid and a list of Communist Party members&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 785.&lt;/ref&gt; — assets which were later used in a formidable and partially successful effort to annihilate the CCP in the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]]. The Krestintern's activities in China once again proved ineffective for advancing Comintern policy interests.
Also in 1926 the Krestintern established a research facility in Moscow for the study of agrarian problems and the publication of books on these topics, known as the International Agrarian Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 956.&lt;/ref&gt; This subdivision of the Peasant International actually continued to exist for several years past the demise of its parent organization, publishing books through 1942, when the German invasion in [[World War II]] forced its termination.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt;

===Later years and dissolution===

The period of pro-peasant moderation exemplified by the New Economic Policy came to an abrupt end in 1928, marked by a return to [[prodrazvyorstka|forced requisitioning]] in an attempt to alleviate the [[Grain Crisis of 1928]]. Serious efforts to advance a united front with the peasantry through the Red Peasant International seem to have been abandoned at this time, although the organization remained nominally functional for nearly a decade further.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt;

In 1930 a new Communist-backed agrarian organization called the [[European Peasant Committee]] was unveiled in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; As was the case with the Peasant International, this group proved a failure in its design to attract peasants and peasant organizations to the communist banner.&lt;ref name=DRR /&gt; The grim brutality of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]], followed by agrarian collapse and a massive famine in 1932-33 essentially terminated any chance for a reestablishment of the so-called [[smychka]] between urban-oriented Communist movement and the peasantry in ensuing years.

{{Culture of Gibraltar}}
'''''Llanito''''' or '''''Yanito''''' (pronounced {{IPA-es|jaˈnito|}}) is a form of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] heavily laced with words from English and other languages, such as [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], spoken in the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name="creole"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ge-It/Gibraltar.html#orientation|title=Culture of Gibraltar|publisher=Everyculture|accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly marked by a great deal of [[Code-switching|code switching]] between [[Andalusian Spanish]] and [[British English]] and by the use of [[anglicisms]] and loanwords from other Mediterranean languages and dialects.&lt;ref name="Levey2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Levey|title=Language Change and Variation in Gibraltar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKW6uqxsj4YC|date=January 2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-1862-5|page=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Llanito'' is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word meaning "little plain". [[Gibraltarians]] also call themselves ''Llanitos''.

==Language==
Andalusian Spanish from the surrounding ''[[Campo de Gibraltar]]'' is the main constituent of ''Llanito'', but it is also heavily influenced by British English. However, it borrows words and expressions of many other languages, with over 500 words of [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] ([[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]]) medieval dialect (with additionally some of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] origin).&lt;ref name="ethno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=eng#Gibraltar|title=Gibraltar Ethnologue profile|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its other main language constituents are [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. It often also involves [[code-switching]] from Spanish to English. Some ''Llanito'' words are also widely used in the neighbouring Spanish town of [[La Línea de la Concepción]] (due to the influx of people from La Línea working in Gibraltar over many years).&lt;ref name="linea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.ya.com/milinea/paginas/diccionario.htm|title=Linense Dictionary|publisher=La Línea de la Concepción|accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To some outsiders who only speak either English or Spanish, ''Llanito'' may sound incomprehensible, as speakers appear to [[Code-switching|switch languages in mid-sentence]], but to people who are [[multilingualism|bilingual]] in both languages, it can sound interesting and unique. One feature of the language is the pronunciation of English words with an Andalusian flavour. For example, bacon is pronounced ''beki''; cake, ''keki''; battery, ''batteria''; a policeman is known as ''la parma'', and porridge is called ''kuecaro'' (a [[hispanicization]] of the brand [[Quaker Oats]]). Most Gibraltarians, especially those with higher education, also speak standard Spanish with either [[Andalusian dialect|Andalusian]] or normative pronunciations and standard English of the British English [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fEiX-YLT3j8C&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;ots=eKRYD5n5Lq&amp;dq=Gibraltarian%20speak%20british%20english&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q=Gibraltarian%20speak%20british%20english&amp;f=false A New New English: language, politics, and identity in Gibraltar]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Italian scholar Giulio Vignoli, Llanito originally, in the first decades of the 19th century, was full of Genoese words, later substituted mainly by Spanish words and by some English words.

Llanito has significant Jewish influence, because of a [[History of the Jews in Gibraltar|long standing Jewish population in Gibraltar]]. They introduced words and expressions from [[Haketia]], a largely extinct Judeo-Spanish language spoken by the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] communities of Northern [[Morocco]], such as [[Tetuan]] and [[Tangiers]] and the Spanish [[exclave]]s of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] in North Africa.

Even though Llanito is seldom written, a Llanito dictionary, ''Diccionario Yanito'', was published in 1978 by [[Manuel Cavilla]], and in 2001 [[Tito Vallejo]] published ''The Yanito Dictionary. Including Place Names and Yanito Anecdotes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://hera.ugr.es/tesisugr/16077507.pdf | title = The discursive construction of Gibraltarian identity in the printed press: A critical discourse analysis on the Gibraltar issue (PhD Thesis) | author = Ángela Alameda Hernández | publisher = [[Universidad de Granada]] | accessdate = 2008-10-13 | pages = 20 | isbn = 84-338-3818-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core elements of Llanito==
Although Llanito is largely based on the colloquial Spanish spoken in the Campo de Gibraltar, there are numerous elements beyond code-switching to English which make it unique. These are as follows.

===Anglicisms===
*''Echegarai'': Watchman or Guard. From English ''"Check Gate"'' influenced by the Basque surname [[Etxegarai]]/[[Echegaray]].
*''Focona'': Gibraltar border with Spain. From English ''"Four Corners"''.

===Calques from English to Spanish===
*''Te llamo pa' trás'': Literal translation into Spanish of English phrase "I'll call you back". In standard Spanish, one would normally say "I'll return your call" (Te devuelvo la llamada", "Te devolveré la llamada").

===Calques from Spanish to English===
*''Don't give me the tin'': Literal translation of Spanish expression ''"No me des la lata"'', meaning "stop annoying me".
*''What a cachonfinger!'': This is a humorous expression based on the Spanish word ''"cachondeo"'' which means "piss-take" in British English. The end of the word "deo" is how the word ''"dedo"'' (finger) is pronounced in colloquial Spanish, thus ''cachonfinger''.

===Local expressions===
*''¿Tú quien te crees que eres? ¿El hijo del Mebli?'' Literally, ''"Who do you think you are? The son of the Mebli?"'', as used when someone is acting with excessive self-importance. "Mebli" is a mispronunciation of Lord Melville.

===Borrowings from third languages===

==Llanito words introduced into Spain==
Many Llanito terms have been introduced into the Andalusian Spanish dialect of the bordering city [[La Línea de la Concepción]], where the resulting dialect is known as Linense. However, according to Gibraltarian linguist Tito Vallejo, a few words common throughout Spain may be of Llanito origin, notably "Chachi" meaning "Cool" or "Brilliant" (from [[Winston Churchill]]) and "Napia" meaning "Big Nose" from [[Lord Napier]]. Churchill was associated with foreign imports from the United Kingdom which were highly sought in Gibraltar and, according to Vallejo, Lord Napier had a particularly big nose.

However, linguists also propose ''chachi'' to be a contraction of the [[Caló language|Caló]] term ''chachipén'' meaning "truth", since this language is the source of a significant proportion of Spanish slang.

==Broadcasting==
The [[Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation]] has also aired some programmes in Llanito including ''Talk About Town'' &amp;ndash; a discussion series in which three presenters discuss local affairs, from the need to replace a street sign to important political affairs.

''Pepe's Pot'' was a cookery programme/program which also used Llanito.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pffC9la_pOc&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;

==Film==
A documentary film, "People of the Rock: The Llanitos of Gibraltar"&lt;ref&gt;http://grubstreetenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/people-of-rock-llanitos-of-gibraltar.html&lt;/ref&gt; (2011) discusses Llanito speech characteristics, history and culture. Notable interviews include Pepe Palmero (of GBC's "Pepe's Pot"), [[Kaiane Aldorino]] (Miss World 2009) and Tito Vallejo (author of "The Llanito Dictionary").

==Demonym==
The official [[demonym]] of Gibraltar is ''[[Gibraltarians]]''. However, the people of Gibraltar may also be referred to as ''Llanitos'' (female: ''Llanitas''). This term is commonly used in the neighbouring towns of [[La Línea]], [[San Roque, Cádiz|San Roque]], [[Algeciras]] and the rest of the [[Campo de Gibraltar]], as well as in Gibraltar itself. When speaking in English, the people of Gibraltar tend to use the word ''Gibraltarians'' to refer to themselves but when speaking in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] they prefer to use the word ''Llanitos'' rather than the Spanish name for their official demonym, ''Gibraltareños''.{{fact|date=September 2016}}

The [[truncation|truncated]] term ''Llanis'' is also used by the people of Gibraltar, where it can be heard all around the territory and chanted in songs during the annual [[Gibraltar National Day]].{{fact|date=September 2016}}

==Etymology==
The etymology of the term ''Llanito'' is uncertain. In Spanish, ''Llanito'' means "little flatland" and has been interpreted as "people of the flatlands". It is thought that the inhabitants of La Línea with important social and economic ties with Gibraltar, were actually the first to be referred to as ''Llanitos'' since La Línea lies in the plain and marsh land surrounding The Rock. 

Another theory for the origin of the word is that it is a [[diminutive]] of the name ''[[Gianni]]'': "gianito", pronounced in Genoese slang with the "g" as "j".&lt;ref&gt;Vignoli, Giulio. "Gli Italiani Dimenticati"; Chapter: Gibilterra&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 18th century 34% of the male civilian population of Gibraltar came from [[Genoa]] and ''Gianni'' was a common [[Italian name|Italian forename]].&lt;ref&gt;Levey, David: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VKW6uqxsj4YC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;ei=nGOrSqv8OaSCywSMtvilCg#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20gibraltar%20ethnic&amp;f=false ''Language change and variation in Gibraltar'', page 24. John Benjamins Publishing Company.]&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, nearly 20% of Gibraltarian surnames are Italian in origin. {{fact|date=September 2016}}{{or|date=September 2016}}

'''Luc-Marie Constant Gnacadja''' or simply  '''Luc Gnacadja''' is a [[Benin]]ese politician and [[architect]]. He was Executive Secretary of the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] from 2007 to 2013.

==Political career==
Gnacadja served in the government of Benin as Minister of the Environment, Housing, and Urban Planning from June 1999 to February 2005 under long-time President [[Mathieu Kérékou]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/french/specials/1618_benin_elex/page5.shtml Page on 2006 presidential candidates], BBC Afrique {{fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to major political changes taking place since 2005, particularly with President Kérékou barred from running again by a two-term limit and an age limit of 70 years for candidates, Gnacadja  ran for president as the unique candidate of the [[Envol]] movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panapress.com/pana-17-lang1-index.html|title=---::: Panapress ::: -la panafricaine de presse pour vos informations, analyses et résumés de l'actualité africaine - Le site officiel ---:::|website=www.panapress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Beninese presidential election, 2006|March 2006 presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonangnon.net/vote2006.php Page on 2006 presidential candidates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805204722/http://www.sonangnon.net/vote2006.php |date=2007-08-05 }}, sonangnon.net {{fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; receiving 11th place and 0.68% of the vote in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/bj.html Elections in Benin], African Elections Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations career==
In terms of ministerial authority, Luc Gnacadja represented Benin as the head of delegation to the UNCCD and at the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) while serving as Minister.

In September 2007, Luc Gnacadja was appointed as Executive Secretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) by [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]], after he was endorsed by the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties of the UNCCD.&lt;ref name=UNCCD/&gt; In applying for the position, Gnacadja was said to have been backed by Beninese President [[Yayi Boni]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://apanews.net/apa.php?page=show_article_eng&amp;id_article=41128 "Beninese named UN Desertification Convention chief"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070805235821/http://apanews.net/apa.php?page=show_article_eng&amp;id_article=41128 |date=2007-08-05 }}, African Press Agency, September 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gnacadja's second term concluded at the end of September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VQaM7fUY?url=http://www.un.org/press/en/2013/sga1438.doc.htm |deadurl=no |archivedate=8 January 2015 |title=Secretary-General Appoints Monique Barbut of France Executive Secretary, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/sga1438.doc.htm |work=United Nations |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Ambassadors Launch Group of Friends of Desertification |url=http://post2015.iisd.org/news/un-ambassadors-launch-group-of-friends-of-desertification |deadurl=no |archivedate=8 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VQaz1glK?url=http://sd.iisd.org/news/un-ambassadors-launch-group-of-friends-of-desertification/ |work=IISD |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since he first took office in 2007, he managed to effectively address the UNCCD's lack of scientific basis. His vision of the UNCCD process was based on moving the Convention towards effective implementation through evidence-based policymaking, target setting and monitoring of implementation by means of agreeing a strong and globally trusted set of impacts and progress indicators by the scientific community; so as to build a strong and authoritative science and policy interface for the Convention. Accordingly, the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its eighth session in 2007 decided that future sessions of the Committee on Science and Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unccd.int/en/about-the-convention/the-bodies/The-CST/Pages/default.aspx|title=The Committee on Science and Technology (CST)  - UNCCD|website=www.unccd.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CST) shall be organized in a predominantly scientific and technical conference-style format and focus on a specific thematic topic relevant to the implementation of The ten-year Strategy&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unccd.int/Lists/SiteDocumentLibrary/10YearStrategy/Decision+3COP8+adoption+of+The+Strategy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to enhance the implementation of the Convention (2008-2018), to be determined in advance by the COP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unccd.int/en/programmes/Science/Conferences/Pages/default.aspx|title=UNCCD Scientific Conferences - Knowledge Hub|website=www.unccd.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNCCD 3rd Scientific Conference&lt;ref&gt;http://land-l.iisd.org/events/unccd-3rd-scientific-conference/&lt;/ref&gt; on “Combating Desertification, Land Degrdation and Drought (DLDD) for poverty reduction and sustainable development: the contribution of science, technology, traditional knowledge and practices”  (decision 18/COP.10) is expected to be held in March 2015 in [[Mexico]].

==Key issues==
In 1992, the first [[Earth summit]] held in Rio agreed to combat [[land degradation]]. Under Gnacadja's direction, [[Rio+20]] held in 2012 witnessed the birth of a new paradigm:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.iofc.org/node/62383 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141130210354/http://us.iofc.org/node/62383 |archivedate=2014-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "land degradation neutrality" meant to reduce land degradation to the minimum level close to the unavoidable degradation by means of prevention while at the same time restoring degraded areas whenever possible by means of [[sustainable land management]] (SLM). In this respect, one of his main interests include a priority focus on Land and [[Soil]] in the Global [[Sustainability]] Agenda.

Gnacadja was a guiding voice for sustainable land development in the negotiations leading up to [[Rio+20]], the June 2012 UN Conference on [[Sustainable Development]]. His personal efforts to promote adoption of an international commitment to a “land degradation–neutral world”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unccd.int/en/programmes/RioConventions/RioPlus20/Pages/Land-DegradationNeutralWorld.aspx|title=Land Degradation Neutrality - UNCCD|website=www.unccd.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; was deemed a critical step forward according to The expert committee overseeing the Cook Prize for Desert Architecture led by Prof. [[David Perlmutter]], chair of the Bona Terra Department of Man in the Desert at the BIDR.&lt;ref name="unccd.int"&gt;http://www.unccd.int/Lists/SiteDocumentLibrary/Media/NewsHighlight/Cook_Prize_Press_Release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and awards==
Luc Gnacadja earned an architecture degree at the African Crafts School of Architecture and Urbanism in Lomé, [[Togo]], and later studied at [[Harvard]] University’s Kennedy School of Government and the [[World Bank Institute]].

In March 2003, Gnacadja was awarded the Green Award 2002 by the [[World Bank]] in Washington.&lt;ref name=UNCCD&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sga1092.doc.htm "Secretary-General appoints Luc Gnacadja of Benin Executive Secretary of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification"], United Nations website, SG/A/1092, September 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; for promoting environment-friendly public expenditure reform in Benin.

On November 17, 2014, Gnacadja was awarded the Jeffery Cook Prize in Desert Architecture&lt;ref name="unccd.int"/&gt; at the International Drylands, Deserts and Desertification Conference&lt;ref&gt;http://eld-initiative.org/index.php?id=51&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=90&amp;cHash=59c28d8db91510efbb6f3a97fd36da24&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[Ben-Gurion University]]&lt;ref name="unccd.int"/&gt; of the Negev’s Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research (BIDR).

==Other activities==
Gnacadja is an honorary councillor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/5561.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093134/http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/5561.html |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[The World Future Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/english.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402034213/http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/english.html |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (WFC) launched in 2007 in Hamburg, [[Germany]] by [[Jakob von Uexkull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rightlivelihood.org/about_the_award.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801012608/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/about_the_award.html |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WFC is an international Foundation consisting of some eminent global personalities who promote change by advocating at the highest levels for a sustainable, just and peaceful future and providing decision-makers with practical solutions to the global challenges facing future generations.

'''Managed decline''' is a [[phrase]] that refers to the management of the decline (or "sunset") phase at the end of a [[Enterprise life cycle|lifecycle]], with the goal of minimizing costs or other forms of losses and harm. The concept originated in business where it referred to the management of companies and industries, but has since spread beyond to be used in other contexts.

Examples of managed decline include the handling of the [[textile]]s, [[shipbuilding]], [[coal]] and [[steel]] industries in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coen|first=David and Wyn Grant, Graham Wilson|title=The Oxford handbook of business and government|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199214271|pages=332|url=https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Business-Government-Handbooks-Management/dp/0199214271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zan|first=Luca and Stefano Zambon, Andrew M.

Decline can be managed through multiple means, including public or [[industrial policy]] efforts such as government provision of retraining.

'''Mary Elizabeth Anderson Pawlenty''' (born January 13, 1961) is a former American [[state court (United States)|state court]] judge who served on [[Minnesota District Courts|Minnesota's First Judicial District]] from 1994 to 2007. The wife of Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]], she was [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of Minnesota|First Lady of Minnesota]] from 2003 to 2011. She previously worked as a private-practice attorney and in 2009 became director at a medical [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]]. She has been a mediator with [http://lawgilbert.com/qualified-neutrals/mary-e-pawlenty/ Gilbert Mediation since 2007].

==Early life and education==
Mary Anderson was raised in [[Edina, Minnesota]]. In 1979, she graduated from [[Edina High School|Edina-East High School]]. In 1983, she graduated from [[Bethel University (Minnesota)|Bethel University]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]], ''summa cum laude''. She received her [[Juris Doctor]], ''cum laude'', from the [[University of Minnesota Law School]]&amp;mdash;where she met [[Tim Pawlenty]]&amp;mdash;in 1986.

==Legal career==
Following graduation, Anderson practiced law in [[Houston, Texas]] for one year. She then returned to Minnesota to marry Tim Pawlenty. They settled in [[Eagan, Minnesota]].

In 1994, Mary was appointed as a Judge of the [[District Court of Minnesota]] for [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] in [[Hastings, Minnesota]] by Governor [[Arne Carlson]]. She and her husband began raising their two daughters, Anna (born 1993) and Mara.

==First Lady of Minnesota==
The family remained at their Eagan home instead of taking the Governor's Residence after Tim Pawlenty was elected [[Governor of Minnesota]] in 2002 due to Mary's requirement to stay in her judicial district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200211/06_hughesa_newgov/|title=Pawlenty sets stage for a Capitol revolution|author=Art Hughes|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=November 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As First Lady of Minnesota, Mary Pawlenty established a web-based program that facilitated the connection between community-based organizations willing to volunteer their time and services and the families of deployed servicemen and women - an initiative that is continued by the Minnesota National Guard as a nationally recognized model for web-based and community support for military families, known as Beyond the Yellow Ribbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.148fw.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123215370/|title=First ladie's military family care initiative continues|author=Amie Dahl|publisher=148th Fighter Wing|date=July 29, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820165528/http://www.148fw.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123215370%2F|archivedate=August 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaving the judicial bench===
In January 2007, after her husband was sworn into his second term as Governor, Judge Pawlenty announced that she was leaving the bench on February 12, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adrforum.com/newsroom.aspx?&amp;itemID=1148&amp;news=3 |title=National Arbitration Forum : Judge Mary Pawlenty Named General Counsel of the National Arbitration Forum |publisher=Adrforum.com |date=2007-01-05 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began work at the [[National Arbitration Forum]] shortly thereafter as its [[general counsel]] in charge of the National Arbitration Forum's legal affairs.

The '''Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research''' is one of [[Government of Egypt|the governmental bodies]] of [[Egypt]] and part of [[Cabinet of Egypt|the cabinet]].

==History==
The ministry was established on 9 November 1961,&lt;ref name=ipo&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Higher Education|url=http://www.ipoque.com/sites/default/files/mediafiles/documents/case-study-ministry-higher-education-egypt.pdf|work=Ipoque|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=centre&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Higher Education|url=https://www.zsi.at/en/object/partner/2564|work=Centre for Social Innovation|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when university education in Egypt became free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mariz Tudros |title=Unity in diversity |journal=Al Ahram Weekly |date=18–24 March 1999 |volume=421 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/421/li1.htm |accessdate=28 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530205258/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/421/li1.htm |archivedate=30 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between March 2011 and June 2013 the ministry had seven different ministers.&lt;ref name=nad&gt;{{cite news|title=Higher education still suffering after the revolution|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20130606161959301|accessdate=20 October 2013|work=University World News|date=8 June 2013|author=Nadia El Awady}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amr Ezzat Salama was one the ministers during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Allen Peterson|title=Egypt's media ecology in a time of revolution|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/10112011-egypts-media-ecology-in-a-time-of-revolution-analysis/|accessdate=7 October 2014|work=Eurasia Review|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mostafa Mussad]] served as minister of higher education from August 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamist professor becomes higher education minister|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120809105521363|accessdate=23 January 2014|work=University World News|date=9 August 2012|author=Ashraf Khaled}}&lt;/ref&gt; to July 2013 when [[Hossam Eisa]] replaced him in the post.&lt;ref name=nad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's interim president swears in first government|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/76619/Egypt/Politics-/BREAKING-Egypts-interim-president-is-swearing-in-f.aspx|accessdate=20 October 2013|work=Ahram Online|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry was headed by El Sayed Abdel Khalek between June 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecairopost.com/news/115224/news/breaking-new-government-swear-in|title=New government swears in|date=17 June 2014|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=Cairo Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Egypt’s New Government|url=http://egyptianstreets.com/2014/06/17/meet-egypts-new-government/|accessdate=7 October 2014|work=Egyptian Streets|date=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and September 2015.

==Organization and activities==
The major function of the ministry, based in [[Cairo]], is to develop, implement and monitor all the higher education-related policies.&lt;ref name=centre/&gt;&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{cite web|title=Higher education in Egypt|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/tempus/participating_countries/overview/egypt_tempus_country_fiche_final.pdf|work=European Commission|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry is responsible for the educational activities of the universities, both public and private, in the country. The ministry realizes this function through three executive bodies, namely the Supreme Council of Universities, the Supreme Council of Private Universities and the Supreme Council of Technical Institutions.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;

In addition, the ministry supervises the [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo|Academy of the Arabic Language]] and the National Committee of UNESCO.&lt;ref name=ipo/&gt; The ministry has international bureaus, including the Egyptian Cultural and Educational Bureau in [[Washington DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message from director|url=http://www.eecous.net/|work=Egyptian Cultural and Educational Bureau|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018, the ministry with [[Minya University]], spearheaded a week-long sports event for people with disabilities. It was the first of its kind in Egypt's history, as Egypt works to integrate disabled into society.&lt;ref name="AMAY_1st_Disability"&gt;{{cite news |title=Start of First Disability Challenge |url=https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1260332 |accessdate=18 October 2018 |work=Al Masry Al Youm |date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 it was announced that Egyptian children would begin to learn English starting in Kindergarten.&lt;ref name="English_curriculum"&gt;{{cite news |title=English language will be taught in kindergarten for the first time: Minister of education |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/311199/Egypt/Politics-/English-language-will-be-taught-in-kindergarten-fo.aspx |accessdate=17 September 2018 |work=Ahram |date=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2708">'''''Munckska kåren''''' (literally "the Munck corps", formally ''Stockholms luftförsvars frivilliga beredskapsförening'') was a Swedish secret [[paramilitary]] group founded by the retired [[lieutenant general]] [[Bror Munck (born 1857)|Bror Munck]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Ohlson2015"/&gt; While nominally apolitical, it was founded to protect the Swedish state against "domestic enemies", implying not [[fascist]]s or [[nazi]]s, but solely left-wing radicals.&lt;ref name="Ohlson2015"/&gt; At its height it had about 2,000 members.&lt;ref name="Lööw"/&gt;

During the late 1920s leaders of the police were affected by the Red Scare, and thought they were inadequately prepared for a [[coup d'état]] similar to the [[October Revolution]]. Anti-communist rhetoric was harsh, especially during the so-called [[Swedish general election, 1928|"Cossack Election" of 1928]].&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt; The plan was for its 2,000 members to have 50 rounds of ammunition each. Stockholm police chief Gustaf Hårleman managed to attain proper licenses for about 1,300 guns, while about 500 to 600 guns were smuggled in illegally from Germany.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;

The corps was unveiled in 1931, leading to a lively debate in Swedish press.&lt;ref name="Ohlson2015"/&gt; [[Horst von Pflugk-Harttung]], who had facilitated the illegal smuggling of arms, was expelled in December 1931.&lt;ref name="SvD"/&gt; The corps disbanded the following year.&lt;ref name="Ohlson2015"/&gt; In 1934 Swedish law was altered to ban similar groups.&lt;ref name="Ohlson2015"/&gt;

{{History of France}}

The '''National Convention''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Convention nationale}}) was the first government of the French Revolution, following the two-year [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] and the one-year [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]].  Created after the great insurrection of [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], it was the first French government organized as a republic, abandoning the monarchy altogether.  The Convention sat as a single-chamber assembly from 20 September 1792 to 26 October 1795 (4 Brumaire IV under the [[French Republican Calendar|Convention's adopted calendar]]).

The Convention came about when the Legislative Assembly, which had found it impossible to work with the king, decreed the provisional suspension of [[King Louis XVI]] and the convocation of a National Convention to draw up a new constitution with no monarchy.  The other major innovation was to decree that deputies to that Convention should be elected by all Frenchmen twenty-five years old or more, domiciled for a year and living by the product of their labor. The National Convention was, therefore, the first French assembly elected by a suffrage without distinctions of class.

Although the Convention lasted until 1795, power was effectively stripped from the elected deputies and concentrated in the small [[Committee of Public Safety]] from April 1793.  The eight months from the fall of 1793 to the spring of 1794, when [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and his allies dominated the Committee of Public Safety, represent the most radical and bloodiest phase of the French Revolution, known as the [[Reign of Terror]].  After the fall of Robespierre, the Convention lasted for another year until a new constitution was written, ushering in the [[French Directory]].

== Elections==
The [[French National Convention election, 1792|indirect election]] took place from 2 to 10 September 1792 after the election of the electoral colleges by primary assemblies on 26 August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivespasdecalais.fr/Anniversaires/Du-2-au-10-septembre-1792-election-des-deputes-a-la-Convention-nationale Du 2 au 10 septembre 1792 : élection des députés à la Convention nationale]&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the abstention of royalists,{{Clarify|date=February 2017}} the anti-republicans, and the fear of victimization the voter turnout in the departments was low – 11.9% of the electorate came, compared to 10.2% in the 1791 elections – in spite of the fact that the number of those eligible to vote had doubled.{{clarify|reason=does not make sense.  On these figures the 1792 turnout was higher than 1791, not 'low'. Also 11% of twice the electorate is clearly a lot more|date=February 2017}} Therefore, the quasi-universal male suffrage had very little impact. The electorate returned the same sort of men that the [[Active and passive citizens|active citizens]] had chosen in 1791.{{sfn|Dupuy|2005|p=34-40}}

In the whole of France, only eleven primary assemblies wanted to retain the monarchy. Of the electoral assemblies, all tacitly voted for a republic – though only Paris used the word. None of the deputies stood as a royalist for elections. Out of the five million Frenchmen able to vote, only a million showed up at the polls. {{clarify|reason=this would be 20%; previous paragraph says it was 11%|date=February 2017}}{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=310}}{{refn|group="note"|The Convention had therefore been elected by small minority of the population, but those who were the most determined. That explains the ambiguity of the word "popular" when it is applied to this period: "popular" the French Revolution was certainly ''not'' in the sense of participation by the people in public affairs. But if the word "popular" is taken to mean that revolutionary policy was formed under pressure from the ''[[sans-culotte]]'' movement and organized minorities, and received an egalitarian impetus from them, then yes, the Revolution had well and truly entered its "popular" age.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=115}}}}

On 20 September the Convention held its first session in the "Salle des Cent-Suisses", the next day it moved to the [[Salle du Manège]], with little room for the public and a bad acoustic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antoine-saint-just.fr/lieux/tuileries.html&lt;/ref&gt; From 10 May 1793 it met in the [[Théâtre des Tuileries|Salle des Machines]], an immense hall in which the deputies were loosely scattered. The Salle des Machines had galleries for the public who often influenced the debates with interruptions or applause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/natcon.html The National Convention] 1906&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|group="note"|During the early meetings of the Convention the deputies had sat indiscriminately, where they pleased. But it was noticed that, as the quarrel between Jacobins and Girondins developed, they grouped themselves to the right and left of the President's chair, whiles the extreme Jacobins found a place of vantage in the higher seats at the end of the hall, which came to be called the Mountain ({{lang-fr|La Montagne}}).{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=320}}}}

The members of the Convention came from all classes of society, but the most numerous were lawyers. 75 members had sat in the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], 183 in the [[French Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. The full number of deputies was 749, not counting 33 from the French colonies, of whom only some arrived in Paris in time. [[Thomas Paine]] and [[Anacharsis Cloots]] were appointed in the Convention by Girondins. Besides these, however, the newly formed {{lang|fr|[[département in France|départements]]}} annexed to France from 1782 to 1789 were allowed to send deputations.

According to its own ruling, the Convention elected its President every fortnight, and the outgoing President was eligible for re-election after the lapse of a fortnight. Ordinarily, the sessions were held in the morning, but evening sessions also occurred frequently, often extending late into the night. Sometimes in exceptional circumstances, the Convention declared itself in permanent session and sat for several days without interruption. For both legislative and administrative the Convention used committees, with powers more or less widely extended and regulated by successive laws. The most famous of these committees included the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and the [[Committee of General Security]].

The Convention held [[legislative power|legislative]] and [[executive power|executive]] powers during the first years of the [[French First Republic]] and had three distinct periods: Girondin, Montagnard or Jacobin, and Thermidorian.

== Girondin Convention ==
The first session was held on 20 September 1792. The following day, the assembly agreed the proposition "[[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|That royalty be abolished in France]]" and was carried with cheers. On the 22nd came the news of the [[Battle of Valmy]]. On the same day it was decreed that "in future the acts of the assembly shall be dated ''First Year of the French Republic''". Three days later the corollary that "the French republic is one and indivisible" was added to guard against federalism. A republic had been proclaimed, but it remained to enact a republican government. The country was little more republican in feeling or practice than it had been before at any time since [[Flight to Varennes|Varennes]]. But now it had to become a republic, because it no longer had a king.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=315}}

When the Convention met the military situation was undergoing an extraordinary transformation that seemed to confirm the Girondin prophecies of easy victory. After [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]] the Prussians withdrew to the frontier, and in November French troops occupied the left bank of the [[Rhine]]. The Austrians, who had besieged [[Lille]] in October, were defeated by [[Charles François Dumouriez|Dumouriez]] at the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November and evacuated the Austrian Netherlands. [[Nice]] was occupied and [[Savoy]] proclaimed its union with France. These successes made it safe to quarrel at home.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=157}}

===The Girondins and the Montagnards===
Most historians divide the National Convention into two main factions: the [[Girondins]] and the [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnards]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The Girondins were the more radical democratic faction at the Convention, as opposed to the Montagnards, who were authoritarian populists. They drew their name from the [[Gironde]], a region of France from which many of the deputies of this faction were elected (although many "Girondins" were actually Parisian by origin). They were also known as the Brissotins after their most prominent speaker, [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|Jaques Pierre Brissot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Girondin|title=Girondin {{!}} political group, France|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montagnards, who drew their support from the less educated segments of the Parisian population, drew their name from the high bleachers that they sat on while the Convention was in session. The Montagnards dominated the Convention through the threat of physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reilly|first=Benjamin|date=2004|title=Polling the Opinions: A Reexamination of Mountain, Plain, and Gironde in the National Convention|jstor=40267833|journal=Social Science History|doi=10.1215/01455532-28-1-53|pmid=|volume=28|pages=53–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three questions dominated the first months of the Convention: revolutionary violence; the trial of the king; and Parisian dominance of politics.

Antagonism between Paris and the provinces created friction among the people that served as a propaganda tool and combat weapon for the two groups. The departments resisted the idea of centralization. They saw this idea being symbolized by the desire to reduce the capital of the Revolution to its one-eighty-third share of influence. Much of the Gironde wished to remove the Assembly from a city dominated by "agitators and flatterers of the people": it did not at the time encourage an aggressive federalism that would have run counter to its political ambitions.{{sfn|Bouloiseau|1983|p=51}}

=== The Plain ===
The Plain was a third faction during the Convention. Though some historians consider these men to be closely associated with the Girondins, the Plain was much more centrist in their ideals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The Plain held the largest group of deputies and derived their name from their place on the floor of the Convention. During the start of the Convention, they sided with the Girondins, however, as it progressed and the Montagnards began to push for the execution of Louis, the Plain began to side with them.

===Trial and execution of the King===
{{Main article|Trial of Louis XVI|Execution of Louis XVI}}

[[File:ExaminationLouistheLast.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The trial of Louis XVI]]

From the opening of the Convention the Girondins showed no inclination to bring the king to trial. They were more interested in discrediting Paris and its deputies. Their decision to hound the Jacobins was not merely a choice of priorities; they genuinely wanted to spare the king.{{sfn|Jordan|1979|p=59}} But in reality the Convention had to declare him guilty if it wanted to avoid damning 10 August 1792, its own existence, and the proclamation of the Republic. "If the king is not guilty, then those who have dethroned him are", as Robespierre remarked on 2 December. Once the Convention recognized Louis's guilt it could hardly refuse to pronounce the death penalty against a person who had summoned the aid of foreign powers and whom the ''[[sans-culottes]]'' considered responsible for the [[10 August (French Revolution)#Assault on the Tuileries|ambush at the Tuileries]].{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=270}}

The discovery of the [[Armoire de fer|iron chest]] in the Tuileries 20 November 1792 made the trial inevitable. Documents found in this secret chest proved without any doubt the treachery of Louis XVI.

The trial began on 10 December. The Montagnards put the debate on the ideological level. Louis XVI was classified as an enemy, alien to the body of the nation and as a "usurper". Balloting began on 14 January 1793. Each deputy explained his vote at the rostrum. The vote against the king was unanimous. There was to be no popular referendum as Girondins hoped. The fatal vote started on 16 January and continued until the next day. Of the 721 deputies present, 387 declared themselves for the death penalty, while 334 were opposed. 26 deputies voted for death on condition that he was reprieved. On 18 January the question of reprieve was put to a vote: 380 votes were cast against; 310 for. Each time the Girondins had split.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=284}}

On the morning of 21 January the Convention ordered the entire National Guard to line both sides of the route to the scaffold. Louis was beheaded at the Place de la Revolution. Within the nation, "voters" and "appellants", those that were against the execution of Louis,{{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=This term is not defined anywhere in the text}} swore undying hatred of each other. The rest of Europe, fearing the outcome of the French Revolution in their own countries, decreed a war of extermination against regicides.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=272}}{{refn|group="note"|As opposed to the English Revolution, the French Revolution killed not only the king of France, but royalty itself. In this sense, even if the ''Conventionnels'' had only transformed into a national tragedy what the last century of absolutism had already marked out as inevitable, they had accomplished their aim: to strip royalty from the nation's future. By executing the king, they had severed France's last ties with her past, and made the rupture with the ''ancien régime'' complete.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=122}}}}

=== The Crisis and Fall of the Girondins ===
The Assembly began harmoniously, but within a few days the Girondins launched a bitter attack on their Montagnard opponents. Conflict continued without interruption until the expulsion of the Girondin leaders from the Convention on 2 June 1793. The Girondins had relied on votes from the majority of the deputies, many of whom were alarmed as well as scandalized by the [[September massacres]], but their insistence on monopolizing all positions of authority during the Convention, and their attacks on the Montagnard leaders, soon irritated them, causing them to regard the party as a faction. One by one, able deputies such as [[Couthon]], [[Pierre-Joseph Cambon|Cambon]], [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]], [[Lindet]] and [[Barère]] began to gravitate towards the Montagnards, while the majority – the Plain, as it was called – held itself aloof from both sides.

Girondins were convinced that their opponents aspired to a bloody dictatorship, while the Montagnards believed that the Girondins were ready for any compromise with conservatives, and even royalists, that would guarantee their remaining in power. The bitter enmity soon reduced the Convention to a state of limbo. Debate after debate degenerated into verbal brawling from which no decision could emerged. The political deadlock, which had repercussions all over France, eventually drove men to accept dangerous allies, royalists in the case of Girondins, Jacobins in that of the Montagnards.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=157}}

Thus the struggle within the Convention continued without results. The decision was to come from outside.
[[File:RiotsMay31-June2 1793.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Journées des 31 Mai 1er et 2 Juin 1793'']]
Since the king's trial, the [[sans-culottes]] had been constantly assailing the "appealers" (''appelants''), and quickly came to desire their expulsion from the Convention. If this were achieved, the government could recover the energy to enable it to deal with the aristocratic plot by arresting suspects and establishing a revolutionary tribunal.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=42}} Military setbacks from [[the First Coalition]], [[Charles François Dumouriez|Dumouriez's]] treason and the [[war in the Vendée]], which began in March 1793, were all used as arguments by Montagnards and ''sans-culottes'' to portray Girondins as soft. They demanded that the Girondins take measures to change thing, but the Girondins were reluctant to adopt the proposed measures. The Girondins were forced to accept the Montagnards creation of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. Social and economic difficulties exacerbated the tensions between the groups. The final showdown was precipitated by [[Jean-Paul Marat]]'s trial and the arrest of sectional activists.

On 25 May the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] demanded that arrested patriots be released. In reply, [[Maximin Isnard|Isnard]], who was presiding over the Convention, launched into a diatribe against Paris which was reminiscent of the [[Brunswick Manifesto]]: "If any attack made on the persons of the representatives of the nation, then I declare to you in the name of the whole country that Paris would be destroyed". On the next day the Jacobins declared themselves in a state of insurrection. On 28 May the ''Cité'' section called the other sections to a meeting in order to organize the insurrection. On 29 May the delegates representing 33 of the sections formed an insurrectionary committee of nine members.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=309}}

{{Main article|Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793}}

On 2 June, 80,000 armed ''sans-culottes'' surrounded the Convention. After an attempt of deputies to leave collided with guns, the deputies resigned themselves to declare the arrest of 29 leading Girondins. In this way the Gironde ceased to be a political force. It had declared war without knowing how to conduct it; it had denounced the King but had shrunk from condemning him; it had contributed to the worsening of the economic crisis but had swept aside all the claims made by the popular movement.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=311}}

== Montagnard Convention ==

Scarcely had the Gironde been eliminated when the Convention, now under Montagnard leadership, found itself caught between two threats. While forces of counter-revolution were gaining new impetus from the federalist revolt, the popular movement, roused to fury by high prices, was increasing the pressure it exercised on the government. Meanwhile, the Government was proving incapable of controlling the situation. In July 1793 the nation appeared to be on the point of falling apart.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=313}}

=== Constitution of 1793 ===
{{Main article|French Constitution of 1793}}
[[File:Constitution 1793.JPG|thumb|Constitution du Peuple Française du 6 Messidor l'an I (24 June 1793)]]

During the month of June the Montagnards played for time. Yet the Convention did not overlook the peasants. It was to these latter that the revolution of 31 May (like those of 14 July and 10 August) brought a substantial benefit. On 3 June the sale of the property of emigrants, in small parcels and payable in ten years, was decreed; on the 10th, the optional division of common lands by head; and on 17 July, the abolition, without compensation, of all that remained of manorial rights.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=55}}

The Montagnards attempted to reassure the middle classes by rejecting any idea of terror, by protecting property rights, and by restricting the popular movement to very narrowly circumscribed limits. It was a delicate balance to achieve, a balance that was destroyed in July by the worsening of the crisis. The Convention rapidly approved the new constitution, hoping to clear itself of the charge of dictatorship and calm the anxieties of the departments''.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=314}}

The Declaration of Rights which precedes the text of the Constitution solemnly reaffirmed the nation's indivisibility and the great principles of freedom of the press, equality and resistance to oppression. It went far beyond the Declaration of 1789, adding to it the right to public assistance, work, education and insurrection. No man could impose his will on others. All political and social tyranny was abolished. Although the ''montagnards'' had refused to be led further down the road to democracy, the Constitution became the bible of all democrats.{{sfn|Bouloiseau|1983|p=67}}

The chief aim of the Constitution was to ensure the major role of the deputies in the Convention, which was seen as being the essential basis for political democracy. The Legislative Assembly was to be elected by direct vote cast for a single member; deputies were elected on receiving a simple majority of the votes cast, and the assembly would sit for one year. The executive council of 24 members was chosen by the Legislative Assembly from among the 83 candidates chosen by the departments on the basis of universal male suffrage, and in this way ministers were made responsible to the representatives of the nation. The exercise of national sovereignty was widened through the institution of the referendum – the Constitution was to be ratified by the people, as were laws in certain precisely defined circumstances.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=316}}

The Constitution was submitted for popular ratification and adopted by a huge margin of more than 1,801,918 in favour to some 17,610 against. The results of the plebiscite were made public on 10 August 1793, but the application of the Constitution, the text of which was placed in the sacred ark and laid in the debating-chamber of the Convention, was postponed until peace had been made.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=338}}

=== Federalist revolt, war and counter-revolution ===
{{see also|Federalist revolts}}
[[File:Death of Marat by David.jpg|thumb|left|La Mort de Marat&lt;br/&gt;[[Jacques-Louis David]], 1793, Brussels|190px]]
Indeed, the Montagnards faced dramatic circumstances – federalist insurrection, war in the Vendée, military failures, and a worsening economic situation. Despite everything, a new civil war could not be avoided.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=55}} By the middle of June, about sixty departments were in more or less open rebellion. Fortunately the frontier departments had remained faithful to the Convention. The rising was widespread rather than deep. It was essentially the work of the departmental and district administrations. The communes, which were more popular in composition, showed themselves in general lukewarm or hostile; and federalist leaders soon became divided among themselves. Sincere republicans among them could not fail to be uneasy about the foreign invasion and the Vendée. Those who were seeing themselves rejected by the people, sought support from the moderates, the Feuillants and even from the aristocrats.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=336}}

July and August were bad months on the frontiers. Within three weeks [[Mainz]], the symbol of previous successes, capitulated to the Prussians, and the Austrians captured the fortresses of [[Condé-sur-l'Escaut|Condé]] and [[Valenciennes]] and invaded northern France. Spanish troops crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and began advancing on [[Perpignan]]. The [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] took advantage of the diversion of republican forces at [[Lyons]] in order to invade France from the East. In [[Corsica]], [[Pasquale Paoli|Paoli]]'s revolt expelled the French from the island with British support. British troops opened the siege of [[Dunkirk]] in August and in October the Allies invaded [[Alsace]]. The military situation had become desperate.

In addition there were other incidents which compounded the fury of the revolutionaries and convinced them that their opponents had abandoned all restraint of civilized behavior. On 13 July, [[Charlotte Corday]] murdered ''sans-culotte'' idol [[Jean-Paul Marat]]. She had been in touch with Girondin rebels in [[Normandy]] and they were believed to have used her as their agent.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=189}}

The lack of forethought displayed by the Convention during the first few days was redeemed by its vigor and skill in organizing measures of repression. Warrants were issued for the arrest of the rebellious Girondin leaders; the members of the revolting departmental administration were deprived of their office.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=337}}

The regions in which the revolt was dangerous were precisely those in which a large number of royalists had remained. There was no room for a third party between the Mountain, which was identified with the Republic, and royalism, which was the ally of the enemy. The royalist insurrection in the Vendée had already led the Convention to take a long step in the direction of the Terror – that is to say, the dictatorship of central power and the suppression of liberties. The Girondin insurrection now prompted it to take a decisive step in the same direction.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=340}}

=== Revolutionary government ===
[[File:Le Départ des Volontaires (La Marseillaise) par Rude, Arc de Triomphe Etoile Paris.jpg|thumb|''[[La Marseillaise]]'' par [[François Rude]]]]
The Constituent Assembly had legislated through its commissions. The Convention governed by means of its [[Commissioners of the Committee of Public Safety#Committees|committees]]. Two of them were of essential importance: [[Committee of Public Safety|Public Safety]] and [[Committee of General Security|General Security]]. The second, which had formidable powers, is less well known than the first, which was the true executive authority and was armed with immense prerogatives. It dated from April, but its composition was thoroughly reshuffled during the summer of 1793.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=132}}

The summer of 1793 saw ''sans-culotte'' disturbances reach a peak under a double banner: price-fixing and terror. On top of this came the news of unprecedented treason: [[Toulon]] and its squadron had been handed over to the enemy.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=68}} In the name of the wretched poverty of the people, the leaders of the [[Enragés]], with [[Jacques Roux]] at their head, called for a planned economy from a Convention which had no liking for the idea. But the revolutionary logic of the mobilization of resources by national dictatorship was infinitely more powerful than economic doctrine. In August, a series of decrees gave the authorities discretionary powers over the production and circulation of grain, as well as ferocious punishments for fraud. "Granaries of plenty" were prepared, to stock corn requisitioned by authorities in each district. On 23 August the decree on the ''[[levée en masse]]'' turned able-bodied civilians into soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/50931/156.pdf?sequence=1|title=From Mobilization to Revolution|last=|first=|date=March 1977|website=|publisher=Charles Tilly University of Michigan|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September, Parisians tried to repeat the revolt of 2 June. Armed ''sections'' again encircled the Convention to demand the setting up of an internal revolutionary army, the arrest of suspects and a purge of the committees. It was probably the key day in the formation of the revolutionary government: the convention yielded, but kept control of events. It put Terror on the agenda on 5 September, on 6th elected [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Billaud-Varenne]] to the Committee of Public Safety, on the 9th created the revolutionary army, on the 11th decreed the [[General maximum|Maximum]] for grain and fodder (general controls for prices, and wages on the 29th), on the 14th reorganized the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], on the 17th voted in the law on suspects, and on the 20th gave the local revolutionary committees the task of drawing up lists of them.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=134}}

The dictatorship of the Convention and the committees, simultaneously supported and controlled by the Parisian sections, representing the sovereign people in permanent session, lasted from June to September. It governed through a network of institutions set up haphazardly since spring in March, the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] and representatives on missions in the departments; was followed the next month by the Convention's representatives to the armies, also armed with unlimited powers; and enforced acceptance of ''assignat'' as the sole legal tender, price controls for grain and the forced loan of a billion livres from the rich.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=133}}

At last France saw a government take shape. [[Georges Danton|Danton]] resigned from it on 10 July. [[Couthon]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], [[Jean Bon Saint-André|Jeanbon Saint-Andre]], and [[Pierre Louis Prieur|Prieur of the Marne]] formed a nucleus of resolute Montagnards who rallied [[Bertrand Barère|Barère]]&lt;!-- Please confirm --&gt; and [[Lindet]], then successfully added [[Robespierre]] on 27 July, [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] and [[Claude Antoine, comte Prieur-Duvernois|Prieur of Cote-d'Ore]] on 14 August, and [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Billaud-Varenne]] on 6 September. They had a few clear ideas to which they clung: to command, to fight, and to conquer. Their work in common, the danger, the taste of and pride in power created solidarity that made the Committee an autonomous organism.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=62}}

The committee was always managed collegially, despite the specific nature of the tasks of each director: the division into "politicians" and "technicians" was a Thermidorian invention, intended to lay the corpses of the Terror at the door of the Robespierrists alone. Many things, however, set the twelve committee members at loggerheads; Barère was more a man of the Convention than of the committee and was a link with the Plaine. Robert Lindet had qualms about the Terror which, by contrast, was the outstanding theme of Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, latecomers to the committee, forced on it by the ''sans-culottes'' in September; unlike Robespierre and his friends, Lazare Carnot had given his support only provisionally and for reasons of state to a policy concession to the people. But the situation which united them in the summer of 1793 was stronger than those differences of opinion.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=132}} The Committee had to set itself above all, and choose those popular demands which were most suitable for achieving the Assembly's aims: to crush the enemies of the Republic and dash the last hopes of the aristocracy. To govern in the name of the Convention, at the same time controlling it, and to restrain the people without quenching their enthusiasm — this was a gamble.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=64}}

The ensemble of institutions, measures and procedures which constituted it was codified in a decree of 14 Frimaire (4 December) which set the seal on what had been the gradual development of centralized dictatorship founded on the Terror. In the center was the Convention, whose secular arm was the Committee of Public Safety, vested with immense powers: it interpreted the Convention's decrees and settled their methods of application; under its immediate authority it had all state bodies and all civil servants (even ministers would disappear in April 1794); it directed military and diplomatic activity, appointed generals and members of other committees, subject to ratification by the Convention. It held responsibility for conducting war, public order and the provisioning of the population. The Commune of Paris, a famous ''sans-culotte'' bastion, was neutralized by coming under its control.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=134}}

====The economy====
Administrative and economic centralization went hand in hand. The state of siege forced France into [[autarky]]; to save the Republic the government mobilized all the nation's productive forces and reluctantly accepted the need for a controlled economy, which it introduced extemporaneously, as the emergency required.{{sfn|Bouloiseau|1983|p=100}} It was necessary to develop war production, revive foreign trade, and find new resources in France itself; and time was short.  Circumstances gradually compelled it to assume the economic government of the country. Along with organization of the army, this was the most original feature of its work.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=100}}

All material resources were subjected to requisitioning. Farmers surrendered their grain, fodder, wool, flax, and hemp. Artisans and merchants gave up their manufactured products. Raw materials were carefully sought out – metal of all kinds, church bells, old paper, rags and parchments, grasses, brushwood, and even household ashes for manufacturing of potassium salts, and chestnuts for distilling. All businesses were placed at the disposal of the nation – forests, mines, quarries, furnaces, forges, tanneries, paper mills, large cloth factories and shoe making workshops. The labor of men and the value of things were subject to price controls. No one had a right to speculate at the cost of ''Patrie'' while it was in danger. Armaments caused more concern. As early as September 1793 efforts were made to create a large factory in Paris for rifles and sidearms.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=104}} A special appeal was made to scientists. [[Monge]], [[Vandermonde]], [[Berthollet]], [[Jean Darcet|Darcet]], [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy|Fourcroy]] perfected metallurgy and manufacture of arms.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=101}}

Only to the wage earners did the Maximum seem thoroughly advantageous. It increased wages by one-half in relation to 1790, and commodities by only one-third. But since the Committee did not ensure that it was respected (except for bread), they would have been duped had they not been benefiting from the favorable conditions that a great war always offers the labor force.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=109}} Still Paris became calmer, because the ''sans-culottes'' were gradually finding ways to subsist; the ''levée en masse'' and the formation of the revolutionary army were thinning their ranks; many now were working in arms and equipment shops, or in the offices of the committees and ministries, which were expanded enormously.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=71}}

====The Army of the Year II====
{{main article|French Revolutionary Army}}

During the summer the requisition of the levy was completed and by July the total strength of the army reached 650,000. The difficulties were tremendous. The war production just started in September. The army was in the middle of the purge. In the spring of 1794 the amalgamation was undertaken. Two battalions of volunteers joined one battalion of regulars to constitute a demi-brigade, or regiment. At the same time the command was reconstituted. The purge ended with most of the nobles excluded. The new generation reached the highest ranks, and the War College (''Ecole de Mars'') received six young men from each district to improve the staff. Army commanders were to be appointed by the Convention.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=96}}

What gradually emerged was a military command unequaled in quality: [[François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers|Marceau]], [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]], [[Jean Baptiste Kléber|Kleber]], [[André Masséna|Massena]], [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]], and a host of others, backed by officers who were sound both in their abilities as soldiers and in their sense of civic responsibility.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=400}} {{refn|group="note"|The revolutionaries turned soldiers did not forget their attachments. [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]] had been a Maratist, [[Jean Baptiste Kléber|Kleber]] and [[François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers|Marceau]] praised the activity of [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier|Carrier]], and [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] attached himself to the Robespierre brothers. So many years later, even men like [[Marmont]] and [[Soult]] were moved with emotion by the memory of the shining hours they had known in the service of the "Indivisible Republic".{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=98}}}}
 
For the first time since antiquity a truly national army marched to war, and for the first time, too, a nation succeeded in arming and feeding great numbers of soldiers – these are the novel characteristics of the army of the Year II. The technical innovations resulted chiefly from its sheer size as well the strategy that developed from it. The old system of cordons lost its prestige. Moving between the armies of the Coalition, the French could maneuver along interior lines, deploy part of their troops along the frontiers, and take advantage of the inaction of any one of their enemies to beat the others. Acting ''en masse'', and overwhelming the foe by sheer numbers – such were Carnot's principles. They were still untried, and not until Bonaparte appeared did they enjoy any great success.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=99}}

=== Fall of the factions ===
As late as September 1793, there were two distinct wings among the revolutionaries. Firstly those who were later called [[Hébertists]] – although [[Jacques Hébert|Hébert]] himself was never the official leader of a party – advocated war to the death and adopted the program of the ''[[Enragés]]'', ostensibly because the ''sans-culottes'' approved it. The Hebertists preferred to side with the Montagnards, so long as they could hope to control the Convention through them. They dominated the [[Cordeliers Club]], filled [[Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte|Bouchotte's]] offices, and could generally carry the Commune with them.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=61}} The other wing was that of the [[Dantonists]], which formed in response to the increasing centralization of the Revolutionary Government and the dictatorship of the Committees. The Dantonists were led predominately by deputies of the Convention (rather than the sans-culottes), including [[Georges Danton|Danton]], [[Jean-François Delacroix|Delacroix]], and [[Desmoulins]].

Putting the needs of national defense above all other considerations, the Committee of Public Safety had no intentions of giving in to the demands of either the popular movement or the moderates. {{According to whom|reason=Is this the Committee's opinion? (Then cite a source for it.) Or a historian's? (Then say so and cite a source.)|date=November 2015| Following the Hebertists would jeopardize revolutionary unity, while the giving in to the demands of the moderates would have undermined the both the Terror and the controlled economy. However, unity, centralization, and the Terror were all considered essential to the war effort.}} In order to balance the contradictory demands of these two factions, the Revolutionary Government attempted to maintain a position halfway between the moderate Dantonists (''citras'') and the extremist Hebertists (''ultras'').{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=359}}

But at the end of the winter of 1793-4, the shortage of food took a sharp turn for the worse. The [[Hebertists]] incited ''sans-culottes'' to demand stringent measures, and at first the Committee did prove conciliatory. The Convention voted 10 million for relief,{{clarify|reason=10 million what? Livres, votes?|date=November 2015}} on 3 Ventose, [[Barère]] presented a new general Maximum, and on the 8th [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] obtained a decree confiscating the property of suspects and distributing it to the needy (Ventose decrees). The Hebertists felt that if they increased the pressure, they would triumph once and for all. Although the call appeared like one for insurrection it was probably just for a new demonstration, like the one in September. But the Committee of Public Safety decided on 22 Ventose Year II (12 March 1794) that the [[Hebertists]] posed too serious a threat. The Committee linked [[Jacques Hébert|Hebert]], [[Charles-Philippe Ronsin|Ronsin]], [[François-Nicolas Vincent|Vincent]], and [[Antoine-François Momoro|Momoro]] to the emigres Proli, [[Anacharsis Cloots|Cloots]] and Pereira, so as to present the Hebertists as parties to the "foreign plot". All were executed on 4 Germinal (24 March).{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=88}}  This move largely silenced the Hebertists, now without their leadership. Having succeeded in stifling dissent on the left, the Committee then turned on the Dantonists, several members of which were implicated in financial corruption. The Committee forced the Convention to lift the parliamentary immunity of nine Dantonist deputies, allowing them to be put on trial. On 5 April Dantonist leaders [[Georges Danton|Danton]], [[Jean-François Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Desmoulins]], and [[Pierre Philippeaux|Philippeaux]] were executed.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=220}}

The execution of the leaderships of both rival factions caused some to become disillusioned. Many ''sans-culottes'' were stunned by the Hebertists' execution. All the positions of influence traditionally held by the sans-culottes were eliminated: the Revolutionary Army was disbanded, the inspectors of food-hoarding were dismissed, [[Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte|Bouchotte]] lost the War Office, the [[Cordeliers Club]] was forced to self-censor and the Government pressure brought about closing 39 popular societies. The Paris Commune, controlled by sans-culottes, was purged and filled with Committee nominees. With the execution of the [[Dantonists]], many of the members of the National Convention lost trust in the Committee, and even began to fear for their personal safety.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=221}}

Ultimately, the Committee had undermined its own support by eliminating the Dantonists and Hebertists, both of which had backed the Committee. By compelling the Convention to allow the arrests of the [[Girondins]] and [[Dantonists]], the Committee believed it had destroyed its major opposition. However, the trials demonstrated the Committee's lack of respect for members of the Convention (several of whom had been executed). Many Convention members who had sided with the Committee in the past by mid-1794 no longer supported it. The Committee had acted as mediator between the Convention and the ''sans-culottes'' from which they both had acquired their strength. By executing the Hebertists and alienating the ''sans-culottes'', the Committee became unnecessary to the Assembly.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=90}}

=== The Terror ===
{{Main article|Reign of Terror}}

Though the Terror was organized in September 1793, it was not introduced until October. It had resulted from a popular movement. A new chapter of the Revolutionary Tribunal was opened after 5 September, divided into four sections: the Committees of [[Committee of Public Safety|Public Safety]] and [[Committee of General Security|General Security]] were to propose the names of judges and jurymen; [[Fouquier-Tinville]] stayed as public prosecutor, and [[Martial Joseph Armand Herman|Herman]] was nominated president.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=341}} The Terror was meant to discourage support for the enemies of the Revolution by condemning outspoken critics of the Montagnards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Reign-of-Terror|title=Reign of Terror {{!}} French history|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great political trials began in October. The queen was guillotined on 16 October. A special decree stifled the defense of 21 Girondins, including [[Vergniaud]] and [[Brissot]], and they perished on the 31st.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=71}}

At the summit of the apparatus of the Terror sat the [[Committee of General Security]], the state's second organization. It consisted of twelve members elected each month by the Convention, and vested with security, surveillance and police functions, including over civil and military authorities. It employed a large staff, headed the gradually constituted network of local revolutionary committees, and applied the law on suspects by sifting through the thousands of local denunciations and arrests which it then had to try.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=135}}

It struck down the enemies of the Republic whoever and wherever they were. It was socially indiscriminate and politically perspicacious. Its victims belonged to the classes which hated the Revolution or lived in the regions where rebellion was most serious. "The severity of repressive measures in the provinces," wrote Mathiez, "was in direct proportion to danger of revolt."{{sfn|Greer|1935|p=19}} Many outspoken members of the community were tried and executed for claims of treason: [[Camille Desmoulins]] and [[Georges Danton]] were two of the more notable men executed for their "threats" against the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Reign-of-Terror|title=Reign of Terror {{!}} French history|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputies sent as "representatives on mission" by the [[Committee of Public Safety]], armed with full powers, reacted according to both the local situation and their own temperaments: [[Lindet]] pacified the Girondin west in July without a single death sentence; in Lyon, some months later, [[Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Joseph Fouche]] relied on frequent summary executions by shooting because the guillotine was not working swiftly enough.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=138}}{{refn|group="note"|Based on recent figures of the Terror:&lt;br /&gt;17,000 victims names distributed according to specific geographical areas: 52% in the Vendee, 19% in the south-east, 10% in the capital and 13% in the rest of France. Distinction is between zones of turmoil and an insignificant proportion of quite rural areas. Between departments, the contrast becomes more striking. Some were hard hit, the Loire-Inferieure, the Vendee, the Maine-et-Loire, the Rhone and Paris. In six departments no executions were recorded; in 31, there were fewer than 10; in 32, fewer than 100; and only in 18 were there more than 1,000. Charges of rebellion and treason were by far the most frequent grounds for execution (78%), followed by federalism (10%), crimes of opinion (9%) and economic crimes (1.25%). Artisans, shopkeepers. wage-earners and humble folk made up the largest contingent (31%), concentrated in Lyons, Marseilles and neighboring small towns. Because of the peasant rebellion in the Vendée, peasants are more heavily represented (28%) than the federalist and merchant bourgeoisie. Nobles (8.25%) and priests (6.5%), who would seem to have been relatively spared, actually provided a higher proportion of victims than other social categories. In the most sheltered regions, they were the only victims. Furthermore, the "Great Terror" is hardly distinguishable from the rest. In June and July 1794, it accounted for 14% of executions, as against 70% from October 1793 to May 1794, and 3.5% before September 1793. if one adds executions without trial and deaths in prison, a total of 50,000 seems likely, that is 2 per 1,000 of the population.{{sfn|Bouloiseau |1983|p=210}}}}

=== Slavery ===
The monarchy made a distinction between French soil on the mainland and soil under French control such as the colonies. This distinction allowed for slavery to be illegal in France but continue in the colonies.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, and Manuel Covo. "Race, Slavery, and Colonies in the French Revolution." The Oxford Handbook of the French Revolution, 2015, 6. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Colonists in [[Saint Domingue]] wanted to have representation, 21 members due to their population size and contribution to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, Covo, "Race, Slavery, and Colonies in the French Revolution.", 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was shot down by the National Convention as the majority of their population were slaves and thus had no rights as citizens and contributed nothing to representative population.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, and Covo, "Race, Slavery, and Colonies in the French Revolution.", 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_des_amis_des_Noirs Société des amis des Noirs] in France originally did oppose slavery during the 1780s, however much of this opposition was ignored as a result of the [[French Revolution]] breaking out.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stein, "The Revolution of 1789 and the Abolition of Slavery." ''Canadian Journal of History/Annales Canadiennes D'Histoire'' 17, no. 3 (1982): 451.&lt;/ref&gt; The French showed a much greater willingness to act on the issue of slavery when the threat of a war with [[Spain]] seemed imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, "The Revolution of 1789 and the Abolition of Slavery.", 454.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792 the National Convention agreed to delegate 3 commissaries for Saint Domingue. Two of the commissaires, [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel]], implemented rights for free men of color that were equal to their white counterparts. On May 5, 1793, Sonthonax and Polverel,  first attacked the plantation system and forced the owners to treat the slaves better and care more for their well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, "The Revolution of 1789 and the Abolition of Slavery.", 455.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonthonax then attacked slavery itself by freeing any slave Huzards, Latin for hazards, who had been armed by their masters since they could not return to peaceful plantation life.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, "The Revolution of 1789 and the Abolition of Slavery.", 456.&lt;/ref&gt; Polverel issued a proclamation in [[Cap Francais]] on June 21, 1793 which freed all slaves who agreed to fight for the French Republic from both internal and external threats.&lt;ref&gt;Stein ,"The Revolution of 1789 and the Abolition of Slavery.", 456.&lt;/ref&gt; The commissaires then ruled that the Republic would pay an indemnity to the owners of female slaves marrying free men and that all children of that union would be free.&lt;ref&gt;Stein ,"The Revolution of 1789 and the Abolition of Slavery.", 458.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Convention eventually allowed for 6 representative members for the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, and Covo, "Race, Slavery, and Colonies in the French Revolution.", 24.&lt;/ref&gt; When pressured by the [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_des_amis_des_Noirs Friends of the Blacks] to end the slave trade in the colonies, the National Convention refused on the grounds of slavery being too core to the French economic wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, and Covo, "Race, Slavery, and Colonies in the French Revolution.", 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee felt “six million French people relied on the colonies to survive” and continued to stand by this argument.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, and Covo, "Race, Slavery, and Colonies in the French Revolution.", 25.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 12, 1790 the National Convention declared the only body of power who could control the status of people in the colonies were committees in the colonies themselves--this meant although free blacks met the requirement for active citizenship the white colonists would not allow it.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, and Covo "Race, Slavery, and Colonies in the French Revolution.", 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This was done in an attempt to please the white colonists and convince them not to join forces with the British.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, and Covo, "Race, Slavery, and Colonies in the French Revolution.", 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This also gave the colonies the power to control their own laws regarding slavery and allowed for the National Convention to wash their hands of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, and Covo, "Race, Slavery, and Colonies in the French Revolution.", 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Three deputies from Saint Domingue traveled to France to attempt to persuade the National Convention to abolish slavery. The National Convention abolished slavery after hearing speeches from the deputies on February 4, 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Stein ,"The Revolution of 1789 and the Abolition of Slavery.", 464-465.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Committee of Public Safety]] delayed sending the proclamation to the colonies for two months. This was due to the apparent opposition of [[Robespierre]] to the abolition of slavery. The issue was eventually resolved following the Committee circumventing Robespierre and ordering the abolition decree to be sent to Saint Domingue.&lt;ref&gt;Stein ,"The Revolution of 1789 and the Abolition of Slavery.", 465.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] attempt to return to slavery in 1801 removed France's state of being the first to abolish slavery and led to the loss of the most prosperous French colony.&lt;ref&gt;Stein ,"The Revolution of 1789 and the Abolition of Slavery.", 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermidor ===
[[File:Max Adamo Sturz Robespierres.JPG|thumb|300px|9 Thermidor]]
The Jacobin dictatorship could only hope to remain in power so long as it was dealing successfully with a national emergency. As soon as its political opponents had been destroyed, and its foreign enemies defeated, it would lose the chief force that kept it together. The Jacobin fall happened more rapidly than expected because of issues within the party.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=502}}

So long as it remained united, the Committee was virtually invulnerable, but it had scarcely attained the apogee of its power before signs of internal conflict appeared.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=229}} The Committee of Public Safety had never been a homogeneous body. It was a coalition cabinet. Its members were kept together less by comradeship or common ideals than by calculation and routine. The press of business which at first prevented personal quarrels also produced tired nerves. Trifling differences were exaggerated into the issues of life and death. Small disputes estranged them from one another.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=508}} [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]], in particular, was irritated by the criticisms directed at his plans by Robespierre and Saint-Just, Dispute followed dispute.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=134}}  Bickering broke out on the Committee of Public Safety, with Carnot describing Robespierre and Saint-Just as "ridiculous dictators" and Collot making veiled attacks on the "Incorruptible". From the end of June until 23 July Robespierre ceased to attend the Committee.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=229}}

Realizing the danger of fragmentation, they attempted a reconciliation. Saint-Just and Couthon favored it, but Robespierre doubted sincerity of his enemies. It was he who brought about the fatal intervention of the Convention. On 8 Thermidor, Year II (26 July 1794), he denounced his opponents, and demanded that "unity of government" be realized. When called upon to name those whom he was accusing, however, he refused. This failure destroyed him, for it was assumed that he was demanding a blank cheque.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=134}} This night an uneasy alliance was formed from threatened deputies and members of The Plain. On the next day, 9 Thermidor, Robespierre and his friends were not allowed to speak, and their indictment was decreed. The men of the extreme left played the leading roles: [[Billaud-Varenne]], who attacked, and [[Collot d'Herbois]], who presided.

On hearing the news the Paris Commune, loyal to the man who had inspired it, called for an insurrection and released the arrested deputies in the evening and mobilized two or three thousand militants.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=150}} The night of 9–10 Thermidor was one of great confusion in Paris, as Commune and Assembly competed for the support of the sections and their troops. The Convention proclaimed that the rebels were henceforth outlaws; [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] was given the task of mustering an armed force, and the moderate sections gave this their support. The National Guardsmen and artillerymen assembled outside the ''Hotel de Ville'' were left without instructions and little by little they dispersed and left the square deserted. Around two o'clock in the morning a column from Gravilliers section led by [[Léonard Bourdon]] burst in the ''Hotel de Ville'' and arrested insurgents.

On the evening of 10 Thermidor (28 July 1794), [[Robespierre]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], [[Couthon]] and nineteen of their political allies were executed without trial. On the following day it was the turn of a large batch of 71 men, the largest mass execution in the entire course of the Revolution.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=411–412}}

== Thermidorian Convention ==
Whatever reasons the conspirators had behind 9 Thermidor, the events afterwards went beyond their intentions. Evidently the remaining members on the Committees counted on staying in office and currying the favour of the Jacobin dictatorship, as though nothing more had happened than a party purge.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=516}}

=== Thermidorian Reaction ===
{{Main article|Thermidorian Reaction}}
They were speedily disabused of this notion. Robespierrists might go out and Dantonists come in; the Convention had recovered its initiative and would put an end, once and for all, to the dictatorial committees government which had ousted it from power. It was decreed that no member of governing committees should hold office for more than four months. Three days later the [[Law of 22 Prairial|Prairial Law]] was repealed and the Revolutionary Tribunal shorn of its abnormal powers. The Commune was replaced with a Commission of Civil Administrators (''commission des administrateurs civils'') from the ranks of the Conventions. In November the Jacobin club was closed. Not merely anti-Robespierrist but anti-Jacobin reaction was in full flood. At the beginning of September [[Billaud]], [[Collot d'Herbois|Collot]] and [[Barère]] left the Committee of Public Safety; by the end of the year they were in prison.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=516}}

The stability of the government was weakening. Next came the concentration of power, another revolutionary principle. The identification of the Committee of Public Safety with the executive was ended on 7 Fructidor (24 August), restricting it to its former domain of war and diplomacy. The Committee of General Security kept its control over the police. There was now to be a total of sixteen committees. ''Conventionnels'', while aware of the dangers of fragmentation, were even more worried by its experience of monopoly of powers. In a few weeks the revolutionary government was dismantled.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=2}}

These measures affected, finally, the instruments of the Terror and opened numerous breaches in the apparatus of repression. The [[law of 22 Prairial]] was repealed, the prisons were opened and "suspects" were released: 500 in Paris in a single week. A few public trials were staged — including those of [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier|Carrier]], held responsible for the mass-drowning at [[Nantes]], and [[Fouquier-Tinville]], notorious as the public prosecutor of the Great Terror of the late spring and summer of 1794 – after which the Revolutionary Tribunal was quietly put aside.{{sfn|Rude|1988|p=115}}{{refn|group="note"|Yet an unofficial Terror-in-reverse continued. In the provinces the Terror assumed violent and vicious form. In the [[Lyonnais]], the Company of Jesus flung the bodies of its victims, men and women, into the [[Rhone]], and prisoners were massacred wholesale in gaol or on their way to prison, while in other cities, bands of so-called [[Companions of Jehu|Companies of Jehu]] and the Sun indiscriminately murdered "terrorists", "patriots of '89" and – most eagerly of all – purchasers of former Church properties. Such excesses were deplored in Paris, but the Convention and its Committees were powerless to contain forces that they had themselves done much to unleash.{{sfn|Rude|1988|p=115}}}}

The destruction of the system of revolutionary government eventually brought about the end of the 'Economic Terror'. ''Maximum'' was relaxed even before 9 Thermidor. Now virtually nobody believed in price controls any longer. Because the black market was plentifully supplied, the idea took hold that price controls equaled scarcity and that free trade, therefore, would bring back abundance. It was generally supposed by the free trade minded [[Physiocrat]] economists within France that prices would at first rise but that then they would fall as a result of competition. This illusion, however, was to be shattered in the winter of 1794-1795. Formally, the National Convention had put the end to the ''maximum'' as the season had started on the Christmas Eve of 4 Nivose Year III (24 December 1794).{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=9–10}}

That winter, the abandonment of the controlled economy provoked a frightful catastrophe. Prices soared and the rate of exchange fell. The Republic was condemned to massive inflation and its currency was ruined. In Thermidor, Year III, ''assignats'' were worth less than 3% of their face value. Neither peasants nor merchants would accept anything but cash. The debacle was so swift that economic life seemed to come to standstill.

The crisis was greatly aggravated by famine. Peasants, finally, stopped bringing any produce to market, because they did not wish to accept ''assignats''. The government continued to provision Paris, but was unable to supply the promised rations. In provinces local municipalities resorted to some sort of regulations, provided not direct coercion in obtaining provisions. The misery of rural day laborers, abandoned by everyone, was often appalling. Inflation ruined creditors to the advantage of debtors. It unleashed an unprecedented speculation.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=142–143}}

At the beginning of spring in March-April 1795, scarcity was such that more unrest appeared almost everywhere. The City of Paris was 'active' once again.

=== Crushing of the popular movement ===
[[File:1er prairial an III.jpg|thumb|Journée du 1er Prairial de l'an III|300px]]
Discontent increased along with the shortages. On 17 March a delegation from ''faubourgs Saint-Marceau and Saint-Jacques'' complained that "We are on the verge of regretting all the sacrifices that we have made for the Revolution." Police law was passed which lay down the death penalty for use of seditious language. Arms were distributed to the "good citizens", the faithful nucleus of the National Guard. The trial of strength was approaching.

{{Main article|Insurrection of 12 Germinal, Year III}}
On 10 Germinal (30 March) all the sections called their general assemblies. The political geography of Paris emerged clearly from this. Convention debate was centered on two issues: the fate of [[Barère]], [[Collot d'Herbois|Collot]], [[Billaud]] and [[Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier|Vadier]], and the implementation of the constitution of 1793. While in the sections of the center and the west formal addresses called for the punishment of the "Four" and passed over the food shortages, the sections of the east and the ''faubourgs'' demanded measures to deal with the grain crisis, the implementation of the constitution of 1793, the reopening of the popular societies and the release of the imprisoned patriots.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=15}}

On the morning of 12 Germinal (1 April) crowds gathered on the ''Ile de la Cité'' and, pushing aside the palace guards, burst into the chamber where the Convention met. Amidst the uproar, spokesmen of the sections outlined the people's grievances. Reliable battalions of National Guard were called and demonstrators, lacking arms and leaders, were forced to withdraw. For the most people it was the constitution of 1793 – seen as a liberating utopia – which represented the solution to all evils. There were others who openly regretted the passing of "the reign of Robespierre".{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=17}}

{{Main article|Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III|l1=Insurrection of 1 Prairial}}
But it was not the end. A new explosion was on the horizon. Insurrection was being openly prepared. On 1 Prairial (20 May 1795) the alarm bells sounded in the ''faubourgs'' [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine|Saint-Antoine]] and Marceau. The armed battalions arrived at Place du Carousel and entered the sitting chamber. After an hour of uproar, "The Insurrection of the People" (''L'Insurection du Peuple'') was read. In the chaos, none of the ringleaders thought of implementing the key item of the program: the overthrow of the government.

The remainder of the Montagnards, The Crest (''la Crête de la Montagne''), managed to obtain the passage of decrees favorable to the rebels. But at 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. two armed columns entered the chamber and cleared out the rioters. The next day insurgents repeated the same mistakes and after receiving promises from the deputies to take speedy measures against the famine, returned to the sections.

On 3 Prairial the government assembled loyal troops, chasseurs and dragoons, national guardsmen, selected from those "who had fortune to preserve" — 20,000 men in all. Faubourg Saint-Antoine was surrounded and on 4 Prairial surrendered and was disarmed. Uncertainty about how to react, hesitancy in action, and lack of revolutionary leadership had doomed the popular movement to throw away its last chance in battle.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=20}}

4 Prairial Year III is one of the crucial dates of the revolutionary period. The people had ceased to be a political force, participants in history. They were now no more than victims or spectators.

=== Constitution of the Year III ===
{{Main article|Constitution of the Year III}}

[[File:Constitution 1795.jpg|left|thumb|Constitution 1795|Constitution de la République Française du 5 Fructidor l'an III (22 août 1795)]]
The victors now could set up a new constitution, the task the National Convention was originally elected for. The Commission of Eleven (the most notable members of which were [[Daunou]], [[Lanjuinais]], [[François Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas|Boissy d'Anglas]], [[Antoine Claire Thibaudeau|Thibaudeau]] and [[Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux|La Révellière]]) drafted a text which would reflect the new balance of power. It was presented on 5 Messidor (23 June) and passed on 22 August 1795 (5 Fructidor of the Year III).

The new constitution went back to the constitution of 1791 as to the dominant ideology of the country. Equality was certainly confirmed, but within the limits of civil equality. Numerous democratic rights of the constitution 1793 – the right to work, to relief, to education – were omitted. The Convention wanted to define rights and simultaneously reject both the privilege of the old order and social leveling.

The constitution went back to the distinction between active and passive citizens. Only citizens over twenty-five years old, disposing of an income of two hundred days of work, were eligible to be electors. This electoral body, which held the real power, included 30,000 people, half as many as in 1791. Guided by recent experience, institutions were set up to protect the Republic from two dangers: the omnipotence of an assembly and dictatorship.

Bicameral legislature as a precaution against sudden political fluctuations was proposed: the [[Council of Five Hundred]] with rights to propose laws and Council of the Ancients, 250 deputies, with powers to accept or reject proposed laws. Executive power was to be shared between five Directors chosen by the Ancients from the list drawn by Five Hundred. One of the Directors would be renewed each year with re-election after five years. As one of the practical precautions, no military were allowed within 60 miles of the sitting assembly and it could relocate in case of danger. The Directory still retained great power, including emergency powers to curb freedom of the press and freedom of association.

The Constitution generally was accepted favorably, even by those on the right, who were hopeful for the upcoming elections and even more happy to get rid of the legislative body so hated by them.

But how to make sure that the new elected body would not overturn the constitution as it was before with Legislative Assembly? Thermidorians attempted this on 5 Fructidor (22 August) by voting for a decree on "formation of a new legislative body". Article II stipulated: "All members presently active in the Convention are re-eligible. Election assemblies may not take fewer than two-thirds of them to form the legislative body". This was known as the Law of the Two-Thirds.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=166}}

=== Vendemiaire ===
{{Main article|13 Vendémiaire}}
[[File:13Vendémiaire.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Napoleon Bonaparte quelling of the Royalist revolt 13 Vendémiaire'', in front of the [[Église Saint-Roch]], rue Saint-Honoré.]]
On 23 September the results were announced: the constitution was accepted by 1,057,390 votes, with 49,978 against. The Two-Thirds decrees obtained only 205,498 votes in favor and 108,754 against.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=247}}

But the Convention had not taken into account those Paris sections who were against Two-Thirds decrees and failed to provide precise vote figures: 47 Parisian sections had rejected the decrees.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=31}} Eighteen of the Paris sections contested the result. The ''Lepeletier'' section issued a call to insurrection. By 11 Vendemiaire seven sections were in state of revolt, sections which were the base of the Convention since 9 Thermidor and now won by the far right if not royalists. The Convention declared itself permanent.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=473}} The ''conventionnels'' knew the score. They knew the art of insurrection by heart and to bring down ''[[muscadins]]'' was easier than the ''sans-culottes''.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=167}} Five members including [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] were appointed to deal with the crisis. A decree of 12 Vendemiaire (4 October) repealed the former disarmament of the former terrorists and an appeal to ''sans-culottes'' was issued.{{refn|group="note"|Barras reference to "Faubourg Saint-Antoin whose attachment to the cause of liberty is well known" in subsequent report offers curious commentary to the official evolution since journees of prairial.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=247}}}}

During the nights of Vendemiaire 12-13 (October 4–5), General Jacques de Menou de Boussay was tasked with putting down the royalist rebels and keep them from attacking the Convention. He recruited other generals to help aid in quelling the insurrection such as, Napoleon Bonaparte. The rebels outnumbered the Army by the thousands, but because of their preparations the night before, Bonaparte and the armies were able to line the road into Paris with cannons from Sablons Camp. Without a way into Paris, the rebels surrendered to the Convention on Vendemiaire 13. Barras and the Convention gave the armies permission to kill. Within 45 minutes over 300 royalist rebels were dead in front of the Church of Saint Roch. The rest had scattered and fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-empire.com/counter-revolution/13_vendemiaire.php|title=Napoleon and Counter-Revolutionary Royalists - 13 Vendémiaire Year 4 - Napoleon &amp; Empire|website=www.napoleon-empire.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moderate repression ensued and the [[First White Terror|White Terror]] in the south was stopped. On 4 Brumaire Year IV, just before breaking up, the Convention voted a general amnesty for "deeds exclusively connected with the Revolution".{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=473}}

== Legacy ==
The article on the Convention in the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] concludes, "The work of the Convention was immense in all branches of public affairs. To appreciate it without prejudice, one should recall that this assembly saved France from a civil war and invasion, that it founded the system of public education (''Museum'', {{lang|fr|[[École Polytechnique]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[École Normale Supérieure]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[École des langues orientales]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Conservatoire]]}}), created institutions of capital importance, like that of the {{lang|fr|Grand Livre de la Dette publique}}, and definitely established the social and political gains of the Revolution." By a decree of 4 February 1794 (16 pluviôse) it also ratified and expanded to the whole [[French colonial empire]] the 1793 [[Abolitionism in France|abolition of slavery]] on [[Saint-Domingue]] by civil commissioners [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax|Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel|Polverel]], though this did not affect [[Martinique]] or [[Guadeloupe]] and was abolished by the [[law of 20 May 1802]].

==Winter Olympics==
===Freestyle skiing===
Initially freestyle skiing had two events (moguls and aerials). There were quotas brought in to limit the number of competitors (particularly from the United States and Canada), which are highly competitive in the two events. for the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Olympics]] the quota system limited the competition for men and women's freestyle skiing (moguls, aerials, and ski-cross) to 180 athletes. Irrespective of international ranking, each country could only have eighteen athletes, and a maximum of ten men or ten women. With the addition of slopestyle and half-pipe in the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi Olympics in 2014]] the quotas were increased to 282 total athletes, 26 per country, and 14 per gender. This resulted in countries having to limit their participation, despite having eligible athletes. For example, Canada could have sent 33 participants based on international ranking, however they were limited to 26 quota spots. For the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the number of athletes participating remained the same, but the number of quota spots increased to a maximum of thirty per country.&lt;ref name="national post" /&gt;

===Snowboarding===
Snowboarding has a similar quota program to freestyle skiing, with 26 spots available per country. For the 2018 Winter Olympics the only country to fill all of its quota spots was the United States.&lt;ref name="national post" /&gt;

===Bobsleigh===
For the 2018 Winter Olympics, a maximum of 170 athletes could compete, and a maximum of three teams per event, with the host nation allotted at least one space.&lt;ref name="NBC Bobsled"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bobsled 101: Qualifying for the 2018 Olympic Games|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/bobsled-101-qualifying-2018-olympic-games|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=NBC Olympics|agency=NBC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11419">{{about||other uses of Qahal and similar spellings|Kahal (disambiguation)}}
The '''''Qahal''''' ({{lang-he-n|קהל}}) was a [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[organizational structure]] in [[Israelites|ancient Israelite society]] according to the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackAss"&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=assembly|section=Asaramel-Assyria}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later centuries, ''Qahal'' was the name of the autonomous governments of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] until being abolished in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal"&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'', (1989) volume 2, entry for ''Kahal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''qahal'', which is a close [[etymology|etymological]] relation of the name of ''Qoheleth'' ([[Ecclesiastes]]), comes from a [[Semitic root|root]] meaning "convoked [group]";&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible]]'', number 6951&lt;/ref&gt; its [[Arabic]] cognate, {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:قال|قَالَ]]}} ''qāla'', means ''to speak''.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackAss"/&gt; 

Where the Masoretic Text uses the term ''qahal'', the [[Septuagint]] usually uses the [[Koine Greek]] term ''ekklesia'', {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἐκκλησία|ἐκκλησία]]}},&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackAss" /&gt; which means "summoned group" (literally, "they who are called out").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', entry for ''ecclesiastical''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', entry for ''ecclesia''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in one particular part of the [[Priestly Code]], the Septuagint instead uses the term {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:συναγωγή|συναγωγή]]}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/sep/num020.htm Numbers 20, LXX]&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "gathering",&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', entry for ''synagogue''&lt;/ref&gt; where the Masoretic Text uses ''qahal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|20|HE}}&lt;!--version does matter--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This last term is the origin of the word "[[synagogue]]".

Thus, the usual translation of ''qahal'' is "congregation" or "assembly", although {{Hebrew|אֲסֻפּ֑וֹת}} ''asuppot'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|12:11|}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Hebrew|עֲצָרָה}} ''aṣarah'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Nehemiah|8:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Hebrew|עֵדָה}} ''ʿedah'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|20:11|}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Hebrew|מוֹעֵד}} ''moʿed'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|16:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Hebrew|מִקְרָא}} ''miqra'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Isaiah|1:13|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Hebrew|סוֹד}} ''sod'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|6:11|}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also usually translated like this.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackAss" /&gt; 

In particular, the Biblical text consistently distinguishes between ''ʿedah'' and ''qahal''.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackAss" /&gt; One passage especially makes the distinction clear;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackAss" /&gt; part of the Priestly Code discusses what to do if "the whole Israelite ['edah] commits a sin and the [qahal] is not aware of it[.]"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|4:13-14|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars conclude that the ''qahal'' must be a judicial body composed of representatives of the ''ʿedah'';&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackAss" /&gt; in some biblical passages, ''ʿedah'' is more accurately translated as "swarm".&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackAss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|14:8|}}, where it refers to [[bee]]s&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical exclusions==
{{main|Mamzer|Eunuch}}

The [[Deuteronomic Code]] prohibits certain members of the ''ʿedah'' from taking part in the ''qahal of [[Yahweh]]''. In particular, it excludes ''[[mamzer]]s'', and men who have been forcibly emasculated.&lt;ref name="Deu2324"&gt;Deuteronomy 23:2-4 (verses 1-3 in some English translations)&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of ''mamzers,'' up to the tenth generation, were also prohibited by this law code from taking part in the "congregation of Yahweh".&lt;ref name="Deu2324" /&gt; 

The Greek term {{lang|grc|σπάδωνες}} "eunuch" is usually used to refer forcibly emasculated men, but it is also used in the [[Septuagint]] to denote certain foreign political officials (resembling the meaning of "[[eunuch]]").&lt;ref name="JewEncMarLaw"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage laws|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=216&amp;letter=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This category does not include men who were born without visible testicles (conditions including [[cryptorchidism]]), or without a visible penis (conditions including [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]]).&lt;ref name="JewEncMarLaw" /&gt; There is dispute, even in traditional Judaism, about whether this prohibited group of men should include those who have become, at some point since their birth, emasculated as the result of a disease&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob ben Asher]], ''[[Even Ha'ezer]]'', 5&lt;/ref&gt;

No explanation of the phrase ''mamzer'' is given in the Masoretic Text, but the [[Septuagint]] translates it as "son of a prostitute" ({{lang-grc|[[:wikt:ἐκ πόρνης]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/septuagint/chapter.asp?book=5&amp;page=23 Deuteronomy 23:2-4, LXX]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Talmud]], it is suggested that the word ''mamzer'' derives from ''mum zer'', meaning ''a strange blemish'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nashim|Kiddushin]]'', 3:12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yevamot]]'' 76b&lt;/ref&gt; and thus suggesting illicit parentage in some sense. There are differing opinions in the Talmud as to what this consists of, but the universally accepted ruling&lt;ref&gt;Maimonidies, ''Mishneh Torah'', Sanctity, Prohibited Relations, 15:1&lt;/ref&gt; is that it refers to the offspring of [[adultery]] (defined as relations with a married woman) or incest, as defined in the [[Book of Leviticus]].

In the Talmud, there is fierce dispute about whether or not the term ''mamzer'' included a child who had a Jewish mother, and a father who is either non-Jewish or a slave (or both);&lt;ref&gt;''Yevamot'' 23a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yevamot'' 45a&lt;/ref&gt; although the Talmud eventually concludes that this is not the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Bastard|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=B&amp;artid=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of scholars now suspect that this was actually the original definition of ''mamzer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=Mamzer|section=Machir-Mani}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Geiger]], a prominent Jewish scholar and rabbi of the mid 19th century, suggested that the etymological origin of ''mamzer'' might be ''ma'am zar'', which means ''belonging to a foreign people''.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Geiger, ''Urschrift und Übersetzungen der Bibel in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der innern Entwicklung des Judentums'' [generally referred to in academic theology simply as ''Urschrift''] (1857), pages 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud interprets the exclusion of certain people from the ''qahal'' as a prohibition against ordinary Jews marrying such people.&lt;ref name="JewEncMarLaw" /&gt; Additionally, the biblical reference to the "tenth generation" was interpreted, by the classical rabbis, as an [[idiom]] meaning "forever";&lt;ref name="JewEncMarLaw" /&gt; thus the Talmud forbids all the descendants, forever, of these people from being married to ordinary Jews.&lt;ref name="JewEncMarLaw" /&gt;

==In Poland-Lithuania==
In the 16th century, Jewish communities in the south of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] began to set up new qahals to administer [[tax]] collection.&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal"/&gt; These had a minimum of 8 members, and in average Jewish communities had a membership of 22-35 Jews.&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal" /&gt; Their [[Executive (government)|executives]] were elected by the local Jewish community, and consisted of 4 ''elders'' (Hebrew: ''zaqen'') with a further 3-5 ''honorary members'' (Hebrew: ''tuvim'').&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal" /&gt; There was one qahal for each Jewish community, although smaller qahals were often made subject to larger ones.&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal" /&gt; 

These Polish-Lithuanian qahals quickly came to be [[self-governance|politically autonomous bodies]] with major regulatory control over Jewish communities in the region;&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal" /&gt; they administered commerce, hygiene, sanitation, charity, [[Jewish education]], ''[[kashrut]]'', and relations between landlords and their tenants.&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal" /&gt;  They provided a number of community facilities, such as a [[rabbi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph ben Ephraim Karo]], ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', "[[Choshen Mishpat]]", chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; a [[mikveh]] (ritual bath), and [[gemach|gemachen]] (interest-free loans). Qahals even had sufficient authority that they could arrange for individuals to be expelled from [[synagogue]]s, [[excommunication|excommunicating]] them.&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal" /&gt;

However, rich and powerful individuals gradually began to dominate qahals, abusing their position for their own benefit.&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal" /&gt; As a result, by the 18th century, many ordinary Jews had begun to clamour for the abolition of the institution.&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal" /&gt; "In 1844 they were officially abolished by the tsarist regime in Ukraine and most of the rest of the empire; they continued to exist only in the Baltic region. Afterwards, Jewish communities were given jurisdiction only over religious and charitable affairs, and occasionally over education."&lt;ref name="EncUkraKahal" /&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
The "Kahal" exists as a theme in [[anti-Jewish]] [[conspiracy theory]] literature. The theme originated with [[Jacob Brafman]], a Russian Jew who had a falling out with [[Minsk]] kahal tax-agents and to get revenge converted to the [[Orthodox Church]], authoring polemics against the [[Talmud]] and the ''Kahal''. Brafmann authored the books ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868) and ''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869), where he claimed that the ''kahal'' was an international network under the control of the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'' and had as its aim undermining Christian entrepreneurs, taking over their property and ultimately seizing power. This theory was taken up by anti-Jewish publications in Russia and was taken seriously by some Russian officials such as P. A. Cherevin and [[Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev]] who in the 1880s urged governor-generals of provinces to seek out a supposed "universal Jewish kahal." Brafmann's image of the "kahal" spread throughout the world, making its way to the [[United States]] by 1881 as it was translated by [[Zénaïde Alexeïevna Ragozin]] in ''[[The Century Magazine]]''. It prepared the groundwork for ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'' and the word "Kahal" features in that text. It is also discussed in other conspiracy works such as [[Edith Starr Miller]]'s ''Occult Theocrasy'' (1933) which ties it to the [[Order of the Illuminati]].

{{Politics of the Faroe Islands}}
'''Republic''' ({{lang-fo|Tjóðveldi}}), formerly known as the '''Republican Party''' ({{lang-fo|Tjóðveldisflokkurin}}) is a [[left-wing]] [[political party]] in the [[Faroe Islands]] committed to [[Faroese independence movement|Faroese independence]].

==History==
The party was founded in 1948 as a reaction to the islands failing to gain independence despite the outcome of the [[Faroese independence referendum, 1946|1946 independence referendum]], after which independence was subsequently declared but annulled by the Danish King.

In 1998 [[Høgni Hoydal]] succeeded [[Heini O. Heinesen]] as party leader.

At the [[legislative]] [[elections in the Faroe Islands|elections]], held on 20 January 2004, the party won 21.7% of the popular vote and 8 out of 33 seats. However, after the passing of an amendment adding the phrase 'sexual orientation' to paragraph 266b of the Anti-Discrimination Act, MP [[Karsten Hansen]] announced that he was leaving the party owing to a difference in opinion. He later joined the [[Centre Party (Faroe Islands)|Centre Party]].

At the elections on 19 January 2008, the party won 23.3% of the vote and  8 out of 33 seats.

In 2007, the party changed its name from ''Tjóðveldisflokkurin'' to simply ''Tjóðveldi'' (i.e., from "the Republican Party" to just "Republic").

In the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2007|Danish parliamentary elections of 2007]], the party received 25.4% of the Faroese vote, thereby retaining one of the two Faroese seats in the Danish national [[Folketing]]. In [[Danish parliamentary election, 2011|the 2011 election]], however, its votes declined and it lost its seat to the [[Social Democratic Party (Faroe Islands)|Social Democrats]]. It regained its seat in [[Danish parliamentary election, 2015|the 2015 election]].

'''Running Start''' is a nonpartisan nonprofit that trains and inspires young women to run for office. Since its founding in 2007, Running Start has trained and inspired more than 12,500 high school, college, and young professional women. Each year, Running Start hosts at least 100 trainings around the country.

== Overview ==

Running Start focuses on research, education, and outreach. It intends to be the United States' premiere resource on young women and politics with nonpartisan, accurate data about young women candidates and their unique role in politics.
 
Running Start also introduces college and high school girls to the power of politics through education initiatives. These include the Young Women's Political Leadership Training, the Running Start/Walmart Star Fellowship, Campaign College, the Women to Watch Awards, and Path to Politics lunch series.

The Young Women's Political Leadership Training program introduces high school girls to politics, equips them with the skills necessary for political leadership, and inspires them to become political leaders. Young candidates and elected officials speak to the girls about what it is like to run as a young woman, how to get involved on a local level, and why they feel it is important to get more women elected. The Political Leadership Program is held in July each year. Due to the high success of this program, Running Start has developed shorter programs in major cities across the country, beginning in New York City and California.

The Running Start/Walmart Star Fellowship program, launched in September 2009, brings 14 female college students or recent graduates to Washington, DC each year to learn about politics and work on Capitol Hill for a female Member of Congress. The Fellows hone their political skills and learn about the legislative process first-hand. Each Friday, the fellows take part in a seminar conducted by Running Start which heightens their internship experience by giving them the skills and contacts they need to become political leaders.  Fellows must also interview the Congresswoman they intern with.&lt;ref&gt;http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_c9d87604-5cd1-11e0-9734-001cc4c002e0.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Fellows emerge from this semester in DC with a deeper understanding of the need for more women to run for office, and confidence in their own abilities to lead, whether at their schools or on the national stage.
 
Campaign College is an initiative in which Running Start, the Women and Politics Institute at American University, and the American Association of University Women work with student governments at colleges around the country to train college women on how to run for office.
 
The Women to Watch awards is an annual event which honors impressive young women leaders under 40. In 2009, honorees included [[Erin Burnett]], CNBC television anchor; Julie Gilbert, founder and CEO of WOLF Means Business; [[Tammy Duckworth]], Assistant Secretary of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs, Department of Veterans Affairs; [[Betsy Fischer]], Executive Producer of ''Meet the Press''; and [[Mona Sutphen]], Deputy Chief of Staff to the Obama Administration. In 2008, honorees included [[Dana Perino]], White House Press Secretary; [[Linda Rottenberg]], CEO of Endeavour; [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], Dutch Parliamentarian; [[Cathy Lanier]], DC Chief of Police; and [[Michelle Rhee]], DC Schools Chancellor. By honoring these outstanding women, the event inspires young women and girls to take their leadership to the next level. Proceeds from the Women to Watch Awards benefit Running Start's research and education programs. This gala event is held annually in May at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.
 
The Path to Politics luncheon series brings together young women interested in running for public office and gives them the opportunity to meet young women legislators and candidates over lunch. The speakers focus on a particular aspect of what it is like to run or serve as a young woman. Each seminar focuses on practical advice, such as fundraising, building one's base, working with the national parties, and establishing credibility as a young woman legislature, as well as inspiring the audience to run for office themselves.

Through these and other programs, Running Start seeks to educate young women about how they can make a difference in politics by becoming candidates themselves.

The '''Socialist People's Front''' ('''SPF'''; {{lang-lt|Socialistinis liaudies frontas}}) is a left-wing political party in [[Lithuania]] formed out of the December 19, 2009, merger of the [[Front Party]] and [[Lithuanian Socialist Party]]. Held at [[Vilnius University]], the party's foundation featured 102 delegates. The merger was approved by an affirmative vote of 96 delegates, with three against and one abstaining. The leader of the Lithuanian Socialist Party, Giedrius Petružis, refused candidacy for chairperson of the merged party, claiming a desire to return to academic life. The leader of the Front Party, [[Algirdas Paleckis]], was unanimously chosen as the leader of the SPF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotcommentary.com/index.php?id=1600 Karštas komentaras: „Frontas“ ir Socialistų partija susijungė į Socialistinį liaudies frontą]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party participated in the 22nd international Communist seminar held in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icseminar.org/ICS/2013/resolutions_ao/ICS2013-Participants.pdf 22nd International Communist Seminar.

==Ideology and Political Programme==
The ideology of the SPF is [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]. The party's by-laws and programme were ratified on at the party's founding on December 19, 2009. The party's by-laws indicate that the "Party is an inseparable part of the international leftist movement. It actively pursues the strengthening of bonds of friendship between Lithuania and other nations, fights for the continuation and strengthening of peace, and maintains contact with [[international nongovernmental organization]]s that adhere to the principles of democracy and socialism."&lt;ref name="fronte.lt"&gt;[http://www.fronte.lt/index.php?lng=lt&amp;action=article&amp;id=596 Socialistinio Liaudies Fronto statutas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722151025/http://www.fronte.lt/index.php?lng=lt&amp;action=article&amp;id=596 |date=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of the party include "the institution of democratic socialism in Lithuania and the strengthening of a unified public, whose members help each other." The by-laws also indicate that:

{{quote|In its political action the party follows the guidelines set by a creatively developing [[Marxist]] theory and methodology, advances made by western social democracies, the positive beginnings of [[Soviet Union|soviet socialism]], the achievements of the [[capitalism|capitalist system]] beneficial to society, and the principles of humanitarianism, [[equality before the law|equal rights]], and solidarity... The SPF represents physical and intellectual work done on behalf of the interests of the workers in the private, public, and governmental spheres. The SPF protects the rights of small and middle-sized businesses. Its persistent concern is the problems faced by recipients of welfare. The SPF will seek to achieve its goals only by peaceful, political means, respecting the [[Constitution of Lithuania]], laws, and international acts and principles that defend human rights.&lt;ref name="fronte.lt"/&gt;}}

==Structure==
The SPF congress is the supreme organ of the party. The congress chooses the party's executive council, which oversees and organizes the activity of the party in between congresses, received decisions regarding creating coalitions with other parties, and approves the budget, any reports on the use of funds, and the candidacy of the head of the election committee. The party's sole leader is the chairperson. Territorial subgroups of the party are its chapters and groups.

== Participation in elections ==
The party participated in [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2012|Parliamentary elections]] and came 11th with 16,515 (1.21%) votes and no seats. The municipal elections in 2015 were more successful, as the political block the party participated in received 68 seats, of which 2 were delegates of SPF, including [[Rafael Muksinov]], a current member of [[Vilnius City Council]]. The party council decided not to participate in [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2016|the parliamentary election in 2016]].

==Controversies==
The SPF caused controversy twice in 2010 when members of the party were denied entry into [[Estonia]]. On April 21, party leader Algirdas Paleckis was part of a group of activists traveling to Estonia to protest [[NATO]]'s policy regarding the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. Paleckis was told that he was on the Estonian [[persona non-grata]] list because of his political views and activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10352825/?Lithuanian.radical.denied.entry.to.Estonia=2010-04-22_08-26 Lithuanian radical denied entry into Estonia] [[Baltic News Service|BNS]]/alfa.lt article retrieved August 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In late June, SPF activists, along with [[anti-fascism|anti-fascists]] from [[Latvia]], were denied entry on their way to protest a meeting of veterans of the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS]] near the [[Vaivara concentration camp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?id=180496 Lithuanian, Latvian antifascists barred from entering Estonia to protest congress of SS veterans] [[Interfax]] article retrieved August 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The activists were told that their vehicle was not fit for entry, and, according to the SPF, the only member of the SPF who managed the border crossing into Estonia was not on the official SPF list of activists and had not been mentioned by name by protest organizers over the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fronte.lt/index.php?lng=lt&amp;action=page&amp;id=3631 EXTRA :Saugant buvusių SSinkų ir jų gerbėjų ramybę. Neįleisti SLF ir kitų antifašistinių judėjimų nariai.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722150540/http://fronte.lt/index.php?lng=lt&amp;action=page&amp;id=3631 |date=July 22, 2011 }} SLF Info article in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] retrieved August 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Lithuanian authorities had initiated prosecution against Paleckis for his denial of [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet aggression against Lithuania]],&lt;ref&gt;http://press.org/news-multimedia/news/lithuanian-former-journalist-accuses-country-trying-deny-his-speech-freedom-sen/&lt;/ref&gt; or, to be more specific, against his claim that Soviet soldiers and special units were not responsible for the deaths of 14 people (including one victim of [[friendly fire]]) in January 13, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.15min.lt/en/article/in-lithuania/algirdas-paleckis-found-guilty-of-denying-soviet-aggression-525-225836&lt;/ref&gt; Paleckis allegedly found several witnesses and ballistic assessments that seemed to indicate that there were secret snipers on the roof of the Vilnius TV centre who were shooting into the civilians. He then went on to state publicly that "it appears that in January 1991 our own people were shooting at our own people."&lt;ref name=REGNUM&gt;{{cite news|title=Algirdas Paleckis, or a new Dreyfus case in Europe?|url=http://www.regnum.ru/english/1534153.html|newspaper=REGNUM news}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first verdict in Lithuania's history on charges of denying aggressive conduct of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.15min.lt/en/article/in-lithuania/algirdas-paleckis-found-guilty-of-denying-soviet-aggression-525-225836]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Vilnius]] court had vindicated Paleckis in January 2012. The prosecution had appealed, and Paleckis was sentenced to a fine of 10,400 [[litas]] on June 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2012/08/196986.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Paleckis himself claimed that there was purportedly no independent investigation into the events of January 13, 1991 at the Vilnius TV tower.

The party also hails the Constitution of [[People's Seimas]], adopted by the [[puppet government]] led by [[Justas Paleckis]].

During the demonstration to commemorate Independence Day of Lithuania on February 15, 2014, the leader of Kaunas' branch [[Giedrius Grabauskas]] commented on the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|Act of March 11]] as the one "having brought severe consequences to Lithuania".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrytas.lt/lietuvos-diena/aktualijos/paleckininkus-suerzino-smaiksus-studentu-plakatai.htm Paleckininkus suerzino šmaikšūs studentų plakatai]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the events of [[EuroMaidan]] the party was one of very few in Lithuania who clearly expressed support for a then-president [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. In May 20, 2014 the party, together with other small radical organisations, organised a small rally in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to voice its opposition towards Lithuanian foreign policy during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, making accusations for "representing the interests of the US and EU, not Lithuanian ones".

A former leader [[Algirdas Paleckis]] left the party in January 2016, just before the Parliamentary election. He motivated such a decision by "diverted opinions with the party leadership", their "overestimation of the significance of rallies and underestimation of the one of participation in the election". As a result, Paleckis participated in the election as an independent candidate in [[Naujoji Vilnia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/algirdas-paleckis-palieka-fronta-56-570607]&lt;/ref&gt; The party with a new leadership started to use more [[left-wing nationalism|nationalist]] rhetoric.

==Political positions==
Even though the party is economically [[far-left]], with the statements often attacking [[free market economics]], it has voiced its ultra-[[Conservatism]] in issues, such as [[LGBT rights]] and [[immigration policy]]. One of its members [[Sergejus Sokolovas]] in its interview declared that leftists should fight sexual minorities rather than support them. He also referred to the supporters of [[LGBT movement]] as ''[[tolerasts]]'', a pun of [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[paederasty]] frequently used by the hate speech groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarchija.lt/politika/34269-socialistinis-liaudies-frontas-pasisako-uz-konservatyvias-vertybes-ir-konservatyvia-seimos-samprata „Socialistinis“ liaudies frontas pasisako už konservatyvias vertybes ir konservatyvią šeimos sampratą]&lt;/ref&gt; Its former leader [[Algirdas Paleckis]] would be among the initiators for organising the [[Lithuanian land sales referendum, 2014|referendum on banning land sales to foreigners]]. The party also opposes quotas for [[refugees]] and participated in an anti-refugee rally held in [[Šiauliai]] in November 14, 2015. Other than [[European refugee crisis]] that they referred to as a 'involuntary immigration', the rally also highlighted "human rights abuses of the working class", "war propaganda" and "[[Russophobia]]". The demonstration also saw the attendance of a [[political syncretism|syncretic]] sister organisation "The Combat", as well as [[Way of Courage]] and right-wing populist [[Fighters for Lithuania Union]], former neo-Nazi activist [[Žilvinas Razminas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laisvaslaikrastis.lt/news/1035-siauliuose-ivyko-patriotinis-mitingas-priverstinei-imigracijai-ne-darbo-zmoniu-teisems-taip]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7599">'''Surveillance abuse''' is the use of [[surveillance]] methods or technology to monitor the activity of an individual or group of individuals in a way which violates the social [[norm (sociology)|norms]] or laws of a society.

During the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s [[COINTELPRO]] operations, there was widespread surveillance abuse which targeted political [[dissident]]s, primarily people from the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] and [[civil rights]] movement.

Other abuses include "[[LOVEINT]]" which refers to the practice of secret service employees using their extensive monitoring capabilities to spy on their love interest or spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSA Officers Spy on Love Interests |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/08/23/nsa-officers-sometimes-spy-on-love-interests/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no prevention in the amount of unauthorized data collected on individuals and this leads to cases where cameras are installed inappropriately. “For instance, according to the [[BBC]], four council workers in [[Liverpool]] used a street [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] pan-tilt-zoom camera to spy on a woman in her apartment.” (Cavallaro,2007). This is just one case where culprits have been caught; however, there are still many common acts such as this. Another incident of inappropriate installation now has “[[Pennsylvania]] parents suing their son's school, alleging it watched him through his laptop's webcam while he was at home and unaware he was being observed.” (Surveillance Camera Players, 2010). This leads to the misconception of surveillance, as it once was a tool to monitor and make sure citizens abide by the law, it has now created even more problems. With cameras only becoming more advanced and more common, it is difficult to determine whether these surveillance cameras are helping to ensure a safe society or leading to bigger issues altogether.

With the growing of [[Web 2.0]], social networking sites, surveillance may be more easily and commonly abused in many situations for a variety of reasons. The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), formerly known as [[Communications Security Establishment|Communications Security Establishment Canada]] (CSEC), has previously spied on Canadians through the public wireless internet connections in an airport in the country. Through this they gathered information on who people called or texted and where they were when they communicated with others. The CSE search through approximately 10-15 million downloads daily. An example of where surveillance may have been abused is where [[Facebook]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] have admitted to allowing government officials to access personal information of their account users. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://torontosun.com/2013/07/08/how-the-canadian-government-can-spy-on-your-online-activities/wcm/8fe99b8a-2172-48ee-b2dc-5f8704916b42|title=How the Canadian Government Can Spy on Your Online Activities|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liberalstudiesguides.ca/guides/little-brother/brown-where-is-canadas-rage-over-digital-surveillance/|title=Where Is Canada's Rage over Digital Surveillance?|last=Brown|first=Jesse|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/cse-monitors-millions-of-canadian-emails-to-government-1.2969687|title=CSE Monitors Millions of Canadian Emails to Government|last=Hildebrant, Ambera; Dave Seglins and Michael Pereira|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lievrouw|first=Leah A.|date=2011|title=Alternative and Activist New Media|url=|journal=Cambridge, UK: Polity|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A device which may be used to abuse surveillance, called a [[Stingray phone tracker|Stingray]], acts and looks similar to a cellphone tower but it tricks mobile devices into connecting with it. After connected an operator can take information stored on the device, sometimes intercepting phone calls and text messages. This method of surveillance can be used on random civilians or in an investigation of a particular person.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, Matthew.

'''Sustainable diets''' are defined as "those diets with low environmental impacts that contribute to food and nutritional security and to healthy lives for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable, are nutritionally adequate, safe, and healthy, and optimize natural and human resources."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Burlingame and Sandro Dernini (2012). “Sustainable Diets and Biodiversity Directions and Solutions for Policy, Research and Action.” Proceedings of the International Scientific Symposium, ''Biodiversity and Sustainable Diets against Hunger'', November 3-5, 2010, FAO Headquarters, Rome&lt;/ref&gt; These diets attempt to address  undernourishment, nutrient deficiencies and obesity and covers ecological phenomena such as [[climate change]], [[loss of biodiversity]] and [[land degradation]].&lt;ref&gt;Tara Garnett, "What is a sustainable healthy diet? A discussion paper," Food Climate Research Network, April 2014. Retrieved 25 October 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.fcrn.org.uk/sites/default/files/fcrn_what_is_a_sustainable_healthy_diet_final.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theme, it also covers the study of eating patterns that look at the impact that food consumption has on planetary resources and the health of humans and promotes the needs of the environment, society, and the economy. This growing body of research is recognized by a variety of international bodies such as the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).

==Definition ==

In 2010, the FAO and [[Bioversity International]] defined a sustainable diet as:&lt;blockquote&gt;those diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2012. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3004e/i3004e.pdf ''Sustainable Diets and Biodiversity: Directions and Solutions for Policy, Research and Action'']. [Accessed 13 January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Diets denominated as "sustainable" ==
Sustainable diets mostly concentrate on issues that have something to do with Low Carbon Diets which are structured to reduce the impact of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bamco.com/timeline/low-carbon-diet/|title=Low Carbon Diet - Bon Appétit Management Co.|last=Company|first=Bon Appétit Management|work=Bon Appétit Management Co.|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others also focus on broader environmental factors, as well as social and economic challenges.

Other regionalized diets include the [[Mediterranean diet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/sustainability-and-food-and-nutrition-security-a-vulnerability-assessment-framework-for-the-mediter/ |doi= 10.1177/2158244014539169|title= Sustainability and Food &amp; Nutrition Security|journal= SAGE Open|volume= 4|issue= 2|pages= 215824401453916|year= 2014|last1= Prosperi|first1= Paolo|last2= Allen|first2= Thomas|last3= Padilla|first3= Martine|last4= Peri|first4= Iuri|last5= Cogill|first5= Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nordic diet]] which emphasizes the consumption of local foodstuffs.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.listnutrition.com/what-is-the-nordic-diet/ What is the Nordic Diet?]" Retrieved 16 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tambov Rebellion''' (historically referred to in the Soviet Union as ''Antonovshchina''), which occurred between 1920 and 1921, was one of the largest and best-organized [[List of peasant revolts|peasant rebellion]]s challenging the [[Bolshevik]] regime during the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Conquest"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]], ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York, 1986, {{ISBN|0-19-504054-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising took place in the territories of the modern [[Tambov Oblast]] and part of the [[Voronezh Oblast]], less than 300 miles southeast of Moscow.

In [[Historiography in the Soviet Union|Soviet historiography]], the rebellion was referred to as the "Antonov's mutiny", or ''Antonovschina'', named so after [[Alexander Antonov (politician)|Alexander Antonov]], a former official of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], a [[Chief of staff]] of the rebels. The movement was later portrayed by the Soviets as anarchical banditry, similar to other [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|anti-Soviet movements]] that opposed them during this period.

== Background ==
[[File:1920 staff tambov green army.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Alexander Antonov (politician)|Alexander Antonov]] (centre) and his staff]]
The rebellion was caused by the forced confiscation of grain by the [[Bolshevik]] authorities, a policy known in Russian as "''[[prodrazvyorstka]]''". In 1920, the requisitions were increased from 18 million to 27 million [[pood]]s in the region. This caused the peasants to reduce their grain production since they knew that anything they did not consume themselves would be immediately confiscated. Filling the state quotas meant death for many by starvation.&lt;ref name="black book"/&gt;

The revolt began on 19 August 1920 in a small town of Khitrovo, where a military requisitioning detachment of the [[Red Army]] appropriated everything they could and "beat up elderly men of seventy in full view of the public".&lt;ref name="black book"/&gt;

A distinctive feature of this rebellion, among the many of these times, was that it was led by a political organization, the [[Union of Working Peasants]] (''Soyuz Trudovogo Krestyanstva''). A Congress of Tambov rebels abolished Soviet power and created the Constituent Assembly that called for universal suffrage and land reform. A major tenet proposed by them was returning all land to the peasants.&lt;ref name="Conquest"/&gt;

On 2 February 1921, the Soviet leadership announced the end of the "''prodrazvyorstka''", and issued a special decree directed at peasants from the region implementing the "''[[prodnalog]]''" policy. The new policy was essentially a tax on grain and other foodstuffs. This was done prior to the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Congress]] of the Bolsheviks, when the measure was officially adopted. The announcement began circulating in the Tambov area on 9 February 1921. The Tambov uprising and unrest elsewhere were significant reasons that the "''prodnalog''" policy was implemented and the "''prodrazvyorstka''" was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Landis, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
[[Alexander Antonov (politician)|Alexander Antonov]], a radical member of the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], had sided with the Bolsheviks during the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, but he became disenchanted with them after they implemented a [[Prodrazvyorstka|policy of grain requisition]] in 1918. Antonov became a popular hero to the people of the [[Tambov]] region of central Russia where he started his campaigns.

In October 1920 the peasant army numbered over 50,000 fighters; numerous deserters from the Red Army joined it. The rebel militia proved highly effective and even infiltrated the Tambov [[Cheka]].&lt;ref name="black book"/&gt; [[Alexander Schlichter]], Chairman of the [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] Gubernia Executive Committee, contacted [[Vladimir Lenin]], who ordered Red Army reinforcements to the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works//1920/oct/19c.htm Lenin to Kornev, 19 October, 1920]. Accessed 21 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1921 peasant revolts spread to [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], [[Saratov]], [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]], [[Astrakhan]] and [[Siberia]]. In February, the peasant army reached its peak, numbering up to 70,000 and successfully defending the area against Bolshevik expeditions.

The seriousness of the uprising caused the establishment of the "Plenipotentiary Commission of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Bolshevik Party for the Liquidation of Banditry in the Gubernia of Tambov". With the end of the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (in March 1921) and the defeat of [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|General Wrangel]] in 1920, the Red Army could divert its regular troops into the area - deploying in total over 100,000 Red Army soldiers, alongside special Cheka detachments.&lt;ref name="black book"/&gt;

The Red Army, under the command of [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], used heavy artillery and [[armoured train]]s and also engaged in the summary execution of civilians. Tukhachevsky and [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]] signed an order, dated 12 June 1921, which stipulated:

{{Quotation|1="The forests where the bandits are hiding are to be cleared by the use of poison gas. This must be carefully calculated, so that the layer of gas penetrates the forests and kills everyone hiding there."&lt;ref name="black book"/&gt;}}

The Bolshevik forces used [[chemical weapon]]s "from end of June 1921 until apparently the fall of 1921", by direct order from the leadership of Red Army and from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="Sennikov"&gt;Publisher: Posev, 2004, {{ISBN|5-85824-152-2}} [http://www.rusk.ru/vst.php?idar=321701 B.V.Sennikov. ''Tambov rebellion and liquidation of peasants in Russia''], Full text in Russian&lt;/ref&gt; Publications in local Communist newspapers openly glorified liquidations of "bandits" with the poison gas.&lt;ref name="Sennikov"/&gt;

Seven [[Internment|concentration camp]]s were set up. At least 50,000 people were interned, mostly women, children, and the elderly - some of them sent to the camps as hostages. Each month 5 percent of inmates in the camps died.&lt;ref name="black book"/&gt;

The Bolsheviks gradually quelled the uprising in the course of 1921. Antonov was killed in 1922 during an attempt to arrest him. Sennikov estimated the total losses among the population of Tambov region in 1920 to 1922 resulting from the war, executions, and imprisonment in concentration camps as approximately 140,000.&lt;ref&gt;

==Recovery of documents==
Some documents relating to the rebellion were found by the local ethnographer Boris Sennikov in 1982 while he was engaged in clearing sand from the altar of the Winter Church of the Kazan monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulag.ipvnews.org/article20061017.php An illustrated article about Tambov revolt from Gulag website (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, the monastery had been requisitioned for use as the local Cheka headquarters and the church had served as the archive of the Tambov Military Commissariat.

In 1933, the local government decided to burn documents that could compromise the Soviet regime. However, during the process, the fire grew out of control and had to be extinguished by water and, crucially, sand. All documents in the archive were believed to be destroyed; as the church altar was not used by the archive, the surviving documents, covered by a layer of sand, had never been found. In 1982, the local archive changed its address and the church became abandoned. When Sennikov found the documents, the Tambov department of [[KGB]] opened a criminal case against him. Later, the case was closed, but Sennikov lost his job.

In 2004, the publishing house ''Posev'' published the Sennikov archive as part of ''The Tambov Rebellion and the Liquidation of Russian Peasantry&lt;ref name="Sennikov"/&gt;'' along with documents relating to the Governorate Military Commissariat (including those dealing with [[Konstantin Mamontov]]'s 1919 anti-Bolshevik raid, and those describing the [[Great Purge]] of the 1930s). The documents also included Red Army orders issued during the rebellion, correspondence, reports of the use of chemical weapons against the peasant rebels, and documents of the Union of the Working Peasants.

==In popular culture==
* Some scenes of the rebellion are depicted in 2011 movie ''[[Once Upon a Time There Lived a Simple Woman]]'' by [[Andrei Smirnov (actor)|Andrei Smirnov]].
* ''Apricot Jam and Other Stories'' (2010) by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]. In a short story about Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]]'s futile attempts at writing his memoirs, the retired Marshal reminisces about being a young officer fighting against the [[Union of Working Peasants]]. He recalls [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]'s arrival to take command of the campaign and his first address to his men. He announced that [[total war]] and [[scorched earth]] tactics are to be used against civilians who assist or even sympathize with the Union. Zhukov proudly recalls how Tukhachevsky's tactics were adopted and succeeded in breaking the uprising. In the process, however, they virtually depopulated the surrounding countryside.

The '''USSR anti-religious campaign (1921–1928)''' was a campaign of [[antireligion|anti-religious]] persecution against churches and believers by the [[Soviet government]] following the initial [[anti-religious campaign during the Russian Civil War]]. The elimination of most religion and its replacement with deism, agnosticism and atheism supported with a materialist world view was a fundamental ideological goal of the state.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 pg 34"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. "A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer", vol 1: ''A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies'', St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, The Attitude of the Workers' Party to Religion.

Found at: http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1909/may/13.htm&lt;/ref&gt; To this end the state conducted anti-religious persecutions against believers that were meant to hurt and destroy religion. It was never made illegal to be a believer or to have religion, and so the activities of this campaign were often veiled under other pretexts (usually resistance to the regime) that the state invoked or invented in order to justify its activities.&lt;ref name="en.wikisource.org"&gt;Letters of Metropolitan Sergii of Vilnius http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letters_of_Metropolitan_Sergii_of_Vilnius&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Doloy prazdniki.jpg|thumb|Soviet anti-religious poster, 1924. The inscription says: "Ban religious holidays!"]]

The persecution entered a new phase in 1921 with the resolutions adopted by the tenth CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) congress, and would set the atmosphere for the remainder of the decade's persecutions, which would enter another new phase in 1929 when new legislation was passed on prohibition of public religious activities.

The 10th party congress launched Lenin's "[[New Economic Policy]]" (NEP), in response to the poor state of the Russian economy that resulted from [[World War I]], the [[Russian Civil War]], and the War Communist system used during the latter. The state faced large scale popular revolts of workers, which Trotsky believed threatened the survival of the state. The NEP brought in some measure of limited free enterprise, and was meant to compromise with the general population as well as to present the new regime in a more respectable light to the world community and thus acquire a place in the world market. To acquire a better reputation, the regime considered it detrimental to continue with the civil war policy of murdering religious believers without trials or plausible accusations.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 47"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. "A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer", vol 2: ''Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions'', St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the anti-religious campaign needed to be conducted under more respectable pretexts.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 47"/&gt;&lt;!-- I'm not sure if there is enough space in this article to give an adequate hisoriographical analysis as to these are thought to be pretexts, but briefly to explain: It was always the official policy that the state aimed to destroy religion, however, what was not the official policy was that the killings and arrests of priests or believers was because of their religion. The 'pretexts' mentioned here are the official reasons given for why believers were being arrested or killed. The fact that these are pretexts may be seen through a large body of evidence that I will artificially explain/divide for simplification into the following groups: i) the behaviour of the state security forces in arresting clergy and laity on clearly invented charges, wherein the only apparent reason as to why they were being arrested was because of their successful efforts at spreading religion ii) the creation of laws against believers that were made deliberately ambiguous and/or were clearly arranged in such a way that the believers had little possibility of being able to keep them (eg. later on in 1929, clergy could be assigned taxes that greatly exceeded 100% of their income, and when they failed to pay it, they were arrested for tax evasion...as though the state was actually expecting them to come up with the sum required, and wasn't in fact simply trying to find a way to put the priest in jail) iii) the anti-religious propaganda that continually invented lies against believers, which were clearly false, but which served as pretexts that preceded the arrest of the believers who were being libelled and arrested for supposedly committing the libel iv)  the interpretation applied to official CPSU Central Committee instructions that often used euphemisms throughout the period and afterwards. v) secret letters that have since been revealed that were written by Lenin, such as in the Shuia incident below wherein Lenin indicates that the campaign to confiscate church valuables was not meant for pure philanthropy but as a means to provoke the church into a situation wherein it could be attacked --&gt; However, the elimination of religion remained a fundamental ideological goal of the state.&lt;ref name="Becker, Winfried 1929"&gt;Becker, Winfried. "Diplomats and missionaries: the role played by the German embassies in Moscow and Rome in the relations between Russia and the Vatican from 1921 to 1929." The Catholic Historical Review 92.1 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two main principal anti-religious campaigns that occurred in the 1920s, with one surrounding the campaign to seize church valuables and the other surrounding the renovationist schism in the Orthodox Church.

This portion of the state's religious campaign came to an end in 1929, when Stalin began the implementation of a much harsher campaign that would take place in the following decade.

== Legislative Measures ==

The tenth party congress met in early 1921 and issued the resolution "On Glavpolitprosvet (Central Committee of the Republic for Political Education) and the Agitation: Propaganda Problems of the Party". This resolution called for "widescale organization, leadership, and cooperation in the task of anti-religious agitation and propaganda among the broad masses of the workers, using the mass media, films, books, lectures, and other devices.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Powell, ''Antireligious Propaganda in the Soviet Union: A Study of Mass Persuasion'' (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1975) p. 34;&lt;/ref&gt;

In August of that year, a plenary meeting of the Party Central Committee adopted an 11-point instruction on the interpretation and application of article 13 (mentioned above). The instruction made a differentiation between educated believers and uneducated believers, and it forbade party membership to any religious believer who was a member of the clergy or who had an education, but uneducated believers were allowed party membership on an individual basis if they prove their devotion to Communism.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin's Press, New York (1961) pp 4&lt;/ref&gt; It was decreed that such members, however, should be submitted to 'special re-education work' in order to make them atheists. The instruction warned against rash actions in anti-religious propaganda, against giving too much publicity to 'anti-religious agitation' and it stressed  'serious scientific cultural-enlightenment work, building up  natural-scientific foundation for a proper historical analysis of the question of religion'. This meant that the anti-religious campaign was to be directed at building up a non-religious culture and educational system, rather than subjecting religion to ridicule and attack. It directed the Central Committee Agitation Department, ''Revolution and the Church'' and Glavpolitprosvet to conform to this. The instruction also emphasized that the state was fighting against all forms of religious belief and not simply individual religions (like the Orthodox church).&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 30&lt;/ref&gt;

It was after the 10th congress that the authorities began to take measures against the public debates, which were eventually formally suspended in 1929 and replaced with public lectures by atheists. The reason given for their cessation was that they did not satisfy public demand and that people preferred to solidify their atheism with study. Martsinkovsky was arrested and sent to exile in 1922 on account of his religious preaching that attracted people to religion and told he could return in a few years once the workers had become wiser (he was in fact never allowed to return).&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 pg 40"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 40&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persecution against the Orthodox Church ==

[[File:Proces metropolity weniamina.jpg|thumb|Russian Orthodox metropolitan [[Saint Benjamin of Petrograd|Benjamin (Kazansky)]] facing charges by Revolutionary Tribunal of Petrograd for "Counter Revolutionary Agitation" [[Saint Benjamin of Petrograd#Arrest and Execution|(details)]]]]

Despite the part of the August 1921 instruction about combating all religions, the state took a particular hardline against the Orthodox church on the pretext that it was a legacy of the Tsarist past (this difference in practice and policy may also have reflected internal disagreement among the party leadership, particularly between Stalin and Trotsky).&lt;ref&gt;Joan Delaney Grossman, 'The Origins of Soviet Antireligious Organizations', in Richard H. Marshall, Jr (ed.), Aspects of Religion in the Soviet Union, 1917-1967, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; This may also have been a pragmatic consideration in the belief that the state was not yet strong enough in order to broaden its anti-religious activities beyond the Orthodox church.

When church leaders demanded freedom of religion under the constitution, the Communists responded [[red terror|with terror]]. They murdered the metropolitan of Kiev and executed twenty-eight bishops and 6,775 priests. Despite mass demonstrations in support of the church, repression cowed most ecclesiastical leaders into submission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russia.by/russia.by/print.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1190294595&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=9&amp;category=9&lt;/ref&gt;

Tikhon produced an encyclical on political neutrality and disengagement of the Church from worldly politics, and the official propaganda depicted it as a form of camouflage to hide his real aim of support for autocratic bourgeois-aristocracy. Tikhon emphasized the freedom of the Church in the separation of Church and State and the duty of believers to be loyal to the state in civic matters, in as much as this did not contradict a Christian's primary loyalty to God. He produced three declarations of loyalty to the Soviet state, in 1919, 1923 and in his last testament in 1925.

Beginning in March 1922, the Soviet Press published libellous accounts of the behaviour of clergy and believers. This was followed up with arrests and trials of the people attacked.

Believers could also be arrested in association with claiming or honouring miracles. Miracles needed to be suppressed in the eyes of the state due to their contradiction of the atheism of the official state ideology. However, it was not yet legal to prosecute people simply for making such claims (it would become so in 1929), so the miracle claims were prosecuted instead under the pretext that they were acts of resistance meant to strengthen believers in their resistance to hold on to church valuables. In Tula, the local bishop Yuvenalii was sentenced to ten years imprisonment after the local populace claimed a miracle to have occurred; several others were imprisoned along with him. The campaign to disprove miracles (in which saints' relics were sometimes exposed and confiscated) met considerable resistance from believers as well as many clashes and arrests.

Faith had to be turned into a private affair and made as invisible as possible. The regime could not tolerate dynamic faith or popular religious leaders who could inspire and lead millions of people.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 58"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecution, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 58&lt;/ref&gt;

To this effect, Lenin's doctrine that the state should be much more tolerant towards amoral or even criminal priests rather than those of good moral standing, was interpreted such that popular clergymen were removed, imprisoned or killed wherever it was deemed feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecution, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 57&lt;/ref&gt; Charges would often be invented against such popular clergy in order to justify their arrest, imprisonment or execution. This method was especially harsh in rural areas away from foreign observers where a systematic campaign liquidated the most popular monks and shut down the most authoritative monasteries. Through this, the famous Optina monastery was shut down in 1922 and turned into a state museum, and one of the elders was arrested. All seven local churches were shut down as well by 1929 (leaving the local religious population with no building to worship in). The museum would later be closed in 1928 and by 1930 the monks who had served in it were mostly either in hiding or had been sent to concentration camps.

Secret Monasticism began to develop in the 1920s in response to the state persecution. This practice involved either people who lived 'in the world' who undertook monastic vows secretly and lived a double-life with other secret monks or nuns, or it involved communities of monastics who lived in secret and isolated from society.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Wynot 2002 p63"&gt;Jennifer Wynot. Monasteries without walls: secret monasticism in the Soviet Union, 1928-39. Church History 71.1 (March 2002): p63(17). (7266 words)&lt;/ref&gt; When such communities were discovered, the monastics could sometimes be immediately executed. Future church leaders were in these communities and they may have been instrumental in preserving monasticism in the USSR.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Wynot 2002 p63"/&gt;

Tikhon died in 1925. He was replaced in 1927 by Metropolitan Sergii who gave unqualified loyalty to the state.&lt;ref name="en.wikisource.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel, Wallace L 2009"&gt;Daniel, Wallace L.

Department of State Bulletin 87 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The Church, however, continued to teach that Orthodoxy was incompatible with Marxism. This was contrasted by many other religious groups in the country that tried to re-affirm how they were compatible with the state ideology when they were put under attack.

The Patriarchal church lost its ability to train new clergy in 1928 after its advanced theological studies in Leningrad "voluntarily closed".&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana A. Chumachenko.

== Campaign to Seize Church Valuables ==

The Volga basin is subject to periodic droughts that can sometimes last for several years. The last famine that had been produced by this occurred in 1891, and after that experience the Tsarist government had built up special stockpiles of grain in preparation for a future famine. All of these stockpiles had been taken and used by armed factions in the Civil War, however, and new droughts in the Volga in 1920-1922 resulted in a massive famine.

Patriarch Tikhon made an appeal to the world community and religious leaders outside of Russia for aid. The Church formed a Famine Relief Committee, but this was shut down by the government only a few months after it had been created, and that they hand over all the money they had collected.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917-1983 (Crestwood NY.: St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1984) ch 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin ordered that all of the precious metals, precious stones and valuable material that could be found in religious buildings throughout the country should be confiscated and sold in order to create funds to help relieve the famine.&lt;ref name="marxist.com"&gt;Paul Dixon, Religion in the Soviet Union, first published 1945 in Workers International News, and can be found at: http://www.marxist.com/religion-soviet-union170406.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriarch appealed to the parishes on February 19, 1922 to surrender all such objects of value with the exception of the vessels used for the Holy Eucharist. On February 28, the government issued another order to all state agents to confiscate all sacred vessels including those used in the sacraments. On the same day, the Patriarch issued an encyclical asking believers to be very generous in their donations so as to pay off the cost of the vessels used in the Eucharist, but not to give up the vessels themselves.

Lenin jumped at the opportunity and used it as a pretext to attack the church. They refused to accept the Patriarch's compromise of offering the monetary value of the vessels and instead insisted that the vessels be handed over. Lenin also refused the Patriarch's request that Church representatives be included in the government commissions inspecting, confiscating and accounting for the confiscated valuables.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Patriarch distrusted the government's intentions, and maintained his order not to hand over the vessels. The state went ahead and sent armed requisitioning teams around the country to collect the valuables, and they provoked much resistance.

The sixth sector of the [[OGPU]], led by [[Yevgeny Tuchkov]], began aggressively arresting and executing bishops, priests, and devout worshipers, such as [[Benjamin of Petrograd|Metropolitan Veniamin]] in Petrograd in 1922 for refusing to accede to the demand to hand in church valuables (including sacred relics). [[Andronic Nikolsky|Archbishop Andronik]] of [[Perm]], who worked as a missionary in Japan, was shot after being forced to his own grave. Bishop Germogen of [[Tobolsk]], who voluntarily accompanied the Tsar into exile, was strapped to the paddlewheel of a streamboat and mangled by the rotating blades.

By mid-1922 there had been 1414 violent clashes between the faithful and the armed detachments, as well as 55 trials and 231 group cases. Tikhon appeared as a witness to the trial of 54 clergy and he took personally responsibility for their actions upon himself.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 26"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecution, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve of the fifty-four were executed and 27 received prison sentences.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 50"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecution, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 50&lt;/ref&gt; At least 35 Orthodox were legally sentenced to death in connection with this campaign (although some sentences were commuted).&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 50"/&gt;

One of the bloodiest of the clashes occurred in an old-textile industrial town called Shuia, near Moscow. On March 15, 1922 a group of mounted police arrived at the church square to requisition the valuables and a large crowd of believers had gathered there as well. The Soviet press reported that the mounted police were greeted with threatening shouts and hurling of rocks or other articles, while someone rang an alarm bell that brought huge masses of people to the square.

A half company of infantry was then brought supported by two armoured cars with mounted machine guns. The Soviet press reported that believers fired the first shots with pistols at the soldiers who then returned fire on the crowd.

After the event Lenin wrote that their enemies had foolishly afforded them a great opportunity by this action, since he believed that the peasant masses would not support the church's hold on its valuables in light of the famine and that the resistance that the church offered could be met with bloody retaliation against the clergy without inciting popular sympathy for them. He wrote, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the party congress arrange a secret meeting of all or almost all delegates to discuss this matter jointly with the chief workers of the GPU, the People's Commissariat of Justice [NKIu], and the Revolutionary Tribunal. At this meeting pass a secret resolution of the congress that the removal of property of value, especially from the very richest lauras, monasteries, and churches, must be carried out with ruthless resolution, leaving nothing in doubt, and in the very shortest time. The greater the number of representatives of the reactionary clergy and the reactionary bourgeoisie that we succeed in shooting on this occasion, the better because this "audience" must precisely now be taught a lesson in such a way that they will not dare to think about any resistance whatsoever for several decades.&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"&gt;Letter from Lenin to Molotov, 1922, webpage: http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/soviet.exhibit/ae2bkhun.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this same letter, which was secret at the time but now published, Lenin explained that the campaign to seize church valuables was meant not for primarily philanthropic reasons but rather as a means of provoking the church into a situation wherein it could be greatly attacked with little reprisal and depicted as a heartless organization that would not give up its gold to feed the starving poor.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, 3&lt;/ref&gt; This fact may have also explained his shutting down of the Church's famine relief efforts and his refusal to accept the compromise. It also likely affected the misrepresentation of the Church's position in the Soviet press wherein it was not acknowledged that the Patriarch had offered to arrange to pay for the valuables and the Church hierarchy was presented as careless about the catastrophe.

Several trials and executions of clergy followed the Shuia incident.

The campaign was not directed at only the Orthodox church but it also seized valuables present in religious buildings of other religions. Trials were conducted of Roman Catholics and Jews who resisted the seizure, but they generally received much milder sentences than the Orthodox.

The valuables collected proved to be of pitiful value on the world market, (it was even discovered that the Russian nobility had for centuries been donating fake precious stones), but Lenin's propaganda effect was still achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izvestia, 19 December 1922; E Belov, 'Sud'ba tserkovynkh tsennostei iz'iatykh sovetskoi vlast'iu v 1922 g.', VRSKhD, no. 104-5 (1972) pp. 325-7 (in. edit. note)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the conclusion of the campaign of seizing church valuables, the terror campaign against the church was called off for a while. In May 1923, the Antireligious Commission of the CPSU Central Committee ordered the GPU (the [[State Political Directorate]]) 'to investigate all closures of churches. Should these have taken place with abuse of the Soviet legislation on the cults, the guilty ones ought to be made responsible for their acts.' &lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 38&lt;/ref&gt; The commission addressed a letter to the Central Committee suggesting immediate discontinuation of the closure of churches, and the publication of an article in [[Pravda]] condemning such acts. The Central Committee followed with an internal letter to all party organizations on June 23, calling for a halt to all such abuses which 'cause all sorts of dissatisfaction, made use of by anti-Soviet elements.' The physical attack was called off, but the propaganda war continued.

The Soviet press after the campaign accused the clergy and laity of hiding or stealing church valuables. Even more arrests and imprisonments followed these accusations. This, however, was cut short by the failure of the state to conceal the embarrassing massive black-market operations by Soviet officials who were caught stealing and selling the valuables for themselves. This news resulted in rioting by believers.

In total, it is estimated that 8,100 clergy, monks and nuns were murdered in connection the church-valuables campaign. Another 165 priests were executed after 1923.

== Renovationist Schism ==

In attacking the Orthodox church, the state supported a schism in the Orthodox church called the 'Renovationist' sect or the 'Living Church',&lt;ref name="marxist.com"/&gt; led by Fr. Alexander Vvendenskij,&lt;ref name="Becker, Winfried 1929"/&gt; by giving it legal recognition in 1922 and continuing to terrorize the old Orthodox as well as deprive it of legal means of existence.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 pg 33"/&gt;  They attempted to make Orthodox Christianity compatible with Marxism and were fully loyal to the state.

The state initially recognized only the schismatic group as the legitimate Orthodox church and it subsequently persecuted those who refused to recognize the schism.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917-1983 (Crestwood NY.: St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1984) pp285-307&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotsky wanted Patriarch Tikhon to be killed after the excommunication in 1918, but Lenin forbade it. Lenin also insisted not to touch the Patriarch during the Shuia incident for fear it would produce another [[Germogen]] (a Patriarch who was killed by the Poles when they occupied Moscow in 1612).&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 pg 33"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, 253&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriarch was arrested in May 1922,&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina Petra Ramet, Ed., Religious Policy in the Soviet Union. Cambridge University Press (1993). P 273&lt;/ref&gt; and his chancery was taken over by the Renovationists.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917-1983 (Crestwood NY.: St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1984) vol. 1 p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory L. Freeze 1925. pp. 305-339"&gt;Gregory L. Freeze. Counter-Reformation in Russian Orthodoxy: Popular Response to Religious Innovation, 1922-1925. Slavic Review, Vol. 54, No. 2 (Summer, 1995), pp. 305-339&lt;/ref&gt; Trotsky would continue to attack the Patriarch until he was released from prison in 1923 and made his declaration of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Novye mucheniki rossiiskie, vol. 1. (Jordanville: H Trinity Monastery Press, 1949) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The state arrested, exiled and even shot clergy who continued to declare their loyalty to Patriarch Tikhon after his arrest, and resisted the takeover by the Renovationists.&lt;ref name="regels.org"&gt;Letters from Moscow, Gleb Yakunin and Lev Regelson, http://www.regels.org/humanright.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The state issued propaganda that claimed the opposition to the takeover was the result of 'bourgeois and black-hundrist elements'.&lt;ref name="Gregory L. Freeze 1925. pp. 305-339"/&gt;

Metropolitan [[Veniamin (Kazansky)]] of [[Petrograd]] was one of the most prominent victims of this. He was very popular and had come from a lower-class background, which hurt Soviet propaganda that the church hierarchy was filled with representatives of the upper classes during the time of the Tsar. His great popularity may have made him a target by the regime.

The Petrograd section of the State Famine Relief Commission initially agreed to a plan proposed by Metropolitan Veniamin to hand over the valuables, and to include representatives of the Church in the confiscations. The Petrograd section may not have been initially informed by Lenin of the real aim of the campaign, because shortly after this agreement was published in the newspapers in approving terms, the Petrograd section then cancelled the agreement and stated that the clergy could not participate in the commission. The Metropolitan agreed to hand over the valuables and pay for the precious objects used in the sacraments through a special collection, and the Petrograd section agreed to this.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace was short-lived, however, because the Metropolitan protested the takeover of the church by the Renovationists and excommunicated its leaders (the priests Vvedensky, Belkov and Krasnitsky). The Soviet press responded with attacking Veniamin's character and he was presented with an ultimatum by the government in that he could either remove the excommunication or he and those close to him would pay with their lives. (It should be noted that the fact that the USSR had a separation of church and state did not mean in practice that the state could not punish believers who did not recognize church authorities when these authorities were working for the state.) The Metropolitan would not change, and so he was arrested shortly after.

He was defended by a Jew name Gurovich and the trial was conducted in a court room that was packed with thousands of people. Gurovich conducted an excellent defence; he cleverly mentioned how Krasnitsky had been publishing militantly anti-bolshevik articles up until November 1917 and as a Jew he defended the record of the Russian clergy in a pre-revolutionary incident where there had been an allegation of Jewish ritual murder. When no evidence could be found for the charges against him about belonging to a counter-revolutionary conspiracy, the Petrograd Cheka chief PA Krasikov famously stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Are you inquiring about the real existence of criminal conspiracy? Look here it is! Right in front of you! This organization is the Orthodox Church itself!&lt;ref name="regels.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his final plea to the court, Veniamin declared his loyalty to the state and recalled the words of St Paul 'if you suffer because you are a Christian, don't be ashamed of it but thank God'.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 54&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the trial, ten persons, including the Metropolitan were condemned to death, and fifty-nine others received prison sentences. Veniamin was [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on August 12.

In 1925 there were at least 65 bishops in prison or exile (not counting those who had been detained for short periods and then released).&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1988 pg 58"/&gt; Some bishops returned from exile in 1925 while an additional twenty bishops were arrested in the same year including Metropolitan Peter (Poliansky) who became temporary Patriarch after Tikhon's death in April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana A. Chumachenko. Edited and Translated by Edwad E. Roslof. Church and State in Soviet Russia: Russian Orthodoxy from World War II to the Khrushchev years. ME Sharpe inc., 2002 pp 3&lt;/ref&gt; The regime continued to arrest clergy who did not accept the Renovationists. Peter's replacement as temporary Patriarch after his arrest was Metropolitan Sergii. Sergii and twelve bishops, including Archbishop Illarion (Troitsky) of Krutitsy were arrested in 1926. The intransigence of some of the bishops would cause them to remain and eventually die in exile; Metropolitan Peter died in the Arctic in 1937 and Illarion died in a prison transit hospital in Leningrad in 1929.

In 1926-1927 the bishops secretly undertook the election of a new patriarch by means of a ballot that was done through correspondence carried by trusted messengers going from one bishop to another. The state discovered this ballot through the arrest and execution of two of the messengers, and arrested many of the bishops who were participating as well as another messenger. The number of arrested bishops rose to 150 by mid-1927 as a result of this.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergii was released in 1927 and became the new Patriarch after he signed a declaration of loyalty to the state. The state wanted the Patriarchal church to bend ever lower in its declaration of loyalty than Tikhon had. The new declaration of loyalty not only promised loyalty to the government, but claimed that the Soviets had never mistreated the Church&lt;ref name="regels.org"/&gt; and thanked the government for the care that had been shown to believers. This declaration may at first not have been widely known, because arrests continued briefly.

Once it had been widely published, another schism developed in the Church by many conservative church movements that refused to accept this new declaration.&lt;ref name="Daniel, Wallace L 2009"/&gt; At least 37 bishops broke with Sergii over this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 60&lt;/ref&gt; The group that broke with the new Patriarch were not deeply opposed to Sergii's civic loyalty to the state, but they could not accept the declaration he signed that stated that there had never been any religious persecutions, for they saw this as a betrayal of the martyrs.&lt;ref name="Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917-1983 (Crestwood NY.: St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1984) ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The clergy who had been arrested for originally declaring their loyalty to Sergii before 1927 remained in prison, while clergy who refused to accept his authority after 1927 began to be arrested by the state. This declaration had ended the persecution of the Orthodox church surrounding the Renovationist issue.

The Renovationists failed to attract the laity,&lt;ref name="en.wikisource.org"/&gt; who largely remained with the Patriarchal church and produced a firestorm of opposition to their temporary takeover of the Russian Orthodox church.&lt;ref name="Gregory L. Freeze 1925. pp. 305-339"/&gt; For this reason the state lost interest in the Renovationists as a tool to hurt Orthodoxy. The Renovationists lost control of a third to one half of their churches by the end of 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, 4&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities changed direction and pushed for reunification in 1924-1927 in the belief that the Renovationists who were loyal to the state could be used as agents, activists and informers within the Patriarchal Orthodox church.&lt;ref&gt;A. Levitin-Krasnov, Likhie gody, 1925-1941 (Paris: YMCA Press, 1977) pp 255-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-Religious Propaganda ==

Anti-religious propaganda played a critical role in the persecutions, because they were used to develop attitudes of hostility against believers which could then lead to justifying their mistreatment.

A number of specialized anti-religious journals began circulation in 1922. ''Nauka i religiia'' (Science and Religion), edited by former priest Mikhail Galkin (literary pseudonym: Gorev&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina Petra Ramet, Ed., Religious Policy in the Soviet Union. Cambridge University Press (1993). P 280&lt;/ref&gt;) began in December 1922, and was soon replaced by the weekly ''Bezhbozhnik'' (The Godless) edited by [[Yemelyan Yaroslavsky]]. Yaroslavsky would form a society of friends of The Godless newspaper, which a few years later would become the Society of the Godless and eventually (1929) it would become the infamous [[League of the Militant Godless]].&lt;ref name="marxist.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 pg 37"&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina Petra Ramet, Ed., Religious Policy in the Soviet Union. Cambridge University Press (1993). P 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the 11th party congress turned the publishing house ''Glavpolitprosvet, Krasnaia nov'' and the journal by the same name into a special party publishing enterprise for Marxist and anti-religious literature. The 12th (1923) and 13th (1924) party congresses called for 'moderation'. The 12th party congress called for the expansion of anti-religious propaganda and warned against insulting religious feelings by 'primitive methods' and of ridiculing the objects and ceremonies of faith; claiming that these methods strengthen 'religious fanaticism'. Instead it called for more publication of anti-religious literature of a popular scientific nature, and more analysis of the history of religion. The call for moderation was ignored by the above-mentioned anti-religious journals.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 pg 37"/&gt;

The propaganda viciously attacked the Orthodox church and especially its clergy as being the scum of the nation. It was claimed in the official press that none of the seminarians believed in their religion's teachings but that these teachings were simply tools to exploit the masses. The early anti-church propaganda produced by the Soviet state claimed that the state was only opposed to the leadership of the Orthodox church, and not religion in general or the Orthodox church as a body. To this effect the press commended acts of disobedience by parishes against the Patriarch; in 1920 there was one parish that was commended for refusing to accept priests that were sent by the church hierarchy and which opted instead to elect a former psalmist as their priest.

The Patriarch was attacked in the press, especially during the campaign to seize church valuables, as having sold their teacher Jesus to the tsar and capitalists by withholding church valuables from the famine stricken. The church hierarchy was presented in the official press as indifferent to the suffering of the famine and happy about the economic catastrophe, as a means that could contribute towards overthrowing the Soviets and returning the monarchy.

Despite the line carried in the official press, Lenin and his party were always concerned from the beginning with trying to eliminate all religion in the country and this played a part towards that end.

Anti-religious propaganda of the time also blamed Christianity, and especially the Orthodox Church, for fomenting anti-semitism. Contradictorily, the anti-religious propaganda also depicted Jews in an anti-semitic light as capitalist businessmen in accordance with Marx's writing .&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-religious press continuously produced primitive blasphemies of God, Christ and the Saints in their pages designed to insult the religious feelings of believers. Religion was equated with immorality, drunkenness and money-grabbing. Religion was blamed for failing to differentiate between the working classes and capitalists.

The anti-religious propaganda rarely showed differentiation in methodology despite the debate that went on between different members of the Soviet hierarchy.

Even 'sophisticated' theoretical and methodological journals often published direct hate propaganda against religious believers.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 the sophisticated 'Society of Militant Materialists' (renamed in 1928 'Militant Dialectical Materialists') was founded, and it consisted predominately (exclusively after 1928) of marxist philosophers grouped around ''Under the Banner of Marxism'', which aimed at combatting religious and 'idealistic' views among scientists, scholars and intellectuals in general.

== Debate on Methodology ==

As the years progressed, it became increasingly clear that the old Marxist assumption&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt; that religion would die away quickly and easily was highly mistaken as resistance to the anti-religious policies was found across the country. In 1924, Trotsky, who originally had thought that the Russian masses were only superficially religious,&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky, 'Vodka, tserkov' i kinematograf, Pravda (12 July 1923) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; warned that the struggle against religion would be a long and arduous battle and he spoke of religion as a cultural phenomena to be attacked on all fronts with every means except the forced closure of churches.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotsky considered printed anti-religious material to be of little use in a largely illiterate nation and he emphasized the potential of the cinema in being able to replace the religiosity of the peasantry (which he thought was only a matter of habit in absence of other entertainment).&lt;ref&gt;Joan Delany Grossman, 'The Origins of Soviet Antireligious Ogrnizations' in Richard H. Marshall, Jr (ed.), Aspects of Religion in the Soviet Union, 1917-1967, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

Different parts of the Soviet leadership disagreed with each other on how best to combat religion, with positions ranging from the 'rightist' belief that religion would die on its own naturally with increasing education, and the 'leftist' belief that religion needed to be attacked strongly. The Marxist notion that human beliefs were determined by material conditions&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt; had been used to support the 'rightist' argument that religion would go away on its own once the state developed, and that rather than teaching people atheism and giving anti-religious propaganda, people should instead be taught natural sciences and they would then lose their religion. The old Marxist theory was pragmatically questioned as it became apparent that religion was not going away, and more active means were thought necessary.

The debate was not about whether or not religion was evil, but was rather about what tactics to use to combat it. The deputy editor of Bezhbozhnik Anton Loginov explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;it's common knowledge that religion is opium... poison, stupor, moonshine, and yet we are not supposed to insult believers' feelings. Why should we say one thing and do another?... Not every stab at religion serves the aim of struggle against it… every "persecution of that faith" builds up religious fanaticism.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this effect, anti-religious activities that were too insulting to religious feelings could be questioned and criticized in the belief that they would harden religious convictions.

Lenin's statement 'On the Significance of Militant Materialism', was worded in such a fashion that both sides of the debate would use it to support their arguments. Lenin's statement called for a close-cooperation of all militant materialists (atheists), both communists and non-communists, including the 18th century French materialists, and it also stressed the role of the official Marxist philosophical monthly journal ''Under the Banner of Marxism (Pod znamenem marxizma)'' to tirelessly disseminate 'atheistic propaganda and struggle', which he called 'the cause of our state' (nasha gosudartsvennaia rabota) &lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 pg 34"/&gt;

An important part of this debate occurred between Emelian Yaroslavsky (founder of the [[Society of the Godless]]) and the Moscow Society of the Godless. Yaroslavsky's position that the whole nation needed to be mobilized for an attack on all religions, but one which was pragmatically organized and moderated to be effective, would eventually carry official favour and become the officially adopted position for the anti-religious campaign that would occur after 1929.

A unified consolidated position on the religious question nevertheless took shape in these years.

== Education ==

The school question proved troublesome initially for Soviet policies. They had outlawed religious instruction for schoolchildren or youth.&lt;ref name="Becker, Winfried 1929"/&gt; In 1925 the delegates of the first congress of Soviet schoolteachers refused to endorse the principle of separation of church and state, and sought to retain religious teaching in school.The majority of school-teachers (as well as much of the Russian population) were reportedly still religious believers in the 1920s. [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], the Commisar of Enlightenment, was forced to accept that the school system would have non-religious rather than anti-religious education, due to the shortage of atheist teachers and the fear that such a system would provoke a hostile reaction by the religious masses. Anti-religious education was still seen as an important goal, and beginning in 1925 anti-religious education was introduced to secondary schools, mainly through classes on culture, in addition to setting up branches of the League of the Godless in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers who were believers were forced to conceal their faith and to abstain from visiting churches in order to keep their jobs.

== Revisal of Renovationist Policy and Policies to Non-Orthodox Religions ==

In 1927 the state officially recognized both churches and there were signs that the government saw the renovationists as a threat to their regime.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 55&lt;/ref&gt; The renovationists began to be attacked in the official press as a cunning group that were trying to be friends with the state in order to increase religion.

The press also attacked Jewish and Muslim reformism at the same time.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"&gt;Froese, Paul. "'I am an atheist and a Muslim': Islam, communism, and ideological competition." Journal of Church and State 47.3 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Reformism in religion and cooperation with the state began to be seen as even more dangerous to the system than the traditional religions because they were able to make religion appear less dangerous than it was.

The attack on the Orthodox became more generally an attack against all religions around 1927. Sects that had originally been praised in the official press for their loyalty and hard-work,&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin's Press, New York (1961), pp 288&lt;/ref&gt; despite their religious convictions that were problematic to implementing Communism, began to be demonized in the late 1920s. Even when these other religions tried to reaffirm their compatibility with Marxism and their loyalty to the state, but this was rejected in the official propaganda that increasingly depicted all religious activity as harmful and in contradiction with Communism.

The non-hierarchical nature of some of these sects made them appear even more dangerous to the state, since they could not be as easily controlled as the Orthodox Church that worked according to a strict hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2:Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish Protestants began to be attacked in 1927. Mennonite communities left the USSR in large numbers as a result of the hostility against them; 13000 fled in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978, pp201&lt;/ref&gt; The Dukhobors had been relatively untouched by direct anti-religious up until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978, pp 98&lt;/ref&gt; Adventists had originally been very hostile to the new regime until 1924 when their leadership declared loyalty to the communist state &lt;ref&gt;Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978, pp167&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in policy may have reflected both a growing confidence in the state's capacity to persecute religion such that it now felt safe it broadening the campaign, and it may also have been a result of growing influence of the [[Society of the Godless]] (founded in 1925).

The need to attack some of these sects may also have been produced from a need to justify the liquidation of the religious farm communes, and the fact that some of these communities were filling the void left by the Orthodox church after it was attacked and many parishes were closed.

== Ukrainian Church ==

The Soviets initially supported a Ukrainian nationalistic church movement called the Autocephalists (also known as Lypkivskyites), which broke with Tikhon under the leadership of Metropolitan Lypinski.&lt;ref&gt;Wasyliw, Zenon V. "Orthodox Church divisions in newly independent Ukraine, 1991-1995." ''East European Quarterly'' 41.3 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets supported this split for the same reasons that they supported the Renovationists in that they wanted to weaken the Patriarchal Church.

Beginning as early as 1919 Ukrainian clergy that remained faithful to Tikhon suffered mass reprisals. Autocephalist complicity may have contributed to the killing of Patriarchal Metropolitan Vladimir in Kiev in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Autocephalists encountered the same problem as the Renovationists in that they failed to attract the Ukrainian laity.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917-1983 (Crestwood NY.: St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1984) ch. 2 pp73-76&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Soviets lost interest in them, and began persecuting them in 1924. This persecution became especially harsh in the latter part of the decade once the state began to take manoeuvres to destroy local nationalist movements. The leader of the Autocephalists was imprisoned in 1926, and the church was forced to declare its self-liquidation in 1930. Almost all of its bishops, and most clerical and lay activists, were incarcerated and many were also executed.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917-1983 (Crestwood NY.: St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1984) ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies towards Muslims ==

Lenin in his earlier writings had professed a desire to eliminate Islam, while recognizing the importance of using Muslim support for their cause.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt;

After the revolution, Lenin had promised national autonomy and religious freedom for Muslims.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt; Muslim reformists had emphasized women's role in the mosque. Sultan Galiev had claimed that Islam had stronger 'civic-political motives' than other faiths and should be treated more cautiously by the communists as well as that there should be very limited propaganda against them with no direct attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Antireligious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) pg 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims had their own People's Commisariat for Muslim Affairs established in 1918 under the administration of mullah Nur-Vakhitov (the only clerical person to ever occupy a state office in Soviet History). Both Muslims and Protestants enjoyed relative toleration until 1928–1929 and were allowed activities banned to the Orthodox church (including publications, seminaries, youth work, etc.) &lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Wilhelm, 'Moslems in the Soviet Union, 1948-54', in Richard H. Marshall, Jr (ed.), Aspects of Religion in the Soviet Union, 1917-1967, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971) pp 257&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets offered the Muslims free public education on a massive scale, which had not been available under the tsars.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt; Through this the region of Central Asia, which had formerly been one of the least educated areas of the Russian empire, would become comparable to the rest of the country.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt; The underdeveloped region was also industrialized at an impressive rate.

The Baku Muslim clergy in 1923 praised the Soviet regime for having saved Persia and Turkey from 'predatory England'.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin's Press, New York (1961) pp 410&lt;/ref&gt;

Sultan Galiev was the leader of a group of Central Asian Marxists that attempted to reform Islam to make it more modern as well as to support atheism in the Central Asian states. He was allied with Lenin, who used him as an intermediary between the government and the peoples of Central Asia. Galiev had controversial ideas within the communist party about creating an autonomous communist state in the Muslim areas of Central Asia that would be called Turkestan. The party reacted against this idea of a unified and autonomous Muslim state by choosing to divide Central Asia into different republics (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) in 1924.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt; Many militant Muslims who had originally sided with the Bolsheviks were upset by this turn of events.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

By the mid-1920s Islamic courts became irrelevant to criminal or civil suits, and they were replaced by Soviet courts. Islamic courts were rapidly eliminated and Islamic studies were removed from education, along with other religious teaching throughout the country. About 8000 Islamic schools existed in Central Asia prior to the revolution, and by 1928 all of them had been shut down.&lt;ref name="Froese, Paul 2005"/&gt; The language and alphabet reforms also cut off the people of Central Asia from Arabic literature.

Galiev's ideas would be attacked in the late 1920s and the anti-religious campaign would reject any policy of special treatment for Islam, and would attack it alongside the other religions.

== Activities of Public Institutions ==

The Komsomol and later LMG{{clarify|date=November 2017}} would try to implement the 10th congress resolution by various attacks, parades, theatrical performances, journals, brochures and films. The Komsomol would hold crude blasphemous 'Komsomol Christmases' and 'Komsomol Easters' headed by hooligans dressed as orthodox clergy.&lt;ref name="Dimitry V. Pospielovsky 1987 pg 40"/&gt; The processions would include the burning of icons, religious books, mock images of Christ, the Virgin, etc.

For example, in one Christmas play on December 25, 1923 in the city of Gomel, the Komsomol actors presented a performance of a mock trial of deities in a city theatre; the defendants were stuffed scarecrows representing the deities of different religions as well as their clergy. The judges were proletarian Komsomol, and they handed down the verdict that all deities and clergy must be burned at the stake. The whole mass then poured out into the streets with torches and scarecrows in their hands saying 'Away with the churches, away with the synagogues!" The effigies were then publicly burned in the city square.

They often organized their parades at the same time as celebration of religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter, and they placed them right outside churches that were holding services. This often prevented traditional Orthodox processions to occur at the same time. Appeals were made to bakeries not to bake traditional foods for these feast-days.

The propaganda campaign, however, was a failure and many people remained with their religious convictions. The church held its own public events with some success, and well competed with the anti-religious propaganda during these years.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 41&lt;/ref&gt; In the few instances that numbers were reported, it was stated that more people attended churches then had come to participate in the anti-religious parades. These tactics of the Komsomol were discarded in the mid-1920s, as being too crude and offensive to believers' feelings, but they were later revived in the late 1920s and early 1930s. They were replaced in the mid-1920s by meetings behind closed doors accompanies by anti-religious lectures, poetry readings as well as articles in atheistic journals.

Special conferences on anti-religious propaganda under the auspices of the Central Committee Agitation-Propaganda Department, worked out directives that were implemented on either the local party level or through a public institution from 1926 onwards.

A huge volume of anti-religious articles in Pravda and Komsomol'skaia Pravda were published between 1928-1929.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) pg 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign Relations ==

The British government issued strong verbal chastisements of the Soviet Union for this campaign, which the Soviets responded to by uncompromisingly defensive reactions that narrowed the scope of diplomatic efforts.&lt;ref name="Becker, Winfried 1929"/&gt;

The Vatican at first sought to use the newly re-created Poland's position to promote Catholic interests in Russia, but following the war between the Bolsheviks and Poland, the Vatican turned to Weimar Germany, which played crucial role in diplomatic efforts with regard to Christians in the USSR.&lt;ref name="Becker, Winfried 1929"/&gt;

In 1922 at the Conference of Genoa, wherein the Soviet Union's relations with the foreign community of nations was negotiated, the Vatican demanded that Russia grant complete freedom of conscience to its citizens.&lt;ref name="Becker, Winfried 1929"/&gt; The Soviet government instead pursued a policy of demanding the Vatican to grant it recognition without a concordat or any conditions, and held out the prospect that doing so could result in priests being released from prison.&lt;ref name="Becker, Winfried 1929"/&gt;

The Vatican raised a massive aid campaign for famine relief in Russia, and the Soviet government permitted the Vatican to send its help, under the condition that it did not engage in any proselytization in Russia and that the priests who would come would be dressed and made to appear as though they were secular relief workers.&lt;ref name="Becker, Winfried 1929"/&gt; The Vatican's mission went ahead and delivered food as well as medicine to the Russian population. The American government gave material support to the Vatican's mission.

This mission was cancelled by the Soviet government in 1924 after a breakdown in relations caused by ridiculous Soviet demands on the Vatican, and sharp conflicts arising between the Catholics and the militant atheists.&lt;ref name="Becker, Winfried 1929"/&gt;

The Civic movement '''«Vidsich»''' ({{lang-uk|Відсіч}}, ''Rebuff'') is an active [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] nonviolent social movement created in 2010 as a reaction to the policies of then President of Ukraine [[Victor Yanukovich]] and his "[[Russophilia|pro-Russian]]" tendencies connected with his administration. ''Vidsich'' focuses on a proactive defense of [[human rights]], [[civil liberties]] and [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitutional freedoms]].

''Vidsich'' unites activists who are convinced that people cannot be neutral with regard to the political and social situation in Ukraine. ''Vidsich'''s aim is in creating a strong national movement which can protect the interests of [[Ukrainians]] and Ukraine in general.

== Founding ==
After [[Victor Yanukovich]] won the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential elections]], opposition-supporting citizens, including many who had previously taken part in protests and campaigns, decided to gather and discuss the likely changes to the social and political situation in Ukraine in light of the handover of power.

This conference took place in [[Kiev]] on February 20, 2010. This date is considered to be the Vidsich founding date as the conference led to decisions in favour of further self-organization and activity, with participants sketching out the principles and directions for the future of the nascent movement{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. In attendance were participants of previous opposition movements ("Granite revolution", "[[Ukraine without Kuchma]]" movement, civic committee "Za pravdu!" ("For truth"), civic campaigns "[[PORA|Pora!]]" ("It's time"), etc.), and other opposition-supporting members of Ukrainian society{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

'''Water – Use It Wisely''' is a [[water conservation]] campaign originally launched on behalf of metropolitan [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]] and the Arizona Department of [[Water resources|Water Resources]]. The campaign provides states, cities and citizens with simple tips and tricks to help them save water in their home and throughout the community.

Water - Use It Wisely launched in Arizona in 2000. It has since expanded into a multimillion-dollar campaign with more than 250 public and private water companies Nationwide.

Interested parties are provided with customizable marketing materials that they can tailor to their city or town and use at their disposal.

A study taken the Behavior Research Center pointed to the effectiveness of the effort by the amount of recognition within the community. The study said that after 18 months of the exposure to the campaign, there is 69 percent recognition and calls for conservation assistance jumped from 8,494 in 1999 to 14,649 in 2001.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.unep.fr/scp/communications/ad/details.asp?id=6684260&amp;cat=4 UNEP DTIE SCP Branch: Communications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the latest cities to get involved in the campaign is [[Durham, North Carolina]] where they recently held a Water – Use It Wisely Sales Event encouraging residents to exchange old shower heads for new, free, water-efficient shower heads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/news_briefs/story/2486740/ Durham Plans 'Water - Use it Wisely' Education, Sales Event :: WRAL.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durhamnc.gov/news/NewsDisplay.cfm?vNewsID=1515&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A73258 Water: Use it wisely | Living Green | Independent Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''YIVO''' ([[Yiddish]]: {{lang|yi|ייִוואָ}}, {{IPA-yi|jiˈvɔ|}}), established in 1925 in Wilno in the [[Second Polish Republic]] (now [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]) as the '''''Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut''''' ([[Yiddish]]: {{lang|yi|ייִדישער װיסנשאַפֿטלעכער אינסטיטוט}}, {{IPA-yi|ˈjidiʃɛr ˈvisən.ʃaftlɛχɛr instiˈtut|pron}}, '''Yiddish Scientific Institute'''&lt;ref name="yivo"&gt;[http://www.yivo.org/about yivo]&lt;/ref&gt;), is an organization that preserves, studies, and teaches the cultural history of Jewish life throughout Eastern Europe, Germany, and Russia as well as [[orthography]], [[lexicography]], and other studies related to [[Yiddish]]. (The word ''yidisher'' means both "Yiddish" and "Jewish.") The English name of the organization was changed to the '''Institute for Jewish Research''' after its relocation to New York City, but it is still known mainly by its Yiddish acronym. YIVO is now a member of the [[Center for Jewish History]] and serves as the ''[[de facto]]'' recognized [[List of language regulators|language regulator]] of the Yiddish language.

==Activities==
YIVO preserves manuscripts, rare books, and diaries, and other Yiddish sources.  The YIVO Library in New York contains over 385,000 volumes&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt; dating from as early as the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivo.org/about/ YIVO Institute for Jewish Research | Brief Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yivo.org/index.php?aid=195&amp;tid=75 YIVO Institute for Jewish Research | Overview of Library Collections&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The YIVO archives hold over 24,000,000 documents, photographs, recordings, posters, films, and other artifacts.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt; Together, they comprise the world's largest collection of materials related to the history and culture of Central and [[East European Jewry]] and the [[American Jewish]] immigrant experience.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt;  The archives and library collections Include works in twelve major languages,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.yivo.org/library/ YIVO Institute for Jewish Research | Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]],  [[German language|German]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Judaeo-Spanish]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

YIVO also functions as a publisher of Yiddish-language books and of periodicals including ''YIVO Bleter''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivo.org/about/index.php?tid=75&amp;aid=177 YIVO Institute for Jewish Research | YIVO in the United States&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1931), ''Yedies Fun YIVO'' (founded 1929), and ''Yidishe Shprakh'' (founded 1941). It is also responsible for English-language publications such as the ''YIVO Annual of Jewish Social Studies'' (founded 1946).

==History==
YIVO was initially proposed by Yiddish [[linguistics|linguist]] and writer [[Nochum Shtif]] (1879–1933). He characterized his advocacy of Yiddish as "realistic" [[Zionism]], contrasted to the "visionary" [[Modern Hebrew|Hebraists]] and the "self-hating" [[cultural assimilation|assimilationists]] who adopted [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Polish language|Polish]]. Other key founders included [[philology|philologist]] [[Max Weinreich]] (1894–1969) and historian [[Elias Tcherikower]] (1881–1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liptzin |first=Sol|year=1972|title=A History of Yiddish Literature|publisher=Jonathan David Publishers|location=Middle Village, NY|isbn=0-8246-0124-6|pages=127–130, 133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

YIVO was founded at a [[Berlin]] conference in 1925, but headquartered in Wilno, a city with a large Jewish population that had been annexed to Eastern Poland in 1922. The early YIVO also had branches in [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]] and New York City. Over the next decade, smaller groups arose in many of the other countries with [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] populations.

In YIVO's first decades, Tcherikover headed the historical research section, which also included [[Simon Dubnow]], [[Saul M. Ginsburg]], [[Abraham Menes]], and [[Jacob Shatzky]]. [[Leibush Lehrer]] (1887–1964) headed a section including psychologists and educators [[Abraham Golomb]], [[H. S. Kasdan]], and [[Abraham Aaron Roback]]. [[Jacob Lestschinsky]] (1876–1966) headed a section of economists and demographers [[Ben-Adir]], [[Liebmann Hersch]], and [[Moshe Shalit]]. Weinreich's language and literature section included [[Judah Leib Cahan]], [[Alexander Harkavy]], [[Judah A. Joffe]], [[Zelig Kalmanovich]], [[Shmuel Niger]], [[Noach Pryłucki]], and [[Zalman Reisen]].&lt;ref&gt;Liptzin, 1972, 130, 133&lt;/ref&gt; YIVO also collected and preserved ethnographic materials under the direction of its Ethnographic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=1552569|title=Guide to the Records of the YIVO Ethnographic Committeeundated, 1885-1941RG 1.2|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1925, YIVO's honorary board of trustees or "Curatorium" consisted of [[Simon Dubnow]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Moses Gaster]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Chaim Zhitlowsky]].

From 1934–1940, YIVO operated a graduate training program known as the Aspirantur. Named after [[Zemach Shabad]], YIVO’s chairman, the program held classes and guided students in conducting original research in the field of Jewish studies. Many of the students' projects were sociological in nature (reflecting the involvement of [[Max Weinreich]]) and gathered information on contemporary Jewish life in the Vilna region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=1638048|title=Guide to the Records of the YIVO Aspirantur1934-1940RG 1.3|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] advance into Eastern Europe caused YIVO to move its operations to New York City. A second important center, known as the Fundacion IWO, was established in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwo.org.ar/english/index.html |title= Fundación IWO  |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812123637/http://www.iwo.org.ar/english/index.html |archivedate=12 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All four directors of YIVO's research sections were already in the Americas when the war broke out or were able to make their way there.&lt;ref&gt;Liptzin, 1972, 3, 133&lt;/ref&gt; For their own reasons, the Nazis carried the bulk of YIVO's archives to Berlin, where the papers survived the war intact, and were eventually moved to YIVO in New York City.

The YIVO Library was looted by the Germans and the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], but an organization that called itself "[[Paper Brigade|The Paper Brigade]]" were able to smuggle out many books and preserve them from destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, David E. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982090807 The Book Smugglers: Partisans, Poets, and the Race to Save Jewish Treasures from the Nazis]. 2017.n&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago YIVO Society is a third active center today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoyivo.org|title=Chicago Yivo Society|work=Chicago Yivo Society|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
YIVO has undertaken many major scholarly publication projects, the most recent being ''[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]'', published in March 2008 in cooperation with Yale University Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300119039 |title=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe - Hundert, Gershon David; YIVO Institute for Jewish Research - Yale University Press |publisher=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of editor-in-chief [[Gershon David Hundert]], professor of history and of Jewish Studies at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], this unprecedented reference work systematically represents the history and culture of Eastern European Jews from their first settlement in the region to the present day. More than 1,800 alphabetical entries encompass a vast range of topics including religion, folklore, politics, art, music, theater, language and literature, places, organizations, intellectual movements, and important figures. The two-volume set also features more than 1,000 illustrations and 55 maps. With original contributions from an international team of 450 distinguished scholars, the encyclopedia covers the region between Germany and the [[Ural Mountains]], from which more than 2.5 million Jews emigrated to the United States between 1870 and 1920.

The first complete English-language edition of Max Weinreich's classic book ''[[History of the Yiddish Language]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Yale University Press]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Dr. [[Paul (Hershl) Glasser]], was published in two volumes in 2008.
