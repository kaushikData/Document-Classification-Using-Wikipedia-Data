== Overview ==
A stress, as defined to [[Walter Cannon]] (1871–1945), is any disturbance that imbalances the internal environment of an organism (i.e. their [[homeostasis]]).{{sfn|Lovejoy|Barsyte|2011|p=|pp=3–7}} There are two major types of stressors that cause stress to animals: [[Abiotic stress|abiotic stressors]] and [[Biotic stress|biotic stressors]].&lt;ref&gt;Romero, L. M., &amp; Wingfield, J. C. (2016). Tempests, poxes, predators, and people: stress in wild animals and how they cope. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Abiotic stressors are any [[ecological]], [[geological]], or [[climate]] changes that causes stress to the animal, such as increased temperatures and [[natural disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tempests, Poxes, Predators, and People: Stress in Wild Animals and How They Cope|last1=Romero|first1=L. Michael|last2=Wingfield|first2=John C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-19-971059-1|location=Oxford|pages=625|language=en|ref=harv}}{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotic stressors are living things related complications that causes stress, such as [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance]], [[pollution]], [[infection]], [[Social pressure|social pressures]], and competition.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{sfn|Lovejoy|Barsyte|2011|p=|pp=75–79}} Animals can respond with [[physiological]] responses,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; behavioural responses, psychological responses,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; or physical responses ([[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]]).{{sfn|Lovejoy|Barsyte|2011|p=|pp=3–7}} Canon argued that there are two possible choices that an organism may choose when stress is encountered: fight responses or flight responses.{{sfn|Lovejoy|Barsyte|2011|p=|pp=3–7}}

== Behavioural responses ==
Behavioural responses to stress are evoked from some underlying complex physiological changes that arise consequently from stress.{{sfn|Lovejoy|Barsyte|2011|pp=}} 

=== Impairment of response inhibition and lack of motivation ===
According to a study conducted by Mika and his colleagues, prolonged stress in [[rats]] causes response inhibition. It was evident through their experiment that stressed rats had inhibited premature responses (decreased timing of intervals to food), along with decreased intrinsic [[motivation]] to initiate a response.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They link the decreased motivation to the stress-associated reduction in incentive motivation, as presented by another study conducted by Kleen and his colleagues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Decreased motivation was also seen in a study conducted by Beery and Kaufer, where they explained that stressed rodents are less likely to be motivated to interact with one another.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Change in social behaviours ===
Beery and Kaufer noted that social withdrawal and general reduction in social interaction after an exposure to a stressor are evident in [[rodents]]. They argue that this is due to the underlying physiological changes that the rodent goes through in response to stress. For instance, the changes that occur to the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis]] is directly related to the changes in social behaviour. Social avoidance is another consequence of stress that can be seen in rodents. Rodents are more likely to avoid dominant rats and avoid social interactions amongst each other after the exposure to a stressor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sexual behaviours ===
Sexual interests change in many species when exposed to stressors. For instance, stressed male and female rats express inhibited [[Animal sexual behaviour|mating behaviour]], which is evident through the clear increase in the inhibitory [[hormone]] [[RF-amide peptide|RF-amide]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another study suggests that masculine sexual behaviour in male rats is subject to changes in accordance to the type of stressors that the rats were subjected to.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The female [[zebra finch]]'s mating choice is determined by the stressors that they are exposed to early in life, which remain consistent throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A study about stress effects on female songbird’s response to sexual signal for mating indicated that the response to this specific signal can be impaired if the female is exposed to developmental stress. Behavioural changes as a result from developmental stress impairs neural responses to sexual signals, which reduces mating.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Aggressive behaviours and anti-predator responses ===
Stressed animals would choose to avoid a novel situation rather than confront it. Aggressive behaviour is associated with sex hormones, such as [[testosterone]], and specific brain regions and systems, such as the medial preoptic nucleus, [[prefrontal cortex]]-dependent response inhibition, and [[anterior hypothalamus]]. Stress negatively impacts [[sex hormones]], which results in an imbalance and reduction in aggression related hormones and function. Also, chronic stress results in prefrontal cortex-dependent response inhibition. This results in reduction in aggression, thus promoting anti-predator responses.{{sfn|Lovejoy|Barsyte|2011|p=|pp=173–188}}&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Prolonged stress reduces parental behaviour toward offspring ===
Prolonged stress alters parental behaviour toward offspring and promotes parental neglect. According to a study performed by Tilgar and associates, predation stress alters parents’ behaviours, such as the reduction in provisioning rates, which negatively impacts the offspring’s performance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The hormones [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] are generally responsible for affiliative and [[pair-bonding]] behaviours in many species. Stress alters the level of both hormones, resulting in an abnormal behaviour from parents towards offspring. For instance, levels of oxytocin decrease as a result of prolonged stress, which has been shown to reduce pair-bonding behaviour and increase withdrawal behaviour. [[Prolactin]] is another important hormone that is associated with nurture by parents to offspring, and levels of this hormone can be altered as a result of stress. Reduced levels of prolactin as a result of stress decreases behaviours such as suckling, licking, and [[Egg incubation|brooding]].{{sfn|Lovejoy|Barsyte|2011|p=|pp=173–188}}

== Transgenerational responses==
Behavioural response to stress can be transmitted from parents to offspring. When an offspring observes the expression of behaviour such as fear in response to a stress stimulus, the same response would be elicited in the offspring when the stimulus is presented. Debeik and associates illustrated in rodents that fear is transferred from mother to infant in response to a certain odour stimulus. They further proved that the neural activity, such as the basal amygdala activity of the offspring’s brain, illustrated fear response.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9278">[[File:Berkson.png|thumb|An illustration of Berkson's Paradox. The top graph represents the actual distribution, in which a positive correlation between quality of burgers and fries is observed. However, an individual who does not eat at any location where both are bad observes only the distribution on the bottom graph, which appears to show a negative correlation.]]
'''Berkson's paradox''' also known as '''Berkson's bias''' or '''Berkson's fallacy''' is a result in [[conditional probability]] and [[statistics]] which is [[counterintuitive]] for some people, and hence a [[veridical paradox]]. It is a complicating factor arising in statistical tests of proportions. Specifically, it arises when there is an [[ascertainment bias]] inherent in a study design. The effect is related to the [[explaining away]] phenomenon in [[Bayesian network]]s.

The most common example of Berkson's paradox is a false observation of a ''negative'' correlation between two positive traits, i.e., that members of a population which have some positive trait tend to lack a second. Berkson's paradox occurs when this observation appears true when in reality the two properties are unrelated—or even ''positively'' correlated—because members of the population where both are absent are not equally observed. For example, a person may observe from their experience that fast food joints in their area which serve good burgers tend to serve bad fries and vice versa; but because they would likely not eat anywhere where '''both''' were bad, they fail to allow for the large number of joints in this category which would weaken or even flip the correlation.

It is often described in the fields of [[medical statistics]] or [[biostatistics]], as in the original description of the problem by [[Joseph Berkson]].

==Statement==
The result is that two [[Statistical independence|independent]] events become [[conditional independence|conditionally dependent]] (negatively dependent) given that at least one of them occurs.  Symbolically: 
:If &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; P(A) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; P(B) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = P(A)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P(A|B,A \cup B) &lt; P(A|A \cup B)&lt;/math&gt;.

:* Event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and event &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; may or may not occur
:
:* &lt;math&gt;P(A|B)&lt;/math&gt;, a [[conditional probability]], is the probability of observing event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is true.
:* Explanation: Event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are independent of each other
:
:
:* &lt;math&gt;P(A|B,A \cup B)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of observing event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''or'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;) occurs. This can also be written as &lt;math&gt;P(A|B \cap (A \cup B))&lt;/math&gt;

:* Explanation: The probability of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given both &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' ( &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''or'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ) is smaller than the probability of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given ( &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''or'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; )
:

In other words, given two independent events, if you consider only outcomes where at least one occurs, then they become negatively dependent, as shown above.

===Explanation===
The cause is that the ''conditional'' probability of event ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' occurring, ''given'' that it or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; occurs, is inflated: it is higher than the ''unconditional'' probability, because we have ''excluded'' cases where ''neither'' occur.
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|A \cup B) &gt; P(A)&lt;/math&gt;
:conditional probability inflated relative to unconditional

One can see this in tabular form as follows: the yellow regions are the outcomes where at least one event occurs (and '''~A''' means "not '''A'''").
{|
! !! A !! ~A
|-
!B
|style="background:yellow" | A &amp; B
|style="background:yellow" | ~A &amp; B
|-
!~B
|style="background:yellow" | A &amp; ~B
| ~A &amp; ~B
|}

For instance, if one has a sample of &lt;math&gt;100&lt;/math&gt;, and both ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; occur independently half the time ( &lt;math&gt;P(A) = P(B) = 1 / 2&lt;/math&gt; ), one obtains:
{|
! !! A !! ~A
|-
!B
|style="background:yellow" | 25
|style="background:yellow" | 25
|-
!~B
|style="background:yellow" | 25
| 25
|}

So in &lt;math&gt;75&lt;/math&gt; outcomes, either ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; occurs, of which &lt;math&gt;50&lt;/math&gt; have ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' occurring. By comparing the conditional probability of ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' to the unconditional probability of ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'': 
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|A \cup B) = 50 / 75 = 2 / 3 &gt; P(A) = 50 / 100 = 1 / 2&lt;/math&gt;
We see that the probability of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is higher (&lt;math&gt;2 / 3&lt;/math&gt;) in the subset of outcomes where (''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' ''or'' ''&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;'') occurs, than in the overall population (&lt;math&gt;1 / 2&lt;/math&gt;). On the other hand, the probability of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given both &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and (''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' or ''&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;'') is simply the unconditional probability of ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'', &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;), since ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' is independent of ''&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;''. In the numerical example, we have conditioned on being in the top row:

{|
! !! A !! ~A
|-
!B
|style="background:yellow" | 25
|style="background:yellow" | 25
|-
!~B
| 25
| 25
|}

Here the probability of ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' is &lt;math&gt;25 / 50 = 1 / 2&lt;/math&gt;.

Berkson's paradox arises because the conditional probability of ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' given &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ''within the three-cell subset'' equals the conditional probability in the overall population, but the unconditional probability within the subset is inflated relative to the unconditional probability in the overall population, hence, within the subset, the presence of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; decreases the conditional probability of ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' (back to its overall unconditional probability):

:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B, A \cup B) = P(A|B) = P(A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|A \cup B) &gt; P(A)&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
Berkson's original illustration involves a retrospective study examining a [[risk factor]] for a disease in a [[statistical sample]] from a [[hospital]] in-patient population. Because samples are taken from a hospital in-patient population, rather than from the general public, this can result in a spurious negative association between the disease and the risk factor. For example, if the risk factor is diabetes and the disease is [[cholecystitis]], a hospital patient ''without'' diabetes is ''more'' likely to have cholecystitis than a member of the general population, since the patient must have had some non-diabetes (possibly cholecystitis-causing) reason to enter the hospital in the first place. That result will be obtained regardless of whether there is any association between diabetes and cholecystitis in the general population.

An example presented by [[Jordan Ellenberg]]: Suppose Alex will only date a man if his niceness plus his handsomeness exceeds some threshold. Then nicer men do not have to be as handsome to qualify for Alex's dating pool. So, ''among the men that Alex dates'', Alex may observe that the nicer ones are less handsome on average (and vice versa), even if these traits are uncorrelated in the general population. Note that this does not mean that men in the dating pool compare unfavorably with men in the population.  On the contrary, Alex's selection criterion means that Alex has high standards.  The average nice man that Alex dates is actually more handsome than the average man in the population (since even among nice men, the ugliest portion of the population is skipped).  Berkson's negative correlation is an effect that arises ''within'' the dating pool: the rude men that Alex dates must have been ''even more'' handsome to qualify.

As a quantitative example, suppose a collector has 1000 [[postage stamp]]s, of which 300 are pretty and 100 are rare, with 30 being both pretty and rare. 10% of all his stamps are rare and 10% of his pretty stamps are rare, so prettiness tells nothing about rarity. He puts the 370 stamps which are pretty or rare on display.  Just over 27% of the stamps on display are rare (100/370), but still only 10% of the pretty stamps are rare (and 100% of the 70 not-pretty stamps on display are rare). If an observer only considers stamps on display, she will observe a spurious negative relationship between prettiness and rarity as a result of the [[selection bias]] (that is, not-prettiness strongly indicates rarity in the display, but not in the total collection).{{Reflist}}

A '''breast [[cyst]]''' is a fluid-filled sac within the [[breast]]. One breast can have one or more breast cysts. They are often described as round or oval lumps with distinct edges. In texture, a breast cyst usually feels like a soft grape or a water-filled balloon, but sometimes a breast cyst feels firm.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-cysts/DS01071 |title=Breast cysts |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |date=9 November 2012 |website=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast cysts can be [[pain]]ful and may be worrisome but are generally [[Benign tumor|benign]]. They are most common in pre-menopausal women in their 30s or 40s. They usually disappear after menopause, but may persist or reappear when using hormone therapy.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic.com"/&gt; They are also common in [[adolescent]]s.&lt;ref name="Strasburger2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor C. Strasburger|title=Adolescent Medicine: A Handbook for Primary Care|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HqB94NETbEC&amp;pg=PA228|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-5315-9|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Breast cysts can be part of [[Fibrocystic breast changes|fibrocystic disease]]. The pain and swelling is usually worse in the second half of the [[menstrual cycle]] or during [[pregnancy]].

Treating breast cysts is usually not necessary unless they are painful or cause [[discomfort]]. In most cases, the discomfort they cause may be alleviated by draining the fluid from the cyst. The cysts form as a result of the growth of the [[Mammary gland|milk glands]] and their size may range from smaller than a [[pea]] to larger than a [[Ping pong ball#Ball|ping pong ball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpmc.org/services/women/breast/breast_cyst.html| title=Breast Cysts|accessdate= 2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small cysts cannot be felt during a physical examination, and some large cysts feel like lumps. However, most cysts, regardless of their size cannot be identified during physical exams.

Breast cysts are not to be confused with "milk cysts" ([[galactocele]]s), which usually appear during weaning.

== Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of breast cysts include: 
* A smooth, easily movable round or oval breast lump with distinct edges
* Breast pain or tenderness in the area of the lump
* Increased lump size and tenderness just before menstruation
* Decreased lump size and resolution of other signs and symptoms after menstruation
* Having one or many simple breast cysts does not increase a person's risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-cysts/DS01071/DSECTION=symptoms |title=Breast cysts Symptoms |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |date=9 November 2012 |website=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=2015-05-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726023636/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cysts/basics/symptoms/con-20032264|archivedate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lumps in the breast are often not found during self-examinations or physical exams. However, in some cases they can be felt at touch, especially if they are larger.

Breasts are usually lumpy or [[Nodule (medicine)|nodular]] as a result of the hormonal changes that women go through during their [[menstrual cycle]]. However, new breast lumps should always be referred to a specialist.

Fluid leaking from a cyst, as may happen due to puncture or vigorous compression during mammography, or due to seatbelt injury in the course of an automobile accident, may trigger an aseptic inflammation in the surrounding breast tissue.&lt;ref name="DronkersHendriks2011-p130"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel J. Dronkers|author2=J. H. C. L. Hendriks|title=Practice of Mammography: Pathology - Technique - Interpretation - Adjunct Modalities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijN96qMpC4YC&amp;pg=PA130|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-3-13-160601-3|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis==
[[File:Needle biopsy.jpg|thumb|Needle biopsy being performed to determine nature of lump either fluid-filled cyst or solid tumor]]
The cystic nature of a [[breast lump]] can be confirmed by [[breast ultrasound|ultrasound]] examination, [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspiration]]&lt;ref name="pmid18423318"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daly CP, Bailey JE, Klein KA, Helvie MA |title=Complicated breast cysts on sonography: is aspiration necessary to exclude malignancy? |journal=Acad Radiol |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=610–7 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18423318 |doi=10.1016/j.acra.2007.12.018 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (removal of contents with needle), or [[mammogram]]. Ultrasound can also show if the cyst contains solid nodules, a sign that the lesion may be [[carcinoma in situ|pre-cancerous]] or [[cancer]]ous. Examination by a [[cytopathology|cytopathologist]] of the fluid aspirated from the cyst may also help with this diagnosis. In particular, it should be sent to a laboratory for testing if it is blood-stained.

Commonly, cysts are detected with the help of mammograms. However, the [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]] also play an important role in establishing an accurate [[diagnosis]]. During these tests, the doctor will try to find out as much information as possible regarding the symptoms the patient has experienced, their intensity and duration and the physical examination is performed regularly to check for other abnormalities that may exist within the [[breast]].

As mentioned above, cysts are often undetectable at touch. Therefore, a mammogram can provide valuable and clear images of the breast [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. Generally, if there is any abnormality within the breast tissue, it will be shown on the mammogram. There are two types of mammograms available. One of them is primarily used in screening, and are ordered for patients who do not show any symptoms and these are called screening mammograms. Diagnostic mammograms are used on patients who developed certain symptoms of a breast condition or in patients whose screening mammograms showed abnormalities.

Patients suspected of breast cysts will normally be given a diagnosing mammogram, although they are not suspected of [[cancer]]. This type of mammogram provides the doctor with the possibility of performing a breast ultrasound at the same time and this is the reason why they are often preferred over the screening mammograms. Breast ultrasound is considered the best option when diagnosing breast cysts because it is 95 to 100% accurate, it provides a clear image on the cyst's appearance (simple or complex) and it may also distinguish between solid lumps and fluid-filled cysts, which a mammogram cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpmc.org/services/women/breast/breast_cyst.html| title=What are breast cysts?|accessdate= 2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast ultrasounds are performed with the help of a handheld medical instrument which is placed on the [[skin]], after a special type of fluid has been applied on it. The instruments picks up the echo resulted from the [[Sound waves#Longitudinal and transverse waves|sound waves]] it sends to the breast. These echoes are transmitted to a computer which translates it into a [[picture]].

Breast cysts may remain stable for many years or may resolve spontaneously.&lt;ref name="ChowdhuryGupta2012"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Veena Chowdhury |editor2=Arun Kumar Gupta |editor3=Niranjan Khandelwal |editor4=Anju Garg| display-editors = 3 |title=Diagnostic Radiology: Musculoskeletal and Breast Imaging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcVpWb4DJBoC&amp;pg=PA484|year=2012|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=978-93-5025-883-5|pages=484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most simple cysts are benign and do not require any treatment or further diagnostic workup. Some complex cysts may require further diagnostic measures such as fine needle aspiration or biopsy to exclude breast cancer however the overwhelming majority is of benign nature.&lt;ref name="pmid18423318" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-cysts/DS01071/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis| title=Tests and diagnosis|accessdate= 2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspiration both diagnoses and removes cysts at the same time. That is, cysts will usually resolve on their own after the fluid is drained. Otherwise, if the lump is not a cyst, the fluid aspirated may contain [[blood]] or there may not be fluid at all. Whereas in the first case, the fluid is sent to the [[laboratory]] for further examination, the latter circumstance is a sign that the breast lump is solid. This type of tumor needs to be biopsied in order to determine whether it is [[malignant]] or [[Benign tumor|benign]].
== Prevention ==
The development of breast cysts may be prevented to some degree, according to the majority of the specialists. The recommended measures one is able to take in order to avoid the formation of the cysts include practicing good health and avoiding certain [[medications]], eating a [[balanced diet]], taking necessary [[vitamins]] and [[Dietary supplement|supplements]], getting exercise, and avoiding [[Stress (biology)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breastscysts.com/treatment.php| title=Breast Cyst Treatment Alternatives|accessdate= 2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|date=November 2016}}

Although [[caffeine]] consumption does not have a scientifically proved connection with the process of cyst development, many women claim that their symptoms are relieved if avoiding it. Some doctors recommend reducing the amount of caffeine in one's diet in terms of both [[beverages]] and [[foods]] (such as [[chocolate]]). Also reducing [[salt]] intake may help in alleviating the symptoms of breast cysts, although, again, there is no scientific linkage between these two. Excessive sugar consumption as well as undetected food allergies, such as to gluten or lactose, may also contribute to cyst development.

== Treatment ==
Breast cysts do not require treatment unless a cyst is large and painful or otherwise uncomfortable. In that case, draining the fluid from a breast cyst can ease symptoms.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic.com"/&gt;

Typical treatment involves a [[Needle aspiration biopsy]]. Aspirated cysts often recur (come back); definitive treatment may require [[surgery]].

Draining the [[fluid]] and then waiting for the cyst to resolve is the main treatment applied in these cases. Moreover, if cysts are aspirated and the fluid looks normal, they do not require any other medical attention apart from following-up to make sure they have completely disappeared. [[Hormone therapy]], by the means of [[oral contraceptives]], is sometimes prescribed to reduce their recurrence and to regulate the menstrual cycle of the patient (which is likely to cause them in the first place). [[Danazol]] may also be prescribed to treat this condition and it is usually considered in patients on whom the non-medical treatment fails and the symptoms are intense.

Surgical removal of a breast cyst is necessary only in a few unusual circumstances. If an uncomfortable breast cyst recurs month after month, or if a breast cyst contains blood-tinged fluid and displays other worrisome signs, surgery may be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-cysts/DS01071/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs| title=Treatments and drugs|accessdate= 2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
It is estimated that 7% of women in the western world develop palpable breast cysts.&lt;ref name="dixon-et-al-1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dixon JM, McDonald C, Elton RA, Miller WR |title=Risk of breast cancer in women with palpable breast cysts: a prospective study. Edinburgh Breast Group |journal=Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9166 |pages=1742–5 |date=May 1999  |pmid=10347986 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(98)06408-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is preliminary evidence that women with breast cysts may be at an increased risk of breast cancer, especially at younger ages.&lt;ref name="dixon-et-al-1999"/&gt;

In males, the occurrence of breast cysts is rare&lt;ref name="Sencha2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander N. Sencha|title=Imaging of Male Breast Cancer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bsUBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|date=24 October 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-06050-7|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may (but need not) be an indication of malignancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen L, Chantra PK, Larsen LH, Barton P, Rohitopakarn M, Zhu EQ, Bassett LW |title=Imaging characteristics of malignant lesions of the male breast |journal=Radiographics |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=993–1006 |year=2006 |pmid=16844928 |doi=10.1148/rg.264055116 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cysts and bra support ==
Some women experience [[mastodynia|breast pain]], especially when engaging in vigorous physical activity. A properly fitted [[sports bra]], which compresses or encapsulates breast tissue, is designed to reduce pain caused by exercise.&lt;ref name="greenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenbaum AR, Heslop T, Morris J, Dunn KW |title=An investigation of the suitability of bra fit in women referred for reduction mammaplasty |journal=British Journal of Plastic Surgery |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=230–6 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12859918 |doi=10.1016/S0007-1226(03)00122-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hadi&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hadi MS |title=Sports Brassiere: Is It a Solution for Mastalgia? |journal=The Breast Journal |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=407–409 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11348400 |doi=10.1046/j.1524-4741.2000.20018.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mason BR, Page KA, Fallon K |title=An analysis of movement and discomfort of the female breast during exercise and the effects of breast support in three cases |journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=134–44 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10476977 |doi=10.1016/S1440-2440(99)80193-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chest pain in children''' is the pain felt in the chest by infants, children and adolescents. In most cases the pain is not associated with the heart. It is primarily identified by the observance or report of pain by the infant, child or adolescent by reports of distress by parents or caregivers. Chest pain is not uncommon in children. Many children are seen in ambulatory clinics, emergency departments and hospitals and cardiology clinics. Most often there is a benign cause for the pain for most children. Some have conditions that are serious and possibly life-threatening. Chest pain in pediatric patients requires careful physical examination and a detailed history that would indicate the possibility of a serious cause. Studies of pediatric chest pain are sparse. It has been difficult to create evidence-based guidelines for evaluation.&lt;ref name="Thull-Freedman2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thull-Freedman|first1=Jennifer|title=Evaluation of Chest Pain in the Pediatric Patient|journal=Medical Clinics of North America|volume=94|issue=2|year=2010|pages=327–347|issn=0025-7125|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.01.004|pmid=20380959|postscript=: Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differential diagnosis ==

Chest pain in children is usually evaluated [[cardiology|in cardiology]] [[clinic]]s and in [[emergency department]]s. It can be distressing for parents and children. Pediatric chest pain differs from chest pain in adults because it is most often unrelated to the heart.&lt;ref name="CollinsGriksaitis2013"/&gt; The causes of pediatric chest pain vary according to the organ or tissue in the child. that generates the pain. Generally, muscular skeletal pain, which includes [[costochondritis]], is the reason for the [[emergency department]] visit. Pain that is felt in the chest but is due to muscular skeletal inflammation or an unknown cause and  accounts for 7% and 69% visits. [[Muscular system|Muscular skeletal]] pain is described and defined differently as a diagnosis of exclusion or is documented as being associated with idiopathic causes. [[Asthma]] and other respiratory symptoms are the second most common presentation. Respiratory associated causes compose 13% to 24% of pediatric chest pain symptoms. [[Digestive system|Gastrointestinal]] and [[Psychogenic pain|psychogenic]] symptoms reported by parents and patients occur less than 10% of the time. [[Cardiovascular system|Cardiac]] causes of pediatric chest pain are found infrequently and are not identified more than 5% of the time. Unknown causes, were estimated to account for 20% to 61% of the final diagnosis given. Patients who receive a diagnosis of cardiac disease are more apt to have acute pain. This pain often awakes them from sleep or presents with fever or abnormal observations found during the physical examination. Trauma can also be a cause for chest pain and has been found to be associated with the pain in 5% of the patients.&lt;ref name="Thull-Freedman2010"/&gt;

Children can present with chest pain can have a sudden onset related to vigorous physical activity and coughing. These symptoms seem to be closely associated with asthma.&lt;ref name="Thull-Freedman2010"/&gt; Infection with ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' can cause chest pain.&lt;ref name="YehChu2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeh|first1=Y-H|last2=Chu|first2=P-H|last3=Yeh|first3=C-H|last4=Jan Wu|first4=Y-J|last5=Lee|first5=M-H.|last6=Jung|first6=S-M|last7=Kuo|first7=C-T|title=Haemophilus influenzae pericarditis with tamponade as the initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|volume=58|issue=11|year=2004|pages=1045–1047|issn=1368-5031|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2004.00041.x|pmid=15605669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preliminary ===

Since most causes of pediatric and adolescent chest pain are not considered life-threatening, parents and their children are often reassured that in the majority of cases, the cause of the pain can be determined. If the child or adolescent appears to have some [[dehydration]], and [[intravenous line]] along with administration of [[saline (medicine)|saline]] is done. The clinician may or may not decide to perform [[diagnostic testing]] . This is especially true if the child or adolescent has symptoms of [[chronic pain]]. If an obvious cause of the chest pain is not readily apparent, testing may begin with an [[Radiography|x-ray]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and an [[electrocardiogram]] . This helps the clinician to determine whether or not the cause of pain is related to pulmonary or cardiac causes.&lt;ref name=Mac2011/&gt;

'''A possible preliminary diagnosis may be able to be made based upon consistent symptoms. Some of these are''':
* bruising and chest pain could be from unrecognized trauma
* an abnormal [[abdominal examination]] may be related to a possible gastrointestinal condition with [[referred pain|pain]] referred to the chest.
* abnormal blood pressure measurements suggests to the clinician that dehydration may be present and related to [[cardiac insufficiency]]
* heart sounds such as [[heart murmur]], [[Pericardial friction|rub]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] may indicate to a condition of the heart
* the pain may be related to a chronic illness and may be part of a serious condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus or [[Hodgkin lymphoma]] &lt;ref name="MaharajChang2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maharaj|first1=Satish S|last2=Chang|first2=Simone M|title=Cardiac tamponade as the initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and review of the literature|journal=Pediatric Rheumatology|volume=13|issue=1|year=2015|pages=9|issn=1546-0096|doi=10.1186/s12969-015-0005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[pleural effusion]] and chest pain may be related to [[arthritis]]
* decreased breath sounds or wheezing can be suggestive of asthma or the fatigue of chest wall muscles
* [[subcutaneous emphysema]] can be felt by the clinician indicating a [[pneumomediastinum]] or [[pneumothorax]]
* tenderness of the costochondral junctions or the wall of the chest is suggestive of musculoskeletal or costochondritis pain&lt;ref name=Mac2011/&gt;

== Cardiac associated risks ==

[[File:Brugada syndrome type1 example2 (CardioNetworks ECGpedia).png|thumb|Brugada syndrome type1 example2 (CardioNetworks ECGpedia)| Brugada syndrome]]

'''Preliminary "red flags" are identified that are more likely to suggest chest pain associated with heart. These are''':
* past or current history of congentital or acquired heart disease
* fainting when the child exerts herself or himself
* an [[hypercoagulable state|abnormality]] of blood coagulation that increases the risk of blood clots
* [[hypercholesterolaemia|high levels of cholesterol]] in the blood
* history of:
** the sudden death of a family member under 35 years-old
** the early onset in a family member of [[coronary artery disease]]
** a family history arrhythmias such as [[Brugada syndrome]] or [[Long QT syndrome]]
* an [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|implanted cardioverter defibrillator]]
* having a [[connective tissue]] disease
* a history of cocaine/amphetamine use&lt;ref name="CollinsGriksaitis2013"/&gt;

=== Testing ===

If the diagnosis is unclear, the clinician may order additional testing. These tests may be an electrocardiogram, stress test, pulmonary function test, drug screen and ultrasound.&lt;ref name=Mac2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="BrassHellmich2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brass |first1=Patrick |title=Ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for subclavian or femoral vein catheterization |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |last2=Hellmic |first2=Martin |last3=Kolodziej |first3=Laurentius |last4=Schick |first4=Guido |last5=Smith |first5=Andrew F |year=2015 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011447 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cause of chest pain in children and adolescents.PNG|left|thumb|Graph of the percentages of the causes of chest pain in children and adolescents]]&lt;!-- based upon:http://ep.bmj.com/content/99/4/122.full.pdf+html --&gt;

Chest pain is relatively common in children and adolescents. Unlike adults, the cause is rarely cardiac.&lt;ref name="CollinsGriksaitis2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=S. A.|last2=Griksaitis|first2=M. J.|last3=Legg|first3=J. P.|title=15-minute consultation: A structured approach to the assessment of chest pain in a child|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition|volume=99|issue=4|year=2013|pages=122–126|url=http://ep.bmj.com/content/99/4/122.full.pdf+html|issn=1743-0585|doi=10.1136/archdischild-2013-303919}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Approximately 0.3% to 0.6% of [[emergency department]] department visits by [[pediatric]] patients are for [[chest pain]]. The emergency department visits are consistent throughout the seasons and times of year. The [[median]] age pediatric patients that complain of [[pain]] is from 12 to 13 years old both males and females display the [[symptoms]] and signs at approximately the same [[ratio]].&lt;ref name="CollinsGriksaitis2013"/&gt; Those that do complain of the chest pain usually present with [[acute pain]] that they have experienced for less than one day. This is not universal though. A small study in [[Turkey]] evaluated patients and found that 59% complained of pain that they had had for more than one month in duration. Estimates of 13% to 24% of patients seen in the emergency department are found to have a [[pulmonary]] association with their pain.&lt;ref name="Thull-Freedman2010"/&gt;

== Treatment ==

Children who have chest pain that is related to asthma and exercise stress can be treated with bronchodilator use.&lt;ref name="Thull-Freedman2010"/&gt; If there is obviously distress and difficulty breathing, treatment to provide the support of [[airway]] and breathing is provided. In addition, treatment can include measures to support circulation.&lt;ref name=Mac2011/&gt;

Part of effective treatment includes obtaining a detailed [[medical history]] .&lt;ref name="CollinsGriksaitis2013"/&gt;

'''Clinical clerkships''' encompass a period of [[medical education]] in which students – [[medical student|medical]], [[nursing school|nursing]], [[dentistry school|dental]], or otherwise – practice medicine under the supervision of a health practitioner.&lt;ref name="unm-glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~unmreg/Curriculum/ScheduleTypeGlossary1-9-06.htm |title=Clinical clerkship |work=UNM Course Type Glossary |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical clerkships ==
In [[medical education]], a '''clerkship''', or '''rotation''', refers to the practice of [[medicine]] by [[medical students]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine|D.P.M]]) during their final year(s) of study. Traditionally, the first half of [[medical school]] trains students in the classroom setting, and the second half takes place in a [[teaching hospital]]. Clerkships give students experiences in all parts of the hospital setting, including the [[operating room]], [[emergency department]], and various other departments that allow learning by viewing and doing.

During this training, students are required to rotate through different [[medical specialties]] and treat [[patient]]s under the supervision of [[physicians]].  Students elicit [[medical history|patient histories]], complete [[physical examination]]s, write [[progress note]]s, and assist in [[surgery|surgeries]] and [[medical procedure]]s. The work hours are that of a full-time job, generally similar to that of [[residency (medicine)|residents]]. Students may also be required to work on weekends and to be on call.
For [[medical student]]s, [[Clerkship (medicine)|clerkships]] occur after the [[basic science]] curriculum, and are supervised by medical specialists at a [[teaching hospital]] or [[medical school]]. Typically, certain clerkships are required to obtain the [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree or the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree in the United States (e.g., [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]]), while others are elective (e.g., [[dermatology]], [[pathology]], and [[neurology]]).

The intent of the clinical clerkship is to teach the medical student the fundamentals of clinical examination, evaluation, and care provision, and to enable the student to select the course of further study. During the clinical clerkship, the medical student will interact with real patients much as a [[physician]] does, but their evaluation and recommendations will be reviewed and approved by more senior physicians.

===United States===
In the United States, [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]] typically lasts four years.  Medical students spend the third and fourth years rotating through a combination of required clerkship and electives.  Most medical schools require rotations in [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], [[psychiatry]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[family medicine]], [[radiology]], and [[neurology]].  Some schools additionally require [[emergency medicine]] and [[intensive-care medicine]].  Furthermore, a common graduation requirement is to complete a [[sub-internship]] in a specialty, where the medical student acts as an [[internship (medicine)|intern]].

'''Dude food''' is a recent food trend largely consisting of heavy, meaty dishes that are thought to appeal to men or express masculinity. Dishes such as hamburgers, hotdogs, or barbeque ribs may be considered dude food, though dude food versions of these dishes often distinguish themselves with gourmet ingredients or exaggerated use of amenities like whiskey, barbecue sauce, bacon, or cheese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Development ==
It is thought that the dude food trend originated in the early 2000s,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-5228093/Japanese-dude-food-set-2018s-big-restaurant-trend.html|title=Japanese 'dude' food is set to take the restaurant scene by storm|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; most likely originating in the southern regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Warwick ''et al'', ''Gastronomy, Tourism and the Media'', North York, Ontario, Channel View Publications, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clay"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/9628599/Dude-food-theres-no-beating-street-eats.html|title=Dude food: there's no beating street eats|last=Clay|first=Xanthe|date=2012-10-23|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.noteabley.com/restaurants/japanese-dude-food-trend/|title=Japanese 'Dude' Food Trend Set To Hit Restaurants in 2018|date=2018-02-18|work=Noteabley|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The common theory is that the trend arose from its affinity with the [[food truck]] and [[street food]] movements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://andredang.com/2013/03/10/the-birth-of-a-new-food-brand-man-food/|title=The birth of a new food brand: Man Food|date=2013-03-10|work=Andre Dang PR|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined by their offerings of “comfort and good quality food” made easily accessible.

==  Dude food advertising ==
Dude food advertising and representation tends to follow the traditional [[gender binary]]&lt;ref name="Earth Eats - Indiana Public Media"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/eartheats/emily-contois-dude-food/|title=Marketing Yogurt To Men? Put Abs On The Package|work=Earth Eats - Indiana Public Media|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be analyzed from a visual perspective, that is by taking into account how gender identity is represented in the food field. Thus, food is considered to be part of those products which are “gendered in a practice of normative sexual dualism reinforced and maintained within (…) cultural institutions of marketing communication and market segmentation”.&lt;ref name=Shroeder&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shroeder, E. Jonathan &amp; Zwick, Detlev | title = Mirrors of Masculinity: Representation and Identity in Advertising images | journal = Consumption, Market and Culture | volume = 7 | date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} According to this, advertising plays a significant role in defining this dualism concerning gender identity since its language represents a tool contributing to the creation and reflection of social norms.&lt;ref name=Shroeder/&gt;

According to Katherine Parkin,&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, Katherine, ''Food Is Love: Food Advertising and Gender Roles in Modern America'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the gender binary in advertising took shape in 50s, following the theories of [[Ernest Dichter]]. She believed that “by convincing Americans of a food’s sex and its resultant gendered identity, as well as its sensuality, advertisers could suggest their foods to meet consumers’ need to fulfill their gender roles”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Parkin, Katherine, ''The Sex of Food and Ernest Dichter: The Illusion of Inevitability'', Vol. 5, Issue 2, Advertising &amp; Society Review, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and “Dichter believed that many people categorized the sex of foods. However, his own subscription to a gendered taxonomy of food is evident in his assessment of the findings”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Moreover, it might be important to notice that not only the food product itself but also the related packaging and advertisement are employed as tools to transmit an idea of how men and women should be, stressing again the cultural and social awareness raised by studies on dude food.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://emilycontois.com/2016/11/15/why-my-dude-food-research-matters/|title=Why My Dude Food Research Matters|date=2016-11-15|work=Emily Contois|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of advertising in England is the Ginsters advertise&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=M&amp;C Saatchi London|title=Ginsters, Feed the Man, The Joke, M&amp;C Saatchi London|date=2014-06-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuEz6UYZvvk|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a beef pasty accompanied by the hashtag #FeedTheMan, in which there is a man that tells a joke in front of his girlfriend’s bosses; but he is talking about Ginsters, thus she has nothing to worry about, because it’s a type of food that makes everyone agree.

In accordance with Lynsey Atkin, advertisement agencies and brands have honed in on a crisis of masculinity in our society and “in times of insecurity, brands can repurpose themselves as champions of the everyman, facilitators of the macho clean, however small. In other words, promising gender-traditional-prowess, like being able to kick a football in a straight line, could be the media-constructed equivalent of helping you grow a beard. Some stereotypes, like male dominance in social situations, are invoked as a nostalgia (a dream of the football-playing and beard-growing of days gone by)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/d75nvk/food-advertising-is-still-feeding-gender-stereotypes|title=Food Advertising Is Still Feeding Gender Stereotypes|date=2014-04-23|work=Munchies|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, it is hard to find an advertisement of men eating chocolate, otherwise in Canada there is the advertise of chocolate bar Mr. Big&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0GiULfGnoc|title=Mr Big Chocolate Bar When You're This Big They Call You Mister (1991)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by Cadbury, where the snack is oversexualized and it is associated to virility, in fact the slogan is “When you're this big they call you Mister”.

Furthermore, specific events and moving tours were organised in Canada and promoted in order to provide dude food dishes and a certain atmosphere; they were born specifically to satisfy men's tastes, whereas women were welcomed but only as supporters of their men.&lt;ref name="offtheeatentracktours.ca"/&gt;

== Gender and food ==
According to the feminist scholar [[Judith Butler]], [[gender]] is “…an identity tenuously constituted in time (…) instituted through a stylized repetition of acts”.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite journal | author = Butler, Judith | title = Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory | journal = Theatre Journal | volume = 40 | date = 1988 | page = 519}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, “...performing food labor is intertwined with performing gender”.&lt;ref name=Julier&gt;{{cite journal | author = Julier, Alice &amp; Lindenfeld, Laura | title = Mapping Men onto the Menu: Masculinities and Food | journal = Food and Foodways | volume = 13 | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}  In particular, several studies focus on how certain foods, drinks, or ways of eating and drinking are interpreted as “masculine”; a crucial example of this attributed masculinity to certain types of food is represented by dude food.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Significantly, scholars have been suggesting that this masculinisation of food practices might allegedly be the expression of masculine privilege which “manifests around food and cooking in a myriad of ways”.&lt;ref name=Julier/&gt;{{rp|9}} Dude food has been extremely crucial as it has raise the interest of the scholarly world as to why the Western cultural and social system defines gender by looking at people's food choices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Barbecue sausages.jpg|thumb|Barbecuing is sometimes seen as an activity through which men might enhance their masculinity]]
[[Meat]] is considered to be one of the most important ingredients of “manly” food, since meat conveys meaning of “...sexuality and virility…”.&lt;ref name=Nath&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1440783310386828| title = Gendered fare?| journal = Journal of Sociology| volume = 47| issue = 3| pages = 261–278| year = 2011| last1 = Nath| first1 = Jemál}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if masculinity is related to meat, a mostly vegetarian diet is inevitably interpreted as feminine. Not only the consumption of meat, but also the various ways in which it is cooked are associated with a specific idea of masculinity. For instance, barbecued meat and its consumption have always been seen as a rather masculine activity.&lt;ref name=Nath/&gt; There is an increase growing literature demonstrating how types of unhealthy food are interpreted to be masculine due to the presence, in our belief system, of cultural stereotypes according to which women tend to eat more healthily than men.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4021781/food-marketing-gender/|title=Here's Why Salads Feel Feminine and Nachos Seem Manly|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This differentiation could also be attributed to the packaging of food products.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Earth Eats - Indiana Public Media"/&gt; Strong stereotypes are deeply embedded also in people’s buying preferences. The cultural basis of these stereotypes regarding food choices and gender perception is the desire from part of our social system to protect and maintain its hegemonic masculine norms.&lt;ref name=Nath/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gough, Brendan, ''“Real men don’t diet”: An analysis of contemporary newspaper representation of men, food and health'' in “Social Science &amp; Medicine” vol. 64, University of Leeds, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The interest toward dude food is leading people to re-think about the reasons behind food choices and why it should be "...enjoyed. With friends and family- male or female"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/in-defense-of-dude-food|title=In Defense Of Dude Food|date=2012-09-19|work=Men's Health|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Female sexual arousal disorder''' ('''FSAD''') is a disorder characterized by a persistent or recurrent inability to attain [[sexual arousal]] or to maintain arousal until the completion of a [[human sexual behaviour|sexual activity]]. The diagnosis can also refer to an inadequate [[vaginal lubrication|lubrication]]-swelling response normally present during arousal and sexual activity. The condition should be distinguished from a general loss of interest in sexual activity and from other [[sexual dysfunction]]s, such as the orgasmic disorder ([[anorgasmia]]) and [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]], which is characterized as a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity for some period of time.

Although female sexual dysfunction is currently a contested diagnostic, it has become more common in recent years to use [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]]-based drugs off-label to treat FSAD. While drug companies are technically not allowed to market these drugs for off-label uses, sharing the information with doctors at [[Continuing Medical Education|CME]] conferences has proved to be an effective way to navigate around the [[FDA]] approval process.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, H. (2006). "The 'Pinking' Of Viagra Culture: Drug Industry Efforts To Create And Repackage Sex Drugs For Women". ''Sexualities'', 363–378.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
A number of studies have explored the factors that contribute to female sexual arousal disorder and female orgasmic disorder. These factors include both psychological and physical factors. Psychologically, possible causes of the disorder include the impact of childhood and adolescence experiences and current events – both within the individual and within the current relationship.

===Individual factors ===
There has been little investigation of the impact of individual factors on female sexual dysfunction. Such factors include stress, levels of fatigue, gender identity, health, and other individual attributes and experiences, such as dysfunctional sexual beliefs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00224490609552300 |title=Dysfunctional sexual beliefs as vulnerability factors for sexual dysfunction |year=2006 |last1=Nobre |first1=Pedro J. |last2=Pinto‐Gouveia |first2=José |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=43 |pages=68–75 |pmid=16817069 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may affect sexual desire or response. Over exposure to [[pornography]]-style media is also thought to lead to poor [[body image]], [[self-consciousness]] and lowered [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serina|first1=Sandhu|title=One in three women watch porn at least once a week, survey finds|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/one-in-three-women-watch-porn-at-least-once-a-week-survey-finds-a6702476.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation|date=August 2018}} An individual's sexual activity is disrupted by overwhelming emotional distress resulting in inability to attain sexual pleasure. Sexual dysfunction can also occur secondary to major psychiatric disorders, including [[major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref name="APP textbook"&gt;Hales E and Yudofsky JA, eds, ''The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry'', Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship factors===
A substantial body of research has explored the role of interpersonal factors in female sexual dysfunction, particularly in relation to orgasmic response. These studies have largely focused on the impact of the quality of the relationship on the sexual functioning of the partners. Some studies have evaluated the role of specific relationship variables, whereas others have examined overall relationship satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00926230701636163 |title=Female Sexual Function and Its Associations with Number of Children, Pregnancy, and Relationship Satisfaction |year=2008 |last1=Witting |first1=Katarina |last2=Santtila |first2=Pekka |last3=Alanko |first3=Katarina |last4=Harlaar |first4=Nicole |last5=Jern |first5=Patrick |last6=Johansson |first6=Ada |last7=Pahlen |first7=Bettina von der|last8=Varjonen |first8=Markus |last9=Ålgars |first9=Monica |journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=89–106 |pmid=18224545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have explored events, while others have focused on attitudes as an empirical measure of relationship functioning. Subject populations have varied from distressed couples to sexually dysfunctional clients to those in satisfied relationships.

===Social context===
In addition to past experience and personal psychology, social context plays a factor:
:Human sexual behavior also varies with hormonal state, social context, and cultural conventions. [[Ovarian hormones]] influence female sexual desire, but the specific sexual behaviors engaged in are affected by perceived pregnancy risk, suggesting that cognition plays an important role in human sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1696 |title=Sex and Context: Hormones and Primate Sexual Motivation |year=2001 |last1=Wallen |first1=Kim |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=339–57 |pmid=11534996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical factors===
Estimates of the percentage of female sexual dysfunction attributable to physical factors have ranged from 30% to 80%. The disorders most likely to result in sexual dysfunction are those that lead to problems in circulatory or neurological function. These factors have been more extensively explored in men than in women. Physical etiologies such as neurological and cardiovascular illnesses have been directly implicated in both premature and retarded ejaculation as well as in erectile disorder,&lt;ref name=Hawton1993&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hawton |first1=K |title=Sex Therapy |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the contribution of physiological factors to female sexual dysfunction is not so clear. However, recent literature does suggest that there may be an impairment in the arousal phase among diabetic women. Given that diabetic women show a significant variability in their response to this medical disorder, it is not surprising that the disease’s influence on arousal is also highly variable. In fact, the lack of a clear association between medical disorders and sexual functioning suggests that psychological factors play a significant part in the impact of these disorders on sexual functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Melman et al. 1988{{vs|need more bibliographic info|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Maravilla, Professor of Radiology and Neurological Surgery and Director of MRI Research Laboratory at the University of Washington, Seattle, presented research findings based on neuro-imaging of women's sexual function. In a small pilot study of four women with female sexual arousal disorder, Maravilla reported there was less brain activation seen in this group, including very little activation in the [[amygdala]]. These women also showed increased activation in the temporal areas, in contrast to women without sexual difficulties, who showed deactivation in similar areas. This may suggest an increased level of [[sexual inhibition|inhibition]] with an arousal stimulus in this small group of women with FSAD.

Several types of medications, including [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), can cause sexual dysfunction and in the case of SSRI and SNRI, these dysfunctions may become permanent after the end of the treatment.&lt;ref name="APP textbook"/&gt;

===Interplay of causes===
Kaplan proposed that sexual dysfunction was based on intrapsychic, interpersonal, and behavioural levels.&lt;ref name="APP textbook"/&gt; Four factors were identified that could have a role in the development of sexual dysfunction: 1) lack of correct information regarding sexual and social interaction, 2) unconscious [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[anxiety]] regarding sex, 3) [[performance anxiety]], and 4) failure to communicate between the partners.&lt;ref name="APP textbook"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

=== DSM-5 ===
The [[DSM-5]] lists the diagnostic criteria as including a minimum of three of the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington, VA|isbn=978-0-89042-554-1|page=433|edition=Fifth}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

# Little interest in sex
# Few thoughts related to sex
# Decreased start and rejecting of sex
# Little pleasure during sex most of the time
# Decreased interest in sex even when exposed to erotic stimuli
# Little genital sensations during sex most of the time

=== DSM-IV ===
The [[DSM-IV]] (American Psychiatric Association 1994) diagnostic criteria were:

# persistent or recurrent inability to attain, or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement,&lt;ref&gt;''[[DSM-IV]]'', American Psychiatric Association 1994, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;
# the disturbance causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty, and
# the sexual dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder (except another sexual dysfunction) and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.

Marita P. McCabe noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;Difficulties arise with this definition in terms of what constitutes an adequate lubrication-swelling response. There is no "gold standard" regarding the length of time it should take to become aroused or the level of arousal that should be achieved. These responses may vary from one woman to another and are dependent on a range of factors, which include her general mood when sexual stimulation commences and her partner’s skill in stimulating her. There may also be differences in physiological and subjective levels of arousal, with some women reporting no feelings of sexual arousal despite evidence of vaginal vasocongestion and others reporting arousal in the absence of such evidence. The expectations and past experiences of clinicians and clients may also lead them to classify the same symptoms as female sexual arousal disorder in one woman but not in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.am/sex/more/female_sexual_dysfunction/ |title=Female Sexual Arousal Disorder and Female Orgasmic Disorder |first=Marita P. |last=McCabe |date=29 May 2006 |publisher=Armenian Medical Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Subtypes===
There are several subtypes of female sexual arousal disorders. They may indicate onset: lifelong (since birth) or acquired. They may be based on context: they may occur in all situations (generalized) or be situation-specific (situational). For example, the disorder may occur with a spouse but not with a different partner.

The length of time the disorder has existed and the extent to which it is partner- or situation-specific, as opposed to occurring in all situations, may be the result of different causative factors and may influence the treatment for the disorder. It may be due to psychological factors or a combination of factors.

==Treatment==
The FDA has approved one medication for the treatment of disorders of female libido, [[flibanserin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mullard|first=Asher|date= 1 October 2015|title=FDA approves female sexual dysfunction drug|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v14/n10/full/nrd4757.html|journal=[[Nature Reviews Drug Discovery]]|doi=10.1038/nrd4757|access-date=3 October 2015|volume=14|pages=669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{update|DSM-V update in 2013|date=December 2015}}
One problem with the current definition in the DSM-IV &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington DC |year=2000 |edition=4th }}&lt;/ref&gt; is that subjective arousal is not included. There is often no correlation between women's subjective and physiological arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chivers M. L. | year = 2005 | title = Leading comment: A brief review and discussion of sex differences in the specificity of sexual arousal | url = | journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 377–390 | doi=10.1080/14681990500238802}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, recently, FSAD has been divided up into sub-types: 
* Genital Arousal Disorder
* Subjective Sexual Arousal Disorder
* Combined Genital and Subjective Arousal Disorder
The third sub-type is the most common in clinical settings &lt;ref&gt;Brotto, L. A., Basson, R., &amp; Gorzalka, B. B. "Psychophysiological assessment in premenopausal sexual arousal disorder", ''The Journal of Sexual Medicine'', 1(3), 266–277, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest criticisms for female sexual arousal disorder is whether it is an actual disorder or an idea put forth by pharmaceutical companies in order to step into a potentially billion dollar industry; see ''[[Orgasm Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite film|title=Orgasm Inc. |url=http://orgasminc.org/ |author=Liz Canner |date=2009 |access-date=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern that this ignores those women who have experienced a significant loss of libido following hysterectomy.

The only mention of female sexual arousal disorder in a peer-reviewed medical journal indicated that 43% of women suffer from FSD, however the survey turned out to not be a rigorous study. Of the handful of questions, if any respondent answered yes at any time, they were classified as having FSD. Here are the questions asked that respondents could only choose a response of Yes or No:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Laureano |first=Bianca |title=How the Pharmaceutical Industry is Monetizing the Female Orgasm |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/150510/how_the_pharmaceutical_industry_is_monetizing_the_female_orgasm?page=entire |agency=RH Reality Check |publisher=[[AlterNet]] |accessdate=15 December 2011 |date=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lacked interest in having sex
* Were unable to come to climax
* Came to climax too quickly
* Experienced physical pain during intercourse
* Did not find sex pleasurable even if sex was not painful
* Felt anxious just before having sex
*Had trouble lubricating

Furthermore, the author [[Edward O. Laumann]] turned out to have financial ties to [[Pfizer]], creator of [[Viagra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10517424 |year=1999 |last1=Cohen |first1=Paul G. |title=Sexual dysfunction in the United States |volume=282 |issue=13 |pages=1229 |journal=JAMA |doi=10.1001/jama.282.13.1229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism, for example, is that "the meaningful benefits of experimental drugs for women's sexual difficulties are questionable, and the financial conflicts of interest of experts who endorse the notion of a highly prevalent medical condition are extensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7484.192 |title=The marketing of a disease: Female sexual dysfunction |year=2005 |last1=Moynihan |first1=R. |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7484 |pages=192–4 |pmid=15661785 |pmc=545000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of bioethics and sociology Jennifer R. Fishman argues that the categorization of female sexual dysfunction as a treatable disease has only been made possible through the input of academic clinical researchers. Through ethnographic research, she believes she has shown how academic clinical researchers have provided the scientific research needed by pharmaceutical companies to bio-medicalize female sexual dysfunction and consequently identify a market of consumers for it. She questions the professional ethics of this exchange network between researchers and pharmaceutical companies, as the clinical research trials are funded by pharmaceutical companies and researchers are given considerable financial rewards for their work. She argues that the conferences where definition of the disease and diagnostic criteria are defined and research is presented to clinicians are also ethically ambiguous, as they are also funded by pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref name="Manufacturing Desire: The Commodification of Female Sexual Dysfunction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishman|first=Jennifer R.|title=Manufacturing Desire: The Commodification of Female Sexual Dysfunction|journal=Social Studies of Science|year=2004|volume=34|issue=2|pages=187–218|pmid=15295831|doi=10.1177/0306312704043028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also worth noting that female sexual arousal disorder is rarely a solitary diagnosis. Due to its high rates of [[comorbidity]] with [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]], a new disorder is being proposed for the DSM-5: Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder.{{update inline|date=December 2015}} The diagnostic criterion "persistent or recurrent" symptoms is also problematic in that it is vague and could lead to too much reliance on clinical judgment.&lt;ref name="Dois"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9535-1 |title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Female Sexual Arousal Disorder |year=2009 |last1=Graham |first1=Cynthia A. |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=240–55 |pmid=19777335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heather Hartely of Portland State University, Oregon is critical of the shift from female sexual dysfunction being framed as an arousal problem to a desire problem. In her article, "The 'Pinking' of Viagra Culture", she states that the change from female sexual arousal disorder to hypoactive sexual desire disorder is indicative of "disease mongering" tactics by the drug industry through an effort to match up a drug to some subcomponent of the DSM classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartley|first=Heather|title=The 'Pinking' of Viagra Culture|journal=Sexualities|date=2006|volume=9|issue=3|pages=363–378|doi=10.1177/1363460706065058|url=http://sex.sagepub.com|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Leonore Tiefer]] of NYU School of Medicine voiced concerns that the success of Viagra, in combination with feminist rhetoric, were being used as a means of fast-tracking public acceptance of pharmaceutical treatment of female sexual arousal disorder. The justification behind this, she says, is that "the branding of Viagra has succeeded so thoroughly in rationalizing the idea of sexual correction and enhancement through pills that it seems inevitable and ''only fair'' that such a product be made available for women," giving a dangerous appeal to "nonapproved drugs though off-label prescribing". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiefer|first=Leonore|title=The Viagra Phenomenon|journal=Sexualities|date=2006|volume=9|issue=3|pages=273–294|doi=10.1177/1363460706065049|url=http://sex.sagepub.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural variation could be overlooked because there are no specific duration or severity criteria for diagnosis. Therefore, the duration criterion of symptoms lasting at least 6 months and the severity criterion of symptoms during 75% or more of sexual encounters have been proposed.&lt;ref name="Dois" /&gt;

Diagnosis based on insufficient vaginal lubrication/swelling is problematic because women’s genital arousal may be an "automatic response" that they are unaware of. Furthermore, there is little evidence that women with sexual arousal disorder have a poor lubrication/swelling response.&lt;ref name="Dois" /&gt;

A '''food group''' is a collection of [[food]]s that share similar [[nutrition]]al properties or [[biological classification]]s. [[List of nutrition guides|Nutrition guides]] typically divide foods into food groups and [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|recommend]] daily [[serving size|servings]] of each group for a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. In the United States for instance, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] has described food as being in from 4 to 11 different groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nestle, Marion|authorlink=Marion Nestle|title=Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health|year=2013|origyear=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27596-6|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The most common food groups==
* '''[[Dairy product|Dairy]]''', also called '''milk products''' and sometimes categorized with [[:Category:Milk substitutes|milk alternatives]] or meat, is typically a smaller category in [[nutrition guides]],&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating - Enjoy a Variety of Foods Every Day |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |work=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing |accessdate=3 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033600/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite web|title=The eatwell plate|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx|work=National Health Service|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA's MyPlate|url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/|work=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UK" /&gt; Examples of dairy products include milk, butter, ghee, [[yogurt]], [[cheese]], cream and ice cream. The categorization of dairy as a food group with recommended daily servings has been criticized by, for example, the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] who point out that "research has shown little benefit, and considerable potential for harm, of such high dairy intakes. Moderate consumption of milk or other dairy products—one to two servings a day—is fine, and likely has some benefits for children. But it’s not essential for adults, for a host of reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate-questions/|title=Healthy Eating Plate &amp; Healthy Eating Pyramid|date=18 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fruits]]''', sometimes categorized with vegetables, include [[apple]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[banana]]s, [[berry|berries]] and [[lemon]]s. Fruits contain carbohydrates, mostly in the form of sugar as well as important vitamins and minerals.
* '''[[Cereal|Grains, beans and legumes]]''', sometimes categorized as '''cereals''', is often the largest category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[oat]]s, [[barley]], [[bread]] and [[pasta]]. An example of beans would be baked beans and soy beans, while an example of legumes would be lentils and chickpeas. Grains are a good source of [[starch]] and are often categorized with other starchy food such as potatoes. 
* '''[[Meat]]''', sometimes labelled '''[[protein]]''' and occasionally inclusive of [[legume]]s and beans, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[meat analogue]]s and/or dairy, is typically a medium- to smaller-sized category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]], [[turkey (food)|turkey]], [[pork]] and [[beef]].
* '''[[confectionery|Confections]]''', also called '''[[confectionery|sugary foods]]''' and sometimes categorized with [[fat]]s and [[oils]], is typically a very small category in nutrition guides, if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt; Examples include [[candy]], [[soft drinks]], and chocolate. 
* '''[[Vegetable]]s''', sometimes categorized with fruit and occasionally inclusive of [[legumes]], is typically a large category second only to [[Food grain|grain]]s, or sometimes equal or superior to grains, in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[spinach]], [[carrot]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[broccoli]].
* '''[[Drinking water|Water]]''' is treated in very different ways by different food guides. Some exclude the category,&lt;ref name=US/&gt; others list it separately from other food groups,&lt;ref name=AU/&gt; and yet others make it the center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eine runde Sache: Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=219|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; or foundation&lt;ref name=UM&gt;{{cite web|title=Healing Foods Pyramid™ 2010|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid/|work=University of Michigan Health System|accessdate=3 June 2011}}{{deadlink|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the guide. Water is sometimes categorized with [[tea]], [[fruit juice]], [[vegetable juice]] and even [[soup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations for healthy, tasty eating and drinking for adults|url=http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fileadmin/pdf/100-ernaehrungsthemen/10-gesundes_essen_trinken/Food_Pyramid.pdf|work=Swiss Society for Nutrition|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is typically recommended in plentiful amounts.

==Uncommon food groups==
The number of "common" food groups varies depending on who is defining them. [[Canada's Food Guide]], which has been in continual publication since 1942 and is the second most requested government document (after the income tax form) in [[Canada]], recognizes only four official food groups, listing the remainder of foods as "another". Some of these "others" include:
* '''[[Alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]]''' is listed apart from other food groups and recommended only for certain people in moderation by [[Harvard School of Public Health|Harvard]]'s Healthy Eating Pyramid and the [[University of Michigan]]'s Healing Foods Pyramid,&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Eating Pyramid|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/|work=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=23 August 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UM"/&gt; while [[Italy]]'s food pyramid includes a half-serving of wine and beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piramide Alimentare Italiana|url=http://www.piramidealimentare.it/|work=Istituto di Scienza dell'Alimentazione|publisher=Università di Roma|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Freaks, Geeks, and Asperger Syndrome: A User Guide to Adolescence''''' is a non-fiction book about how it is like having [[Asperger Syndrome]]. The book was written by the then 13-year-old [[Luke Jackson (author)|Luke Jackson]] who has Asperger Syndrome himself. Luke wrote the book because he thought that there were not enough useful things on the internet about the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/4614001.stm |title=Bilingual book tackles Asperger's |date=6 June 2005 |work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The point of the book is to explain that it is fine to be different. Luke goes through the problems that people with Asperger Syndrome face such as trouble reading facial expressions and body language. Luke Jackson lives in a family with three brothers and three sisters and his siblings have related difficulties as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=89362 |title=Book Reviews: Personal Accounts: Asperger Syndrome  |author=Kamlyn Haynes, Jeffrey Geller |date=1 November 2004 |work=Psychiatric Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
David Worling of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry said that the book is filled with valuable information and is useful to have in a clinical library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Freaks, Geeks, &amp; Asperger Syndrome: A User Guide to Adolescence |author=David Worling |year=2005 |work= Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |pmc=2542912 |page=85 |volume=14 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received first place in [[Times Educational Supplement]] awards in 2003 for special educational needs books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=385803 |title=Everyone is good at something |author=Geraldine Brennan |date=24 October 2003 |work=[[TES-Newspaper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''functional food''' is a [[food]] given an additional [[wikt:function|function]] (often one related to health-promotion or disease prevention) by adding new ingredients or more of existing ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1171305207040&amp;lang=e What are Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals?

The term was first used in [[Japan]] in the 1980s where there is a government approval process for functional foods called Foods for Specified Health Use (FOSHU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FOSHU, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Japan | agency= Government of Japan | url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/topics/foodsafety/fhc/02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
The functional food industry, consisting of food, beverage and supplement sectors, is one of the several areas of the [[food industry]] that is experiencing fast growth in recent years.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, W. "Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods'' August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the global market of functional food industry will reach 176.7 billion in 2013 with a [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of 7.4%. Specifically, the functional food sector will experience 6.9% CAGR, the supplement sector will rise by 3.8% and the functional beverage sector will be the fastest growing segment with 10.8% CAGR.&lt;ref name="roberts"/&gt; This kind of growth is fueled not only by industrial innovation and development of new products that satisfy the demand of [[health industry|health]] conscious [[consumer]]s, but also by [[health claim]]s covering a wide range of health issues.&lt;ref name="scholan"&gt;Scholan, I. "Functional Beverages-- where next? Innovation in functional beverages market is set to continue." ''International Food Ingredients'' December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, consumer [[skepticism]] persists mainly because benefits associated with consuming the products may be difficult to detect.&lt;ref name="scholan"/&gt; Strict examination of some of the functional food claims may discourage some companies from launching their products.&lt;ref name="scholan"/&gt;

{{main|Deepwater Horizon oil spill}}
The ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill was the world's largest accidental marine oil spill.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Moss, [http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/the-13-largest-oil-spills-in-history "The 13 largest oil spills in history"], Mother Nature Network, 16 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It began on 20 April 2010 after an explosion on the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'', a drilling rig leased by BP to drill an exploratory well.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bea, [http://ccrm.berkeley.edu/pdfs_papers/bea_pdfs/DHSGFinalReport-March2011-tag.pdf "Final report on the Investigation of the Macondo Well Blowout"], ''Deepwater Horizon'' Study Group, Center for Catastrophic Risk Management, University of California, Berkeley, 1 March 2011, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Between then and 15 July, when the well was capped, over four million barrels of oil (around 170 million US gallons, or 643 million litres) spilled from a depth of 5,000&amp;nbsp;ft (1,500 m) into the Gulf of Mexico, 48 miles off the coast of Louisiana.&lt;ref name=UnifiedCommand&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100804012234/http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com/go/doc/2931/840475/ "U.S. Scientific Teams Refine Estimates of Oil Flow from BP's Well Prior to Capping"], [[Unified Command (Deepwater Horizon oil spill)|Deepwater Horizon Unified Command]], 2 August 2010: "Overall, the scientific teams estimate that approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil have been released from the well. Not all of this oil and gas flowed into the ocean; containment activities conducted by BP under U.S. direction captured approximately 800,000 barrels of oil prior to the capping of the well."
*Harry R. Weber, [http://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/BP-seeks-to-spread-blame-as-first-phase-of-spill-4443183.php "BP seeks to spread blame as first phase of spill trial ends"], ''Houston Chronicle'', 17 April 2013: "The government once estimated the spill was 4.9 million barrels, but agreed this year to lower that to 4.1 million barrels, about 172 million gallons. BP has disputed the government estimates."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the GuLF Study, the duration of the spill, the area affected, the proximity to local communities, and the number of people involved in the clean-up, were all greater than in any other spill that has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/epi/studies/gulfstudy/ "The GuLF STUDY"], National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, accessed 9 July 2013: "The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico differed from previous spill in that the leak was at the ocean floor rather than on the surface. However, the area covered, the proximity to populated communities, the number of potentially exposed workers and community members, and the duration of the spill were far greater than any previously studied oil spills."&lt;/ref&gt; Around 180 miles of shoreline were "heavily to moderately oiled," according to a US government report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/foia/docs/dwh/fosc_dwh_report.pdf "On Scene Coordinator Report: Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill"], submitted to the National Response Team, September 2011, pp. v–vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional safety concerns were raised by the use of roughly nine million litres of [[oil dispersants]], [[Corexit]] 9527 and 9500, during the clean-up operation. It was the largest known application of such dispersants to date,&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Gaskill, [http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110419/full/news.2011.246.html "How Much Damage Did the ''Deepwater Horizon'' Spill Do to the Gulf of Mexico?"], ''Nature'', 19 April 2011: "BP added around 9 million litres of chemical dispersants to the oil, roughly a third of it at depth."
*J. Wise and J.P. Wise Sr., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22435326 "A review of the toxicity of chemical dispersants"], ''Reviews on Environmental Health'', 26(4), 2011, pp. 281–300: "Chemical dispersants used for the cleanup and containment of crude [[oil toxicity]] became a major concern after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil crisis in the Gulf of Mexico. During the crisis, millions of liters of chemical dispersants (Corexit 9527 and 9500) were used – the largest known application of dispersants in the field."&lt;/ref&gt; and the first use of dispersants at that depth.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Aileen. "BP ''Deepwater Horizon'' Oil Spill," in S. George Philander (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Global Warming and Climate Change'', Second Edition, SAGE, 2012 (pp. 146–147), [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8VE92tDqEEC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]: "The spill was the first to release a huge amount of oil at a depth of nearly 5,000 ft (1,500 m), and the first to use dispersants at this depth."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study details==
===Background and funding===
Following the spill, there were anecdotal reports of health problems among workers involved in the clean-up, who complained of a variety of issues, including flu-like symptoms, rashes and stress. The Institute of Medicine held a workshop in June 2010, "Assessing the Human Health Effects of the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill," and recommended that the United States government set up a study.&lt;ref name=Reardon&gt;Sara Reardon, [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6022/1252 "Ten Months After Deepwater Horizon, Picking Up the Remnants of Health Data"], ''Science'', 331(6022), 11 March 2011, p. 1252.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Health and Human Services agreed that month to set it up.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt; The study was launched in September 2010,&lt;ref name=NIH7Sep2010/&gt; and in February 2011 the first mailing requests were sent out to potential participants.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Ball, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703610604576158231937676742 "Study to Track Gulf Cleanup Workers' Health"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 22 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study is expected to cost $34 million over five years,&lt;ref name=Reuters1Mar2011/&gt; and has been designed so that it can continue for up to 20 years.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt; The National Institutes of Health (NIH) contributed $10 million to fund the initial phases, and BP contributed an additional $10 million to NIH for this and other projects.&lt;ref name=studylaunch/&gt; The BP funding was made through its Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GRI), a ten-year program to study the effects of the spill.&lt;ref name=NIH7Sep2010/&gt;

[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-21.png|220px|thumb|alt=map|Map of the spill area]]
The areas affected are [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=Reuters1Mar2011&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/01/us-oilspill-health-idUSTRE7205TO20110301 "U.S. to study health impact of BP oil spill"], Reuters, 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The study aims to track 55,000 workers for at least five years.&lt;ref name=Reardon/&gt; The workers will have been involved in a variety of tasks, such as oil burning, skimming, booming, as well as cleaning up animals, equipment and the shoreline, resulting in different levels of exposure to contaminants. The study has also recruited, as a control group, workers who completed the clean-up safety training, but who in the end did not take part in the clean-up itself.&lt;ref name=studylaunch/&gt;

The researchers will examine the workers' exposure to [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) and dispersants, using monitoring data gathered during the clean-up. Around 20,000 of the workers will be visited at home, and blood, hair, urine and toenail samples will be collected to look for [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]], such as [[DNA adduct]]s and [[chromosome]] damage; lung-function tests will be carried out, and dust samples will be collected from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/epi/studies/gulfstudy/questionnaires/home_visit_baseline_scripts_and_questionnaires.pdf "Home Visit Baseline Scripts and Questionnaires"], GuLF Study, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, p. 5, accessed 9 July 2013:
:"During the visit, you'll be asked to:&lt;p&gt;"have your blood pressure, height, weight, hips, and waist measured&lt;p&gt;"blow into a machine to measure your lung function ...&lt;p&gt;"have a blood sample drawn and provide samples of urine, hair, and toenails&lt;p&gt;"complete a one-hour interview&lt;p&gt;"and allow our staff to collect a dust sample from your home."

DNA adducts, chromosome damage, and altered ability to repair DNA are examples of the sorts of biomarkers being considered."

Researchers will look for respiratory conditions, cancers, [[Hematology|hematological]] outcomes, and neuro-behavioral or mental-health problems, and for any job losses, and financial or domestic disruption, the spill may have caused.&lt;ref name=studylaunch&gt;[http://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/newsroom/releases/2010/september07/index.cfm "7 Sep 2010: NIH to Launch Gulf Oil Spill Health Study"], National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Questionnaires ask workers about their health at the time of the spill, exposure to oil or dispersant, and lifestyle factors that, as the study said, "might confound associations between exposures and health."&lt;ref name=studyintro&gt;[http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/epi/studies/gulfstudy/ "The GuLF STUDY"], National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, accessed 9 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2013 researchers had conducted 32,000 telephone interviews, including 800 interviews in Spanish and over 1,000 in Vietnamese, and 9,967 home visits.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Schleifstein, [http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2013/01/bp_deepwater_horizon_spill_sci.html "BP Deepwater Horizon spill: Scientists say seafood safe, but health effects being measured"], ''The Times-Picayune'', 22 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obstacles and concerns===
The difficulties facing the study are considerable. Sara Reardon wrote in ''Science'' in March 2011 that scientists were concerned that they did not know what to look for.&lt;ref name=Reardon/&gt; The delay between the workers' exposure in 2010 and the start of the study – the first interviews of participants took place in February 2011&lt;ref name=Buchanan&gt;Susan Buchanan, [http://www.louisianaweekly.com/bp-spill-workers-seek-care-as-health-study-progresses/ "BP spill workers seek care as health study progresses"], ''The Louisiana Weekly'', 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; – meant that short-term physical markers that could be directly related to the spill, such as rashes, had gone. There is also little information about the pre-spill baseline health of the workers, whose work involves regular exposure to environmental hazards. According to epidemiologist Maureen Lichtveld, the main health effects are likely to be psychosocial, such as depression and increased alcohol use resulting from job losses. Reardon wrote that, given how economically depressed the community is, it will be difficult to demonstrate what is causing the stress-related illnesses the workers report.&lt;ref name=Reardon/&gt;

There has been concern that the study will collect health information without addressing the medical needs of the workers, who may have no [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]]. The study's lead investigator, Dale Sandler, said in 2011 that participants who are found by the researchers to need medical care will be referred to local health-care providers who offer free or reduced-cost treatment. Local people say that finding such medical care is not easy, and that the workers' health should be prioritized over data collection.&lt;ref name=Buchanan/&gt;

The first edition of the ''Handbook of Religion and Health'' (published in 2001) is divided into 8 major parts that contain a total of 34 chapters. The book also contains an 11-page introduction, a 2-page conclusion, 95 pages of references, and a 24-page index. One reviewer described the book as "surprisingly readable" (p.&amp;nbsp;791&lt;ref name=plante01/&gt;).

The parts and chapters are shown in the adjacent table. Most chapters focus on reviewing and discussing the relation between religion and particular health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease or depression. In two chapters, the authors present more encompassing theoretical models that they suggest may explain the generally favorable associations observed between religion and health:

*In chapter 15, on mental health, the authors theorize that the relation between religion and mental health outcomes may be mediated (causally explained) by stressful life experiences, as well as various other psychological factors that include coping resources and future goals.&lt;ref&gt;The authors state "The model in Figure 15.1 illustrates hypothesized pathways by which religion can influence mental health" (p. 222). Figure 15.1 (p. 223) shows interrelations between religion and 5 clusters of mental health outcomes as mediated by 1) stressful life experiences; 2) future goals, prior experiences, and world view; 3) coping resources; 4) cognitive appraisals; and 5) coping behaviors. The figure also shows a role for 6) genetics/biological factors; and 7) developmental factors.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In chapter 25, on physical health, the authors theorize that the religion / physical health relation may be mediated (causally explained) by mental health, social support, and health behaviors, which in turn may affect various physiological processes as well as disease detection and treatment compliance, which affect physical health.&lt;ref&gt;The authors state "On the basis of the research we have reviewed, we now develop a theoretical model to illustrate how religious beliefs and practices might impact physical health (see Figure 25.1)" (p. 389).&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors note that their model for effects on physical health 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
does not consider 'supernatural'... explanations... since such mechanisms (if they exist at all) act outside the laws of science as we know them today. We focus here on known psychological, social, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms by which religion may exert effects on physical health. (p. 389)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The book's 34th and final chapter contains a 77-page table with systematic information about all 20th-century studies of religion and health. Topics are arranged in the order of the other chapters, and provide technical information such as the type of population, the number of subjects, the existence of a control or a comparison group, and a 1-to-10 rating or "grade" of the study's quality and rigor. The "reader thus gains a snapshot view of each study, can easily identify those with a variable of interest, and can reference back to the text to see what the authors have to say about it" (p.&amp;nbsp;139&lt;ref name=cronin02/&gt;).

The ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' wrote that the authors of the ''Handbook of Religion and Health'' are
&lt;blockquote&gt;
well-regarded researchers in this maturing field... Their analysis of more than 1200
studies and 400 reviews is meticulous and balanced.... This is an unparalleled resource not only for physicians with an interest in the relationship between religion and health but perhaps even more for those who doubt its significance. All physicians should consider the possibility that something so meaningful to a large number of patients might also be good for their health. (pp.&amp;nbsp;465-6&lt;ref name=charles01/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'' also stated that "Studies are cited to illustrate the complexity and limitations of available knowledge," that "The authors offer theoretical models for how religion might directly or indirectly influence both mental and physical health," and that "The authors provide an outline for a religious history that can serve as part of a clinical assessment. Ways to aid patients to use their religious beliefs within the health care system are suggested" (all p.&amp;nbsp;465&lt;ref name=charles01/&gt;).

In the ''[[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]]'', [[Leonard Duhl]] wrote that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the authors have done a very thorough overview of all we know at this time. Clearly spirituality and religion affect growth and development, the creation of pathology and the treatment of disease. They have not got the total answer. However, they have laid a ground work for understanding a complex set of issues. They review those studies that exist, critically interpret their findings, and offer new ways of "asking the question." They hypothesise the possible mechanisms, and suggest new directions.
(p.&amp;nbsp;688&lt;ref name=duhl01/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Gerontologist]]'', [[David O. Moberg]] described the book as "mind-boggling, comprehensive, and evenhanded...This comprehensive reference work deserves an honored place in every medical, religious, gerontological, professional, and scientific research library, even though it has one major weakness, the lack of an index of names." (pp.&amp;nbsp;699–700;&lt;ref name=moberg01/&gt;)

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Jerome Groopman]] wrote that the ''Handbook'''s conclusions 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
are not entirely encouraging: they suggest that although the relationship between health and spirituality is clearly worthy of serious study, much of the research done in the field to date has been shoddy. Koenig and his collaborators also go to great lengths to educate the reader about negative effects of belief and orthodoxies... such as the fear that disease is punishment for sin, and that assistance is preferably derived through miracles rather than through medicine. (p.&amp;nbsp;166&lt;ref name=groopman01/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Freethought Today]]'', a magazine published by the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]], wrote that the ''Handbook'' "reports that there are at least 1200 studies on religion and health - with the vast majority showing positive associations" and asked
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Are there really this many studies? What are these studies like? Well, here's one of them that qualifies by [[Harold G. Koenig|Koenig's]] standards.... The authors reported differences between Jewish and non-Jewish Cleveland attorneys in the incidence of some index of cardiovascular disease. That's it.... So that's how numbers like 1200 arise, because studies like this get included. (pp.&amp;nbsp;10-11&lt;ref name=sloan07/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', [[Thomas G. Plante]] wrote that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A growing number of well-conceived and methodologically rigorous studies have been conducted to examine if religious beliefs and behaviors might be related to health benefits or health risks....  No book, however, has &lt;nowiki&gt;[until now]&lt;/nowiki&gt; thoroughly reviewed all the empirical studies and reviews in this area.... The authors maintain scholarly neutrality and let the research evidence speak for itself.... The book is surprisingly readable for a 700+ page scholarly review.... The authors should be commended on an extraordinary job on this soon to be classic text.(pp.&amp;nbsp;790-1&lt;ref name=plante01/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'', Paul Genova wrote that "This ''Handbook'' is really a reference volume.... Case presentations are rare. Occasional sensitive discussions on subjects such as the adjustment to terminal cancer... are embedded in exhaustive literature reviews." But
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the biggest problem, in my view, with the line of reasoning represented by this book &lt;nowiki&gt;[is that]&lt;/nowiki&gt; "Health" is the ego's agenda. It should not be conflated with concepts such as doing God's will or taking one's proper place in a divine pattern.... A cultural product of present-day American behavioral science, this book renders unto the Caesar of controlled studies.... it fits the current pattern of assimilation and loses the Spirit of the message. (pp.&amp;nbsp;1619-20&lt;ref name=genova02/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Anglican Theological Review]]'', Daniel Grossoehme, "a priest serving as a pediatric chaplain" (p.&amp;nbsp;800&lt;ref name=grossoehme02/&gt;), wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
now more than ever there is a need for religion and science (and specifically health science) to be in conversation with one another.... This volume is a significant contribution to the conversation and one which can be of great value in a variety of church settings.... The information contained in this volume provides the background necessary to carry on an education program that is both theologically and intellectually (scientifically) sound.... Guidance for previously unthought-of pastoral issues comes out from the studies. (p.&amp;nbsp;798&lt;ref name=grossoehme02/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion]]'', James W. Jones noted that "Like most medical texts, it is organized by syndromes" (p.&amp;nbsp;95&lt;ref name=jones05/&gt;), and that "the book’s clear organization" makes "selectively &lt;nowiki&gt;[reading]&lt;/nowiki&gt; the chapters of interest... easy to do" p.&amp;nbsp;96). He also stated that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have used this book successfully as part of the assigned readings in undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate courses on religion and health.... [it] is accessible to educated nonprofessionals as well as professionals in religion and medicine.... It is not, however, an introduction to the controversy surrounding the field. The authors do not explicitly argue for the religion–health relation; they are content to let the weight of evidence as they present it speak for itself.... For a more critical discussion, the reader must look to other sources. But anyone planning a course or introducing a colleague to the general field of religion and health should make this book available. (pp.&amp;nbsp;95-6&lt;ref name=jones05/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[First Things]]'' wrote that "The authors write in the desiccated tone of the social scientist who divorces his thought from the human encounter with the transcendent.... Nowhere in this tome does one find a statement (let alone any enthusiastic support for) the authentic place of religion in our being" (p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;ref name=mchugh01/&gt;).

The ''Journal of Hospice &amp; Palliative Nursing'' wrote that the authors "take on a Herculean task," and "every time I randomly opened to a page, I found something unanticipated and intriguing" (pp.&amp;nbsp;138,&amp;nbsp;139&lt;ref name=cronin02/&gt;).

The ''Journal of Sex Education &amp; Therapy'' wrote that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a dip-and-dig book.... I spent a week just leafing through to savor the gems.... One day I read about depression... another delinquency, then cardiovascular disease... I spent a weekend on research methods and measurement tools and another weekend on priorities for future research. Yum. If you are looking for a doctoral project or an advisor, here is the place for you to dip and-dig. (p.&amp;nbsp;365&lt;ref name=cesaretti01/&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6809">Spain employs a [[universal health care]] system. The system is essentially "free" except for small, often symbolic co-payments in some products and services.

According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], total health spending accounted for 9.4% of GDP in Spain in 2011, slightly above the OECD average of 9.3%. The Spanish health care system is considered one of the best in the world, in 7th position in the ranking calculated by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation, World Health Staff, (2000), Haden, Angela; Campanini, Barbara, eds., The world health report 2000 - Health systems: improving performance (PDF), Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organisation, {{ISBN|92-4-156198-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain is ranked 1st in the world in organ transplants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.es/20170111/how-spain-became-world-leader-at-organ-transplants&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.es/20160225/global-transplant-leader-spain-reaches-its-100000th-transplant&lt;/ref&gt; The public sector is the main source of health funding. In Spain, 73% of health spending was funded by public sources in 2011, very close to the average of 72% in OECD countries. Since 2010, real term spending on healthcare has declined in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Briefing-Note-SPAIN-2014.pdf|title=OECD Health Statistics 2014 How does Spain compare? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospitals==
{{main article|List of hospitals in Spain}}
In an emergency, people can go straight to a hospital A&amp;E. For any other type of hospital treatment a referral from a doctor is required. There are public and private hospitals, with the former providing free treatment. As some hospitals offer both private and state healthcare services, the presentation of a social security card, an [[European Health Insurance Card|EHIC]], or proof of private insurance is advisable.
As hospital doctors do not issue prescriptions, after discharge, patients take the hospital medical report to a pharmacy for prescriptions to be filled.

In Spain patients have the right to read their own patient records, but there is evidence that this is not well publicised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decentralisation==

In Spain, provision of health care services is decentralised, and thus the responsibility of several [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|autonomous communities]]. In 1998, an analysis of the effects of greater autonomy on legislative performance and policy outcomes for health care observed a positive effect on the former, but no effect on the latter. The analysis noted that a possible explanation for this disconnect was that autonomous communities had only experienced greater autonomy in the area of health care for a short time, and positive effects on policy outcomes could take longer to manifest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antón, R.,  Macías|first1=JI|last2=Muñoz de Bustillo|first2=R|last3=Fernández Macías|first3=E|title=Effects of health care decentralization in Spain from a citizens' perspective|journal=The European Journal of Health Economics|date=May 2014|volume=15|issue=4|pages=411–431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, an analysis of data collected by the Spanish National Health Survey in 2001 showed that autonomous communities with decentralised health services tended to have better equity performance.&lt;ref name="costafont"&gt; {{cite journal|last1=Costa-Font|first1=Joan|last2=Gil|first2=Joan|title=Exploring the pathways of inequality in health, health care access and financing in decentralized Spain|journal=Journal of European Social Policy|date=December 2009|volume=19|issue=5|pages=446–458}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, an analysis of data collected by the Spanish [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas|Centre of Sociological Research]] between 1996 and 2009 found that for twenty variables of public satisfaction with health care services, decentralisation not only had no effect on 2 measures of primary or specialised care and 1 of hospital care, but actually performed worse on 3 measures of primary or specialised care and 1 measure of hospital care. No statistically significant trend was observed for twelve of the twenty measures of satisfaction. The authors of the analysis stressed that the data was limited due to the subjective nature of patient reports, and the possible inability of some to properly evaluate performance of health care services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Pablo|last2=Fraile|first2=Marta|title=Regional Decentralisation of Health Policy in Spain: Social Capital Does Not Tell the Whole Story|journal=West European Politics|date=October 1998|volume=21|issue=4|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International comparisons==
In a sample of 13 developed countries Spain was second in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in both 2009 and 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that, in the previous 10 years the conditions treated had: a high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality; caused significant long-term morbidity; incurred high levels of expenditure or had significant developments in prevention or treatment. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross border comparison of medication use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of health Economics|title=International Comparison of Medicines Usage: Quantitative Analysis|url=http://www.abpi.org.uk/our-work/library/industry/Documents/meds_usage.pdf|publisher=Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ceuta]] had the highest proportion of practising doctors per head of any region in Europe - 871 per 100,000 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Euro health consumer index]] rated Spain 19th of 35 European countries in 2015, remarking that there was somewhat of an over-reliance on seeking private care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A local [[landmark]] or [[road]] near a honey hole may have "Honey Hole" in its name&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nescopeck State Park]] in Pennsylvania, USA and [[Todmorden Unitarian Church]] in West Yorkshire, England&lt;/ref&gt; or as a [[nickname]] for a [[mud]]dy spot.&lt;ref&gt;John Eric Bruce Gover, Allen Mawer, Frank Merry Stenton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9XkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=honey+hole ''Survey of English Place-Names: The Place-Names of Nottinghamshire''], Volume 17, [[English Place-Name Society]], [[Cambridge University Press]], 1940, p.299 (retrieved 29 August 2010 from Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12672">The '''International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH)''', is an international non-governmental professional society, founded in [[Milan]] during the [[Milan International (1906)|Expo 1906]] as the Permanent Commission on Occupational Health.

ICOH aims at fostering the scientific progress, knowledge and development of occupational health and safety in all its aspects. Today, ICOH is the world's leading international scientific society in the field of occupational health with a membership of 2,000 professionals from 93 countries and is recognised by the [[United Nations]] as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) with close working relationships with [[ILO]], [[WHO]], [[UNEP]] and [[International Social Security Association|ISSA]].

== ICOH Activities ==

The most visible activities of ICOH are the triennial World Congresses on Occupational Health, which are usually attended by some 3,000 participants. The 2000 Congress was held in Singapore, the 2003 Congress in [[Iguassu Falls]] (Brazil), the 2006 Centennial Congress in Milan, (Italy), the 2009 Congress in [[Cape Town]] (South Africa), ICOH 2012 Congress in Cancun (Mexico), ICOH 2015 Congress in Seoul (Rep. of Korea), while ICOH 2018 was held in Dublin (Ireland). The next ICOH Congress will be held in Melbourne (Australia) in 2021, while ICOH 2024 will be held in Marrakesh (Morocco).

At the ICOH 2006 General Assembly, the President highlighted the overriding importance of permanent training and education of experts in order to face the rapidly changing world of work, the need to develop occupational health services throughout the world (including the development and dissemination of [[Basic Occupational Health Services]] - BOHS), the importance of creating BOHS guidelines, tools, training, and pilot projects and the intention of making a global survey on the OHS situation in ICOH member countries. Cooperation with [[World Health Organization]], [[International Labour Organization]] and other [[NGO]] partners is among the priorities of the current ICOH Strategy (ICOH Centennial Declaration).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohweb.org/site_new/multimedia/core_documents/pdf/centennial_declaration.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== ICOH Scientific Committees ==

ICOH has 37 Scientific Committees. They cover a broad scope of challenges and problems in work life, including traditional risks of occupational injuries and diseases, and the risks of “new work life”. The Scientific Committees focus specifically on the areas of competence and promote and carry out research in their respective fields. Most of these committees have regular symposia, scientific monographs and review the abstracts submitted to the International Congresses.

== ICOH Concrete Actions for the Asbestos Ban ==

ICOH relations with International Organizations (WHO, ILO) have received critiques, notably on the issue of [[asbestos]]: "''Part of the explanation for this bland acceptance of the asbestos cancer epidemic is that the WHO and the ILO have allowed organizations such as the International Commission on occupational Health (ICOH) and other asbestos industry consultants and experts to manipulate them and to distort the scientific evidence. The WHO and the ILO were lulled into inaction by conflicting scientific reports of the epidemic.''"&lt;ref name="LaDou2004"&gt;{{cite journal

Actually, '''ICOH has set among its main priorities the Asbestos Ban''', taking a very clear position in favour of the global ban of asbestos. Through its official bodies and individual members ICOH took actions at all levels of activity, global, national and workplace levels:

#After the  '''"Call for an International ban for asbestos"''' produced by the [[Collegium Ramazzini]], the ICOH Officers Meeting in  Paris, 30–31 August 1999, chaired by the ICOH President at that time, Professor Jean-Francois Caillard, decided to endorse it. Furthermore the endorsement of the "Call for an International ban for asbestos" was approved by the ICOH 2nd General Assembly on 1 September 2000, in connection with the ICOH 2000 Congress.
#The need for a continuous follow-up was recognised during ICOH 2000-2002 triennium and the ICOH President, Prof. Bengt Knave, decided to establish a '''Task Group on Asbestos''' (including members of the Board), that presented in the ICOH Board Meeting of 1–2 March  2002, an article by Benedetto Terracini "World Asbestos Congress: Past, Present and Future, Osasco (Brazil) 17–20 September 2000", as a report. The article was endorsed by the Board.
#The European Conference on Asbestos 2003 on 3–6 September 2003, drafted and adopted the '''“Dresden Declaration on Protection of Workers against Asbestos”'''. The Declaration was drafted with strong input by ICOH President and the Secretary of the Scientific Committee on Industrial Hygiene and it summarizes the contemporary effort of ICOH which has the scientific role to “provide guidance and support for a well-governed process to eliminate the use of asbestos”. For this aim, ICOH Past President, Prof. Jorma Rantanen, during the 13th Session of the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health made the proposal for elimination of asbestos related diseases as a priority for ILO/WHO collaboration. The Committee unanimously approved the proposal.
#ICOH commitment in this field was also attested by the full support to the '''Asian Asbestos Conference 2006''' organized in Thailand on 26–27 July 2006 by the Ministry of Public Health and co-sponsored by the International Labour Office (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO), International Ban Asbestos Secretariat (IBAS) and the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH). During the Conference, Prof. Jorma Rantanen declared ICOH's unequivocal support for a global asbestos ban; this position is rooted in the experiences of ICOH members who have observed the dire consequences of hazardous asbestos exposures on their patients in industrialized countries. Prof. Rantanen urged that concerted action be taken by international agencies, national governments, trade unions and NGOs to raise awareness of the asbestos hazard and to highlight the long-term economic benefits of transferring to non-asbestos technologies.
#The '''"Bangkok Declaration"''', recalling the ILO resolution on Asbestos, the ILO Conventions on Occupational Cancer (No. 139), the Safety in the Use of Asbestos, the WHO Global Strategy on Occupational Health for All and the WHA Resolution 58.22 on Cancer Prevention and Control and considering the ICOH International Code of Ethics for Occupational Health Professionals, declared the support of its signatories for a global asbestos ban and was widely disseminated through many networks.
#For the triennium 2009-2012, a new '''ICOH Working Group on the Elimination of Asbestos-related Diseases''' was set. The Working Group  mainly focused on examining the existing regulations and bans in order to develop specific recommendation for actions and guidelines.
#ICOH continued its efforts on this specific issue through the '''ICOH Statement: Global Asbestos Ban and the Elimination of Asbestos-Related Diseases'''.To accomplish such elimination, ICOH urges each and every individual country to implement a total ban on production and use of asbestos. ICOH also urges complementary efforts aimed at primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of asbestos-related diseases through country-specific “National Programmes for Elimination of Asbestos-Related Diseases” in line with ILO and WHO guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohweb.org/site_new/ico_homepage.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the national level the expert input of ICOH members to the decisions concerning the ban of asbestos can be found for example in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Japan and Norway.
The ICOH members also were most instrumental in production of the '''"Asbestos, asbestosis, and cancer: the Helsinki criteria for diagnosis and attribution"'''&lt;ref&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health 1997;23:p.311–6, "''Asbestos, asbestosis, and cancer: the Helsinki criteria for diagnosis and attribution. Proceedings of an International Expert Meeting''". People and Work. Research Reports 14. Finnish Institute of Occupational Health 1997. 98 p.
&lt;/ref&gt;- a document that has been taken in use in everyday practices in diagnosing, recognition and compensation of asbestos related diseases and has also been used in courts in some countries in defence of victims of the diseased persons. ICOH members also train the experts in occupational medicine and safety by using the research and criteria documents as a support for education.

'''International Day of the Girl Child''' is an international observance day declared by the United Nations; it is also called the '''Day of Girls''' and the '''International Day of the Girl'''. [[October 11]], 2012, was the first Day of the Girl Child. The observation supports more opportunity for girls and increases awareness of [[gender inequality]] faced by girls worldwide based upon their gender. This inequality includes areas such as [[right to education|access to education]], nutrition, legal rights, medical care, and protection from discrimination, [[violence against women]] and [[forced marriage|forced]] [[child marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/10/united-nations-malala-girls-education.html|title=As Malala Recovers, U.N.

The Day of Girls helps raise awareness not only of the issues that girls face, but also what is likely to happen when those problems are solved. For example, educating girls helps reduce the rate of child marriage, disease and helps strengthen the [[economy]] by helping girls have access to higher paying jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://schoolsofthought.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/11/education-a-focus-on-international-day-of-the-girl-child/|title=Education a Focus on International Day of the Girl Child|last=Krache|first=Donna|date=11 October 2012|work=CNN|access-date=11 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/camille-crittenden/science-math-programs-matter_b_1944249.html|title=International Day of the Girl: Why Science &amp; Math Programs Matter|last=Crittenden|first=Camille|date=8 October 2012|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=11 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:International Day of the Girl Child for 2014.jpg|alt=Girls at a 2014 International Day of the Girl Child Event.|thumb|Girls at a 2014 International Day of Girls Event.]]
The International Day of Girls initiative began as a project of [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International]], a non-governmental organization that operates worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=201609280700CANADANWCANADAPR.C2019&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Challenge Accepted!

Plan International representatives in [[Canada]] approached the Canadian federal government to seek to the coalition of supporters [[raised awareness]] of the initiative internationally. Eventually, Plan International urged the [[United Nations]] to become involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katy-ma-/international-day-of-the-girl_b_4080548.html|title=What Is the International Day of the Girl Child?|last=Ma|first=Katy|date=10 October 2013|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=11 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International Day of Girls was formally proposed as a resolution by Canada in the United Nations General Assembly. [[Rona Ambrose]], Canada's Minister for the Status of Women, sponsored the resolution; a delegation of women and girls made presentations in support of the initiative at the 55th [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]].

'''[[Irrigation]] in [[Colombia]]''' has been an integral part of Colombia's agricultural and rural development in the 20th Century. Public investment in irrigation has been especially prominent in the first half of the Century. During the second half, largely driven by fiscal shortages and a common inability to raise sufficient revenues from collection of water charges, the Colombian government adopted a program to devolve irrigation management responsibility to water users associations. Irrigation management transfer has occurred only partially in Colombia, as the government has maintained strong managerial tasks in certain irrigation districts.

Colombia has approximately 900,000 hectares of irrigated agriculture, mostly located in the warm center, Magdalena, Cauca and Tolima Valleys, and the northeast near [[Venezuela]]’s border and along the [[Caribbean]] coast. Approximately, 90% of the agricultural land is irrigated through gravity irrigation systems. According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), 62% of the functional irrigable land in Colombia has been developed and managed by the private sector. Only 38% was developed by the public sector. FAO estimates that the private sector invested on average US$19 million annually during the period 1991–1997. Colombia has a considerable potential to expand land under irrigation due to high rainfall and fertile volcanic soil creating conditions favorable for a wide range of crops.

Efficiency of irrigation systems is in general very low in the country contributing to soil salinization and water erosion. In addition, agricultural runoff including chemicals from fertilizers and pesticides are taking an increasing toll on Colombian ecosystems.
According to the first national communication to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], Colombia is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially highland Andean ecosystems. Colombian Government is in the process of implementing an Integrated National Adaptation Project focused on defining and implementing policy options to meet the anticipated impacts of climate change.

==History of the irrigation sector==

===Agricultural land under irrigation; past and present trends===
The total irrigated area in Colombia was around 50000 ha until 1950. From 1960 through 1990, private irrigated area expanded at an average annual rate of 15000 ha.&lt;ref name="Violence"&gt;{{cite journal

The private sector financed approximately two thirds of the irrigation schemes.

===Institutional Development===
At the beginning of the centuray, irrigation development was largely driven by the Colombian government. Public investment on irrigation infrastructure started in 1936 and continued throughout the 1940s and 1950s, when the Colombian government focused in agriculture development in the valleys of Alto Chicamocha, Firavitoba y Samaca in Northern Colombia, and built the irrigation systems of Ramada, [[Coello, Tolima|Coello]], [[Saldaña, Colombia|Saldaña]] and [[Department of Valle del Cauca|Roldanillo-Union-Toro]] (RUT).&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water users associations (WUA), such as Coello and Saldaña in [[Department of Tolima|Tolima district]], become very active and lobbied the government for infrastructure management transfer.&lt;ref name="Garces-Restrepo"/&gt; In the 1960s, the government increased public investment in irrigation sector building 14 irrigation districts together with drainage and flood control infrastructure through the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA).&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; In the 1970s with the creation of the Institute for Hydrology, Meteorology and Land Development (HIMAT) the government aimed at increasing water users’ capacity to eventually take over management of irrigation systems. HIMAT would be in charge of management until water users’ association reach adequate capacity. Coello and Saldaña districts were transferred to water users in 1976 under a constitutional principle referred to as "delegation of administration". The "delegation of administration" did not include transfer of ownership for scheme assets nor full WUA control over budgets, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) plans and personnel. HIMAT retained a strong supervisory role in administering budgets and O&amp;M vis a vis WUA.&lt;ref name="Garces-Restrepo"/&gt;

In 1993, the government passed a Land Development Law No. 41 in 1993 and its associated enabling Decree Nos. 1278 and 2135 aimed at updating current agreement with water users associations from “delegation of administration” to “concessional contracts”. Under the new agreement water users associations would have full control over irrigation district finances, O&amp;M procedures and personnel but continued not having ownership over irrigation infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Garces-Restrepo"/&gt;

In 1994, HIMAT was transferred to a newly created institution, the National Institute for Land Development (INAT) aimed at reinvigorate management transfer. INAT reached agreements with WUA on a case by case basis. At the beginning of
1990, only Coello and Saldaña (with a total irrigable area of 39,603 ha) had been transferred. By the end of 1996, 17 of the 23 public irrigation districts in the country had been transferred to WUAs or 115,695 ha of a total of 241,077 ha of irrigated area previously under public management.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; The original plan was to enable total transfer by 1997. However, after experiencing difficulties transferring Maria Baja and other districts the government discontinued implementation aiming at better addressing some of the challenges the remaining associations had. Some of those challenges include facilities in disrepair, high costs of irrigation, lower productivity, lower profitability, social unrest, poverty and inability to collect adequate irrigation fees from farmers.&lt;ref name="Garces-Restrepo"/&gt;

==Environmental aspects==

===Linkages with water resources===
According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], Colombia receive an average of 3,000mm rainfall annually, which represents a total volume of 3,425&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Up to 61% of the total volume turns into an average flow and total internal renewable water resources of 2,113&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. According to the Institute of Hidrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies, ecosystems need up to 40% of the total water resources available in Colombia to continue providing full environmental services. Most of the irrigated areas are located in the warm center, Magdalena and Cauca Valleys, and the northeast near Venezuela’s border and along the Caribbean coast. Cauca and Tolima Valleys have 40% of irrigated land. Approximately, 90% of the agricultural land is irrigated through gravity irrigation systems but the Cauca Valley and Sabana in Bogota with improved on farm irrigation systems such as dripping and aspersion.&lt;ref name="Informe Nacional"&gt;

===Environmental impacts of irrigation===
According to Marin Ramirez (1991), as quoted in the National Report on Water Resources Management in Colombia, the predominance of gravity irrigation systems are due to both the sense of water being an abundant and cheap resource and the high upfront costs for improved irrigation techniques. Hence, efficiency of irrigation systems is in general very low in the country contributing to soil salinization and water erosion. In addition, agricultural runoff including chemicals from fertilizers and pesticides are taking an increasing toll on Colombian ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Informe Nacional"/&gt;

===Anticipated climate change impacts on irrigated agriculture===
According to the first national communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Colombia is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Highland Andean ecosystems, especially moorlands, are expected to be seriously affected by increase in temperature which has recorded a net increase of 0.2-0.3 degrees Celsius per decade during the period 1961–1990 – according to the Meteorological, Hydrological and Environmental Studies Institute—and is expected to continue to do so  by the Meteorological Research Institute of Japan. Hydrological temperature changes would result in a [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and the services attached to those such as water supply, basin regulation and hydropower.&lt;ref name="Adaptation Colombia"&gt;

==Legal and institutional framework==

===Legal framework===
The [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]] grants to the Colombian Government the responsibility of guaranteeing natural resources sustainable use, including water resources. In 1993, the government passed a Land Development Law No. 41 in 1993 and its associated enabling Decree Nos. 1278 and 2135 aimed at reducing public intervention in the irrigation sector and spurring private investment. The Law incorporates users’ participation in design, building, and posterior operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) by establishing a water fee which includes a fraction of the total costs. The law also establishes the National Council for Land Development (CONSUAT).

The Law 99 of 1993 established the current institutional framework in Colombia; in particular it created the Environment Ministry the National Environmental System (See [[Water resources management in Colombia]] for further information). The Law creates a new and complex institutional framework where different administrations and institutions coexist.

===Institutional framework===
The Environment Ministry is in charge of formulating water resources management policies and regulations including pollution standards and charge fees. The Agriculture Ministry is in charge of developing sustainable land management, agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The National Council for Land Management (CONSUAT) is the Agriculture Ministry’s principal advisor and INAT – together with other public and private entities – is its executive branch. The National Fund for Land Management is an administrative unit in charge of designing and implementing irrigation, drainage and flood control infrastructure. Until 1992, irrigation districts management were subscribed to HIMAT – now renamed INAT – and are currently in the process of being transferred to water user organizations (See History of the irrigation sector above).

Finally, the institutional framework includes a research institution, IDEAM which coordinates the Colombian Environmental Information System and is responsible for meteorology, hydrology, and related environmental studies.&lt;ref name="Javier Blanco"&gt;

===Key Legal Issues that Arise in Irrigation PPPs===
There are a number of legal and commercial issues that will affect how these projects move forward and are structured.  Whilst some of the legal issues are not confined to irrigation PPPs they can take on a new dimension and complexity when applied to irrigation: Land ownership; water extraction; public sector counterpart. These will be key issues in a PPP as the private provider will want to ensure a steady revenue stream.&lt;ref name="PPPIRC"&gt;{{cite web|last=PPPIRC|title=PPPs in Irrigation|url=http://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/ppp-sector/water-sanitation/ppps-irrigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also the usual legal considerations that need to be checked when developing PPPs in any sector, such as legal restrictions on the type of PPP arrangement that can be entered into, relevant procurement rules for entering into PPPs, existence of restrictions on foreign investment, taxation and potential for tax holidays and the ability to assign rights such as security and step in rights to lenders.&lt;ref name="PPPIRC"/&gt;

===Example of WUA: The Coello Irrigation District===

The Coello irrigation district is located about 150 kilometers from the capital, Bogota on the left bank of the Magdalena River in the Department of Tolima. The only source of water for the project is the Rio Coello, a tributary of the Magdalena River. About 99Z of the lands of the Coello project belong to private owners. About 56% of the farms in the district are smaller than 10 ha, occupying a total of only 142 of the land area. Another 262 of the farms occupy more than 20 ha
each or a total of 712 of the land.

The management of the Coello district was transferred to the Water Users' Association (known as USOCOELLO) when HIHAT was created in 1976. The general conditions of transfer were defined in an agreement between HIMAT and USOCOELLO. USOCOELLO's regulations defining the rights and obligations of the association members, and the functions of the General Assembly, Board, and General Manager are set out in a document issued on October 31, 1986. Any owner, farmer or tenant farmer in the area can be a member of USOCOELLO and submit a request for registration. The district is one of the oldest in Colombia and members of the Association participate actively in the annual meetings.&lt;ref name="Coello"&gt;

==Economic aspects==

===Water tariff===
Under Colombian law all beneficiaries of public works must pay a land appreciation surcharge proportionate to the value of the government's investment. Beneficiaries of land improvement districts are also liable for the cost of operations and maintenance (O&amp;M). Operations and maintenance costs are recovered through (i) a fixed water charge (per hectare, per year) and (ii) a variable water charge based on the volume of water delivered for irrigation. The law does not state what proportion of these two charges is to meet O&amp;M costs. Water rates are fixed once a year by HIHAT's Board of Directors before the first planting season starts, at the time of budget preparation. In setting the fixed and volumetric water rates, HIMAT determines the users’ contribution to O&amp;M costs, the government pays the difference. Fixed charges are paid in advance, regardless of land use. Their payment is a pre-requisite for receiving the irrigation service. The volumetric water charges are paid at the end of each season. The collection rate is generally high. Volumetric payments depend on how much water is actually delivered to the farmers. Rainfall varies markedly, which affects demand for supplementary irrigation water. Total water charges covered only 34.9% O&amp;M costs in 1980 and 28.5% in 1987. Only a few districts, including RUT, approach self-sufficiency for operations and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Coello"/&gt;

===Investment===
According to FAO, 463,000 ha of the functional irrigable land in Colombia (or 62%) has been developed and managed by the private sector. Only 38% was developed by the public sector. FAO estimates that the private sector invested an average of US$19 million annually during the period 1991–1997.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; In 1994, investment cost of private irrigation development for basic irrigation projects providing water for rice and cereal varied between US$750 to 1,000 per hectare. Private investment cost for irrigation schemes featuring pumping lifts varied between US$1,200 to 1,750 per hectare. Finally, private investment costs for irrigations schemes including wells, sprinkles or localized irrigation varied between US$2,000 to 2,700 per hectare.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

===External cooperation===
During the 1980s, The World Bank invested a total of US$234 million in [http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?query=Colombia%20irrigation&amp;menuPK=51526214&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;pagePK=218616&amp;piPK=217470 several small-scale irrigation developments] on the foothills of the Andes, in the savannah country of Northern Colombia and the Magdalena watershed in Northwest Colombia.

Particularly in the area of Climate Change, the World Bank is working closely with Colombian Government in an [http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P083075 Integrated National Adaptation Project] to strengthen Colombian institutions, particularly IDEAM, to produce climate information in support of adaptation to climate change. The project also includes the definition and implementation of a specific pilot adaptation program supporting the maintenance of environmental services in the Las Hermosas Massif including the [http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P078220 Amoya watershed protection].

The Inter- American Development Bank worked together with the Colombian government in the 1990s in the creation of a [http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=TC9408338&amp;Language=English National Irrigation Program] and an [http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=CO0055&amp;Language=English Irrigation and Drainage Program] to support the government's strategy for land improvement and to seek private-sector involvement in efforts to modernize Colombia's agriculture sector.

==Lessons learned from Colombia’s irrigation model==
Researchers Carlos Garces-Restrepo and Doublas L. Vermillion studied the impact of management transfer to water users’ organizations in selected irrigation systems, namely RUT, Rio Recio, Samaca, San Rafael y Maria La Baja. The findings of the study “support the hypothesis that management transfer leads to efforts by water users associations to improve management efficiency, such as reducing the number of management staff and taking measures to cut costs.” Management transfer also leads to a significant reduction of government expenditures in irrigation management. However, “transfer has not had substantial impacts on the performance of operations and maintenance or in the agricultural and economic productivity of irrigated land or water, neither improving negative performance nor causing detriment where performance was positive.”&lt;ref name="Garces-Restrepo"/&gt;

The researchers also notice that the concept of “management transfer” varies among countries. In the case of Colombia, government maintained considerable authority over O&amp;M, budgets and human resources. Ownership of infrastructure was never transferred to water users associations nor have water rights been granted. Hence, “it is necessary to test the hypothesis that a more integrated and comprehensive devolution policy would lead to more positive impacts on performance.”&lt;ref name="Garces-Restrepo"/&gt;

'''Jolan Chang''' (9 December 1917 - 25 April 2002) was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Sexology|sexologist]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[philosopher]] who wrote the luminary classics on Eastern Sexuality ''The Tao of Love and Sex'' and ''The Tao of the Loving Couple''. He was born in [[Hangzhou]] as the son of an army general. After the revolution he lived for a number of years in Canada, but later he moved to [[Sweden]]. He died in [[Stockholm]].

British author [[Lawrence Durrell]] wrote about Chang in his 1980 book ''A smile in the Mind's Eye.''

''The Tao of Love and Sex'' (with foreword and postscript by [[Joseph Needham]]) interprets ancient [[Taoist sexual practices|Taoist sexual teachings]] into a modern model of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Beginning with a background of [[Tao]] and [[Yin and yang|yin/yang]], the book then goes into the following subjects: the role of women in sex, the importance of sexuality to [[health]], [[ejaculation]] control, [[hip thrusting|thrusting]] methods, descriptions of various [[sex position]]s, advantages of [[Woman on top (sex position)|female superior positions]], erotic [[kiss]]ing and the Tao, overcoming [[impotence]], the importance of female satisfaction, [[longevity]] in relation to sexual health, benefits of [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|age differences between sexual partners]] and [[breathing]] exercises. The book demonstrated that the principles of ancient Taoist texts are applicable to stimulating and improving sexual health today.

[[File:Five years' hunting adventures in South Africa- being an account of sport with the lion, elephant (1892) (14783637432).jpg|thumb|[[Roualeyn George Gordon-Cumming]] shooting a rhinoceros cow and calf.]]
This is a '''list of famous big-game hunters''' who gained fame largely or solely because of their [[big-game hunting]] exploits. The members of this list either hunted big game professionally for profit, the science of their day or by virtue of their wealth or position for sport consistently as their primary pastime for many years, and includes brief biographical details particularly concerning the game hunted, the hunting methods employed and the hunting weapons used by those listed.

==Africa==
===Bunny Allen===
'''[[Bunny Allen|Frank Maurice "Bunny" Allen]]''' (1906–2002) was an English born professional safari guide in Kenya. Born in Buckinghamshire, as a young boy Allen learnt to poach game, gaining the nickname “Bunny” for his skill at snaring rabbits. In 1927 Allen followed his older brothers to Kenya. Managing a farm Allen would take guests of the owner on shoots, bringing him to the attention of [[Bror von Blixen-Finecke]] and [[Denys Finch Hatton]]. Allen soon became one of Finch Hatton’s guns on shoots, including the Prince of Wales’ 1928 safari. Rising to Captain in the 6th King's African Rifles during World War II, after the war Allen started his own safari business and by the 1950s was considered the best and the most expensive safari operator in Kenya. Allen was also regularly employed by film studios when filming in Africa, he is rumoured to have had love affairs with [[Grace Kelly]] and [[Ava Gardner]]. Allen predominantly used a [[.470 Nitro Express]] double rifle from [[John Rigby &amp; Company]] to hunt big game.&lt;ref name=Blomfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowell/&gt;&lt;ref name=TelegraphBunny/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wheeler/&gt;

===Yank Allen===
'''George "Yank" Allen''' (1867–1924) was an American born professional lion hunter in [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]] in the early 20th century. Allen was originally a Texan cowboy who reputedly left the United States as a result of a gunfight, first travelling to South America before arriving in Southern Africa in 1900. Renowned as an eccentric, Allen was quite contemptuous of lions, never referring to them as lions but instead calling them "dawgs" that did not roar but instead "bawled". Allen supplemented his income by hunting lion for the protection of cattle, charging farmers £7 per lion. In 1912 Allen became a professional lion hunter when the Southern Rhodesian cattle enterprise Liebig's hired him to protect their herd of 20,000 cattle, paying him £10 per lion plus transport and labour. Allen always hunted alone, not trusting his native help, and his favorite rifles for lion hunting were a [[.303 British]] service rifle and a [[.577 Black Powder Express]] double rifle. At the time of his death he was said to have killed around 300 lions, making him in the opinion of "Pondoro" Taylor one of the most successful lion hunters ever.&lt;ref name=BaxterBurke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor-Cartridges/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;

===Major G.H. Anderson===
'''Major Gordon H. "Andy" Anderson''' (1878–1946) was a British soldier, elephant hunter and safari guide. Anderson commenced big game hunting in 1909 and elephant hunting in 1912, after meeting lifelong friend Jim Sutherland. Over the course of his life Anderson shot between 350 and 400 elephants, his favourite calibres for elephant hunting being the [[.577 Nitro Express]], the [[.470 Nitro Express]] and the [[.318 Westley Richards]]. From 1921 Anderson also started acting as a professional safari guide, he most notable clients being the Duke and Duchess of York (later [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother]]) in 1924 and (in partnership with Denys Finch Hatton) the Prince of Wales (later [[King Edward VIII]]) and his brother [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] in 1928. In 1934 Anderson was one of the founding members of the [[East African Professional Hunter's Association]], in 1946 he wrote his autobiography, ''African Safaris'', which was published posthumously.&lt;ref name=Taylor-Cartridges/&gt;&lt;ref name=ClodeFamous/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herne/&gt;

===William Charles Baldwin===
'''William Charles Baldwin''' (1826–1903) was an English born big game hunter in 19th century South Africa. Born in [[Leyland, Lancashire]], from a young age Baldwin had an innate love of sports, dogs and horses, from the age of six he spent two days a week on a pony following the local [[Harrier (dog)|harriers]]. After school Baldwin tried being a clerk in a shipping office and a farmer but in 1851 he packed his guns, rifles, saddles and seven deerhounds, purchased from [[Charles Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 5th Earl Fitzwilliam|Earl Fitzwilliam's]] gamekeeper at great expense, and sailed for South Africa to hunt elephant. Baldwin hunted from [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] to the [[Zambezi]] and west to [[Lake Ngami]], he claimed to be the second white man to set eyes on the [[Victoria Falls]] in 1860. Baldwin hunted mainly mounted on horseback with local hounds, the deerhounds having proved of little use. He returned to England in 1861, never returning to Africa, in 1863 he published a memoir ''African hunting: from Natal to the Zambezi''.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt;

===Deaf Banks===
'''Frederick Grant "Deaf" Banks''' (1875–1954) was variously a trader, government official, planter, elephant hunter and game ranger in Uganda. Born in London, but raised in Christchurch, New Zealand, Banks went to Africa in 1896 at the age of 21. Initially working with a coastal merchant, Banks moved into coffee planting and then set off on a prospecting trip to the Congo before he took to big game hunting. Banks did most of his hunting in [[Uganda Protectorate]] and the Lado Enclave, and is said to have killed over 1,000 elephants in his life, despite being almost completely deaf. Banks did most of his elephant hunting with a [[6.5×54mm Mannlicher–Schönauer]] in open country and a [[.577 Nitro Express]] double rifle for cover.&lt;ref name=Taylor-Cartridges/&gt;&lt;ref name=CapstickDDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt;&lt;ref name=ampltd/&gt;

===W.D.M. "Karamojo" Bell===
'''[[WDM Bell|Walter Dalrymple Maitland "Karamojo" Bell]]''' (1880–1954) was a Scottish, soldier, fighter pilot, adventurer and elephant hunter. Arriving in Africa at the end of the 19th century, from 1902 Bell hunted elephant professionally in [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], [[Sudan]], the [[Lado Enclave]], [[French Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[French Congo]] and the [[Belgian Congo]]. During his hunting career, Bell shot 1,011 elephants and numerous other game including 25 lions, 16 leopards, 4 white rhinosaurus, 67 black rhinoceros and between 600 and 700 buffalo. Bell was an exceptional shot who preferred to hunt with smaller calibre bolt actioned rifles than large bore double rifles, around 800 of his elephants were killed with a [[.275 Rigby]]. Bell published two books on his time in Africa, ''The wanderings of an elephant hunter'' in 1923 and ''Karamojo safari'' in 1949, along with a number of articles. Bell is considered one of the most successful of Africa's professional elephant hunters.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=BellKaramojo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bellwanderings/&gt;

===Bror Blixen===
'''[[Bror von Blixen-Finecke|Baron Bror Fredrik "Blix" von Blixen-Finecke]]''' (1886–1946) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] baron, writer and professional safari guide. Blixen arrived in Kenya in 1913 with his new wife, his second cousin [[Karen von Blixen-Finecke]]. The marriage did not last, Blixen was a renowned philanderer, and after their separation in 1922 he was forced to flee from his creditors and hide in the bush. Close friend [[Robert Coryndon|Sir Robert Coryndon]] intervened and referred some friends to Blixen to go on safari, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s he guided safaris throughout East Africa, notable clients included [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]]. Blixen returned to Sweden in 1938, where he died eight years later at the age of 59. Blixen hunted extensively with a [[.600 Nitro Express]] double rifle by [[W.J.

After several years he returned to [[New York City|New York]] where he arranged professionally guided hunting trips. Making his first trip to Africa in 1968, Capstick later became a professional hunter and game ranger in Zambia, Botswana, and Rhodesia. Publishing articles about hunting and adventure from the late 1960s, Capstick published his first book ''Death in the Long Grass'' in 1977, establishing his reputation as a writer.&lt;ref name=CapstickDLG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macmillan/&gt;&lt;ref name=KWilson/&gt;

===Cigar===
'''Cigar''' was a 19th-century [[Khoikhoi|hottentot]] elephant hunter. Originally a jockey in [[Grahamstown]], Cigar first hunted elephant for William Finaughty in 1869, keeping half of the ivory from elephants he shot. Finaughty stated Cigar was an excellent horseman and a fair shot, but his fear of elephants prevented him from having any success at that time. Frederick Selous first met Cigar in 1872 when Cigar agreed to take Selous elephant hunting; by then he had completely overcome his fear of elephants. At the time Cigar employed two native hunters and three porters; Selous described Cigar as a slightly built active man with wonderful endurance and a very good game shot who hunted with an old heavy [[6 bore]] muzzleloader. Cigar originally hunted elephant from horseback with Finaughty, but when Selous met him he hunted them on foot due to tsetse flies.&lt;ref name=Finaughty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Millais/&gt;&lt;ref name=Selous-Wanderings/&gt;

===William Finaughty===
'''William "Old Bill" Finaughty''' (1843–1917) was a 19th-century elephant hunter in Southern Africa. Born in Grahamstown, in 1864 at age 21 Finaughty travelled to [[Matabeleland]] to trade; chief [[Mzilikazi]] was friendly to his party and he witnessed a dance of 25,000 warriors. Shooting his first elephants on that trip, after making further expeditions in 1865 and 1866, Finaughty decided to hunt elephant professionally in 1867, which he did until 1876. Finaughty did all of his hunting from horseback, predominantly with a [[4 bore]] muzzle loader, which fired a 4 oz bullet driven by "a handful of powder", whose recoil would leave his shoulder black and blue after a day’s elephant hunting and on a number of occasions knocked him out of the saddle. On one of his last hunts Finaughty used a "newly-invented" breech loading rifled 12 bore, and the memory of its recoil still made his eyes water 30 years later. It is believed Finaughty killed over 400 elephants in his life. He retired from elephant hunting when most elephants moved into tsetse fly country, not wanting to risk himself or his horses. In 1913, American Mr G.L. Harrison interviewed Finaughty, and upon his return to the United States he published Finaughty's recollections in ''The recollections of William Finaughty - elephant hunter 1864-1975''.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finaughty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fadala/&gt;&lt;ref name=McIntyre/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZimFieldGuideFinaughty/&gt;

It is said that Hartley discovered gold in the Hartley Hills (later named in his honour) in 1866 near where he made his annual hunting camp, guiding [[Karl Mauch]] back the following year who confirmed the presence of gold, their announcing the discovery led to South Africa's gold rush. In 1869 Hartley escorted [[Thomas Baines]] to these goldfields. Hartley did all of his hunting from horseback, it is believed he shot between 1,000 and 1,200 elephant in his life, he eventually died from injuries caused by a rhinoceros collapsing on top of him after he had shot it.&lt;ref name=MacKenzie-huntingethos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZimFieldGuideBaines/&gt;

It is believed Larsen had shot over 300 elephants by 1909, and he continued to hunt in West Africa for another 17 years. One of Larsen's favourite weapons for elephant was a [[.600 Nitro Express]] by [[W.J. Jeffery &amp; Co]]. One incident recorded about Larsen occurred on 20 January 1909, whilst on the trail of a wounded bull elephant in the [[Benguela Province|district of Benguela]], he came upon a pride of lions, killing seven of them in two minutes with nine shots from his .600 Nitro Express.&lt;ref name=Taylor-Cartridges/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;

===Harry Manners===
'''Harry Manners''' (1917–1997) was a 20th-century South African elephant hunter. Born in [[Grootfontein]] to an English father and German mother, Manners shot his first elephant aged 17 using an old [[10.75 x 68mm Mauser]] rifle. In 1937 Manners moved to the [[Portuguese East Africa]]n hinterlands to take up elephant hunting, at the time there were no hunting restrictions there, he continued to hunt elephant (also selling the meat) professionally until 1953 when commercial ivory hunting was closed in Portuguese East Africa. Manners shot approximately 1,000 elephants in his life, his finest tusker had tusks weighing {{convert|185|and|183|lb|kg}}, the fourth largest African tusks ever recorded, he estimated that for every elephant he shot with tusks in the {{convert|90|to|100|lb|kg}} range, he had to walk {{convert|100|mi|km}}. Manners predominantly hunted with a [[Winchester Model 70]] firing the [[.375 H&amp;H Magnum]] over iron sights (he thought a rifle scope added unnecessary weight), although for a period when .375 H&amp;H ammunition was suddenly unavailable he resorted to a [[.30-06 Springfield]], although he only killed 40 elephants with it and only under the most certain conditions. Manners later ran a curio shop in the [[Skukuza]] camp in [[Kruger National Park]], where he was a tourist attraction himself, in 1980 he published his autobiography, ''Kambaku!''.&lt;ref name=CapstickLIH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Manners/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

===William Cotton Oswell===
'''[[William Cotton Oswell]]''' (1818–1893) was an English born 19th century explorer and big game hunter. In 1837 Oswell entered the service of the [[British East India Company]], whilst in India he enjoyed fox [[coursing]] with [[Afghan hound]]s, [[pig sticking]], [[snipe]] shooting, and big game hunting, shooting [[Sambar deer|sambar]], [[chital]] and bear, although in 1844 after suffering from severe malaria he was sent to the [[Cape Colony]] to recover. Once Oswell arrived in Africa his health quickly recovered and over the next 8 years, except for a short period in England and India, he spent his time exploring and hunting. No source describes the total amount of game Oswell shot, but he shot large numbers of elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo, hippopotamus, giraffe and quagga. Every animal Oswell shot, except 3 elephant, were subsequently completely eaten by his camp followers or local tribesmen, he once fed 600 highly emaciated men, women and children of the Bakaa tribe for 7 weeks and sent them home with an abundant supply of meat. According to Sir Samuel Baker, Oswell "was a first-rate horseman, and all of his shooting was from the saddle, or by dismounting for a shot after he had run his game to bay."  Always shooting game from the closest possible range, Oswell had horses he was riding killed by buffalo and white rhinoceros, and on one occasion a lioness landed on his horse's rump. Oswell did almost all of his hunting with a double-barrelled [[10 bore]] muzzle loader made by [[James Purdey &amp; Sons|Purdey]] which weighed {{convert|10|lb|kg}}, fired 5 to 6 drams (8.9 to 10.6 g) of fine powder and was specially built to fire solid balls.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyell/&gt;

After the Boer War, Pearson remained in Africa and in 1904 he arrived in Kenya to hunt elephant. In 1907 Pearson moved into the [[Lado Enclave]] to poach elephant, returning to Kenya in 1911 to recommence licensed hunting, which he did until the start of the [[Great War]] when he enlisted to the intelligence department. After the war Pearson joined the Uganda Game Department as an elephant hunter, controlling elephant numbers which were causing significant damage to crops. In 1928 the Prince of Wales (later [[King Edward VIII]]) travelled through East Africa including Uganda, Pearson was charged with organising a hunting safari and for 8 days the Royal party hunted under Pearson's guidance. On the last day of the safari, a rogue bull elephant charged the Royal Party and Pearson placed himself between the Prince and the elephant, shooting with lethal effect. [[William Frederick Gowers|Sir William Gowers]], Governor of Uganda, later wrote "It was an exhibition of presence of mind, quickness and courage which I am glad to have been privileged to witness, and which none of those who saw it will ever forget." The Prince gave Pearson a royal tie pin and cufflinks as mementoes of the occasion. It is believed Pearson shot over 1,000 elephants over the course of his life, he used a Rigby Mauser .350 Rigby, a W.J.

Embarking on his first expedition in 1890, Powell-Cotton made 28 expeditions over a 50-year period throughout Africa and Asia to gather and categorise zoological and ethnographical specimens. Powell-Cotton was primarily concerned with contributing to scientific knowledge through preservation and documentation, not with indiscriminately collecting trophies, returning with their remains to Britain to be mounted by renowned London taxidermist [[Rowland Ward]]. The [[Powell-Cotton Museum]], built to house his specimens, contains over 16,000 mammal skeletons and skins but also includes butterflies, insects and birds. Among his most famous specimens was one of the largest tuskers ever killed, the pair of tusks weighed {{convert|372|lb|kg}}, the largest tusk was {{convert|9|ft|m}} long, {{convert|25|in|cm}} in diameter and weighed {{convert|198|lb|kg}}.

In 1911 Rainey set sail from New York with a pack of 15 Southern [[American Foxhound]]s, having informed a correspondent of ''The New York Times'' that his "principle desire" was "to trap wild animals and bring them back alive." Instead, Rainey is said to have killed over 200 lions using this pack. In an editorial, ''The New York Times'' later questioned Rainey's sportsmanship, equating his hunting to "butcher's work", [[John Guille Millais]] wrote "Paul Rainey's method of hunting lions with a large pack of hounds can hardly come into the true category of lion-hunting where risks are taken. The dogs, it is true, were often killed or wounded; but as a friend who had taken part in the hunts remarked: 'It is just like rat-hunting, and about as dangerous'."  Rainey subsequently made a wildlife film of his hunting in Africa, ''Paul Rainey's African Hunt'', released in April 1912 it was the largest money-making wildlife film of the decade.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Millais/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitman/&gt;

Between 1887 and 1892 Sharpe used an [[8 bore]] double rifle and a single barrelled [[4 bore]], whilst in 1893 he acquired his first [[bolt action]]ed rifle, preferring them to doubles from that time on due to the availability for more than two shots. Sharpe hunted extensively with a [[.333 Jeffery]] and a [[.404 Jeffery]], on an expedition in 1916 he used a [[.600 Nitro Express]] double rifle but discarded it after an incident involving four elephants, having shot the first two he was charged by the remaining animals before he had time to reload.&lt;ref name=Lyell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beolens-Watkins-Grayson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kalinga/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharpe/&gt;

Stigand once crawled into a cave after another wounded lion which, luckily for him, had died by the time he reached it. Stigand wrote several books including ''Hunting the elephant in Africa'' and ''The game of British East Africa'', he usually used a [[.256 Mannlicher]] for elephants, rhinoceros, lion, buffalo and smaller game, he also used an old big bore [[.450 Nitro Express]] double rifle which he usually had a gun bearer carry for him.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill-Sudan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stigand-Hunting/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stigand-East-Africa/&gt;

Taylor experimented widely with different types of hunting rifles, cartridges and bullet types throughout his career, his books ''African rifles and cartridges'' and ''Big game and big game rifles'' explore the practical application of bullet ballistics and type including articulating the "[[Taylor KO factor]]" to calculate the "knock out" value (a "knock out" meant that the elephant was sufficiently stunned by the hit that he would not immediately turn on the hunter) of cartridges and bullet types. Taylor's writings also discuss numerous American, British and European cartridges as well as rifle actions with comparative notes on [[double rifle]]s, [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine rifles]] and [[single-shot rifle]]s.

[[John Manwood]] listed the five animals protected by law for the early Norman kings as the [[Hart (deer)|hart]], hind (both [[red deer]]), [[Wild boar|boar]], [[hare]] and [[wolf]], and it is assumed from the few hunting accounts of William's sons that the royal hunt was conducted on horseback with hounds. The royal accounts of 1136 from [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] detail payments to over 100 hunt servants and archers as well as payments for numerous horses and hounds, the hounds were divided into the wolf pack, the king's pack and the main pack, the first two for the king's recreational hunting, the last for use by royal servants for supplying game to the royal table.&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Manwood/&gt;

===Louis XV of France===
'''[[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]''' (1710–1774) was [[King of France]] from 1715 to 1774. To the King hunting was an all-absorbing affair, in 1722 he drove from his coronation to his first hunt in the [[Villers-Cotterêts]] forest and by 1725 he hunted 276 days in the year and in that same year he was at the death of 362 kills, having ridden 3,121 leagues (12,166&amp;nbsp;km) behind his hounds. The King hunted with a huge pack of hounds called ''The Great Pack'', made up of 40 to 90 couples (80 to 180 hounds) of different breeds, the number increasing during his reign. The pack was actually three packs divided between the game hunted, wild boar, wolf and red deer, and employed a staff of over 500 noblemen (each being on duty for 3 months at a time) and 250 horses, with a further 2,000 horses available for the use by the King, his courtiers and guests. Between 1743 and 1767 the kills of red deer alone by the Great Pack was 2,651 stags.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hancock/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;

===Victor Emmanuel II of Italy===
'''[[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]]''' (1820–1878) was [[Kingdom of Sardinia|King of Sardinia]] from 1849 to 1861 and [[King of Italy]] from 1861 to 1878. The King is credited with saving the [[Alpine ibex]] from extirpation from the Alps by creating the Royal Hunting Reserve of the Gran Paradiso in 1856. At the time of its creation there were estimated to be only 60 animals remaining in the Alps, the creation of the park and the appointment of a staff of 55 game keepers to watch and ward the remaining animals saw their numbers climb to between 500 and 1,000 head by 1877, this in spite of the King shooting on average 50 head a year. In 1920 the Royal Hunting Reserve formed the basis of [[Gran Paradiso National Park]] by which time it held over 4,000 head of ibex. An enthusiastic alpine sportsman, the King is believed to have shot around 232 male ibex, 22 female ibex and over 700 chamois in his life.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baillie-Grohman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Riley/&gt;

'''[[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Ernest II]]''' (1818–1893) was the [[Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] from 1844 to 1893. The Duke held various extensive sporting estates including [[Reinhardsbrunn]] near [[Gotha]], [[Schloss Rosenau, Coburg|Schloss Rosenau]] near [[Coburg]], an estate at [[Hinterriß]] and a boar forest in [[Alsace]] and much of his year was spent hunting; he was also a frequent guest of his brother [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] at [[Balmoral Castle]]. The Duke shot 3,283 red deer and over 2,000 chamois in his life, as well as numerous boar, roe deer and small game, much of the shooting was stalked although in the forests of [[Thuringia]] the deer was usually driven and as the Duke aged, the chamois at Hinterriß were also driven. The Duke's favourite rifle was a [[.450 Black Powder Express]] by [[Alexander Henry (gun maker)|Alexander Henry]] with which he shot running deer out to {{convert|440|m|yd}}.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baillie-Grohman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Riley/&gt;

===John George I, Elector of Saxony===
'''[[John George I, Elector of Saxony|John George I]]''' (1585–1656) was the [[Elector of Saxony]] from 1611 to 1656. The Electors of Saxony were by ancient hereditary "Lord High Masters of the Chase" of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and John George I and his son John George II were possibly the greatest slaughterers of big game in history.&lt;ref name=Baillie-Grohman/&gt;  Over the course of his life John George I shot 35,421 red deer, 1,045 fallow deer, 11,489 roe deer, 31,902 wild boar, 238 bears, 3,872 wolves, 217 lynxes, 12,047 hares, 19,015 foxes, 37 beavers, 930 badgers, 81 otters and 149 wild cats. These huge numbers of game were killed by a system of elaborate palisades and hundreds of game beaters who drove the game in enormous numbers to within range of the hunters and their still primitive muzzleloading firearms. John George I was also an enthusiastic organizer of area [[blood sport]]s for the amusement of his court, using the great open market of Dresden as the stage he would pit [[aurochs]] brought from Poland against bears or wild boar and stag against wolves and occasionally the Elector would enter the arena himself to dispatch an animal with a spear, these events usually culminated in members of court participating in some [[fox tossing]]. It is said that John George I rejected the offer of the throne of [[Bohemia]] because the deer in Bohemia were smaller and fewer than those of Saxony.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baillie-Grohman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blackmore/&gt;

===John George II, Elector of Saxony===
'''[[John George II, Elector of Saxony|John George II]]''' (1613–1680) was Elector of Saxony from 1656 to 1680.

In 1665 John George II rebuilt at enormous expense a high palisade fence originally built by his ancestor [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]] in the preceding century and had fallen into disrepair. The fence ran the entire length of the border between Saxony and Bohemia and was rebuilt to prevent the Elector's stags from straying from his country.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baillie-Grohman/&gt;

===James VI and I of Scotland and England===
'''[[James VI and I]]''' (1566-1625) was [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scotland]] as '''James VI''' from 1567 to 1625 and [[King of England]] and [[Monarchy of Ireland|Ireland]] as '''James I''' from 1603 to 1625.  James' reign was marked by his passion for hunting, he reimposed many previously relaxed game and forest laws, took a close interest in the royal forests and claimed the royal right to hunt all game all over England. Providing James with good days hunting was seen as a valuable way to curry favour with the king, although his secretaries often complained of delays in getting his signature due to his frequent lengthy absences hunting and various foreign ambassadors were on occasion kept waiting for weeks while James was away on an extended hunting trip. James born small and unable to walk properly or hold himself upright without experiencing pain in his legs, but he had considerable stamina mounted and he maintained to his couriers and ministers his need to hunt frequently to protect his health.  James usually hunted stag and hare mounted with a pack of hounds.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meysey-Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray/&gt;

At the age of 14 Collier ran away to follow his owners, Howell and Thomas Hinds, into the [[Confederate Army]] (against their express orders because of his age), he was the only black man to serve in the Confederate Army from Mississippi, later serving in the 9th Texas Cavalry. After the war Collier worked briefly as a cowboy in Texas before returning to Mississippi and to hunting, he is credited with killing over 3,000 bears, hunting bears and cougars with a pack of hounds. Collier gained national fame when he took Theodore Roosevelt bear hunting, having promised a bear for Roosevelt he single-handedly captured and tied a large black bear to a tree, Roosevelt's refusal to shoot the bear as unsportsmanlike led the press to coin the nickname "[[Teddy bear]]".&lt;ref name=Giltner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schullery/&gt;&lt;ref name=US-F&amp;W/&gt;

Hampton did all of his hunting mounted on horseback with a large pack of Southern [[American Foxhound]]s, with which in addition to bears and deer he killed around 16 cougars, several wolf as well as lynx and grey fox. Hampton was described by Theodore Roosevelt as "the mightiest hunter America has ever seen", he usually shot his prey after the hounds had brought it to bay, although he also killed 30-40 bear by hand with a knife, letting the hounds distract the bear whilst he walked up behind it to stab its throat.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roosevelt-wilderness/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45193">::''This article is about an integrated health care system, often for elders or those with disabilities, which often relies on a single type of health and social care service called a nursing facility, modernized to assisted living facilities. For specific information on providers of such services, see for example Direct Support Professional, Disability Public Policy (See, also wiki's disability portal), Aging Public Policy, and Field of Gerontology.

'''Long-term care''' ('''LTC''') is a variety of services which help meet both the medical and non-medical needs of people with a [[chronic illness]] or [[disability]] who cannot care for themselves for long periods. Long term care is focused on individualized and coordinated services that promote independence, maximize patients' quality of life, and meet patients' needs over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of the U.S. Health Care System|last=Leiyu Shi and Douglas Singh|first=|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning; 4 edition|date=December 8, 2015|isbn=1284100553|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for long-term care to provide custodial and non-skilled care, such as assisting with [[activities of daily living|normal daily tasks]] like [[clothing|dressing]], feeding, using the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kernisan|first1=Leslie|title=Activities of Daily Living: What Are ADLs and IADLs?|url=https://www.caring.com/articles/activities-of-daily-living-what-are-adls-and-iadls|publisher=Caring|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, long-term care involves providing a level of medical care that requires the expertise of skilled practitioners to address the multiple chronic conditions associated with older populations. Long-term care can be provided at home, in the community, in [[assisted living]] facilities or in [[nursing home]]s. Long-term care may be needed by people of any age, although it is a more common need for [[senior citizens]].&lt;ref name="WHO Bulletin"&gt;[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/1/12-020112.pdf "Defusing the demographic "time-bomb" in Germany."] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2012;90:6–7 | {{doi|10.2471/BLT.12.020112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of long-term care==
Long-term care can be provided formally or informally. Facilities that offer formal LTC services typically provide living accommodation for people who require on-site delivery of around-the-clock supervised care, including professional health services, personal care, and services such as meals, laundry and housekeeping.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"&gt;Health Canada. [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/home-domicile/longdur/index-eng.php Long-Term Facilities-Based Care.] Accessed 3 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These facilities may go under various names, such as nursing home, personal care facility, residential continuing care facility, etc. and are operated by different providers.

While the US government has been asked by the LTC (long-term care) industry ''not'' to bundle health, personal care, and services (e.g., meal, laundry, housekeeping) into large facilities, the government continues to approve that as the primary use of taxpayers' funds instead (e.g., new assisted living). Greater success has been achieved in areas such as supported housing which may still utilize older housing complexes or buildings, or may have been part of new federal-state initiatives in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, J. &amp; Wiener, J. (2004). Public funding for long term care services for older people with residential care settings. In: J. Pynoos, P. Hollander-Feldman, &amp; J. Ahers, ''Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults: Obstacles, Options and Opportunities'', pp. 51-80. NY, NY: The Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term care provided formally in the home, also known as [[home care|home health care]], can incorporate a wide range of clinical services (e.g. [[nursing]], [[drug therapy]], [[physical therapy]]) and other activities such as physical construction (e.g. installing hydraulic lifts, renovating bathrooms and kitchens). These services are usually ordered by a [[physician]] or other professional. Depending on the country and nature of the health and social care system, some of the costs of these services may be covered by [[health insurance]] or [[long-term care insurance]].

Modernized forms of long term services and supports (LTSS), reimbursable by the government, are user-directed personal services, family-directed options, independent living services, benefits counseling, mental health companion services, family education, and even self-advocacy and employment, among others. In home services can be provided by personnel other than nurses and therapists, who do not install lifts, and belong to the long-term services and supports (LTSS) systems of the US.

Informal long-term home care is care and support provided by family members, friends and other unpaid volunteers. It is estimated that 90% of all home care is provided informally by a loved one without compensation&lt;ref name="Saltman"/&gt; and in 2015, families are seeking compensation from their government for caregiving.

==Long-term services and supports==
"Long-term services and supports" (LTSS) is the modernized term for community services, which may obtain health care financing (e.g., home and community-based Medicaid waiver services),&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (2011, May 5). HCBS waivers-Section 1915c. Washington, DC: Author. Retrieved in May 2011 from: http://www.cms.gov/MedicaidStWaivprogDemoPG1/05{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (2012).

Retrieved in August 2012 from: http://www.asaging.org/Blog/thirty-years-home-and-community-based{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may or may not be operated by the traditional hospital-medical system (e.g., physicians, nurses, nurse's aides).&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D. (2011). Long term care spending for disability. ''Disability Spending in States: 1997-2008''. Boulder, CO: University of Colorado, Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) &lt;ref&gt;Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities. (2014). ''Long-Term Services and Supports Taskforce''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; which works with the U. S. Congress, has indicated that while hospitals offer acute care, many non-acute, long-term services are provided to assist individuals to live and participate in the community. An example is the group home international emblem of community living and deinstitutionalization,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. &amp; Traustadottir, R. (2005). ''Deinstitutionalization and People with Intellectual Disabilities''. London, UK: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and the variety of supportive services (e.g., [[supported housing]], [[supported employment]], [[supported living]], supported parenting, [[family support]]), supported education.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J. (1991). ''Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities in the Community''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ullmer, D., Webster, S., &amp; McManus. (1991, August). ''Cultivating Competence: Models of Support for Families Headed by Parents with Cognitive Limitations: A National Resource Directory''. Madison, WI: Wisconsin (Governor's) Council on Developmental Disabilities, Supported Parenting Project.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, K. (1993, July). Special Issue on Supported Education, 17(1). ''Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal'', Boston, MA: International Association of Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services and the Department of Rehabilitation Counseling, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also common with aging groups, such as the American Association of Retired Persons ([[AARP]]), which annually surveys the US states on services for elders (e.g., intermediate care facilities, assisted living, home-delivered meals). Long term services and supports are discussed in depth in the forthcoming, ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US'' (Racino, manuscript 2012, in press, 2014) &lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014) ""Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US."" NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; The new US Support Workforce includes the Direct Support Professional, which is largely non-profit or for-profit, and the governmental workforces, often unionized, in the communities in US states. Core competencies (Racino-Lakin, 1988) at the federal-state interface for the aides "in institutions and communities" were identified in aging and physical disabilities, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and behavioral ("mental health") health in 2013 (Larson, Sedlezky, Hewitt, &amp; Blakeway, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Larson, S.A., Sedlezky, L., Hewitt, A., &amp; Blakeway, C. (2014). Chapter 10: Community support services workforce in the US. In: J. Racino, ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US'' (pp. 235-254). London, NY, NY, &amp; Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Barack Obama, US House Speaker John Boehner, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Harry Reid, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell received copies of the US Senate Commission on Long Term Care on the "issues of service delivery, workforce and financing which have challenged policymakers for decades" (Chernof &amp; Warshawsky, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Chernof, B. &amp; Warshawsky, M. (2013, September). ''Commission on Long Term Care: Report to US Congress''. Washington, DC: US Senate.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Commission envisions a "comprehensive financing model balancing private and public financing to insure catastrophic expenses, encourage savings and insurance for more immediate LTSS (Long Term Services and Supports) costs, and to provide a safety net for those without resources." (Ibid, 2013).

The direct care workforce envisioned by the MDs (physicians, prepared by a medical school, subsequently licensed for practice) in America (who did not develop the community service systems, and serve different, valued roles within it) were described in 2013 as: personal care aides (20%), home health aides (23%), nursing assistants (37%), and independent providers (20%) (p.&amp;nbsp;10).&lt;ref&gt;Litvak, S. &amp; Kennedy, J. (1991). ''Policy Issues Affecting the Medicaid Personal Care Services Optional Benefit''. Oakland, CA: World Institute on Disability.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G. (1994). Medicaid PCA Services in Massachusetts: Options and Issues. Washington, DC: National Association of State Developmental Disabilities Services.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, J. &amp; Litvak, S. (1991, December). ''Case Studies of Six State Personal Assistance Service Programs Funded by the Medicaid Personal Care Option''. Oakland, CA: World Institute on Disability.&lt;/ref&gt; The US has varying and competing health care systems, and hospitals have adopted a model to transfer "community funds into hospital"; in addition, "hospital studies" indicate M-LTSS (managed long-term care services) &lt;ref&gt;Saucier, P., Kasten, K., Burwell, B., et al. (2012). ''The Growth of Managed Long-Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) Programs''. Washington, DC: Centers for Medicaid and Medicare and Truven Health Analytics.&lt;/ref&gt; as billable services. In addition, allied health personnel preparation have formed the bulk of the preparation in specialized science and disability centers which theoretically and practically supports modernized personal assistance services across population groups (Litvak &amp; Racino, 1999) &lt;ref&gt;Litvak, S. &amp; Racino, J.

''Contributions to Client-Centered Therapy and the Person-Centered Approach''. Ross-on-the-Wye, United Kingdom: PCCS Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term services and supports (LTSS) legislation was developed, as were the community services and personnel, to address the needs of "individuals with disabilities" for whom the state governments were litigated against, and in many cases, required to report regularly on the development of a community-based system.&lt;ref&gt;Dybwad, G. &amp; Bersani, H. (1996). ''New Voices: Self Advocacy for People with Disabilities''. Cambridge, MA: Brookline Books.&lt;/ref&gt; These LTSS options originally bore such categorical services as residential and vocational rehabilitation or habilitation, family care or foster family care, small intermediate care facilities,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., McCord, W., &amp; Searl, S. (1981). Medicaid dollars and community homes: The community ICF/MR controversy.

These services often have undergone a revolution in payment schemes beginning with systems for payment of valued community options (Smith &amp; Alderman, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G. &amp; Alderman, S.

==Needs for long-term care==
[[File:Nursing home corridor.JPG|thumb|Nurse at a [[nursing home]] in Norway]]
Life expectancy is going up in most countries, meaning more people are living longer and entering an age when they may need care. Meanwhile, birth rates are generally falling. Globally, 70 percent of all older people now live in low or middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/ageing/en/ Ageing and Life Course.] Accessed 3 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries and [[health care system]]s need to find innovative and sustainable ways to cope with the demographic shift. As reported by John Beard, director of the [[World Health Organization]]'s Department of Ageing and Life Course, "With the rapid ageing of populations, finding the right model for long-term care becomes more and more urgent."&lt;ref name="WHO Bulletin"/&gt;

The demographic shift is also being accompanied by changing social patterns, including smaller families, different residential patterns, and increased female labour force participation. These factors often contribute to an increased need for paid care.&lt;ref&gt;London School of Economics and Political Science. [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/150246/Eurohealth-Vol17-No-2-3-Web.pdf Ageing and long-term care.] ''Eurohealth'' 2011, 17(2–3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, the largest percentages of older persons needing LTC services still rely on informal home care, or services provided by unpaid [[caregiver]]s (usually nonprofessional family members, friends or other volunteers). Estimates from the [[OECD]] of these figures often are in the 80 to 90 percent range; for example, in [[Austria]], 80 percent of all older citizens.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2005). ''Long Term Care for Older People''. Paris: OECD.&lt;/ref&gt; The similar figure for dependent elders in [[Spain]] is 82.2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Costa-Font, J., and Patxot, C. (2005). The design of the long-term care system in Spain: Policy and financial constraints. ''Soc. Society'' 4:1, 11–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] estimates that about 9 million American men and women over the age of 65 needed long-term care in 2006, with the number expected to jump to 27 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Demand for Long-Term Care in the U.S. (Updated)|url=http://www.thescanfoundation.org/sites/default/files/us_growing_demand_for_ltc_june_2012_fs.pdf|publisher=The Scan Foundation|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is anticipated that most will be cared for at home; family and friends are the sole caregivers for 70 percent of the elderly. A study by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] says that four out of every ten people who reach age 65 will enter a nursing home at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. [http://ahrq.hhs.gov/research/longtrm1.htm AHCPR Research on Long-term Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714102623/http://ahrq.hhs.gov/research/longtrm1.htm |date=2009-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 10 percent of the people who enter a nursing home will stay there five years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Term Care|url=https://www.senioranswers.org/insurance/long-term-care/|publisher=Colorado Gerontological Society|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on projections of needs in long term care (LTC), the US 1980s demonstrations of versions of Nursing Homes Without Walls (Senator Lombardi of New York) for elders in the US were popular, but limited: On LOK, PACE, Channeling, Section 222 Homemaker, ACCESS Medicaid-Medicare, and new Social Day Care. The major argument for the new services was cost savings based upon reduction of institutionalization.&lt;ref&gt;Weasart, W.G., Cready, C.M., &amp; Pawelak, J.E. (1988, reprinted 2005). The past and future of home and community-based long term care. ''Milbank Quarterly'', 83(4): 1-71.&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrations were significant in developing and integrating personal care, transportation, homemaking/meals, nursing/medical, emotional support, help with finances, and informal caregiving. Weasart concluded that: "Increased life satisfaction appears to be relatively consistent benefit of community care" and that a "prospective budgeting  model" of home and community-based long term care (LTC) used "break-even costs" to prevent institutional care.

==Long-term care costs==
A recent analysis indicates that Americans spent $219.9 billion on long-term care services for the elderly in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;National Health Policy Forum (2014) The Basics: National Spending for Long-Term Services and Supports. Retrieved (January 2015) from www.nhpf.org/library/the-basics/Basics_LTSS_03-27-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Nursing home spending accounts for the majority of long-term care expenditures, but the proportion of home and community based care expenditures has increased over the past 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, R.I., &amp; Benson, W.F., Financing and organizing health and long term care services.

The Medicaid and Medicare health care systems in the US are relatively young, celebrating 50 years in 2015. According to the ''Health Care Financing Review'' (Fall 2000), its history includes a 1967 expansion of to ensure primary and preventive services to Medicaid-eligible children (EPSDT), the use home and community-based Medicaid waivers (then HCBS services), Clinton administration health care demonstrations (under 1115 waiver authority), the new era of SCHIP to cover uninsured children and families, coverage for the HIV/AIDS population groups, and attention to ethnic and racial-based service delivery (e.g., beneficiaries). Later, managed care plans which used "intensive residential children's" options and "non-traditional out-patients services (school-based services, partial hospitalization, in-home treatment and case management) developed "behavioral health care plans".&lt;ref&gt;Cook, J., Fitzgibbon, G., Burke-Miller, J., et al. (2004, Fall). Medicaid behavioral health care plan satisfaction and children's service utilization. ''Health Care Financing Review'', 26(1): 43-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the average annual cost of nursing home care in the United States was $81,030 for a semi-private room. The average annual cost for assisted living was $42,600.  Home health aides were paid on average $12 per hour and homemaker services averaged about $20 per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2012/studies/mmi-2012-market-survey-long-term-care-costs.pdf 2012 MetLife Market Survey of Nursing Home, Assisted Living, Adult Day Services, and Home Care Costs], Metlife Mature Market Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The average cost of a nursing home for one year is more than the typical family has saved for retirement in a 401(k) or an IRA.&lt;ref&gt;George Washington University. (2004). Retirement saving and long-term care needs: An overview. The Retirement Security Project.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, 26 states have contracts with [[managed care]] organizations (MCO) to deliver long-term care for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The states pay a monthly capitated rate per member to the MCOs that provide comprehensive care and accept the risk of managing total costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/states-turn-managed-care-constrain-medicaid-long-term-care-costs |title=States Turn to Managed Care To Constrain Medicaid Long-Term Care Costs |date=2014-04-09 | accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the percentage of elderly individuals in the population rises to nearly 14% in 2040 as predicted, a huge strain will be put on caregivers' finances as well as continuing care retirement facilities and nursing homes because demand will increase dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, R. (2009, 07 20). Elderly to Double to 14% of Global Population by 2040. https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=axV6K65QoAg8.&lt;/ref&gt; New options for elders during the era of choice expansion (e.g., seniors helping seniors, home companions), which includes limitations on physician choices, assisted living facilities, retirement communities with disability access indicators, and new "aging in place" plans (e.g., aging in a group home, or "transfer" to a home or support services with siblings upon parents' deaths-intellectual and developmental disabilities).

Politically, the 21st Century has shifted to the cost of unpaid family caregiving (valued by AARP in aging at $450 billion in 2009), and the governments in the US are being asked to "foot part of the bill or costs" of caregiving for family members in home. This movement, based in part on feminist trends in the workplace, has intersected with other hospital to home, home health care and visiting nurses, user-directed services, and even hospice care. The government's Medicaid programs is considered the primary payer of ''Long Term Services and Supports'' (LTSS), according to the American Association of Retired Persons, Public Policy Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, A., Ujavri, K &amp; Fox-Grange, W. (2012, September). ''In Brief #INB 198''. Washington,DC: AARP Public Policy Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; New trends in family support and family caregiving also affect diverse disability population groups, including the very young children and young adults,&lt;ref&gt;Singer, G., Siegel, D., &amp; Conway, P. (2012). ''Family Support and Family Caregiving Across Disabilities''. Baltimore, MD; Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; and are expected to be high increases in Alzheimer's due to longevity past age 85.

==Long-term care funding==
Governments around the world have responded to growing long-term care needs to different degrees and at different levels. These responses by governments, are based in part, upon a public policy research agenda on long term care which includes special population research, flexible models of services, and managed care models to control escalating costs and high private pay rates.&lt;ref&gt;Binstock, R. and Spector, W. (nd, 1996). ''Five Priority Areas for Research on Long-Term Care''. Washington, DC: Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M.E. and Gengler, D.J. (1993, Fall).

===Europe===
Most [[Western European]] countries have put in place a mechanism to fund formal care and, in a number of [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Continental European]] countries, arrangements exist to at least partially fund informal care as well. Some countries have had publicly organized funding arrangements in place for many years: the [[Netherlands]] adopted the Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (ABWZ) in 1967, and in 1988 [[Norway]] established a framework for municipal payments to informal caregivers (in certain instances making them municipal employees). Other countries have only recently put in place comprehensive national programs: in 2004, for example, [[France]] set up a specific insurance fund for dependent older people and in 2006, [[Portugal]] created a public funded national network for long-term care. Some countries ([[Spain]] and [[Italy]] in Southern Europe, [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]] in Central Europe) have not yet established comprehensive national programs, relying on informal caregivers combined with a fragmented mix of formal services that varies in quality and by location.&lt;ref name="Saltman"&gt;Saltman, R.B., Dubois, H.F.W. and Chawla, M. (2006). The impact of aging on long-term care in Europe and some potential policy responses, ''International Journal of Health Services'', 36(4): 719-746.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, some Nordic countries began making payments to informal caregivers, with [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] allowing relatives and neighbors who were providing regular home care to become municipal employees, complete with regular pension benefits. In [[Finland]], informal caregivers received a fixed fee from municipalities as well as pension payments. In the 1990s, a number of countries with social health insurance ([[Austria]] in 1994, [[Germany]] in 1996, [[Luxembourg]] in 1999) began providing a cash payment to service recipients, who could then use those funds to pay informal caregivers.&lt;ref name="Saltman"/&gt;

In Germany, funding for long-term care is covered through a mandatory insurance scheme (or ''Pflegeversicherung''), with contributions divided equally between the insured and their employers. The scheme covers the care needs of people who as a consequence of illness or disability are unable to live independently for a period of at least six months. Most beneficiaries stay at home (69%).&lt;ref name="WHO Bulletin"/&gt; The country's LTC fund may also make pension contributions if an informal caregiver works more than 14 hours per week.&lt;ref name="Saltman"/&gt;

Major reform initiatives in health care systems in Europe are based, in part on an extension of user-directed services demonstrations and approvals in the US (e.g., Cash and counseling demonstrations and evaluations).&lt;ref&gt;Doty, P., Mahoney, K.J., &amp; Simon-Rusinowitz, L. (2007, February). Designing the cash and counseling demonstration and evaluation. ''Health Service Research'', 42, No. 1.2. Retrieved 10/6/2013, 8:40 pm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014). Individual and public budgeting. ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. (pp. 209-234). London, NY, NY and Boca Raton, FL: Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; Clare Ungerson, a Professor of Social Policy, together with Susan Yeandle, Professor of Sociology, reported on the Cash for Care Demonstrations in Nation-States in Europe (Austria, France, Italy, Netherlands, England, Germany) with a comparative USA ("paradigm of home and community care").&lt;ref&gt;Ungerson, C. &amp; Yeandle, S.

In addition, direct payment schemes were developed and implemented in the UK, including  in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, C. (2006). Direct payments in Scotland. In: J. Leece &amp; J. Bornat, ''Development in Direct Payments''. (pp. 33-48).

These "health care schemes" on the commodification of care were compared to individualised planning and direct funding in the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, P., Lord, J., &amp; Salisbury, B.

Bristol, UK: Polity Press, University of Bristol.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

====Canada====
In Canada, facility-based long-term care is not publicly insured under the [[Canada Health Act]] in the same way as hospital and physician services. Funding for LTC facilities is governed by the provinces and territories, which varies across the country in terms of the range of services offered and the cost coverage.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"/&gt;  In Canada, from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, there were 1,519 long-term care facilities housing 149,488 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Daily — Long-term Care Facilities Survey, 2013|url = http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/150504/dq150504b-eng.htm|website = www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date = 2016-01-19|first = Government of Canada, Statistics|last = Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada-US have a long term relationship as border neighbors on health care; however Canada, similar to the UK (National Health Service), has a system of "socialized medicine" (e.g., US, Bernie Sander's Proposal for Medicare for All during the US Presidential campaign).  In the development of home and community-based services, individualised services and supports were popular in both Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, J. &amp; Hutchinson, P. (2003). Individualised support and funding: Building blocks for capacity building and inclusion. ''Disability and Society'', 18: 71-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian citations of US projects included the cash assistance programs in family support in the US, in the context of individual and family support services for children with significant needs. In contrast, the US initiatives in health care in that period involved the Medicaid waiver authority and health care demonstrations, and the use of state demonstration funds separate from the federal programs.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Bogdan, R., &amp; Racino, J. (1991). ''Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities in the Community''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H.Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D., Hemp, R., Fujiura, G., Bachelder, L., &amp; Mitchell, D. (1990). ''The State of the States in Developmental Disabilities''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Long-term care is typically funded using a combination of sources including but not limited to family members, Medicaid, long-term care insurance and Medicare. One of these includes out-of-pocket spending, which often becomes exhausted once an individual requires more medical attention throughout the aging process and might need in-home care or be admitted into a nursing home. For many people, out-of-pocket spending for long-term care is a transitional state before eventually needing Medicaid coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Gale, W.G., Iwry, M., Orszag, P., Ahlstrom, A., Clements, E., Lambrew, J., Yumlinson, A. (2004) Retirement Saving and Long-Term Care Needs: An Overview.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal savings can be difficult to manage and budget and often deplete rapidly. In addition to personal savings, individuals can also rely on an [[Individual retirement account]], [[Roth IRA]], [[Pension]], [[Severance package]] or the funds of family members. These are essentially [[retirement]] packages that become available to the individual once certain requirements have been met.

In 2008, Medicaid and Medicare accounted for approximately 71% of national long-term care spending in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin Group. (2010). Individuals living in the community with chronic conditions and functional limitations: A closer look. Report prepared under contract #HHS-100-95-0046 for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.&lt;/ref&gt;  Out-of-pocket spending accounted for 18% of national long-term care spending, private long-term care insurance accounted for 7%, and other organizations and agencies accounted for the remaining expenses.  Moreover, 67% of all nursing home residents used Medicaid as their primary source of payment.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, S. R., &amp; Gibson, M. J. (2002). ''Across the States: Profiles of Long-Term Services and Supports (5th ed.)''. Washington, DC: AARP Public Policy Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Private Long-Term Care Insurance in 2017 paid over $9.2 Billion in benefits and claims for these policies continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ltcnews.com/articles/long-term-care-insurance-industry-paid-huge-amount-of-benefits-in-2017&lt;/ref&gt; The largest claim to one person is reported to be over $2 million in benefits &lt;ref&gt;https://www.expertclick.com/NewsRelease/Largest-LongTerm-Care-Insurance-Claim-Being-Paid-Exceeds-2-Million,2018156809.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicaid is one of the dominant players in the nation's long-term care market because there is a failure of private insurance and Medicare to pay for expensive long-term care services, such as nursing homes.  For instance, 34% of Medicaid was spent on long-term care services in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, E., &amp; Elias, R. (2004). Medicaid and long-term care. Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicaid operates as distinct programs which involve home and community-based (Medicaid) waivers designed for special population groups during deinstitutionalization then to community, direct medical services for individuals who meet low income guidelines (held stable with the new Affordable Care Act Health Care Exchanges), facility development programs (e.g., intermediate care facilities for intellectual and developmental disabilities populations), and additional reimbursements for specified services or beds in facilities (e.g., over 63% beds in nursing facilities). Medicaid also fund traditional home health services and is payor of adult day care services. Currently, the US Centers for Medicaid and Medicare also have a user-directed option of services previously part of grey market industry.

In the US, [[Medicaid]] is a government program that will pay for certain health services and nursing home care for older people (once their assets are depleted). In most states, Medicaid also pays for some long-term care services at home and in the community. Eligibility and covered services vary from state to state. Most often, eligibility is based on income and personal resources. Individuals eligible for Medicaid are eligible for community services, such as home health, but governments have not adequately funded this option for elders who wish to remain in their homes after extended illness [[aging in place]], and Medicaid's expenses are primarily concentrated on nursing home care operated by the hospital-nursing industry in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvey, J., &amp; Li, A. (2002). Long Term Care Financing: Options for the Future. Benefits Quarterly, 18(2), 7-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] does not pay for long-term care. Medicare pays only for medically necessary skilled [[nursing]] facility or [[home health care]]. However, certain conditions must be met for Medicare to pay for even those types of care. The services must be ordered by a doctor and tend to be rehabilatative in nature.  Medicare specifically will not pay for custodial and non-skilled care. Medicare will typically cover only 100 skilled nursing days following a 3-day admission to a hospital.

A 2006 study conducted by [[AARP]] found that most Americans are unaware of the costs associated with long-term care and overestimate the amount that government programs such as Medicare will pay.&lt;ref&gt;AARP Press Center. [http://www.aarp.org/research/press-center/presscurrentnews/long_term_care_report.html Long-term care report]&lt;/ref&gt; The US government plans for individuals to have care from family, similar to Depression days; however, AARP reports annually on the Long-term services and supports (LTSS) &lt;ref&gt;AARP. (2012). ''Long-Term Services and Supports in the US''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; for aging in the US including home-delivered meals (from senior center sites) and its advocacy for caregiving payments to family caregivers.

[[Long-term care insurance]] protects individuals from asset depletion and includes a range of benefits with varying lengths of time. This type of insurance is designed to protect policyholders from the costs of long-term care services, and policies are determined using an "experience rating" and charge higher premiums for higher-risk individuals who have a greater chance of becoming ill.&lt;ref&gt;Amaradio, L. (1998). Financing Long-Term Care for Elderly Persons: What Are the Options? Journal of Health Care Finance, 25(2). 75-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now a number of different types of long term care insurance plans including traditional tax-qualified, partnership plans (providing additional dollar-for-dollar asset protect offered by most states), short-term extended care policies and hybrid plans (life or annuity policies with riders to pay for long term care).&lt;ref&gt;http://longtermcareplanningnews.com/articles/new-ltc-policy-options-available-hybrid-long-term-care-and-short-term-care&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of LTC facilities may have certain [[Nursing home residents' rights|legal rights]], including a Red Cross ombudsperson, depending on the location of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements for States and Long Term Care Facilities|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6d9e785c91c433571919f9827481b19d&amp;node=42:5.0.1.1.2&amp;rgn=div5#42:5.0.1.1.2.2.7.1|work=ELECTRONIC CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, government funded aid meant for long-term care recipients are sometimes misused.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' explains how some of the businesses offering long-term care are misusing the loopholes in the newly redesigned New York Medicaid program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Nina|title=Medicaid Shift Fuels Rush for Profitable Clients|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/nyregion/medicaid-shift-fuels-rush-for-profitable-clients.html?_r=0|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government resists progressive oversight which involves continuing education requirements, community services administration with quality of life indicators, evidence-based services, and leadership in use of federal and state funds for the benefit of individual and their family.

For those that are poor and elderly, long term care becomes even more challenging.  Often, these individuals are categorized as "[[Medicare dual eligible|dual eligibles]]" and they qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid.  These individuals accounted for 319.5 billion in health care spending in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Coming Experiments in Integrating and Coordinating Care for 'Dual Eligibles'|last = Meyer|first = Harris|date = June 2012|journal = Health Affairs|doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0505|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now discredited, '''Meadow's Law''' was a precept much in use until recently in the field of child protection, specifically by those investigating cases of multiple cot or crib death – [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]] – within a single family.

== History ==
The "law" has it that because such deaths are a rare phenomenon and difficult to explain by natural causes, we might say that "One is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder unless there is proof to the contrary."&lt;ref name=Obs2001/&gt;

The name is derived from the controversial [[United Kingdom|British]] paediatrician, [[Roy Meadow]], who until 2003 was seen by many as "Britain's most eminent paediatrician" and leading expert on child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article544402.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Sam | last1=Knight | title=Professor Sir Roy Meadow struck off | date=15 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meadow's reputation went into decline with a series of legal reverses for his theories, and the damage was confirmed in July 2005 when he was struck off the medical register by the [[General Medical Council]] for tendering misleading evidence.  Meadow's license was reinstated in February 2006 by a London court.

Meadow attributes many unexplained infant deaths to the disorder or condition in mothers called [[Fabricated or Induced Illness|Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy]]. According to this diagnosis some parents, especially mothers, harm or even kill their children as a means of calling attention to themselves.  Its existence has been confirmed by cases where parents have been caught on video surveillance actively harming their children,{{Fact|date=April 2008}} but its frequency is subject to debate as Meadow claimed to have destroyed the original data which he used to substantiate the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/11/sm_sallyclark15.xml&amp;page=3 Daily Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the 1993 trial of [[Beverley Allitt]], a [[pediatrics|paediatric]] nurse convicted of killing four children under her care and injuring five others, Meadow's ideas gained ascendancy in British child protection circles, and mothers were convicted of murder on the basis of his expert testimony.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} Thousands of children{{Fact|date=April 2008}} were removed from their parents and taken into care or fostered out because they were deemed to be 'at risk'. From 2003, however, the tide of opinion turned: a number of high-profile acquittals cast doubt on the validity both of Munchausen's and 'Meadow's Law'. Several convictions were reversed, and many more came under review.

=== Attribution to the Di Maios ===
In a note to his mathematical analysis of the [[Sally Clark]] case, Professor Ray Hill endorses a claim that Meadow did not originate the rule:

{{quote |text= Professor Meadow did not originate the law. It appears to be attributable to D. J. and V. J. M. Di Maio, two American pathologists who state in their book:&lt;ref&gt;Dominic J. DiMaio and Vincent J. M. DiMaio, Forensic Pathology, Elsevier, St. Louis MO, 1989, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; ''It is the authors’ opinion that while a second SIDS death from a mother is improbable, it is possible and she should be given the benefit of the doubt. A third case, in our opinion, is not possible and is a case of homicide''. It is clear that the statement is the authors’ opinion. It is not a conclusion reached by analysis of their observations; no supportive data are presented and there are no illustrative [[Case history|case histories]], or references to earlier publications. This is in striking contrast with the rest of the book which is replete with illustrative case histories and cites many references throughout. A recent examination of Meadow’s own contributions to the medical literature has likewise failed to uncover supportive [[pathology|pathological]] evidence or references to it |sign= Dr Glynn Walters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; |source= Letter to Professor Ray Hill, published in ''Multiple sudden infant deaths – coincidence or beyond coincidence?''&lt;ref name="RayHill"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Multiple sudden infant deaths – coincidence or beyond coincidence? |url= http://www.cse.salford.ac.uk/staff/RHill/ppe_5601.pdf |first= R. |last= Hill |journal= Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology |year= 2004 |volume= 18 |pages= 322–323 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3016.2004.00560.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The precept was published in the [[United States]] by DiMaio and DiMaio in 1989, without mention of Meadow. In ''ABC of Child Abuse'', first published in the same year, Meadow wrote his formulation:
{{quote |text= One sudden infant death is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder until proved otherwise' is a crude aphorism but a sensible working rule for anyone encountering these tragedies |sign= Dr Roy Meadow |source= ''ABC of Child Abuse''&lt;ref name=Obs2001&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,4221973-102285,00.html Gene find casts doubt on double 'cot death' murders].  The Observer; 15 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The formula is “clearly fallacious” according to Bob Carpenter, Professor of Medical Statistics at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]], an expert witness in some of the trials where infant cot deaths were prosecuted as homicides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s1288472.htm The Health Report: 24 January 2005 - Repeat Sudden Unexpected and Unexplained Infant Deaths&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Critics of Meadow's law state that it is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of [[statistics]], particularly relating to [[probability]], [[likelihood function|likelihood]], and [[statistical independence]].

At the trial in 1999 of solicitor [[Sally Clark]], accused of murdering her two sons, Meadow testified that the odds against two such deaths happening naturally was 73,000,000:1, a figure which he obtained by squaring the observed ratio of births to [[cot-death]]s in affluent non-smoking families (approximately 8,500:1).

This caused an uproar amongst professional [[statistician]]s, whose criticisms were twofold:

=== The prosecutor's fallacy ===
Firstly, Meadow was accused of espousing the so-called [[prosecutor's fallacy]] in which the probability of "cause given effect" (i.e. the true likelihood of a suspect's innocence) is confused with that of "effect given cause" (the likelihood that innocence will result in the observed double-cot-death). In reality, these quantities can only be equated when the likelihood of the alternative hypothesis, in this case murder, is close to certainty. Since murder (and especially double murder) is itself a rare event, the probability of Clark's innocence was certainly far greater than Meadow's figure suggested.

=== Statistical independence ===
The second criticism was that Meadow's calculation had assumed that cot deaths within a single family were [[statistical independence|statistically independent]] events, governed by a probability common to the entire affluent non-smoking population. No account had been taken of conditions specific to individual families (such as a hypothesised "cot death [[gene]]") which might make some more vulnerable than others. The occurrence of one cot-death makes it likely that such conditions exist, and the probability of subsequent deaths is therefore greater than the group average (estimates are mostly in the region of 1:100).

Combining these corrections with estimates of [[Double murder|successive murder]] probabilities by affluent non-smokers, Mathematics Professor Ray Hill found that the probability of Clark's guilt could be as low as 10% (based solely on the fact of two unexplained child deaths, and before any other evidence was considered).&lt;ref name="RayHill"/&gt;  In any case, a legal [[verdict]] is not to be rendered on the basis of statistics; Hill wrote, "[[Guilt (law)|guilt]] must be proved on the basis of forensic and other evidence and not on the basis of these statistics alone.  My own personal view that she is innocent is based on my subjective assessment of all the aspects"&lt;ref&gt;

'''Mission Zamora''' is an integrated [[land reform]] and land [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] program in [[Venezuela]], created in law by the ''Ley de Tierras'' ("Law of Land"), part of a package of 49 decrees made by [[Hugo Chávez]] in November 2001. The plan is named in honor of [[Ezequiel Zamora]], a 19th-century Venezuelan peasant leader.

== Background ==
Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic [[disinvestment]], governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%—among the highest in Latin America—and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer. The ''Ley de Tierras''—"Law of the Lands"—was passed by presidential decree in November 2001; it included the creation of Plan Zamora to implement [[land reform]]s, including redistribution, in Venezuelan agriculture. The plan was created for several pressing reasons: to stimulate the [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector in Venezuela in order to provide [[food security]] to the country (the only net food importer in [[Latin America]]) and more economic activity, to break up the concentrated economic power of the ''[[latifundio]]s'' (75–80% of land owned by 5% of landowners, 2% owned 60% of farmland;&lt;ref&gt;Seth DeLong, [http://www.counterpunch.org/delong02262005.html Land Reform in Venezuela] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715084735/http://www.counterpunch.org/delong02262005.html |date=2006-07-15 }}, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', February 26/27 2005 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2015}} 60% of agricultors do not possess any land &lt;ref name=Diplo&gt;Maurice Lemoine, [http://mondediplo.com/2003/10/07venezuela Venezuela: the promise of land for the people], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', October 2003 {{en icon}}/{{fr icon}}/{{pt icon}}/{{eo icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2015}}) and redistribute wealth to the poor in Venezuela, and to discourage [[urbanization]], which creates heavy burdens on city services in the [[slum]]s of [[Caracas]] and other Venezuelan cities.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Underutilized or unused private corporate and agricultural estates would now be subject to [[Nationalization|expropriation]] after "fair-market" compensation was paid to the owners. Inheritable, inalienable, and at times communal land grants were also gifted to small farmers and farmer's collectives. The rationale given for this program was that it would provide incentives for the eventual and gradual repopulation of the countryside and provide "[[food security]]" for the country by lessening the present dependence on foreign imports. There are three types of land that may be distributed under the program:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
# government land,
# land that is claimed by private owners, but whose claims the government disputes (including centennially inherited land)
# and underutilized private land (including second homes, and investment property).
To date, the Chávez government has only distributed the first two types of land.

== Legal specifications ==
There are three components to the Plan's legal specifications:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
#A legal limit (a capped limit) on the size of landholdings, which varies based on conditions between 1 and 50&amp;nbsp;km².
#A tax on unused land holdings.
#A program for distribution of government and expropriated (with compensation) unused private lands.

Venezuelan citizens between the age of 18 and 25 or who head a family may petition to benefit from the Plan's land redistribution programs. The Plan's participants are first granted a piece of land to [[wikt:homestead|homestead]] and [[Agriculture|cultivate]]; if they cultivate it continuously for three years, they are then given official title to the land. This government-recognized title may then be inherited by the participants' relations, but its sale is legally proscribed.

== Implementation ==
Three institutions were created to carry out the land distribution program: the ''[[Venezuelan National Land Institute|Instituto Nacional de Tierras]]'' ("National Land Institute"), which oversees [[tenant farmer|land tenancy]]; the ''[[Venezuelan National Rural Development Institute|Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo Rural]]'' ("National Rural Development Institute"), which oversees aid to farmers, including technical expertise and equipment, and the ''[[Venezuelan Agriculture Corporation|Corporación de Abastecimiento y Servicios Agrícolas]]'' ("Agricultural Corporation of Supplies and Services"), to help with marketing. By the end of 2003, 60,000 families had received temporary title to a total of 55,000&amp;nbsp;km² of land under this plan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The taking of private land proved controversial among Venezuelan land owners since the introduction of The Land Law of 2001, with one Chávez ally, former governor of [[Cojedes (state)|Cojedes state]] Jhonny Yanez Rangel stating during a speech that "private property … is a right, but not absolute", while also placing emphasis on the importance of "the collective interest".&lt;ref name=AZ&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela eyes private land for agrarian reforms|url=http://azdailysun.com/venezuela-eyes-private-land-for-agrarian-reforms/article_2e0d0ad0-40ea-5f6f-9aa6-d6ddc133210f.html|accessdate=11 July 2015|agency=[[Arizona Daily Sun]]|date=8 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Gatestone Institute]] in 2010, Chávez began to intensify land takeovers.&lt;ref name=GI2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahjar-Barducci|first1=Anna|title=Venezuela: Chavez "Intensifies" Land Takeovers|url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/1804/venezuela-chavez-land-takeovers|website=[[Gatestone Institute]]|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military was often involved in land takeovers, with some allegations of the [[Bolivarian National Guard]] violently taking land from families.&lt;ref name=AZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=GI2011/&gt; In 2010, Venezuela tied with [[Chad]] and [[Zimbabwe]] for 2nd worst property rights in the world according to the [[International Property Rights Index]].&lt;ref name=GI2011/&gt; By 2014, the International Property Rights Index rated Venezuela as having the worst property rights in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=he International Property Rights Index 2014 |url=http://internationalpropertyrightsindex.org/countries?f=ipri&amp;o=desc |website=[[International Property Rights Index]] |accessdate=11 July 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711100438/http://internationalpropertyrightsindex.org/countries?f=ipri&amp;o=desc |archivedate=July 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study carried out at [[Bristol University]] examining the diets of British toddlers found that such fears were overstated.  The study found that while children in the lowest fat group had lower intakes of [[zinc]] and [[vitamin A]], children in the highest fat group ingested less [[iron]] and [[vitamin C]]. Overall the children were not seriously deprived of any essential nutrients, regardless of their diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

'''Multimedia psychotherapy''' is a new form of [[psychotherapy]] created by psychoanalyst Domenico A. Nesci (member of the [[International Psychoanalytic Association]]) and his son, producer artist [[Filippo Nesci (artist and producer)|Filippo A. Nesci]], in Rome, Italy, in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Perlstein: [http://internationalfilmreview.net/2015/08/22/producer-filippo-nesci-continues-the-nesci-familys-successful-film-lineage/ "Producer Filippo Nesci Continues the Nesci Family's Successful Lineage of Innovative Creations"] ''International Film Review'', August 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The method was originally conceived as a technique to help mourning patients suffering from [[grief]] and bereavement.

== Methodology ==
Multimedia psychotherapy consists in a series of sessions (approximately 5 to 8 different sessions) scheduled in the following order:
intake, picture sessions, music session, screening session, outcome.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Nesci, "Multimedia Psychodynamic Psychotherapy: a Preliminary Report." ''Journal of Psychiatric Practice'' 06/2009; 15(3):211-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

# In the ''intake'', the therapist screens suitable patients and explains how the therapy works if he/she thinks that the technique can be effectively and safely applied.
# During the ''picture sessions'' the patient brings photographs or videos of his/her lost love object (the person who had died) and freely associates on them (as if they were dreams) while recalling memories.
# During the ''music session'' the therapist asks the patient to remind a song or a music that fits well to become the soundtrack of the "psychodynamic montage" that will be later produced by the producer/artist.
# At this point, therapist and multimedia artist briefly meet and discuss the case. Patient's pictures and music are given to the artist by the therapist, so that there is no direct contact between patient and artist, at any time, during the whole therapy. When the artist has produced the "psychodynamic montage" (or "memory object") this is delivered to the therapist who can now schedule the ''screening session'' with the patient. During this central session, patient and therapist watch together the video and share the usually strong emotions it is able to promote. A few sessions then take place to help patient to engage in his/her blocked working through of the (repressed or disavowed) mourning process.
# The ''psychodynamic montage'' is finally given to the patient and/or posted on a website where the patient and his/her relatives can see it (with a password).

'''''Mycoplasma''''' are a [[mollicute]] genus of [[bacteria]] that lack a [[cell wall]] around their [[cell membrane|cell membranes]].&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | pages=409–12 |edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This characteristic makes them naturally resistant to many common [[antibiotics]] such as [[penicillin]] or other [[beta-lactam]] antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. They can be [[parasitic]] or [[saprotrophic]]. Several species are [[pathogen]]ic in humans, including ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'', which is an important cause of [[atypical pneumonia]] and other respiratory disorders, and ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]]'', which is believed to be involved in [[pelvic inflammatory diseases]]. ''Mycoplasma'' species are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infectious Diseases of the Female Genital Tract | publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2009|author1=Richard L. Sweet |author2=Ronald S. Gibbs }}&lt;/ref&gt; can survive without oxygen, and come in various shapes. For example, ''M. genitalium'' is flask-shaped (about 300 x 600 [[nanometers|nm]]), while ''M. pneumoniae'' is more elongated (about 100 x 1000 [[nanometers|nm]]). Hundreds of mycoplasma species infect animals.&lt;ref name="LarsenHwang2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsen|first1=Bryan|last2=Hwang|first2=Joseph|title=Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: A Fresh Look|journal=Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=2010|year=2010|pages=1–7|issn=1064-7449|doi=10.1155/2010/521921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''mycoplasma'', from the Greek μυκής, ''mykes'' (fungus) and πλάσμα, ''plasma'' (formed), was first used by [[Albert Bernhard Frank]] in 1889 to describe an altered state of plant cell cytoplasm resulting from infiltration by fungus-like microorganisms.&lt;ref name="Krass_1973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krass CJ, Gardner MW | title = Etymology of the Term Mycoplasma| journal = Int.

Later, the name for ''Mycoplasma'' was '''pleuropneumonia-like organisms''' (PPLO), broadly referring to organisms similar in colonial morphology and filterability to the causative agent (a mycoplasma) of [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]].&lt;ref name="Edward"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Edward DG, Freundt EA | title = The classification and nomenclature of organisms of the pleuropneumonia group | journal = J.

&lt;!--==History==
 removed uncited section
The lack of a cell wall conveys some unique properties of mycoplasmas such as sensitivity to osmotic shock and detergents, resistance to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, and formation of fried-egg shaped colonies. Sections of mycoplasmas reveal that their cells are essentially built of three organelles: the cell membrane, ribosomes, and a circular double stranded DNA tightly packed molecule. Their mode of replication is no different from that of other [[prokaryotes]] dividing by [[binary fission]]. For binary fission to happen, cytoplasmic division must fully synchronize with genome replication and in mycoplasmas cytoplasmic replication lags behind genome replication, which ultimately results in the formation of multinucleated filaments.

From ''in vitro'' cultivation of mycoplasmas it has been discovered that they are "fastidious", i.e. difficult to cultivate. The reasons for these difficulties for species such as ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' and ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' is the lack of all the genes involved in amino acid synthesis, making them dependent on exogenous supply of amino acids and other nutrients. This dependence on exogenous supplies of fatty acids and cholesterol serves as an advantage to conduct further studies on these organisms. In order to compensate for these deficiencies mycoplasmas are grown on complex media, usually consisting of beef heart infusion, peptone, yeast extract, and serum with various supplements.

Mycoplasmas' lack of a cell wall makes them good models for membrane studies. Due to this reason the availability of these membranes in pure state have enabled their chemical, enzymatic and antigenic characterization. The membrane is made of 60% to 70% protein with the remaining 20% to 30% being lipids.&lt;ref name = "Razin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Razin S, Hayflick L | title = Highlights of mycoplasma research—An historical perspective | journal = Biologicals | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–90 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20149687 | doi = 10.1016/j.biologicals.2009.11.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Over 100 species have been included in the genus ''Mycoplasma''. Microbes of the class [[Mollicutes]], to which Mycoplasma belongs, are [[parasite]]s or [[commensal]]s of humans, animals, and plants. The genus ''Mycoplasma'' uses [[vertebrate]] and [[arthropod]] hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maggi|first1=Ricardo G.|last2=Compton|first2=Sarah M.|last3=Trull|first3=Chelsea L.|last4=Mascarelli|first4=Patricia E.|last5=Mozayeni|first5=B.

=== Cell morphology ===
"Due to the lack of a rigid cell wall, Mycoplasmataceae can contort into a broad range of shapes, from round to oblong.  They therefore cannot be classified as rods or cocci."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical Microbiology made ridiculously simple|last=Gladwin, MD|first=Mark|last2=Trattler, MD|first2=William|last3=Mahan, MD|first3=C. Scott|publisher=MedMaster, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1935660156|location=Miami, Fl|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- posible [[WP:COPYVIO]]The [[bacteria]] of the genus ''Mycoplasma'' (trivial name: mycoplasmas) and their close relatives are characterized by lack of a [[cell wall]] which makes them resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalosporin and vancomysin, the major antigen determinants are their cell membrane glycolipids and proteins. Further more the lack of cell wall (no peptidoglycan layer) is the reason that they are gram negative. Despite this, the cells often present a certain shape, with a characteristic small size (it is the smallest free-living bacteria), with typically about 10% of the volume of an ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cell. These cell shapes presumably contribute to the ability of mycoplasmas to thrive in their respective environments. Most are [[Coccus|pseudococcoidal]], but there are notable exceptions. Species of the ''M. fastidiosum'' cluster are rod-shaped. Species of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cluster, including ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'', possess a polar extension protruding from the pseudococcoidal cell body. This tip structure, designated an attachment organelle or terminal organelle, is essential for adherence to host cells and for movement along solid surfaces (gliding motility), and is implicated in normal cell division. ''M. pneumoniae'' cells are pleomorphic, with an attachment organelle of regular dimensions at one pole and a trailing filament of variable length and uncertain function at the other end, whereas other species in the cluster typically lack the trailing filament. Other species like ''[[Mycoplasma mobile|M. mobile]]'' and ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'' have similar structures with similar functions.

Mycoplasmas are unusual among bacteria in that most require [[sterols]] for the stability of their [[cytoplasmic membrane]]. Sterols are acquired from the environment, usually as cholesterol from the animal host. Mycoplasmas generally possess a relatively small [[genome]] of 0. 58-1. 38 megabases, which results in drastically reduced biosynthetic capabilities and explains their dependence on a host. Additionally they use an alternate [[genetic code]] in which the [[codon]] UGA encodes the amino acid [[tryptophan]] instead of the usual [[stop codon]]. They have a low [[GC-content]] (23–40 [[Mole (unit)|mol]]).--&gt;

Cultivation was, and still is difficult because of the complex growth requirements.

These researchers succeeded by inoculating a semipermeable pouch of sterile medium with pulmonary fluid from an infected animal and depositing this pouch intraperitoneally into a live rabbit. After fifteen to twenty days, the fluid inside of the recovered pouch was opaque, indicating the growth of a microorganism. Opacity of the fluid was not seen in the control.

However, this did not work if the material was heated, indicating a biological agent at work. Uninoculated media in the pouch, after removal from the rabbit, could be used to grow the organism [[in vitro]], demonstrating the possibility of cell-free cultivation and ruling out viral causes, although this was not fully appreciated at the time.&lt;ref name="Nocard_Roux_1898"/&gt;--&gt;

The medical and agricultural importance of members of the genus ''Mycoplasma'' and related genera has led to the extensive cataloging of many of these organisms by culture, [[serology]], and small sub-unit [[ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] gene and whole genome sequencing. A recent focus in the sub-discipline of [[molecular phylogenetics]] has both clarified and confused certain aspects of the organization of the class ''Mollicutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Johansson K-E, Pettersson B | chapter = Taxonomy of Mollicutes | title=Molecular Biology and Pathogenicity of Mycoplasmas (Razin S, Herrmann R, eds.)| pages=1–30 | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum | location=New York |year = 2002 | url = | isbn = 0-306-47287-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the [[Bacterial taxonomy#Vernacular names|trivial name]] "mycoplasmas" commonly denoted all members of the class [[Mollicutes]]. The name "Mollicutes" is derived from the Latin mollis (soft) and cutis (skin), and all of these bacteria do lack a cell wall and the genetic capability to synthesize [[peptidoglycan]].

[[Taxonomists]] once classified ''Mycoplasma'' and relatives in the Phylum ''[[Firmicutes]]'', consisting of low G+C [[Gram-positive bacteria]] such as ''[[Clostridium]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', and ''[[Streptococcus]]'', but modern [[polyphasic]] analyses situate them in the Phylum ''[[Tenericutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown DR | chapter = Phylum XVI. Tenericutes Murray 1984a, 356VP | title=Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, Second Edition, Vol. 4, (Krieg NR, Staley JT, Brown DR, et al., eds.)| pages=567–568 | publisher = Springer | location=New York |year = 2011 | url = | isbn = 978-0-387-95042-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order Mycoplasmatales contains a single family, [[Mycoplasmataceae]], comprising two genera: ''Mycoplasma'' and ''[[Ureaplasma]]''. Now ''Mycoplasma'' is a genus in Mollicutes.

Historically, the description of a bacterium lacking a cell wall was sufficient to classify it to the genus ''Mycoplasma'' and as such it is the oldest and largest genus of the class with about half of the class' species (107 validly described), each usually limited to a specific host and with many hosts harboring more than one species, some pathogenic and some commensal. In later studies, many of these species were found to be phylogenetically distributed among at least three separate orders.

A limiting criterion for inclusion within the genus ''Mycoplasma'' is that the organism have a vertebrate host. In fact, the type species, ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides|M. mycoides]]'', along with other significant mycoplasma species like ''M. capricolum'', is evolutionarily more closely related to the genus ''[[Spiroplasma]]'' in the order ''Entomoplasmatales'' than to the other members of the genus ''Mycoplasma''. This and other discrepancies will likely remain unresolved because of the extreme confusion that change could engender among the medical and agricultural communities.

The remaining species in the genus ''Mycoplasma'' are divided into three nontaxonomic groups, ''hominis, pneumoniae'' and ''fermentans'', based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.&lt;br /&gt;The ''hominis'' group contains the phylogenetic clusters of ''[[Mycoplasma bovis|M. bovis]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'', and ''[[Mycoplasma hominis|M. hominis]]'', among others. ''[[Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae|M. hyopneumoniae]]'' is a primary bacterial agent of the porcine respiratory disease complex.

The ''pneumoniae'' group contains the clusters of ''[[Mycoplasma muris|M. muris]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma fastidiosum|M. fastidiosum]]'', ''[[Ureaplasma urealyticum|U. urealyticum]]'', the currently unculturable [[haemotrophic mollicutes]], informally referred to as [[haemoplasmas]] (recently transferred from the genera ''Haemobartonella'' and ''Eperythrozoon''), and the ''M. pneumoniae'' cluster. This cluster contains the species (and the usual or likely host) ''[[Mycoplasma alvi|M. alvi]]'' (bovine), ''[[Mycoplasma amphoriforme|M. amphoriforme]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma gallisepticum|M. gallisepticum]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma imitans|M. imitans]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma pirum|M. pirum]]'' (uncertain/human), ''[[Mycoplasma testudinis|M. testudinis]]'' (tortoises), and ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'' (human). Most, if not all, of these species share some otherwise unique characteristics including an attachment organelle, homologs of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cytadherence-accessory proteins, and specialized modifications of the cell division apparatus.

A study of 143 genes in 15 species of ''Mycoplasma'' suggests that the genus can be grouped into four clades: the ''M. hyopneumoniae'' group, the ''M. mycoides'' group, the ''M. pneumoniae'' group, and a ''Bacillus''-''Phytoplasma'' group.&lt;ref name="pmid17687503"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oshima K, Nishida H | title = Phylogenetic relationships among mycoplasmas based on the whole genomic information | journal = J.

== Laboratory contaminant ==
''Mycoplasma'' species are often found in research laboratories as contaminants in [[cell culture]]. Mycoplasmal cell culture contamination occurs due to contamination from individuals or contaminated cell culture [[Growth medium|medium]] ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Drexler HG |author2=Uphoff CC |title=Mycoplasma contamination of cell cultures: Incidence, sources, effects, detection, elimination, prevention |journal=Cytotechnology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=75–90 |date=2002 |doi=10.1023/A:1022913015916 |pmid=19003295 |pmc=3463982}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mycoplasma'' cells are physically small – less than 1&amp;nbsp; µm, so are difficult to detect with a conventional [[microscope]].

Mycoplasmae may induce cellular changes, including [[chromosome]] aberrations, changes in [[metabolism]] and cell growth. Severe ''Mycoplasma'' infections may destroy a cell line. Detection techniques include [[DNA probe]], [[ELISA|enzyme immunoassays]], [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], plating on sensitive [[agar]] and staining with a [[DNA]] stain including [[DAPI]] or [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]].

An estimated 11 to 15% of U.S. laboratory cell cultures are contaminated with mycoplasma.
A [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]] study showed that half of U.S. scientists did not test for ''Mycoplasma'' contamination in their cell cultures. The study also stated that, in former Czechoslovakia, 100% of cell cultures that were not routinely tested were contaminated while only 2% of those routinely tested were contaminated (study page 6). Since the U.S. contamination rate was based on a study of companies that routinely checked for ''Mycoplasma'', the actual contamination rate may be higher. European contamination rates are higher and that of other countries are higher still (up to 80% of Japanese cell cultures).&lt;ref name=Corning&gt;{{cite news | author = John Ryan | title = Understanding and Managing Cell Culture Contamination | page= 24 |edition = | publisher = Corning Incorporated | year = 2008 | url = http://catalog2.corning.com/Lifesciences/media/pdf/cccontamination.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of these mycoplasmae have shown a strong correlation to [[malignant transformation]] in mammalian cells ''[[in vitro]]''.

==== ''Mycoplasma'' infection and host cell transformation ====

The presence of ''Mycoplasma'' was first reported in samples of cancer tissue in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="pmid7479753" /&gt; Since then, several studies tried to find and prove the connection between ''Mycoplasma'' and cancer, as well as how the bacterium might be involved in the formation of cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid22076306" /&gt; Several studies have shown that cells that are chronically infected with the bacteria go through a multistep transformation. The changes caused by chronic mycoplasmal infections occur gradually and are both [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[genetics|genetic]].&lt;ref name="pmid22076306" /&gt; The first visual sign of infection is when the cells gradually shift from their normal form to sickle-shaped. They also become [[hyperchromatic]] due to an increase of DNA in the nucleus of the cells. In later stages, the cells lose the need for a solid support to grow and proliferate, as well as the normal contact-dependent inhibition cells.&lt;ref name="pmid7479753" /&gt;

==== Possible intracellular mechanisms of mycoplasmal malignant transformation ====

'''Karyotypic changes related to mycoplasma infections'''

Cells infected with ''Mycoplasma'' for an extended period of time show significant chromosomal abnormalities. These include the addition of chromosomes, the loss of entire chromosomes, partial loss of chromosomes, and [[chromosomal translocation]]. All of these genetic abnormalities may contribute to the process of malignant transformation. Chromosomal translocation and extra chromosomes help create abnormally high activity of certain [[proto-oncogenes]], which caused by these genetic abnormalities and include those encoding [[c-myc]], [[HRAS]],&lt;ref name="pmid 11575494 "/&gt; and [[vav (protein)|vav]].&lt;ref name="pmid22076306" /&gt; The activity of proto-oncogenes is not the only cellular function that is affected; tumour suppressor genes are affected by the chromosomal changes induced by mycoplasma, as well. Partial or complete loss of chromosomes causes the loss of important genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation.&lt;ref name="pmid7479753" /&gt; Two genes whose activities are markedly decreased during chronic infections with mycoplasma are the [[Retinoblastoma protein|Rb]] and the [[p53]] tumour suppressor genes.&lt;ref name="pmid22076306" /&gt; Another possible mechanism of carcinogenesis is [[RAC1]] activation by a small GTPase-like protein fragment of Mycoplasma.&lt;ref name=" pmid = 24172987 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu X, Yu J, Zhou X, Li Z, Xia Y, Luo Z, Wu Y | title = A small GTPase-like protein fragment of Mycoplasma promotes tumor cell migration and proliferation in vitro via interaction with Rac1 and Stat3. | journal = J Mol Med Rep | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 173–179 | date = Jan 2014 | pmid = 24172987 | url = http://www.spandidos-publications.com/mmr/9/1/173 | doi=10.3892/mmr.2013.1766}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major feature that differentiates mycoplasmas from other carcinogenic pathogens is that the mycoplasmas do not cause the cellular changes by insertion of their own genetic material into the host cell.&lt;ref name="pmid 11575494 "/&gt; The exact mechanism by which the bacterium causes the changes is not yet known.

; Partial reversibility of malignant transformations

The malignant transformation induced by mycoplasmae is also different from that caused by other pathogens in that the process is reversible. The state of reversal is, however, only possible up to a certain point during the infection. The window of time when reversibility is possible varies greatly; it depends primarily on the ''Mycoplasma'' involved. In the case of ''M. fermentans'', the transformation is reversible until around week 11 of infection and starts to become irreversible between weeks 11 and 18.&lt;ref name="pmid7479753" /&gt; If the bacteria are killed using [[antibiotics]]&lt;ref name="pmid7479753" /&gt; (i.e. [[ciprofloxacin]]&lt;ref name="pmid22076306" /&gt; or [[Clarithromycin]]&lt;ref name="pmid15708077"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pehlivan M, Pehlivan S, Onay H, Koyuncuoglu M, Kirkali Z | title = Can mycoplasma-mediated oncogenesis be responsible for formation of conventional renal cell carcinoma? | journal = Urology | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 411–414 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15708077 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2004.10.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) before the irreversible stage, the infected cells should return to normal.

==== Connections to cancer ''in vivo'' and future research ====

Epidemiologic, genetic, and molecular studies suggest infection and inflammation initiate certain cancers, including those of the prostate. ''M. genitalium'' and ''M. hyorhinis'' induce malignant phenotype in benign human prostate cells (BPH-1) that were not tumorigenic after 19 weeks of exposure.

[[Colon cancer]]: In a study to understand the effects of ''Mycoplasma'' contamination on the quality of cultured human colon cancer cells,  a positive correlation was found between the number of'' M. hyorhinis'' cells present in the sample and the percentage of CD133-positive cells (a glycoprotein with an unknown function).&lt;ref name="pmid 20353562"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mariotti E, Gemei M, Mirabelli P, D'Alessio F, Di Noto R, Fortunato G, Del Vecchio L | title = The percentage of CD133+ cells in human colorectal cancer cell lines is influenced by Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 10 | pages = 120–125 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20353562 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2407-10-120 | pmc=2854114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lung cancer]]: Studies on lung cancer have supported the belief that more than a coincidental positive correlation exists between the appearance of'' Mycoplasma'' strains in patients and the infection with tumorigenesis.&lt;ref name="pmid21999143"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Apostolou P, Tsantsaridou A, Papasotiriou I, Toloudi M, Chatziioannou M, Giamouzis G | title = Bacterial and fungal microflora in surgically removed lung cancer samples | journal = Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery | volume = 6 | page = 137 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21999143 | doi = 10.1186/1749-8090-6-137 | pmc=3212932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prostate cancer]]: p37, a protein encoded for by ''M. hyorhinis'', has been found to promote the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. The protein also causes the growth, morphology, and the gene expression of the cells to change, causing them to become a more aggressive phenotype.&lt;ref name="pmid21663671"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Urbanek C, Goodison S, Chang M, Porvasnik S, Sakamoto N, Li CZ, Boehlein SK, Rosser CJ | title = Detection of antibodies directed at M. hyorhinis p37 in the serum of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 233–238 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21663671 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2407-11-233 | pmc=3129326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renal cancer]]: Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) exhibited a significantly high amount of Mycoplasma sp. compared with the healthy control group. This suggests ''Mycoplasma'' may play a role in the development of RCC.&lt;ref name="pmid15708077"/&gt;

{{Occupational hazards}}
'''Occupational hygiene''' (United States: '''industrial hygiene''' (IH)) is the anticipation, recognition, evaluation, control, and confirmation of protection from hazards at work that may result in injury, illness, or affect the well being of workers. These hazards or stressors are typically divided into the categories [[biological]], [[chemical]], [[Physical hazard|physical]], [[ergonomic]] and [[psychosocial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aioh.org.au/about_occupHygiene.asp|title=Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists|author=|date=|website=aioh.org.au|access-date=2009-05-23|archive-url=https://archive.is/20050717135248/http://www.aioh.org.au/about_occupHygiene.asp|archive-date=2005-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The risk of a health effect from a given stressor is a function of the hazard multiplied by the exposure to the individual or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12209.html|title=Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment|last=Council|first=National Research|doi=10.17226/12209|pmid=25009905|isbn=9780309120463|date=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For chemicals, the hazard can be understood by the dose response profile most often based on toxicological studies or models. Occupational hygienists work closely with toxicologists (see [[Toxicology]]) for understanding chemical hazards, physicists (see [[Physics]]) for physical hazards, and physicians and microbiologists for biological hazards (see [[Microbiology]] [[Tropical medicine]] [[Infection]]) Environmental and occupational hygienists are considered experts in exposure science and exposure risk management.  Depending on an individual's type of job, a hygienist will apply their exposure science expertise for the protection of workers, consumers and/or communities.

The British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS) defines that "occupational hygiene is about the prevention of ill-health from work, through recognizing, evaluating and controlling the risks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bohs.org/standardTemplate.aspx|title=British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS)|author=|date=|website=bohs.org|access-date=2010-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830051500/http://www.bohs.org/standardTemplate.aspx|archive-date=2009-08-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA) refers to occupational hygiene as ''the discipline of anticipating, recognizing, evaluating and controlling [[health]] hazards in the working environment with the objective of protecting worker health and well-being and safeguarding the community at large.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ioha.net|title=Home » IOHA - International Occupational Hygiene Association|website=IOHA - International Occupational Hygiene Association|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "occupational hygiene" (used in the UK and Commonwealth countries as well as much of  Europe) is synonymous with ''industrial hygiene'' (used in the US, Latin America, and other countries that received initial technical support or training from US sources).  The term "industrial hygiene" traditionally stems from industries with construction, mining or manufacturing and "occupational hygiene" refers to all types of industry such as those listed for "industrial hygiene" as well as financial and support services industries and refers to "[[Employment|work]]", "[[wikt:Workplace|workplace]]" and "place of work" in general.  ''Environmental hygiene'' addresses similar issues to ''occupational hygiene'', but is likely to be about broad industry or broad issues affecting the local community, broader society, region or country.

The profession of '''occupational hygiene''' uses strict and rigorous scientific methodology and often requires professional judgment based on experience and education in determining the potential for hazardous exposure risks in workplace and environmental studies.  These aspects of occupational hygiene can often be referred to as the "art" of occupational hygiene and is used in a similar sense to the "art" of [[medicine]]. In fact "occupational hygiene" is both an aspect of [[Preventive medicine|preventive medicine]] and in particular [[occupational medicine]], in that its goal is to prevent industrial disease, using the science of [[risk management]], [[exposure assessment]] and [[industrial safety]].  Ultimately professionals seek to implement "safe" systems, procedures or methods to be applied in the workplace or to the environment.

==The social role of occupational hygiene==
Occupational hygienists have been involved historically with changing the perception of society about the nature and extent of hazards and preventing exposures in the workplace and communities.  Many occupational hygienists work day-to-day with industrial situations that require control or improvement to the workplace situation however larger social issues affecting whole industries have occurred in the past e.g. since 1900, [[asbestos]] exposures that have affected the lives of tens of thousands of people.  Occupational hygienists have become more engaged in understanding and managing exposure risks to consumers from products with new regulations such as REACh ([[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]]).

More recent issues affecting broader society are, for example in 1976, legionnaires' disease or [[legionellosis]]. More recently again in the 1990s [[radon]] and in the 2000s the effects of [[mold]] from indoor air quality situations in the home and at work.  In the later part of the 2000s concern has been raised about the health effects of [[Nanoparticle|nanoparticles]].

Many of these issues have required the coordination over a number of years of a number of medical and para professionals in detecting and then characterizing the nature of the issue, both in terms of the hazard and in terms of the risk to the workplace and ultimately to society.  This has involved occupational hygienists in research, collection of data and to develop suitable and satisfactory control methodologies.

==General activities==
The occupational hygienist may be involved with the assessment and control of [[Physical hazard|physical]], [[Chemical hazard|chemical]], [[biological]] or [[Environmental hazard|environmental]] hazards in the workplace or community that could cause [[injury]] or [[disease]].  Physical hazards may include [[Noise health effects|noise]], [[Temperature extreme|temperature extremes]], [[Over-illumination|illumination extremes]], [[Ionizing radiation|ionizing]] or [[Non-ionising radiation|non-ionizing]] [[radiation]], and [[ergonomics]].  Chemical hazards related to dangerous goods or hazardous substances are frequently investigated by occupational hygienists.  Other related areas including [[indoor air quality]] (IAQ) and [[safety]] may also receive the attention of the occupational hygienist.  Biological hazards may stem from the potential for legionella exposure at work or the investigation of biological injury or effects at work, such as dermatitis may be investigated.

As part of the investigation process, the occupational hygienist may be called upon to communicate effectively regarding the nature of the hazard, the potential for risk, and the appropriate methods of control.  Appropriate controls are selected from the [[Hierarchy of hazard control|hierarchy of control]]: by elimination, substitution, engineering, administration and personal protective equipment (PPE) to control the hazard or eliminate the risk.  Such controls may involve recommendations as simple as appropriate PPE such as a 'basic' particulate dust mask to occasionally designing dust extraction ventilation systems, work places or management systems to manage people and programs for the preservation of health and well-being of those who enter a workplace.

Examples of occupational hygiene include:
[[File:Disposable_foam_earplugs.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Disposable_foam_earplugs.jpg|thumb|270x270px|Disposable foam earplugs: out of the ear with coins for scale (top) and inserted into the wearer's ear (bottom).]]
* Analysis of physical hazards such as noise, which may require the use hearing protection [[earplugs]] and/or [[earmuffs]] to prevent hearing loss.
* Developing plans and procedures to protect against infectious disease exposure in the event of a [[flu pandemic]].
* Monitoring the air for hazardous contaminants which may potentially lead to worker illness or death.

==Workplace assessment methods==
Although there are many aspects to occupational hygiene work the most known and sought after is in determining or estimating potential or actual [[Exposure assessment|exposures]] to hazards.  For many chemicals and physical hazards, [[occupational exposure limits]] have been derived using toxicological, epidemiological and medical data allowing hygienists to reduce the risks of health effects by implementing the "Hierarchy of Hazard Controls".  Several methods can be applied in assessing the workplace or environment for exposure to a known or suspected hazard.  Occupational hygienists do not rely on the accuracy of the equipment or method used but in knowing with certainty and precision the limits of the equipment or method being used and the error or variance given by using that particular equipment or method.  Well known methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in "A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock".&lt;ref&gt;"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock AIHA Press" http://iweb.aiha.org/iweb/Purchase/ProductDetail.aspx?Product_code=AEAK06-327/{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main steps outlined for assessing and managing occupational exposures:
* Basic Characterization (identify agents, hazards, people potentially exposed and existing exposure controls)
* Exposure Assessment (select occupational exposure limits, hazard bands, relevant toxicological data to determine if exposures are "acceptable", "unacceptable" or "uncertain")
* Exposure Controls (for "unacceptable" or "uncertain" exposures)
* Further Information Gathering (for "uncertain" exposures)
* Hazard Communication (for all exposures)
* Reassessment (as needed) / Management of Change
[[File:Hierarchy_of_Occupational_Exposure_Limits.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hierarchy_of_Occupational_Exposure_Limits.JPG|thumb|Hierarchy of occupational exposure limits (OELs)]]

===Basic characterization, hazard identification and walk-through surveys===
The first step in understanding health risks related to exposures requires the collection of "basic characterization" information from available sources.  A traditional method applied by occupational hygienists to initially survey a workplace or environment is used to determine both the types and possible exposures from hazards (e.g. noise, chemicals, radiation).  The '''walk-through survey''' can be targeted or limited to particular hazards such as silica dust, or noise, to focus attention on control of all hazards to workers.   A full walk-through survey is frequently used to provide information on establishing a framework for future investigations, prioritizing hazards, determining the requirements for measurement and establishing some immediate control of potential exposures. The [[Health Hazard Evaluation Program]] from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] is an example of an industrial hygiene walk-through survey. Other sources of basic characterization information include worker interviews, observing exposure tasks, material safety data sheets, workforce scheduling, production data, equipment and maintenance schedules to identify potential exposure agents and people possibly exposed.

The information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the specific type of work from which the hazards can come from. As mentioned previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and official reports of work and the hazards encountered. Of these, the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices, events, releases, hazards and other relevant information. Once the information is gathered from a collection of sources, it is recommended for these to be digitally archived (to allow for quick searching) and to have a physical set of the same information in order for it to be more accessible. One innovative way to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical hazards identification map, which distills the hazard information into an easy to use graphical format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/20-Historical+Hazard+Identification+Process+for+DandD.pdf|title=D&amp;D KM-IT - Deactivation &amp; Decommissioning powered by the global community!|first=FIU ARC, DOE|last=EM|date=|website=www.dndkm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each device is often specifically designed to measure a specific or particular type of contaminant.  Such devices are often subject to multiple interferences.  Electronic devices need to be calibrated before and after use to ensure the accuracy of the measurements taken and often require a system of certifying the precision of the instrument.
====Dust sampling====
Nuisance dust is considered to be the total dust in air including inhalable and respirable fractions.

Various dust sampling methods exist that are internationally recognised. '''Inhalable''' dust is determined using the modern equivalent of the [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]] (IOM) MRE 113A monitor (see section on workplace exposure, measurement &amp; modelling).  Inhalable dust is considered to be dust of less than 100 micrometers aerodynamic equivalent diameter (AED) that enters through the nose and or mouth.  See [[Lungs]]

'''Respirable''' dust is sampled using a cyclone dust sampler design to sample for a specific fraction of dust AED at a set flow rate.  The respirable dust fraction is dust that enters the 'deep lung' and is considered to be less than 10 micrometers AED.

Nuisance, inhalable and respirable dust fractions are all sampled using a constant volumetric pump for a specific sampling period.  By knowing the mass of the sample collected and the volume of air sampled a concentration for the fraction sampled can be given in milligrams (mg) per metre cubed (m3).  From such samples the amount of inhalable or respirable dust can be determined and compared to the relevant [[Occupational exposure limit|occupational exposure limits]].

By use of inhalable, respirable or other suitable sampler (7 hole, 5 hole, et cetera) these dust sampling methods can also used to determine metal exposure in the air.  This requires collection of the sample on a methyl-cellulose ester (MCE) filter and acid digestion of the collection media in the laboratory followed by measuring metal concentration though an atomic absorption (or emission) spectrophotometry.  Both the UK Health and Safety Laboratory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.gov.uk/publications/mdhs.html|title=Health and Safety Laboratory|author=|date=|website=hsl.gov.uk|access-date=2009-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616185829/http://www.hsl.gov.uk/publications/mdhs.html|archive-date=2009-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods  (2003-154) -|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; have specific methodologies for a broad range of metals in air found in industrial processing (smelting, foundries, et cetera).

A further method exists for the determination of asbestos, fibreglass, synthetic mineral fibre and ceramic mineral fibre dust in air.  This is the membrane filter method (MFM) and requires the collection of the dust on a grided filter for estimation of exposure by the counting of 'conforming' fibres in 100 fields through a microscope.  Results are quantified on the basis of number of fibres per millilitre of air (f/ml).  Many countries strictly regulate the methodology applied to the MFM.

====Chemical sampling====
Two types of chemically absorbent tubes are used to sample for a wide range of chemical substances.  Traditionally a chemical absorbent 'tube' (a glass or stainless steel tube of between 2 and 10&amp;nbsp;mm internal diameter) filled with very fine absorbent silica (hydrophilic) or carbon, such as coconut charcoal (lypophylic), is used in a sampling line where air is drawn through the absorbent material for between four hours (minimum workplace sample) to 24 hours (environmental sample) period.  The hydrophilic material readily absorbs water-soluble chemical and the lypophylic material absorbs non water-soluble materials.  The absorbent material is then chemically or physically extracted and measurements performed using various gas chromatograph or mass spectrometry methods.  These absorbent tube methods have the advantage of being usable for a wide range of potential contaminates.  However, they are relatively expensive methods, are time consuming and require significant expertise in sampling and chemical analysis.  A frequent complaint of workers is in having to wear the sampling pump (up to 1&amp;nbsp;kg) for several days of work to provide adequate data for the required statistical certainty determination of the exposure.

In the last few decades, advances have been made in 'passive' badge technology.  These samplers can now be purchased to measure one chemical (e.g. formaldehyde) or a chemical type (e.g. ketones) or a broad spectrum of chemicals (e.g. solvents).  They are relatively easy to set up and use.  However, considerable cost can still be incurred in analysis of the 'badge'.  They weigh 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;grams and workers do not complain about their presence.  Unfortunately 'badges' may not exist for all types of workplace sampling that may be required and the charcoal or silica method may sometimes have to be applied.

From the sampling method, results are expressed in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) or parts per million (PPM) and compared to the relevant [[Occupational exposure limit|occupational exposure limits]].

It is a critical part of the exposure determination that the method of sampling for the specific contaminate exposure is directly linked to the exposure standard used.  Many countries regulate both the exposure standard, the method used to determine the exposure and the methods to be used for chemical or other analysis of the samples collected.

===Exposure management and controls===
The [[hierarchy of control]] defines the approach used to reduce exposure risks protecting workers and communities.  These methods include [[Hazard elimination|elimination]], [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], [[engineering controls]] (isolation or ventilation), [[administrative controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]].  Occupational hygienists, engineers, maintenance, management and employees should all be consulted for selecting and designing the most effective and efficient controls based on the hierarchy of control.

==Professional societies==
The development of industrial hygiene societies originated in the United States, beginning with the first convening of members for the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] in 1938, and the formation of the [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] in 1939. In the United Kingdom, the [[British Occupational Hygiene Society]] started in 1953. Through the years, professional occupational societies have formed in many different countries, leading to the formation of the [http://www.ioha.net/ International Occupational Hygiene Association] in 1987, in order to promote and develop occupational hygiene worldwide through the member organizations.&lt;ref name="ioha3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ioha.net/aboutioha.html|title=About IOHA|publisher=International Occupational Hygiene Association|accessdate=8 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106191127/http://www.ioha.net/aboutioha.html|archive-date=2012-11-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOHA has grown to 29 member organizations, representing over 20,000 occupational hygienists worldwide, with representation from countries present in every continent.&lt;ref name="ioha3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ioha22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioha.net/nationalsocieties.html|title=National Societies|publisher=International Occupational Hygiene Association|accessdate=8 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106191225/http://ioha.net/nationalsocieties.html|archive-date=2012-11-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peer-reviewed literature==
There are several academic journals specifically focused on publishing studies and research in the occupational health field. The ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene'' (JOEH) has been published jointly since 2004 by the [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] and the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]], replacing the former ''American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal'' and ''Applied Occupational &amp; Environmental Hygiene'' journals.&lt;ref name="joeh2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=uoeh20|title=Taylor &amp; Francis Online:: Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene - Aims &amp; Scope|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another seminal occupational hygiene journal would be ''The Annals of Occuapational Hygiene,'' published by the [[British Occupational Hygiene Society]] since 1958.&lt;ref name="annals2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/annhyg/about.html|title=Oxford Journals – Life Sciences &amp; Medicine – ''The Annals of Occupational Hygiene''|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] maintains a searchable bibliographic database (NIOSHTIC-2) of occupational safety and health publications, documents, grant reports, and other communication products.&lt;ref name="nioshtic2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/n2info.asp|title=About NIOSHTIC-2 – CDC/NIOSH|publisher=NIOSH|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occupational hygiene as a career==
Examples of occupational hygiene careers include:
* Compliance officer on behalf of regulatory agency
* Professional working on behalf of company for the protection of the workforce
* Consultant working on behalf of companies
* Researcher performing laboratory or field occupational hygiene work

=== Education ===
The basis of the technical knowledge of occupational hygiene is from competent training in the following areas of science and management.
* Basic Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics (Statistics), Physics);
* Occupational Diseases (Illness, injury and health surveillance (biostatistics, epidemiology, toxicology));
* Health Hazards (Biological, Chemical and Physical hazards, Ergonomics and Human Factors);
* Working Environments (Mining, Industrial, Manufacturing, transport and storage, service industries and offices);
* Programme Management Principles (professional and business ethics, work site and incident investigation methods, exposure guidelines, [[Occupational exposure limit|Occupational exposure limits]], jurisdictional based regulations, hazard identification, risk assessment and risk communication, data management, fire evacuation and other emergency responses);
* Sampling, measurement and evaluation practices (instrumentation, sampling protocols, methods or techniques, analytical chemistry);
* Hazard Controls (elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative, PPE and Air Conditioning and Extraction Ventilation);
* Environment (air pollution, hazardous waste).
However, it is not rote knowledge that identifies a competent occupational hygienist.  There is an "art" to applying the technical principles in a manner that provides a reasonable solution for workplace and environmental issues.  In effect an experienced "mentor", who has experience in occupational hygiene is required to show a new occupational hygienist how to apply the learned scientific and management knowledge in the workplace and to the environment issue to satisfactorily resolve the problem.

To be a professional occupational hygienist, experience in as wide a practice as possible is required to demonstrate knowledge in areas of occupational hygiene.  This is difficult for "specialists" or those who practice in narrow subject areas.  Limiting experience to individual subject like asbestos remediation, confined spaces, indoor air quality, or lead abatement, or learning only through a textbook or “review course” can be a disadvantage when required to demonstrate competence in other areas of occupational hygiene.

Information presented in Wikipedia can be considered to be only an outline of the requirements for professional occupational hygiene training.  This is because the actual requirements in any country, state or region may vary due to educational resources available, industry demand or regulatory mandated requirements.

During 2010, the Occupational Hygiene Training Association (OHTA) through sponsorship provided by the IOHA initiated a training scheme for those with an interest in or those requiring training in occupational hygiene. These training modules can be downloaded and used freely. The available subject modules (Basic Principles in Occupational Hygiene, Health Effects of Hazardous Substances, Measurement of Hazardous Substances, Thermal Environment, Noise, Asbestos, Control, Ergonomics) are aimed at the ‘foundation’ and ‘intermediate’ levels in Occupational Hygiene. Although the modules can be used freely without supervision attendance at an accredited training course is encouraged. These training modules are available from [http://www.ohlearning.com/ OH Learning.com]

Academic programs offering industrial hygiene bachelor's or master's degrees in United States may apply to the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) to have their program accredited.  As of October 1, 2006, 27 institutions have accredited their industrial hygiene programs.  Accreditation is not available for Doctoral programs.

In the U.S. the training of IH professionals is supported by [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] through their [[NIOSH Education and Research Centers]].

===Professional credentials===
====Australia====
In 2005, the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygiene (AIOH) has accredited professional occupational hygienist through a certification scheme.  Occupational Hygienists in Australian certified through this scheme are entitled to use the phrase '''Certified Occupational Hygienist''' (COH) as part of their qualifications.

====United States of America====
Practitioners who successfully meet specific education and work-experience requirements, and pass a written examination administered by the [http://www.abih.org/ American Board of Industrial Hygiene] (ABIH) are authorized to use the term '''Certified Industrial Hygienist''' (CIH) or '''Certified Associate Industrial Hygienist''' (CAIH).  Both of these terms have been codified into law in many states in the United States to identify minimum qualifications of individuals having oversight over certain activities that may affect employee and general public health.

After the initial certification, the CIH or CAIH maintains their certification by meeting on-going requirements for ethical behavior, education, and professional activities (e.g., active practice, technical committees, publishing, teaching).

ABIH certification examinations are offered during a spring and fall testing window each year at more than 400 locations worldwide.

The CIH designation is the most well known and recognized industrial hygiene designation throughout the world. There are approximately 6800 CIHs in the world making ABIH the largest industrial hygiene certification organization. The CAIH certification program was discontinued in 2006. Those who were certified as a CAIH retain their certification through ongoing certification maintenance. People who are currently certified by the ABIH can be found in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713093558/http://www.abih.org/members/roster/rostersearch.cfm public roster].

The ABIH is a recognized certification board by the International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA). The CIH certification has been accredited internationally by the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC 17024) (see ANSI). In the United States, the CIH has been accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards [CESB].

The Association of Professional Industrial Hygienists, Inc. (APIH) was established in 1994 to offer credentialing to industrial hygienists who meet the education and experience requirements found in Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 62, Chapter 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apih.us/|title=Association of Professional Industrial Hygienists|website=apih.us|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; APIH adopted the Tennessee Code as its basis for credentialing because it was the first legal definition in the United States of an industrial hygienist in terms of education and experience. The APIH Registration Committee investigates and verifies, through electronic means or correspondence, both educational and experience accomplishments claimed by each applicant for registration. The Committee determines the appropriate level of registration, '''Registered Industrial Hygienist''' or '''Registered Professional Industrial Hygienist''', and then authorizes the registration certificate to be issued.

====Canada====
In Canada, a practitioner who successfully completes a written test and an interview administered by the [http://www.crboh.ca/ Canadian Registration Board of Occupational Hygienists] can be recognized as a '''Registered Occupational Hygienist''' (ROH) or '''Registered Occupational Hygiene Technician''' (ROHT).  There is also designation to be recognized as a '''Canadian Registered Safety Professional''' (CRSP).

====United Kingdom====
The Faculty of Occupational Hygiene, part of the British Occupational Hygiene Society, represents the interests of professional occupational hygienists.

Membership of the Faculty of Occupational Hygiene is confined to BOHS members who hold a recognized professional qualification in occupational hygiene.

There are three grades of Faculty membership:
* Licentiate (LFOH) holders will have obtained the BOHS Certificate of Operational Competence in Occupational Hygiene and have at least three years’ practical experience in the field.
* Members (MFOH) are normally holders of the Diploma of Professional Competence in Occupational Hygiene and have at least five years’ experience at a senior level.
* Fellows (FFOH) are senior members of the profession who have made a distinct contribution to the advancement of occupational hygiene.

All Faculty members participate in a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) scheme designed to maintain a high level of current awareness and knowledge in occupational hygiene.

====India====
Indian Society of Industrial hygiene was formed in 1981 at Chennai India. Subsequently, its secretariat was shifted to Kanpur. The society has registered about 400 members, about 90 of whom life members. The society publishes a newsletter "Industrial Hygiene Link". The current address of the secretary of the society is Shyam Singh Gautam, Secretary, Indian Society of Industrial Hygiene, 11, Shakti Nagar, Rama Devi, Kanpur 2008005 Mobile number 8005187037.

He was a founding member of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]], and was a key figure in the country's road to independence. Ong served various positions in the government of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] and Malaysia, as a Cabinet minister and ambassador.

He was a Chinese [[Muslim]] convert.

==Early life and education==
Born Ong Yoke Lin on 23 July 1917 in [[Kuala Lumpur]], he attended Pudu Girls' English School and later [[Victoria Institution]], where he was contemporaries of, among others, [[Yahya Abdul Razak]], [[Lee Siew Choh]], [[Yaacob Latiff]] and [[Mahmood Ambak]], the father-in-law of [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], the fifth [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]]. He passed the London Matriculation in 1935 and trained as a chartered accountant. He intended to read law, but his studies were put on hold by the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]].

==Politics==
Omar helped found and joined the [[Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) in 1949. As a prominent Chinese leader, Ong was selected by the [[List of High Commissioners from the United Kingdom to Malaya|British High Commissioner]] as a member of the then fully appointed [[Selangor State Assembly|Selangor State Council]] and [[Federal Legislative Council]].

In 1952, he and [[Yahya Abdul Razak]] mooted the idea of an alliance between MCA and the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) for the [[Kuala Lumpur City Hall|Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council]] elections. This was the precursor to the formal [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance Party]]. He contested and won a seat in that election, and was chosen as leader of the Alliance Party in the Municipal Council.

Omar went on to become MCA vice-president and the [[Dewan Rakyat|Member of Parliament]] for [[Hulu Selangor]].&lt;ref name="passing"&gt;{{cite news |title=Omar Ong Yoke Lin: the passing of an era |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/omar-ong-yoke-lin-the-passing-of-an-era/ |publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the Alliance Party won the [[Malayan general election, 1955|first ever elections]] to the Federal Legislative Council under the leadership of [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]. Omar was appointed Minister for Post and Telecoms in the Tunku's first Cabinet. Following the overwhelming support shown for the Alliance Party during the elections and the forming of the government, the Tunku led the Merdeka Delegation to [[London]] which successfully negotiated independence from the British. Omar joined the Tunku on his second trip to London in April 1957 to finalise the newly drafted [[Constitution of Malaya]].&lt;ref name="passing"/&gt;

===Independence and the formation of Malaysia===
On 31 August 1957, Omar was appointed to the [[first Rahman cabinet]] of the newly independent [[Federation of Malaya]], holding the Labour and Social Welfare portfolio. In 1959, he became Health Minister.

During negotiations to unite Malaya, [[Singapore]], [[Sarawak]] and [[British North Borneo]] (later known as [[Sabah]]), Ong was Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] as Malaya focused on diplomacy amid regional tensions with [[Indonesia]] (''[[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Konfrontasi]]'').

Following the proclamation of the [[Federation of Malaysia]], Ong continued to serve in the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio until 1973. He served concurrently as High Commissioner to Canada in 1966 and as Ambassador to Brazil from 1967 to 1972.

In 1973, he was elected [[President of the Dewan Negara]] and served until 1980.

==Personal life==
Tun Omar was married to Toh Puan Dr. Aishah and had three children.&lt;ref name="last"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/7/1/nation/20100701130403&amp;sec=nation|title=Tun Omar Yoke Lin Ong dies of old age|date=1 July 2010|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|publisher=Star Publications|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He converted to [[Islam]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="passing"/&gt;

==Death==
Ong died on 1 July 2010 due to old age. He was 92. His body was laid to rest at [[Makam Pahlawan]] near [[Masjid Negara]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref name="last"/&gt;

An '''oral torus''' is a lesion made of compact bone and occurs along the [[palate]] or the [[Human mandible|mandible]] inside the mouth.  The palatal torus or ''[[torus palatinus]]'' occurs along the palate, close to the midline, whereas the mandibular torus or ''[[torus mandibularis]]'' occur along the [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|lingual]] side of the mandible.

Occurrences of tori are more frequent in women than in men.  Tori are associated with adulthood and rarely appear before the age of 15.  The palatal version of tori have a higher occurrence in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Inuit]] populations.

Treatment is not necessary unless they become an obstruction to chewing or [[prosthetic]] appliances.

The '''Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana''' was founded on December 19, 1935 out of the former '''Gold Coast Pharmacists and Druggists Union''' and the '''Chemists Defense Association''' which had existed before 1929. The Society was founded by a group of [[pharmacists]] led by the late Mr. William Ayiah Hansen, Hansdrug College of Pharmacy, Hansdrug Hall, Accra. He did so with the support of the Honorable Dr. D. Duff, the then Director of Medical Services. William Ayiah Hansen was then the Organizing Secretary and Registrar of the Society. Before 1935, the predominant [[Pharmacists]] groups in [[Ghana]] were two associations, [[Pharmacists]] affiliated themselves to these groups according to their bonding or non-bonding to government service. The private [[pharmacists]] groups were led by Mr. William Ayiah Hansen.

==Chapters==
The Society has branches in all the Regions of [[Ghana]] except the Northern and Upper Regions which form one Branch. There are Hospital, General Practice and Industrial, [[Pharmacists]] Associations. The Ghana Pharmaceutical Students Association is affiliated to the Society.

===Practice and Interest Groups===
*Community Practice Pharmacists’ Association - CPPA
*Industrial Pharmacists’ Association - IPA
*Social and Academic Pharmacists’ Association - SAPA
*Government and Hospital Pharmacists’ Association - GHOSPA
*Associations of Representatives of Ethical Pharmaceutical Industries - AREPI
*Lady Pharmacists Association of Ghana - LAPAG

==Statutory roles==
The Society is tasked with the following:
* Promote a unified front among pharmacists in [[Ghana]] generally, and to secure the observance of high standards of professional conduct as will uphold the dignity of the profession of [[pharmacy]]
* Regulate the training of individuals desiring to become [[pharmacists]], and to encourage the pursuit of research activities connected with the progress of pharmaceutical knowledge
* Disseminate scientific and professional information by means of lectures, symposia, seminars, the publication of the Society’s Journal, and by whatever means available to the Society within the laws of [[Ghana]]
* Encourage the exchange of ideas on and discussion of subjects of common interests to its members
* Co-operate with other pharmaceutical bodies outside Ghana with the aim of upholding high standards and dignity of the profession of [[pharmacy]] worldwide
* Organize meetings or other functions that will promote a good social intercourse among its members
* Place at the disposal of the Government and the general public the benefit of pharmaceutical expertise in keeping with the Society’s motto: “''Amicus Humani Generis''”
* Collaborate with the Government and all or any other agencies or bodies in Ghana to ensure that pharmaceutical services comparable to the best in the world is available to the people of [[Ghana]]
* Perform all other functions within the framework of the laws of Ghana, as may be found necessary for the achievement and realization of the foregoing objects or part hereof

==Logo==
The idea of a crest for the Society was proposed in 1962 but it was not until February 1971 when a design was ordered. The crest as it is today was accepted as the symbol of the Society on August 5, 1972.

===Significance of Logo===
* An outer ring, the [[Adinkra symbols|Adinkra]] design; ''Obi nka obi'' (Peace and Harmony) which is in conformity with the Society’s motto (''Amicus Humani Generis'')	
* Mortar and pestle with the recipe sign superimposed on the mortar representing the basic international designation of the pharmacy profession.
* Cluster of green leaves at the base of the mortar with a capsule superimposed on the leaves. The cluster of leaves represents the old and traditional concept of [[Pharmacy]] and denotes the numerous medicinal plants that abound in Ghana
* The superimposed capsule indicates the changing role of pharmacy from plant source to synthetic products. It also shows that pharmacists can extract the active principles from plants, formulate and dispense them in acceptable dosage forms

==Membership==
By virtue of '''Section 9, Act 64''' of Ghana, every person registered as a pharmacist in Ghana automatically becomes a member of the Society. Membership had until the promulgation of Act 64 of [[Ghana]] been optional.
At its inception, membership was twenty six. In 1961 after the passage of Act 64, a new register opened. Membership then increased significantly to nearly four hundred and twenty. By December 1984, the number of [[pharmacists]] registered had reached eight hundred and five. Membership certificates were introduced in 1972 and have been available since then. The designation of membership is MPSG. Associate membership is open to persons who have obtained their recognizable academic qualifications and are undergoing their registration process or pursuing postgraduate studies.

==The National Council of the Society (Governing Body)==
The body responsible for the day-to-day management of the affairs of the Society. Consists of the following member:

===Standing Executive Committee===

==The National Secretariat==
This is the head-office of the Society and the seat of the current president and governing body. It was initially located at Selwyn Market Street, [[Accra]]. In 1956, a new office with a physical address was inaugurated at Knustford Avenue, near the Timber Market, [[Accra]]. Since 1972 the Secretariat has been moved four times. Now it is within the Social Advance Institute building near the Greater Accra Regional Administration.
On July 17, 1966 a collective decision was made to build a National Headquarters with the help of a fund launched by the late General [[Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka]]. A Building committee was set-up by Council but unfortunately up to date, the building has not taken off. The Secretariat is currently being run by the General Secretary, his Assistant and aided by four staff members led by an administrative secretary.

'''Saint Quiteria''' ({{lang-es|Quiteria}}; {{lang-ca|Quitèria}}; {{lang-oc|Quiteira}}; {{lang-fr|Quitterie}}; {{lang-pt|Quitéria}}; {{lang-ta|கித்தேரியம்மாள்}} ''Kittēriyammāḷ'') was a fifth-century [[virgin]] [[martyr]] about whom nothing is certain except her name and her cult. She appears in the ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'', but not in any other ancient calendars (such as the ''[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]'').

==Name==
''Quiteria'' may be derived from ''Kythere'' (or ''Kyteria'', ''Kuteria''), a title applied to the [[Phoenicia]]n goddess [[Astarte]] which meant "the red one",&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; or from (the possibly related name) ''Cytherea'', an epithet of the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]] because she was born on the island of [[Kythira]]. Such origins of the name suggest to some that Quiteria is fictional.

==Legend==
Her legend states that she was the daughter of a [[Gallaecia]]n prince.  Her father wanted her to marry and renounce [[Christianity]].  Quiteria fled and her father's men found her at [[Aire-sur-l'Adour]], in [[Gascony]].  She was [[decapitation|beheaded]] on the spot.  Her sister Saint Libérate also suffered the same fate, was beheaded in the forest of Montus and lies in a 14th-century sarcophagus in the fortified church of Saint Jean Baptiste, Mazéres 32&amp;nbsp;km from her sister Quiteria in Aire-sur-l'Adour.

==Quiteria and the Nonuplet sisters==
[[Portugal|Portuguese]] religious traditions state that Saint Quiteria was the leader of the "Nonuplet Sisters," who were named '''Eumelia (Euphemia); Liberata (Virgeforte); Gema (Marinha, Margarida); Genebra; Germana; Basilissa; Marica; and Vitoria (Victoria). ''' These were born in [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] to an important [[ancient Rome|Roman]] military official.  Their mother, disgusted at the fact that she had given birth to nine daughters all at once as if she were a common peasant (or an animal), ordered a maid to take them to a river to drown them.  Their father was unaware of their birth.

Disobeying her mistress, however, the maid gave the girls over to some local women who brought them up.  As adult women, they opposed the worship of [[Roman gods]] and were brought before their father, who recognized them as his daughters.  Their father wanted them to marry Roman officers or other suitors.  The nonuplets refused and were imprisoned in a [[tower]].  However, they escaped and liberated all of their other prisoners.  They subsequently waged a [[guerrilla war]] in the mountains against the [[Roman Empire]].

Quiteria was caught and beheaded. Her sister Euphemia, unable to escape from the soldiers who pursued her, threw herself from a [[cliff]] situated today in the [[Peneda-Gerês National Park]] (it is called today ''Penedo da Santa'', Cliff of the Saint).  A rock opened up and swallowed her and on the spot there sprang up a [[hot spring]].

This is a legend that closely follows that of the Galician [[Marina of Aguas Santas|Saint Marina]], who is said to have been one of nine sisters. (citation needed)

Patron Saint of '''rabies'''

==Alternate legend==
Other Portuguese traditions make her a native of ''Bracara'' ([[Braga, Portugal]]) who was decapitated and thrown into the sea. This legend states that she emerged from the water with her head in her hands, and is thus sometimes represented as such. However, she is not considered one of the [[Cephalophores]] because there is no written record to support this. Her patronage against [[rabies]] stems from the fact that her legend states that she held two rabid dogs at bay with the power of her saintly voice.  A festival in her honor was first held at [[Tui, Galicia]] in 1688 after a proclamation was made by its bishop.&lt;ref&gt;http://arre-burro.weblog.com.pt/arquivo/2004_10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Røssvatnet''' ({{lang-sma|Reevhtse}})  is a [[lake]] and [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] in the municipalities of [[Hattfjelldal]] and [[Hemnes]] in [[Nordland]] county, [[Norway]].  It has been the site of human occupation since the [[Stone Age]]. Its area of {{convert|219|km2}} makes it the second [[List of lakes in Norway#Largest lakes|largest lake in Norway]] by surface area. Without the [[dam]] which has regulated the lake since 1957, it would be {{convert|190|km2}} and the third largest lake in Norway. Its depth is {{convert|240|m}}, its volume is estimated at about {{convert|15|km3}}, and its surface elevation is {{convert|374|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/R%C3%B8ssvatnet|title=Røssvatnet|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2378">A '''saline flush''' is the method of clearing [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous lines]] (IVs), Central Lines or [[Artery|Arterial]] Lines of any [[medicine]] or other perishable liquids to keep the lines (tubes) and entry area clean and sterile. Typically in flushing an intravenous [[cannula]], a 5ml syringe of [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] is emptied into the medication port of the cannula's connecting hub after insertion of the cannula.&lt;ref name=Longmore&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood left in the cannula or hub can lead to clots forming and blocking the cannula. Flushing is required before a drip is connected to ensure that the IV is still patent.

Flushing is also used after medications are delivered by the medication port to ensure all the drug is delivered fully. If multiple medications are given through the same line flushing can be used in between drugs to ensure that the medicines won't react. This is especially important if complex regimes of intravenous medication is used such as in [[chemotherapy]].

Flushing with saline should be painless if the cannula is in its proper place, although if the saline is not warmed there may be a cold sensation running up the vein. A painful flush may indicate [[Infiltration (medical)|tissuing]] or [[phlebitis]] and is an indication that the cannula should be relocated.&lt;ref name=Longmore/&gt;

Solutions other than normal saline may be used. [[Heparin]]ised saline may be used in flushing arterial lines, to prevent clotting and blockage of the line.

When syringes are used to perform a saline flush, it is important that the syringe not be reused for multiple patients, even though direct contact with the patient does not normally occur.&lt;ref name="promedmail-4890696"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.promedmail.org/post/4890696|publisher=[[ProMED-mail]]|title=HEPATITIS C - USA (02): (TEXAS) REUSED SALINE FLUSH SYRINGES, 2015|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary sclerosing cholangitis''' (SSC) is a [[Chronic condition|chronic]] cholestatic liver disease. It is an aggressive and rare disease with complex and multiple causes. It is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, destruction of the biliary tree and biliary cirrhosis. It can be treated with minor interventions, antibiotics, and monitoring, or with more serious cases, surgery, endoscopic intervention, and liver transplantation. 

==Cause==
SSC is thought to develop as a consequence of known injuries or pathological processes of the biliary tree, such as biliary obstruction, surgical trauma to the bile duct, or ischemic injury to the biliary tree. Secondary causes of SSC include [[Gallstone|intraductal stone disease]], [[surgical]] or [[blunt trauma|blunt]] [[abdominal trauma]], intra-[[arterial]] [[chemotherapy]], and recurrent [[pancreatitis]].&lt;ref name="pmid17058222"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abdalian R, Heathcote EJ |title=Sclerosing cholangitis: a focus on secondary causes |journal=[[Hepatology (journal)|Hepatology]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1063–74 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17058222 |doi=10.1002/hep.21405 |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been clearly demonstrated sclerosing cholangitis can develop after an episode of severe bacterial [[cholangitis]].&lt;ref name="pmid12057011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=ter Borg PC, van Buuren HR, Depla AC | title = Bacterial cholangitis causing secondary sclerosing cholangitis: a case report | journal = BMC Gastroenterology | volume = 2| pages = 14 |date=June 2002 | pmid = 12057011 | pmc = 116430 | doi = 10.1186/1471-230X-2-14| url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also it was suggested that it can result from insult to the biliary tree by obstructive cholangitis secondary to [[choledocholithiasis]], surgical damage, trauma, vascular insults, [[parasitism|parasites]], or congenital fibrocystic disorders. Additional causes of secondary SC are toxic, due to chemical agents or drugs.&lt;ref name="pmid12516911"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kariv R, Konikoff FM | title = Sclerosing cholangitis--primary, secondary and more.. | journal = The Israel Medical Association Journal : IMAJ | volume = 4 | issue = 12 | pages = 1141–2 |date=December 2002 | pmid = 12516911 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secondary sclerosing cholangitis|url=http://www.nature.com/nrgastro/journal/v6/n5/full/nrgastro.2009.46.html|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The [[diagnosis]] of SSC requires the [[Diagnosis of exclusion|exclusion]] of secondary causes of [[sclerosing cholangitis]] and recognition of associated conditions that may potentially imitate its classic cholangiographic features. It is morphologically similar to [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] ([[primary sclerosing cholangitis|PSC]]) but originates from a known [[pathology|pathological process]]. Its [[Illness|clinical]] and [[cholangiography|cholangiographic]] features may mimic PSC, yet its natural history may be more favorable if recognition is prompt and appropriate therapy is introduced. Sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients, however, is associated with rapid disease progression and poor outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Causes of Secondary Sclerosing Cholangitis|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/761739_8|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serologic testing, radiological imaging and histological analysis can help diagnose SSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secondary Sclerosing Cholangitis due to Gallbladder Adenocarcinoma|url=http://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/345961|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{tobacco}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}
The use of [[tobacco]] for [[smoking]] in [[New Zealand]] has been subjected to government regulation for a number of decades. On 10 December 2004, New Zealand became the third country in the world to make all indoor workplaces including bars and restaurants smoke-free.

==Consumption==
The number of cigarettes available for consumption, a statistical measure that reflects sales, has generally been decreasing since they peaked at 6.3 billion in 1977 but consumption has remained constant from 2005 through to 2008 at 2.4 billion cigarettes. Over the last 30 years the number of cigarettes that have been available has dropped by 61.5%. The volume of tobacco available for consumption rose  to a new high of 904 tonnes and was 83.3 percent higher than the lowest amount recorded in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/2298E570-72C0-43D1-8F40-9435D701EFC7/0/alcoholandtobaccoavailableforconsumptionyearendeddec07hotp.pdf |title=Alcohol and Tobacco Available for Consumption: Year ended December 2007 |date=2008-02-22 |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |accessdate=2008-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119203644/http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/2298E570-72C0-43D1-8F40-9435D701EFC7/0/alcoholandtobaccoavailableforconsumptionyearendeddec07hotp.pdf |archivedate=19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The first building in the world to have a smoke-free policy was the [[Old Government Buildings (Wellington)|Old Government Building]] in [[Wellington, New Zealand]], in 1876. This policy was enacted over concerns about the threat of fire, as it was the second largest wooden building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/wellington-kapiti/wellington/government-buildings/ Department of Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest attempt at tobacco control was in 1907, when the government moved to ban tobacco sales to persons under the age of 16, as it was feared that tobacco would "stunt" a minor's growth.  However, this law was not enforced until 1988.  In 1997, the age restriction was increased to 18 years. Although it is now illegal to sell tobacco products to a minor, a minor may still publicly consume, possess and distribute tobacco to friends without penalty (as opposed to alcohol).

The [[Smoke-free Environments Act 1990]] was passed to prevent the effects of [[passive smoking]] on other people by restricting cigarette smoking in places such as workplaces and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0108/latest/DLM223191.html|title=Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 No 108 (as at 04 April 2016), Public Act Contents – New Zealand Legislation|work=legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand passed an [[Smoke-free Environments Amendment Act 2003|amendment to the Smoke-free Environments Act]] on 3 December 2003 (effective in 2004) which covers all indoor public workplaces and hospitality venues (pubs, bars, nightclubs, charter club bars, restaurants and casinos). Studies have shown very high levels of compliance with the law. Also, the air quality at indoor hospitality venues is very good compared to similar settings in other countries where smoking is still permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moh.govt.nz/smokefreelaw|title=Smokefree law|work=moh.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor smoke-free laws cover the grounds of all schools, some council-owned parks (e.g., in South Taranaki and Upper Hutt), the grounds of some hospitals, stadiums and most university campuses. However, these laws are not strictly enforced apart from a polite request from security guards and property owners. The government has not moved to restrict smoking in cars, but has run mass media campaigns that promote smoke-free cars and homes.

Smoking on domestic flights was banned in 1988 and on all international flights as of 1996.

Cigarette advertising was banned on TV and radio in 1963, on cinemas and billboards in 1971, and in print media in 1990.  Tobacco sponsorship was phased out in 1995 and tobacco signage banned from outside shops the same year. Tobacco displays themselves were banned in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Plain-packets-to-follow-tobacco-display-ban/tabid/423/articleID/262306/Default.aspx| work=3 News NZ| title= Plain packets to follow tobacco display ban| date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of single cigarettes was banned in early 1998, and cigarettes are required to be sold in packs of no less than 20.

The New Zealand government's ''National Drug Policy 2007-2012'' seeks to reduce the effects of tobacco use by limiting availability, limiting the use of tobacco, and reducing harm from existing tobacco use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy|title=National Drug Policy 2007-2012|publisher=Ministry of Health|location=Wellington|date=March 2007|isbn=978-0-478-30751-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying==
[[File:National Tobacco Company Ltd building in Napier, New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The National Tobacco Company Ltd building in [[Napier, New Zealand]].]]
On 5 September 2007, [[Action on Smoking and Health]] (ASH) called for the removal of tobacco from sale by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ash.org.nz/index.php?pa_id=4&amp;news_id=159&amp;expand_section=1|title=ASH - Action on Smoking and Health New Zealand|work=ash.org.nz|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610024556/http://www.ash.org.nz/index.php?pa_id=4&amp;news_id=159&amp;expand_section=1|archivedate=10 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco displays in shops were banned in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/ASH-backs-ban-on-retail-tobacco-displays/tabid/423/articleID/262272/Default.aspx| work=3 News NZ| title= ASH backing tobacco display ban| date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Peters]], himself a smoker, has long been lobbying for the rights of smokers. In the [[2016 New Zealand budget]], [[ACT New Zealand]] also came out lobbying on behalf of smokers, arguing that despite tax on tobacco having doubled in the last five years, with smoking rates having dropped by 1.3 percentage points only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ACT on side of working class over fags tax rise|work=[[The Press]]|date=31 May 2016|page=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
St John of God Health Care Inc is a wholly owned and controlled entity of St John of God Australia Ltd, established in 1989 to sponsor the ministry that until then was run solely by the Sisters of St John of God&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sjog.org.au/more/about-us/history|title=History|website=www.sjog.org.au|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;St John of God Health Care, [http://www.sjog.org.au/about_us/governance_-_our_structure.aspx "Governance"], Retrieved 2011-02-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The congregation of the Sisters of St John of God was founded in 1871 in Wexford, Ireland. In 1895, Perth’s Bishop Matthew Gibney sent a request to the Sisters for help to care for people suffering from typhoid during the 1890s Gold Rush.&lt;ref&gt;Sisters of St John of God, [http://www.ssjg.org.au/story/index.html "Our Founding Story"], Retrieved 2011-02-28&lt;/ref&gt; The first hospital established under this arrangement was at Kalgoorlie in the late 1890s followed shortly by another in the Perth suburb of Subiaco.

The Sisters of St John of God went on to establish hospitals, patho&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://annualreport2016.sjog.org.au/|title=St John of God Health Care 2015/16 annual report|website=annualreport2016.sjog.org.au|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;logy and social outreach services in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;St John of God Health Care, [http://www.sjog.org.au/about_us/history.aspx "History"], Retrieved 2011-02-28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, St John of God Health Care merged with the services previously operated by the Hospitaller Order of St John of God in Victoria, New South Wales and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;St John of God Health Care, [http://www.sjog.org.au/PDF/SJGHC%20ANNUAL%20REPORT%202007-2008%20web.pdf "Annual Report 2007-2008"], pp.2, Retrieved 2011-02-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pomegranate symbol==
The symbol used by St John of God Health Care is a cross with a pomegranate.&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn Hughes (2009), [http://www.frankston.vic.gov.au/library/scripts/objectifyMedia.aspx?file=pdf/235/26.pdf&amp;siteID=18&amp;str_title=Stained+Glass+Booklet.pdf "Shining Lights Ethereal Visions"], Frankston City Council, pp.23, Retrieved 2011-02-25&lt;/ref&gt; The cross symbolises the Christian heritage of the organisation; the pomegranate, which is open to allow the seeds to scatter, symbolises self-giving and represents the organisation's values.&lt;ref&gt;St John of God Health Care, [http://www.sjog.org.au/PDF/SJGHC%20ANNUAL%20REPORT%202007-2008%20web.pdf "Annual Report 2007-2008"], pp.2, Retrieved 2011-02-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The pomegranate symbol was chosen by the Sisters of St John of God to reflect the order’s patron Saint, [[John of God]], who ministered to the sick and poor in the Spanish town of Granada – ‘pomegranate’ in Spanish – in the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne, [http://www.cam.org.au/reflections/st-john-of-god.html "St John of God"], Kairos: Volume 21, Issue 03, Retrieved 2011-02-27&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}

'''Standard of living''' refers to the level of [[wealth]], comfort, material goods, and necessities available to a certain [[socioeconomic class]] in a certain geographic area, usually a [[country]].
The standard of living includes factors such as income, quality and availability of [[employment]], class disparity, [[poverty rate]], quality and affordability of housing, hours of work required to purchase necessities, [[gross domestic product]], [[inflation rate]], amount of leisure time every year, affordable (or free) access to quality healthcare, quality and availability of [[education]], life expectancy, incidence of disease, cost of goods and services, infrastructure, national [[economic growth]], economic and political stability, political and religious freedom, environmental quality, climate and safety. The standard of living is closely related to [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp#ixzz1VUli2yEI |title=Standard of Living Definition |publisher=Investopedia.com |date= |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
Standard of living is generally measured by standards such as real (i.e. [[inflation (economics)|inflation]] adjusted) income per person and poverty rate. Other measures such as access and quality of [[health care]], [[Economic inequality|income growth inequality]], and educational standards are also used. Examples are access to certain goods (such as number of refrigerators per 1000 people), or measures of health such as life expectancy. It is the ease by which people living in a time or place are able to satisfy their needs and/or wants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The main idea of a 'standard' may be contrasted with the [[quality of life]], which takes into account not only the material standard of living, but also other more intangible aspects that make up human life, such as leisure, safety, cultural resources, social life, [[physical health]], environmental quality issues, etc.  More complex means of measuring well-being must be employed to make such judgements, and these are very often political, thus controversial. Even between two nations or societies that have similar material standards of living, quality of life factors may in fact make one of these places more attractive to a given individual or group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6631">'''TAP Pharmaceuticals''' was formed in 1977 as a [[joint venture]] between the two global [[pharmaceutical]] companies, [[Abbott Laboratories]] and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.]] and was dissolved in 2008; its two most successful products were proton-pump inhibitor [[lansoprazole]] (Prevacid) and the prostate cancer drug, [[leuprorelin]] ((Lupron).&lt;ref name=FT2008/&gt;   The intention of the joint venture was to get products that Takeda had discovered [[drug development|developed]], approved, and marketed in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name=WSJ1981&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lehner|first1=Urban C.|last2=Marcom|first2=John|title=Tokyo Tonic: Japan's Drug Makers Try World Market, Challenging U.S. and Europe Producers|work=Wall Street Journal|date=7 August 1981|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was established at a time when Japanese pharmaceutical companies were seeking partnerships to access the US market.&lt;ref name=FT2008/&gt;  These efforts were supported by the Japanese government at the time to help the national economy compete in higher technology, as countries like South Korea, Taiwan were beginning to catch up with Japan in commodity production.&lt;ref name=WSJ1981/&gt;  Japanese pharmaceutical companies were especially strong in the fields of generating analogs of known [[cephalosporin]] antibiotics, cancer drugs, and cardiovascular drugs.&lt;ref name=WSJ1981/&gt;

The first products TAP file new drug applications for, were two cephalosporins, [[cefmenoxime]] (Cefmax) and [[cefsulodin]] (Cefonomil), [[estazolam]] for sleep disorders, and leuprorelin; leuprorelin was the first one approved, in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lupron Is First Abbott-Takeda Product to Reach U.S. Market|url=https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS008170/LUPRON-IS-FIRST-ABBOTTTAKEDA-PRODUCT-TO-REACH-US-MARKET-FDA-APPROVES-SYNTHETIC-LHRH-ANALOG-WAS-TREATED-AS-1A-BREAKTHROUGH-FOR-PROSTATE-CANCER|work=Pink Sheet|date=15 April 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Takeda established its own US R&amp;D and sales force, for the diabetes drug [[pioglitazone]] (Actos).&lt;ref name=FT2008/&gt; 

In 2000, TAP's withdrew its [[new drug application]] for [[apomorphine]] (branded as "Uprima") as a treatment for [[erectile dysfunction]] after an FDA review panel raised questions about the drug's safety, due to many clinical trial subjects fainting after taking the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abbott Withdraws Application for an Impotence Pill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/01/business/company-news-abbott-withdraws-application-for-an-impotence-pill.html|work=Bloomberg News via The New York Times|date=1 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abbott Withdraws Application for an Impotence Pill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/01/business/company-news-abbott-withdraws-application-for-an-impotence-pill.html|work=Bloomberg News via The New York Times|date=1 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the US Department of Justice, states attorneys general, and TAP Pharmaceutical Products settled criminal and civil charges against TAP related to federal and state [[medicare fraud]] and illegal marketing of the drug [[leuprorelin]]. TAP paid a total of $875 million, which was a [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|record high at the time]].&lt;ref name=NYT2001&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petersen|first1=Melody|title=2 Drug Makers to Pay $875 Million to Settle Fraud Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/04/business/2-drug-makers-to-pay-875-million-to-settle-fraud-case.html|work=The New York Times|date=4 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOJ&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. and Seven Others Charged with Health Care Crimes|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2001/October/513civ.htm|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=October 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The $875 million settlement broke down to $290 million for violating the Prescription Drug Marketing Act,  $559.5 million to settle federal fraud charges for overcharging Medicare, and $25.5 million reimbursement to 50 states and Washington, D.C., for filing false claims with the states' Medicaid programs.&lt;ref name=DOJ/&gt; The case arose under the [[False Claims Act]] with claims filed by Douglas Durand, a former TAP vice president of sales, and Joseph Gerstein, a doctor at [[Tufts University]]'s HMO practice.&lt;ref name=NYT2001/&gt; Durand, Gerstein, and Tufts shared $95 million of the settlement.&lt;ref name=NYT2001/&gt;

When the settlement was announced, the Department of Justice also announced that seven people were indicted on criminal charges by a grand jury; the DoJ also said that four doctors had already pled guilty for receiving kickbacks.&lt;ref name=DOJ/&gt;  As of 2003 around 12 TAP employees had been indicted and were contested the charges, and one had pled guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Gardiner|title=Abbott to Pay $622 Million To End Inquiry Into Marketing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/27/business/abbott-to-pay-622-million-to-end-inquiry-into-marketing.html|work=The New York Times|date=27 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbott and Takeda agreed to end the partnership in 2008, with Abbott keeping the rights to leuprorelin, which had sales in 2007 of $600 million and a patent expiring in 2015 and the approximately 300 employees who worked on the product, and Takeda keeping the rights to lansoprazole, which had sales of $2.3 billion in 2007 but was facing imminent generic competition, along with 800 employees in the U.S. and all the drugs in the TAP pipeline.&lt;ref name=FT2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jack|first1=Andrew|title=Takeda ends joint venture with Abbott|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9c7078de-f608-11dc-8d3d-000077b07658?mhq5j=e1|work=Financial Times|date=March 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJsplit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Shirley S.|title=Abbott, Takeda to End Joint Venture|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120596276402549819|work=Wall Street Journal|date=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Desmond|first1=Maurna|title=Takeda and Abbott Say Goodbye|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/03/20/takeda-abbott-closer-markets-equity-cx_md_lal_0320markets40.html|work=Forbes|date=20 March 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Takeda was also obligated to pay Abbott about $1.5 billion over several years.&lt;ref name=WSJsplit/&gt;  By 2008, Takeda's own sales in the US outside of TAP had grown to $3 billion, mostly from sales of pioglitazone which by then was the best-selling diabetes drug in the world.&lt;ref name=Forbes2008/&gt;

'''''The Hungry Gene''''' is a 2002 book by [[Ellen Ruppel Shell]] in which she tackles the issue of [[obesity]]. It is a [[non-fiction]] journalistic [[book]]. The author devotes multiple chapters of her book to the events that led to the co-discovery of the [[Leptin]] gene in 1994. Based on interviews with the parties involved, she reports that [[Leptin]] was co-discovered at [[Rockefeller University]] by [[Rudolph Leibel]], [[Jeffrey M. Friedman|Jeffrey Friedman]], and members of their laboratories, and explains why Leibel and others were excluded by Friedman in the scientific paper that announced the discovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35640">'''Tobacco harm reduction''' ('''THR''') is a public health strategy to lower the health risks to individuals and wider society associated with using tobacco products. It is an example of the concept of [[harm reduction]], a strategy for dealing with the abuse of other drugs. Tobacco smoking is widely acknowledged as a leading cause of illness and death,&lt;ref name=Nitzkin2014/&gt; and preventing smoking is vital to public health.

In the developed world, a reduction in the prevalence of smoking has been primarily achieved through reducing the uptake of smoking among younger people rather than improving the rates of quitting in established smokers. It is, however, this latter group who will generate the greatest source of population burden of morbidity and premature mortality caused by smoking in the next twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IARC Monographs- Tobacco smoke and involuntary smoking|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol83/|website=monographs.iarc.fr|publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jha|first1=P|last2=Peto|first2=R|title=Global effects of smoking, of quitting, and of taxing tobacco.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=2 January 2014|volume=370|issue=1|pages=60–8|pmid=24382066|doi=10.1056/nejmra1308383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicotine itself, however, is not very harmful, as inferred from the long history of use for nicotine replacement therapy products.&lt;ref name=Fagerstrom2014/&gt; Nicotine increases heart rate and blood pressure and has a range of local irritant effects but is not carcinogenic (cancer causing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IARC Monographs- Classifications|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/|website=monographs.iarc.fr|publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, none of the three main causes of mortality from smoking, lung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease, is caused primarily by nicotine. The main hazardous component is the smoke which results from the combustion of tobacco, so if nicotine could be effectively and acceptably delivered without smoke, it is likely that most if not all the harm of smoking could be avoided. THR measures have been focused on reducing or eliminating the use of combustible tobacco by switching to other nicotine products, including:

#Cutting down (either long-term or before quitting smoking)
#Temporary abstinence
#Switching to non-tobacco nicotine containing products, such as pharmaceutical [[Nicotine replacement therapy|nicotine replacement therapies]] or currently (generally) unlicensed products such as [[electronic cigarettes]]
#Switching to smokeless tobacco products such as [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[snus]]
#Switching to non-combustible organic or additive-free tobacco products

It is widely acknowledged that discontinuation of all tobacco products confers the greatest lowering of risk. However, approved [[smoking cessation]] methods have a 90% failure rate, when used as directed.&lt;ref name="Nitzkin2014" /&gt; In addition, there is a considerable population of smokers who are unable or unwilling to achieve abstinence.&lt;ref name="Rodu"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rodu | first1 = Brad | last2 = Godshall | first2 = William T.| title = Tobacco harm reduction: An alternative cessation strategy for inveterate smokers | journal = Harm Reduction Journal | volume = 3 | pages = 37 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7517-3-37 | pmid =  17184539| pmc =1779270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harm reduction is likely of substantial benefit to these smokers and public health.&lt;ref name="Nitzkin2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fagerstrom2014" /&gt; Providing reduced-harm alternatives to smokers is likely to result in lower total population risk than pursuing abstinence-only policies.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Debunking the claim that abstinence is usually healthier for smokers than switching to a low-risk alternative, and other observations about anti-tobacco-harm-reduction arguments | author=Phillips, CV | journal=Harm Reduct.

==History==
The concept of tobacco harm reduction was established in 1976 when Professor Michael Russell wrote: "People smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar"&lt;ref name="Russell76"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Low-tar medium-nicotine cigarettes: a new approach to safer smoking | author=Russell, MA | journal=Br Med J |date=June 1976 | volume=1 | issue=6023 | pages=1430–3 | pmid=953530 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.6023.1430 | pmc=1640397}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that the ratio of tar to nicotine could be the key to safer smoking.&lt;ref name="Fagerstrom2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rodu/&gt; Since then, the harm from smoking has been well-established as being caused almost exclusively by toxins released through the combustion of tobacco.&lt;ref name=Nitzkin2014/&gt; In contrast, non-combustible tobacco products as well as pure nicotine products are considerably less harmful, although they still have the potential for addiction.&lt;ref name="Fagerstrom2014" /&gt;

Debates on tobacco harm reduction tend to be geographically defined arguments, because of the varying legal, moral, and historical status of tobacco, and the different types of tobacco products and use in different cultures around the world. For instance, cigarette smoking is the dominant form in the [[United States]], while use of [[cigar]]s, pipes, and smokeless tobacco is limited to a much smaller population.  Anti-smoking advocacy efforts and widespread popularization of the negative health effects of smoking over the last few decades have led to restrictions in the sale and use of tobacco products. Despite this, tobacco in all its forms has remained a legal product in most societies.  A notable exception is the European Union, where the most dangerous products (cigarettes) are available but smokeless tobacco products, which are far less hazardous, are banned.&lt;ref name=Bates2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bates | first1 = C | last2 = Fagerstrom | first2 = K | last3 = Jarvis | first3 = MJ | last4 = Kunze | first4 = M | last5 = McNeill | first5 = A | last6 = Ramstrom | first6 = L | year = 2003 | title = European Union policy on smokeless tobacco: a statement in favour of evidence based regulation for public health | url = | journal = Tob Control | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 360–367 | doi=10.1136/tc.12.4.360 | pmid=14660767 | pmc=1747769}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exception is [[Sweden]], where there is a long tradition of [[smokeless tobacco]] (snus) use among men.

In October 2008 the [[American Association of Public Health Physicians]] (AAPHP) became the first medical organization in the U.S. to officially endorse tobacco harm reduction as a viable strategy to reduce the death toll related to cigarette smoking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphp.org/special/joelstobac/2010/harmredcnupdatejuly2010.html Update on the Scientific Status of Tobacco Harm Reduction, 2008-2010].

=="Safer cigarettes"==

[[Lights (cigarette type)|Light Cigarettes]]

Cigarette manufacturers have attempted to design safer cigarettes for almost 50 years, but results have been marginal at best.&lt;ref name="Rigotti"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rigotti | first1 = NA | last2 = Tindle | first2 = HA | year = 2004 | title = The fallacy of light cigarettes | url = http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/328/7440/E278#BIBL | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = | pages = 278–279 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7440.E278 | pmid=15016715 | pmc=2901853}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Filters were introduced in the early 1950s, and manufacturers were selling low-yield cigarettes by the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Rigotti"/&gt;  Initially it was thought that these innovations were harm reducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Russell | first1 = MAH | year = 1974 | title = Realistic goals for smoking and health: a case for safer smoking | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(74)92558-6 | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 254–258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in 1976 investigators at the American Cancer Society published research concluding that light cigarettes were safer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hammond | first1 = EC | last2 = Garfinkel | first2 = L | last3 = Seidman | first3 = H | last4 = Lew | first4 = EA | year = 1976 | title = Tar and nicotine content of cigarette smoke in relation to death rates | url = | journal = Environ Res | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 263–274 | doi=10.1016/0013-9351(76)90036-0 | pmid=1001298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study authors wrote that "total death rates, death rates from coronary heart disease, and death rates from lung cancer were somewhat lower for those who smoked 'low' tar-nicotine cigarettes than for those who smoked 'high' tar-nicotine cigarettes." However, scientific evidence suggests that switching from regular to light or low-tar cigarettes does not reduce the health risks of smoking or lower the smoker's exposure to the nicotine, tar, and carcinogens present in cigarette smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benowitz|first1=NL|last2=Jacob P|first2=3rd|last3=Bernert|first3=JT|last4=Wilson|first4=M|last5=Wang|first5=L|last6=Allen|first6=F|last7=Dempsey|first7=D|title=Carcinogen exposure during short-term switching from regular to "light" cigarettes.|journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention|date=June 2005|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1376–83|pmid=15941944|doi=10.1158/1055-9965.epi-04-0667}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, part of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control’s Article 11 and its accompanying guidelines recommend that misleading terms, including ‘light’ and ‘mild’, should be removed from tobacco product advertising, packaging, and labeling,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/text_download/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Guidelines for implementation of the WHO FCTC|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/guidelines/adopted/guidel_2011/en/|website=www.who.int|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smokeless tobacco ==
It has been established that use of Swedish and American [[smokeless tobacco]] confers only 0.1% to 10% of the risks of smoking,&lt;ref name="Rodu"/&gt; though smokeless products in [[India]] and elsewhere in [[Asia]] contain higher levels of contaminants and thus confer greater risks.&lt;ref name="RCP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccoprogram.org/pdf/4fc74817-64c5-4105-951e-38239b09c5db.pdf|title=Harm reduction in nicotine addiction: Helping people who can't quit|date=October 2007|publisher=Tobacco Advisory Group of the Royal College of Physicians|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two respected medical groups believe that smokeless tobacco may play a role in reducing smoking-attributable deaths. In 2007, Britain's Royal College of Physicians concluded "...that smokers smoke predominantly for nicotine, that nicotine itself is not especially hazardous, and that if nicotine could be provided in a form that is acceptable and effective as a cigarette substitute, millions of lives could be saved." &lt;ref name="Royal College of Physicians"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicotine without smoke: Tobacco harm reduction|url=https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/nicotine-without-smoke-tobacco-harm-reduction-0|website=RCP London|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a study based on National Health Interview Survey data found that 73% of smokers who switched to smokeless tobacco as part of their latest quit attempt were successful in quitting smoking.&lt;ref name="RoduPhillips2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/5/1/18 | title=Switching to smokeless tobacco as a smoking cessation method: evidence from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey |author1=Rodu, B |author2=Phillips, CV | journal=Harm Reduct J |date=May 2008  | volume=5 | pages=18 | doi=10.1186/1477-7517-5-18 | quote=Switching to ST compares very favorably with pharmaceutical nicotine as a quit-smoking aid among American men, despite the fact that few smokers know that the switch provides almost all of the health benefits of complete tobacco abstinence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study, smokers who used pharmaceutical nicotine products in their most recent quit attempt had success rates between 0 and 35%.&lt;ref name="RoduPhillips2008"/&gt;

===Snus===
{{Main|Snus}}
Scandinavian snus is a moist form of smokeless tobacco which is usually placed under the upper lip, and is not smoked or swallowed. A 2014 report commissioned by [[Public Health England]] on another avenue for tobacco harm reduction, [[electronic cigarette]]s, said snus "has a risk profile that includes possible increases in risk of oesophageal and pancreatic cancer, and of fatal (but not non-fatal) myocardial infarction, but not COPD or lung cancer." The report examined the case of snus as "a unique natural experiment in the impact of a socially accepted, non-medical, affordable and easily accessible reduced harm product on the prevalence of tobacco smoking". They concluded that "Although controversial, the Swedish natural experiment demonstrates that despite dual use and primary uptake of the reduced-harm product by young people, availability of reduced-harm alternatives for tobacco smokers can have a beneficial effect. While snus is not likely to become a legal or indeed politically viable option in the UK, this data proves the concept that harm reduction strategies can contribute to significant reductions in smoking prevalence."&lt;ref name=NHE2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311887/Ecigarettes_report.pdf|title=Electronic cigarettes – A report commissioned by Public Health England |publisher=Public Health England|date=15 May 2014|pages=11–12|author1-first=John |author1-last=Britton|author2-first=Ilze|author2-last=Bogdanovica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the mounting evidence that the health risks of [[Swedish snus]] are far lower than those of combustible tobacco products, in August 2014, Swedish Match (a manufacturer) filed a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) application with the FDA Center for Tobacco Products (CTP). The MRTP application seeks to modify the warning labels on smokeless tobacco products such that they reflect the evidence of reduced-harm compared to smoking. Among the proposed labeling changes, the MRTP application requests replacing the current warning, "This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes," with this text: "No tobacco product is safe, but this product presents substantially lower risks to health than cigarettes."&lt;ref name="SM MRTP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/Static/widgets/tobacco/SMNA_MRTPA_FDA-2014-N-1051.html | title=Swedish Match North America MRTP Applications | date=27 August 2014 | accessdate=24 October 2014 | pages=100,000+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic cigarettes==
{{Main|Electronic cigarette}}
E-cigarettes are [[battery-powered]] devices that provide nicotine for inhalation in a vapour generated by heating a solution of water, nicotine propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin and typically some flavouring. They were first developed in China in 2003, and first introduced to Europe and the US around 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wlesenthal|first=Kelly|title=Electronic Cigarette History|url=http://21centurysmoke.org/electronic-cigarette-history/|accessdate=25 November 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many brands and models of e-cigarettes available today but they can be broadly grouped into three categories. First generation e-cigarettes are similar in appearance to a conventional cigarette and are typically designed to be for single use.  Second generation e-cigarettes are around the size of a large fountain pen, have a battery linked to a permanent vapouriser and a refillable tank for the nicotine solution.  Third generation e-cigarettes tend to be larger, with a more powerful battery and two heating elements which allow users to carry the power.&lt;ref name="Royal College of Physicians"/&gt; Nicotine delivery has typically increased with successive generations of e-cigarette,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talih|first1=S|last2=Balhas|first2=Z|last3=Eissenberg|first3=T|last4=Salman|first4=R|last5=Karaoghlanian|first5=N|last6=El Hellani|first6=A|last7=Baalbaki|first7=R|last8=Saliba|first8=N|last9=Shihadeh|first9=A|title=Effects of user puff topography, device voltage, and liquid nicotine concentration on electronic cigarette nicotine yield: measurements and model predictions.|journal=Nicotine &amp; tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco|date=February 2015|volume=17|issue=2|pages=150–7|pmid=25187061|doi=10.1093/ntr/ntu174|pmc=4837998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that repeated use of second and third generation devices can result in sustained venous blood levels of nicotine which are comparable with those expected in smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramôa|first1=CP|last2=Hiler|first2=MM|last3=Spindle|first3=TR|last4=Lopez|first4=AA|last5=Karaoghlanian|first5=N|last6=Lipato|first6=T|last7=Breland|first7=AB|last8=Shihadeh|first8=A|last9=Eissenberg|first9=T|title=Electronic cigarette nicotine delivery can exceed that of combustible cigarettes: a preliminary report.|journal=Tobacco control|date=April 2016|volume=25|issue=e1|pages=e6-9|pmid=26324250|doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052447|pmc=4888876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic cigarettes are a promising harm reduction technology because they deliver nicotine without the dangerous chemicals in tobacco smoke, while remaining attractive to smokers.&lt;ref name=Fagerstrom2014&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460313003729 | title=Tobacco harm reduction: The need for new products that can compete with cigarettes | author=Fagerström, KO, Bridgman, K | journal=Addictive Behaviors |date=March 2014  | volume=39 | issue=3 | pages=507–511 | doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.11.002 | pmid=24290207 | quote=The need for more appealing, licensed nicotine products capable of competing with cigarettes sensorially, pharmacologically and behaviourally is considered by many to be the way forward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the eventual [[regulation of electronic cigarettes|regulatory status]] of e-cigarettes in many countries remains uncertain,&lt;ref name=Fagerstrom2014/&gt; public health advocates view electronic cigarette as having a valid place within tobacco harm reduction strategy.&lt;ref name=West2014&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://bjgp.org/content/64/626/442 | title=Electronic cigarettes: fact and faction | author=West, R, Brown J | journal=British Journal of General Practice |date=September 2014 | volume=64 | issue=626 | pages=442–3 | doi=10.3399/bjgp14X681253 | pmid=25179048 | quote=It is important that interpretation of the evidence and communication with policy makers and the public is not distorted by a priori judgements. | pmc=4141591}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a first step towards the regulation of e-cigarettes, the MHRA granted Marketing Authorisations (licences) for the medicinal products e-Voke 10&amp;nbsp;mg and 15&amp;nbsp;mg Electronic Inhaler (PL 40317/0001-2) on 16 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con616843.pdf|publisher=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public health researchers in the UK estimated that 6,000 premature smoking-related deaths per year would be prevented for every million smokers who switched to e-cigarettes.&lt;ref name=West2014/&gt; Since currently approved [[smoking cessation]] methods have a 90% failure rate, the use of e-cigarettes as a prominent THR modality is likely to substantially reduce tobacco-related illness in the United States, with the potential to save 4.8 million lives over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name=Nitzkin2014&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Case in Favor of E-Cigarettes for Tobacco Harm Reduction | author=Nitzkin, J | journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=June 2014  | volume=11 | issue=6 | pages=6459–71 | doi=10.3390/ijerph110606459 | pmid=25003176 | quote=A carefully structured Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR) initiative, with e-cigarettes as a prominent THR modality, added to current tobacco control programming, is the most feasible policy option likely to substantially reduce tobacco-attributable illness and death in the United States over the next 20 years. | pmc=4078589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of UK adults found that over two thirds of ex-smokers and over one third of current smokers report that one of the main reasons they use e-cigarettes is to help them stop smoking completely.&lt;ref name="Action on Smoking and Health"&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of electronic cigarettes (vapourisers) among adults in Great Britain {{!}} Action on Smoking and Health|url=http://ash.org.uk/information-and-resources/fact-sheets/use-of-electronic-cigarettes-vapourisers-among-adults-in-great-britain/|website=ash.org.uk|publisher=Action on Smoking and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, published up until January 2016, is limited, but suggests a potential increase in long term smoking cessation using e-cigarettes containing nicotine compared to those without, with no increased health risk compared to smokers with medium term use (two years or less).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartmann-Boyce|first1=Jamie|last2=McRobbie|first2=Hayden|last3=Bullen|first3=Chris|last4=Begh|first4=Rachna|last5=Stead|first5=Lindsay F|last6=Hajek|first6=Peter|title=Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub3/pdf|website=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd010216.pub3|date=13 September 2016|pmid=27622384|volume=9|page=CD010216}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with any new product, long term or rare adverse effects will not become clear until e-cigarettes have been in widespread use for decades. However, in an effort to  [[tobacco control movement|decrease tobacco related death and disease]], e-cigarettes appear to have a potential to be part of the strategy.&lt;ref name="Cahn2011"&gt;{{cite journal |first2=M|last1=M.|first1=Z.|last2=Siegel|title=Electronic cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy for tobacco control: a step forward or a repeat of past mistakes?|journal=Journal of public health policy|date=February 2011|volume=32|issue=1|pages=16–31|doi=10.1057/jphp.2010.41|pmid=21150942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulation of e-cigarettes varies around the world. The Institute for Global Tobacco Control  (IGTC) has identified 68 countries that have laws regulating e-cigarettes, as at November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Laws Regulating E-cigarettes {{!}} Global Tobacco Control - Learning from the Experts|url=http://globaltobaccocontrol.org/e-cigarette/country-laws-regulating-e-cigarettes|website=globaltobaccocontrol.org|publisher=Institute for Global Tobacco Control}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Types of regulation include complete prohibition on the sale and marketing of e-cigarettes, prohibition on their use in enclosed public places, minimum age for purchase, an allowance for e-cigarettes to be sold under general consumer product regulations and most recently, in the UK, e-cigarettes may be brought to market as either medicines or consumer products (with those seeking medicines approval undergoing the standard medicines licensing process). The World Health Organization acknowledge that e-cigarettes may play a role in harm reduction strategies, but should be regulated to minimize any potential risks. However, the vast differences in regulatory approaches evident around the world highlights the challenge of developing a global regulatory approach.

==Propellant-based nicotine delivery==

An alternative nicotine delivery platform based on existing asthma inhaler technology has been developed by a UK-based healthcare company, [[Kind Consumer Limited]]. The technology is under license to Nicoventures Limited a subsidiary of [[British American Tobacco]] who are responsible for the launch and commercialization of the technology as an approved [[nicotine replacement therapy]] product. The MHRA granted Marketing Authorizations (licenses) for the medicinal products Voke/Nicotine 0.45&amp;nbsp;mg Inhaler (PL 39589/0001-2) on 11 September 2014, with a variation to the license to support full commercialization granted on 23 February 2015.

== Public perceptions==
Smokers remain confused about tobacco harm reduction.  In a 2004 survey, about 80-100% of participants incorrectly perceived low-yield cigarettes as harm-reducing, while 75-80% mistakenly believed that switching to smokeless tobacco conferred no risk reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haddock | first1 = CK | last2 = Lando | first2 = H | last3 = Klesges | first3 = RC | last4 = Peterson | first4 = AL | last5 = Scarinci | first5 = IC | year = 2004 | title = Modified tobacco use and lifestyle change in risk-reducing beliefs about smoking | url = | journal = Am J Prev Med | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 35–41 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2004.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar confusion exists about electronic cigarettes. In the UK, research commissioned by the anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health found that in 2016, more than three times as many people think e-cigarettes are as harmful or more harmful than smoking than in 2013 (25% vs 7%), the highest proportion since the survey began.&lt;ref name="Action on Smoking and Health"/&gt;  They expressed concern that the proportion of adult smokers who thought that e-cigarettes were more or equally harmful than cigarettes was highest in those who had never tried e-cigarettes, and these perceived potential harms was the main reason why they had not tried them.&lt;ref name="Action on Smoking and Health"/&gt;

In 2015 a report commissioned by Public Health England noted, as well as the UK figures above, that in the US belief among responders to a survey that vaping was safer than smoking cigarettes fell from 82% in 2010 to 51% in 2014.&lt;ref name=McNeill201579&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNeill|first1=A, SC|title=E - cigarettes: an evidence update A report commissioned by Public Health England|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/454516/Ecigarettes_an_evidence_update_A_report_commissioned_by_Public_Health_England.pdf|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=Public Health England|p=79|accessdate=20 August 2015|location=UK|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report blamed "misinterpreted research findings", attracting negative media coverage, for the growth in the "inaccurate" belief that e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking, and concluded that "There is a need to publicise the current best estimate that using EC is around 95% safer than smoking".&lt;ref name=McNeill201580&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNeill|first1=A, SC|title=E - cigarettes: an evidence update A report commissioned by Public Health England|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/454516/Ecigarettes_an_evidence_update_A_report_commissioned_by_Public_Health_England.pdf|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=Public Health England|accessdate=20 August 2015|location=UK|date=2015}}, pages 6, 11, 78-80&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published by the Wall Street Journal in 2016 entitled "Are E-Cigarettes a Healthy Way to Quit Smoking?", [[Jed Rose (scientist)|Dr. Jed E. Rose]] co-inventor of the [[nicotine patch]] said, "Having worked my entire career to develop effective smoking-cessation treatments, I have realized that current approaches are ineffective for the vast majority of smokers. Alternative approaches are urgently needed. The World Health Organization predicts&lt;ref name=Who2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Report On The Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2008|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_full_2008.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2016|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt; a billion deaths will be attributable to smoking during the 21st century. Electronic cigarettes have an unparalleled potential to reduce the public-health impact of smoking, by allowing smokers to replace the habit and nicotine of smoking without the toxic effects of combustion."&lt;ref name=Rose2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Are E-Cigarettes a Healthy Way to Quit Smoking?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-e-cigarettes-a-healthy-way-to-quit-smoking-1460340169|website=www.wsj.com|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=21 April 2016|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns around tobacco harm reduction strategies==

Whilst tobacco harm reduction approaches have the potential to reduce risks to the current adult smoking population, there are hypothesised potential hazards to wider public health.  Smoking has become less acceptable over recent years in a number of countries, a result of a number of he Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) guidelines to reduce smoking prevalence.  The renormalisation of smoking is a concern if e-cigarette use appears to become more appealing, for example through their use in locations where conventional cigarettes are prohibited, advertising and increased e-cigarette use by parents, siblings, peers, celebrities or other influential groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fairchild|first1=AL|last2=Bayer|first2=R|last3=Colgrove|first3=J|title=The renormalization of smoking? E-cigarettes and the tobacco "endgame".|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=23 January 2014|volume=370|issue=4|pages=293–5|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1313940|pmid=24350902}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voigt|first1=K|title=Smoking Norms and the Regulation of E-Cigarettes.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=October 2015|volume=105|issue=10|pages=1967–72|pmid=26270285|doi=10.2105/ajph.2015.302764|pmc=4566542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have also been raised that non-tobacco nicotine use may results in uptake of tobacco smoking that would not otherwise have occurred.  This ‘gateway theory’ has been largely applied to the use of e-cigarettes by non-smokers and particularly children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=K|last2=Keane|first2=H|title=All gates lead to smoking: the 'gateway theory', e-cigarettes and the remaking of nicotine.|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=October 2014|volume=119|pages=45–52|pmid=25150650|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no reported evidence, however, that NRT use among young people has ever acted as a gateway to smoking, or that e-cigarette use has resulted in any appreciable increase initiation of smoking among children or adults.  The Royal College of Physicians suggest that any association between e-cigarette and conventional cigarette use is likely due to common liability to use these products and the use of e-cigarettes to reduce smoking.&lt;ref name="Royal College of Physicians"/&gt;

Dual use of tobacco products and non-tobacco nicotine by continuing smokers is another aspect which has raised concern.  It is suggested that dual use could inadvertently sustain smoking by making it easier for smokers to temporarily abstain from tobacco use, or encourage smokers to move towards dual use rather than complete cessation in the mistaken belief that this offers significant health gains.  Dual use of tobacco and NRT is licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) as a tobacco harm reduction strategy which actually increases the chance of quitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The use of nicotine replacement theory to reduce harm in smokers|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/publication/con068571.pdf|website=MHRA Public Assessment Report|publisher=MHRA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141205150130/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/publication/con068571.pdf|archivedate=2014-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Royal College of Physicians reviewed evidence around dual use and smoking cessation and reported that findings were suggestive that e-cigarettes had the potential to offer the same cessation gains,&lt;ref name="Royal College of Physicians"/&gt; although further research would be helpful to more clearly delineate such an effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1012">'''Whitemoor Haye''' ({{gbmapping|SK1813}}) is a mainly [[agriculture|agricultural]] area in the [[floodplain]] of the [[River Tame, West Midlands|River Tame]], near [[Alrewas]] in [[Staffordshire]], [[England]].

It is very popular with [[Birdwatching|birdwatchers]], as several rare species are either resident or seasonal visitors, notably the [[corn bunting]].

The remains of several [[woolly rhinoceros]]es were recovered from a [[quarry]] here in 2002.&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2375509.stm '''Extraordinary'' woolly rhino finds'' BBC news]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an [[Aerodrome|airfield]], for light aircraft such as [[Ultralight aviation|microlights]].
