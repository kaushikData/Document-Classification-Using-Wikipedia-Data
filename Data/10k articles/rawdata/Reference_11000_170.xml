[[African-American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) has been the center of controversy about the education of [[African-American]] youths, the role AAVE should play in public schools and education, and its place in broader society.{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=217–218}}

==Overview==
By definition, as a [[nonstandard dialect|vernacular dialect]] of English, AAVE has never received the social prestige of a [[standard dialect]], leading to widespread and long-standing misconceptions that it is a grammatically inferior form of English, which linguistics research of the twentieth century has soundly refuted.&lt;!-- No citation is needed here for this claim of refutation. Evidence is amply provided below: see the names Pinker, Radford et al, Schilling-Estes, and Crystal. --&gt; However, educators and social commentators traditionally have advocated for eliminating AAVE usage through the public-education system for a variety of reasons, ranging from a continued belief that AAVE is intrinsically deficient to arguments that its use, by being stigmatized in certain social contexts, is socially limiting.{{sfnp|Wardhaugh|2002|pp=343–348}} Some of the harshest criticism of AAVE or its use has come from African Americans.{{sfnp|Lippi-Green|2000|p=200}}{{sfnp|Lanehart|2001|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;"Black critics [of Black English] use all the different arguments of the white critics, and spare us the more or less open embarrassment that all white Americans feel when publicly criticizing anything or anyone Black. So, of course, they can be even more wrong-headed and self-righteously wrong-headed than anyone else .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;." {{Harvcoltxt|Quinn|1982|pp=150–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A conspicuous example was the "[[Pound Cake speech]]", in which [[Bill Cosby]] criticized some African Americans for various social behaviors, including the way they talked.

Faced with such attitudes, the [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]] (CCCC), a division of [[National Council of Teachers of English]] (NCTE), issued a position statement on students' rights to their own language. This was adopted by CCCC members in April 1974 and appeared in a special issue of ''College Composition and Communication'' in Fall of 1974. The resolution was as follows:{{sfnp|Smitherman|1999|p=357}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;We affirm the students' right to their own patterns and varieties of language—the dialects of their nurture or whatever dialects in which they find their own identity and style. Language scholars long ago denied that the myth of a standard American dialect has any validity. The claim that any one dialect is unacceptable amounts to an attempt of one social group to exert its dominance over another. Such a claim leads to false advice for speakers and writers and immoral advice for humans. A nation proud of its diverse heritage and its cultural and racial variety will preserve its heritage of dialects. We affirm strongly that teachers must have the experiences and training that will enable them to respect diversity and uphold the right of students to their own language.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around this time, pedagogical techniques similar to those used to teach English to speakers of foreign languages were shown to hold promise for speakers of AAVE. William Stewart experimented with the use of dialect readers—sets of text in both AAVE and standard English.{{sfnp|Stewart|1975|p 117-120}} The idea was that children could learn to read in their own dialect and then shift to "Standard English" with subsequent textbooks.{{sfnp|Wardhaugh|2002|p=345}} {{Harvcoltxt|Simpkins|Holt|Simpkins|1977}} developed a comprehensive set of dialect readers, called bridge readers, which included the same content in three different dialects: AAVE, a "bridge" version that was closer to "Standard American English" without being prohibitively formal, and a Standard English version.{{sfnp|Simpkins|Holt|Simpkins|1977|p=??}} Despite studies that showed promise for such "Standard English as a Second Dialect" (SESD) programs, reaction to them was largely hostile{{sfnp|Morgan|1999|p=181}} and both Stewart's research and the Bridge Program were rejected for various political and social reasons, including strong resistance from parents.{{sfnp|Wardhaugh|2002|p=345}}{{sfnp|Downing|1978|p=341}}{{sfnp|Morgan|1999|p=182}}

A more formal shift in the recognition of AAVE came in the "[[Ann Arbor Decision]]" of 1979 (''Martin Luther King Junior Elementary School Children et al., v. Ann Arbor School District''). In it, a federal judge of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|Eastern District of Michigan]] ruled that in teaching black children to read, a school board must adjust to the children's dialect, not the children to the school,{{sfnp|Wardhaugh|2002|p=345}} and that, by not taking students' language into consideration, teachers were contributing to the failure of such students to read and use mainstream English proficiently.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=123, 222}}

National attitudes towards AAVE were revisited when a [[Oakland Ebonics controversy|controversial resolution]] from the [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] (California) school board ([[Oakland Unified School District]]) on December 18, 1996, called for "[[Ebonics (word)|Ebonics]]" to be recognized as a language of African Americans.{{sfnp|Coulmas|2005|p=213}} In fact, ebonics would be classified as a "second language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=WOO|first1=ELAINE|last2=Curtius|first2=Mary|title=Oakland School District Recognizes Black English|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-20/news/mn-11042_1_black-english|accessdate=July 25, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Black English" Named Second Language|url=http://www.mtv.com/MTVNEWS/newsmain/story6.html|accessdate=July 25, 2016|date=December 20, 1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961222033624/http://www.mtv.com/MTVNEWS/newsmain/story6.html|archivedate=December 22, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was to implement a program similar to the Language Development Program for African American Students (LDPAAS) in [[Los Angeles]], which began in 1988 and uses methods from the SESD programs mentioned above.{{sfnp|Morgan|1999|pp=184–185}}

Like other similar programs,{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=230, 232}} the Oakland resolution was widely misunderstood as intended to teach AAVE and "elevate it to the status of a written language."{{sfnp|Coulmas|2005|p=214}} It gained national attention and was derided and criticized, most notably by [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[Kweisi Mfume]] who regarded it as an attempt to teach [[slang]] to children.{{sfnp|Morgan|1999|p=173}} The statement that "African Language Systems are [[Genetic (linguistics)|genetically]] based" also contributed to the negative reaction because "genetically" was popularly misunderstood to imply that African Americans had a biological predisposition to a particular language.{{sfnp|Wolfram|1998|p=114}} In an amended resolution, this phrase was removed and replaced with wording that states African American language systems "have origins in West {{sic}} and Niger–Congo languages and are not merely dialects of English.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;."{{sfnp|Golden|1997|p=?}}

The Oakland proposal was explained as follows:  that black students would perform better in school and more easily learn standard American English if textbooks and teachers incorporated AAVE in teaching black children to speak Standard English rather than mistakenly{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=123}}&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard language is not the same as substandard, as explained for example by the cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' pp.&amp;nbsp;28 ''et seq.'' (Pinker's comments on dialects in general and AAVE in particular go unmentioned by [[Geoffrey Sampson]] in ''Educating Eve,'' a book-length attempted debunking of ''The Language Instinct''.) The same point is made in various introductions to language and sociolinguistics, e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Radford|Atkinson|Britain|Clahsen|1999|p=17}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Schilling-Estes|2006|p=312}} ''et seq.''; and also in surveys of the English language, e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Crystal|2003}}, sec.&amp;nbsp;20, "Linguistic Variation".&lt;/ref&gt; equating nonstandard with substandard and dismissing AAVE as the latter. {{Harvcoltxt|Baratz|Shuy|1969|p=93}} point to these linguistic barriers, and common reactions by teachers, as a primary cause of reading difficulties and poor school performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, research has been conducted on the overrepresentation of African Americans in special education&lt;ref&gt;.{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=227}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Artiles|Trent|1994}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Harry|Anderson|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Harvcoltxt|Van Keulen|Weddington|DeBose|1998|pp=112–113}} argue that this is because AAVE speech characteristics are often erroneously considered to be signs of speech development problems, prompting teachers to refer children to [[speech pathology|speech pathologists]].&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Smitherman, the controversy and debates concerning AAVE in public schools imply deeper [[Cultural determinism|deterministic]] attitudes towards the African-American community as a whole. Smitherman describes this as a reflection of the "power elite's perceived insignificance and hence rejection of Afro-American language and culture".{{sfnp|Smitherman|1977|p=209}} She also asserts that African Americans are forced to conform to European American society in order to succeed, and that conformity ultimately means the "eradication of black language .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. and the adoption of the linguistic norms of the white middle class." The necessity for "bi-dialectialism" (AAVE and General American) means "some blacks contend that being bi-dialectal not only causes a schism in the black personality, but it also implies such dialects are 'good enough' for blacks but not for whites."{{sfnp|Smitherman|1977|p=173}} 

=={{anchor|Ann Arbor Decision}} Ann Arbor decision==
The case of ''Martin Luther King Junior Elementary School Children et al. v. Ann Arbor School District'', known as the '''Ann Arbor Decision''', is considered to have established an important precedent in the education of poor African American students who are [[African American Vernacular English|Black English]] speakers.

The case was decided on July 12, 1979 by Judge Charles W. Joiner on the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]]. The suit was brought on behalf of poor black students at the school.  Gabe Kaimowitz, lead counsel for the Plaintiffs, alleged that the students were denied equal protection of the laws, because applicable Michigan regulations did not recognize social, economic and cultural factors differing those pupils from others.  Black middle class students at the school were not represented among the plaintiffs.  Judge Joiner in 1977 and 1978 rejected five of the six claims.  The sixth claim asserted that the Ann Arbor School District violated federal statutory law because it failed to take into account the home language of the children in the provision of education instruction. The court agreed. The judge ordered the school district to find a way to identify [[African American Vernacular English|Black English]] speakers in the schools and to "use that knowledge in teaching such students how to read standard English".&lt;ref&gt;Flood, J., Jensen, J., Lapp, D., Squire, J. (1991). ''Handbook of research on teaching the English language arts''. New York, NY: Macmillan Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Cases that led to the Ann Arbor Decision ===
In 1954, most of the United States had racially segregated schools, which was made legal by the ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' case in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thirteen.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/landmark_brown.html|title=The Supreme Court . Expanding Civil Rights . Landmark Cases . Brown v. Board of Education (1954) {{!}} PBS|website=www.thirteen.org|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case it held that segregated public schools were constitutional as long as the black and white children in the schools were equal. Throughout the middle of the twentieth century many civil rights groups and leaders challenged the school board's racial segregation through legal and political action. One of the actions, [[Brown v. Board of Education]] was filed, and is an important and significant case, which ultimately led up to the Ann Arbor Decision. The Brown v. Board of Education case was filed against Topeka and it went over how it violated the 14th amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/brvb/index.htm|title=Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case paved the way for integration in many public schools across the United States, but black students still faced many problems as stated in the Ann Arbor Decision. 

==Oakland Ebonics resolution==
On December 18, 1996, the [[Oakland Unified School District]] school board of [[Oakland, California]], United States, passed a controversial resolution recognizing the legitimacy of [[Ebonics (word)|Ebonics]]{{spnd}}what mainstream linguists more commonly term [[African American English]] (AAE){{spnd}}as an African [[language]]. The resolution set off a firestorm of media criticism and ignited a national debate.

For students whose primary language was Ebonics, the Oakland resolution mandated some instruction in this, both for "maintaining the legitimacy and richness of such language ... and to facilitate their acquisition and mastery of English language skills." This also included the proposed increase of salaries of those proficient in both Ebonics and Standard English to the level of those teaching [[limited English proficiency]] (LEP) students and the use of public funding to help teachers learn AAE themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Morgan|1999|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular response===
Some interpretations of the controversial issues in the resolution include the idea that Ebonics is not a [[vernacular]] or [[dialect]] of English, that it is a separate language; a member of the African language family;{{clarify|date=December 2016}} that [[African Americans]]  particular language and their dialects; that speakers of Ebonics should qualify for federally funded programs traditionally restricted to bilingual populations; and that students would be taught American Standard English via Ebonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wolfram|1998|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]] condemned the resolution, saying "I understand the attempt to reach out to these children, but this is an unacceptable surrender, borderlining on disgrace." His comments were seconded by former Secretary of Education [[William Bennett]], former New York governor [[Mario Cuomo]], and Senator [[Joe Lieberman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jackson would later reverse his position, attributing his initial opposition to a misunderstanding of the school district's proposal.  He said, "They're not trying to teach Black English as a standard language.  They're looking for tools to teach children standard English so they might be competitive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jackson Supports Oakland Ebonics; In Reverse, He Says School Board Action was Misunderstood  |first=Ros |last=Davidson |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=December 31, 1996 |page=A-5 |agency=[[Reuters| Reuters News Service]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2OQxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mW8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6455,8926366 |accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amended resolution===
The original resolution caused a great deal of consternation and anger, which fueled the controversy. On January 15, 1997, Oakland's school board passed an amended resolution. The original resolution used the phrase "genetically based" which was commonly understood to mean that African Americans have a biological predisposition to a particular language, while the authors of the resolution insisted that it was referring to [[Genetic (linguistics)|''linguistic'' genetics]]. This phrase was removed in the amended resolution and replaced with the statement that African American language systems "have origins in West and [[Niger-Congo languages]] and are not merely dialects of English."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Golden|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguists' response===

Some linguists and associated organizations issued statements in support of recognizing the legitimacy of African American English as a language system:

{{quote|The systematic and expressive nature of the grammar and pronunciation patterns of the African American vernacular has been established by numerous scientific studies over the past thirty years. Characterizations of Ebonics as "slang," "mutant," "lazy," "defective," "ungrammatical," or "broken English" are incorrect and demeaning. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. There is evidence from Sweden, the US, and other countries that speakers of other varieties can be aided in their learning of the standard variety by pedagogical approaches which recognize the legitimacy of the other varieties of a language. From this perspective, the Oakland School Board's decision to recognize the vernacular of African American students in teaching them Standard English is linguistically and pedagogically sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/ebonics.lsa.html Resolution On The Oakland "Ebonics" Issue Unanimously Adopted at the Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America, Chicago, Illinois   January 3, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Linguistic Society of America]]}}

{{quote|Research and experience have shown that children learn best if teachers respect the home language and use it as a bridge in teaching the language of the school and wider society.|[[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages]] (TESOL)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tesol.org/advance-the-field/position-statements/position-statement-of-the-tesol-board-on-african-american-vernacular-english-march-1997 Policy Statement of the TESOL Board on African American Vernacular English]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Walt Wolfram]], a linguist at [[North Carolina State University]], wrote that this controversy exposed the intensity of people's beliefs and opinions about language and language diversity, the persistent and widespread level of public misinformation about the issues of language variation and education, and the need for informed knowledge about language diversity and its role in education and in public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wolfram|1998|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in response to the amended resolution claiming that African American language systems "are not merely dialects of English",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Golden|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been some statements in opposition from linguists, since linguists do primarily regard African-American English as a dialect or variety of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Smith and Crozier|1998|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poplack"&gt;{{Citation|last=Poplack|first=Shana|authorlink=Shana Poplack|title=The English History of African American English|publisher=Blackwell|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Poplack|first=Shana|last2=Tagliamonte|first2=Sali|title=African American English in the Diaspora|publisher=Blackwell|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Word on the Street"&gt;{{cite book|title=Word on the Street: Debunking the Myth of a "Pure" Standard English|last=McWhorter|first=John H.|authorlink=John McWhorter|page=162|publisher=Basic Books|year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Edt7yUD6PkMC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

In law, an '''Answer''' was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or [[defense (legal)|defense]], a [[reply]] to a [[question]] or response, or [[objection (law)|objection]], or a correct solution of a problem.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Answer|volume=2|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common law]], an '''Answer''' is the first [[pleading]] by a [[defendant]], usually filed and served upon the [[plaintiff]] within a certain strict time limit after a civil [[complaint]] or criminal [[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]] or [[indictment]] has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an ''optional'' "pre-answer" [[motion to dismiss]] or [[demurrer]]; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant ''must'' file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse [[default judgment]].

In a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either [[guilt (law)|guilt]]y or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of [[equitable remedy]] such as [[restitution]] or a permanent [[injunction]]. Criminal cases may lead to [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s or other [[punishment]], such as [[imprisonment]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The famous Latin ''Responsa Prudentium'' ("answers of the learned ones") were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman [[lawyer]]s, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt;

During debates of a contentious nature, deflection, colloquially known as 'changing the topic', has been widely observed, and is often seen as a failure to answer a question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baaske|first1=Kevin|title=Arguments and Arguing: The Products and Process of Human Decision Making|date=2015|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53235">{{Theosophy}}
In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], '''Ascended Masters''' are believed to be spiritually [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] beings who in past [[incarnation]]s were ordinary humans, but who have undergone a series of spiritual transformations originally called [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiations]].

Both "[[Mahātmā#Theosophy|Mahatma]]" and "Ascended Master" are terms used in the Ascended Master Teachings. Ascended Master is based on the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] concept of the Mahatma or [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]. However, Mahatmas and Ascended Masters are believed by some to differ in certain respects.

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, a "Master", "Commoner", "Shaman", or "Spiritual Master" is a human being who has taken the Fifth Initiation and is thereby capable of dwelling on the 5th dimension. An "Ascended Master" is a human being who has taken the Sixth Initiation, also referred to as Ascension,&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2004. Describes the Theosophical Society and religious organizations based on a belief in Ascended Masters, such as The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom and The Summit Lighthouse. pp. 330–334.&lt;/ref&gt; and is thereby capable of dwelling on the 6th dimension. An "Ascended Master" is a human being who has regained full union with his "Mighty I AM Presence." When a human being has regained full union with his "Mighty I AM Presence," that state of full union is referred to as "Ascension." Technically, a human being "ascends" when he takes the Sixth Initiation, and not before then.

A "Chohan" (Lord) of a "Ray" is an Ascended Master who has been placed in charge of one of the 12 "Rays" (until recently, 7 Rays were generally known, and 5 Rays were "secret"), due to having an extraordinary natural spiritual affinity for that Ray. A "Ray" is a concentrated stream of spiritual energy emanating, ultimately, from the Godhead. Each "Ray" is the embodiment/expression of one of the 12 great God-Qualities, such as Divine Will, Divine Wisdom, Divine Love, etc. The "Chohans (Lords) of the Rays" thus constitute a special grouping of Ascended Masters (Sixth Level Initiates).

Those who have taken the Seventh Initiation hold the Senior Administrative Posts in the [[Great White Brotherhood]] on Earth. These senior administrative posts are divided into 3 departments: The Department of the Manu, the Department of the Planetary Christ, and the Department of the Mahachohan. "

A "Lord of the World" is a human being (or another organism) who has taken the Ninth Initiation. According to ascended master teaching, The Ninth Initiation is the highest Initiation possible on, what is believed to be a 9d-dimensional planet grid such as Earth by Ascended Master Teaching believers. They believe this will be until the end of [[2012 phenomenon|21 December, 2012]]. [[Sanat Kumara]] (a "Lord of the Flame" originally from the higher-dimensional levels of the planet Venus) was the original being who held the spiritual office of "Lord of the World"  here on planet Earth.

The term "Ascended Master" was first used by [[Baird T. Spalding]] in 1924 in his series of books, "The Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East" (DeVorss and Co.). Godfre Ray King further popularized this concept of spiritual masters who had once lived on the earth in his book ''Unveiled Mysteries'' &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press, 1934, p. vii: "The time has arrived, when the Great Wisdom, held and guarded for many centuries in the Far East, is now to come forth in America, at the command of those Great Ascended Masters who direct and protect the evolution of mankind upon this Earth."&lt;/ref&gt; (1934) by [[Guy Ballard]] (1878-1939). Ballard was the founder of the first "Ascended Master Teaching" in modern times, known as The [["I AM" Activity]] (in full: The "I AM" Religious Activity of the Saint Germain Foundation ).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Saint Germain Foundation. ''The History of the "I AM" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation''. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings were continued and embellished by later organizations such as [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;ref name="Freedom Journal 1961"&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' (1951-1961) Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1951) (known in the 1980s as The New Age Church of the Christ, and later as The Bridge to Spiritual Freedom), [[The Summit Lighthouse]]&lt;ref name="Lewis, James R. 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''White Paper - Wesak World Congress 2002''. Acropolis Sophia Books &amp; Works, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1958) and its successor organization the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], and various other organizations such as the [[White Eagle Lodge]] (1936).&lt;ref name="Braden, Charles S. 2000, pp. 257-307"&gt;[[Charles S. Braden|Braden, Charles S.]] ''These Also Believe'', MacMillan Publishing Company 2000, pp. 257–307.&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern form of the teachings, which did not rely on "channeled" messages, was given by a former associate of Godfre Ray King, Pearl Dorris, in Mount Shasta, California, beginning on October 20, 1972 and continuing until her death in Yreka, California in 1990 (See her biography: ''Lady Master Pearl, My Teacher'' by Peter Mt. Shasta, also the book she helped channel, ''Step by Step: Ascended Master Discourses''). Her emphasis was on learning to feel and identify  with the I AM Presence within, rather than invoking the "Presence" as an external mental principle. Under her tutelage, [[Peter Mt. Shasta]] was trained to continue the Masters' teachings, working today to incorporate the inner teachings of the Far East and their emphasis on self-observation, with the dynamic I AM teachings that uses affirmations to develop mastery in daily life. See ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. In [[Peter Mt. Shasta]]'s third autobiographical book ''My Search in Tibet for the Secret Wish-Fulfilling Jewel'' he mentions the widely held belief in Tibet that yogis ascend, ''jalus'' (Tibetan), by dissolving the five elements and raising the Nirmanakaya and Sambogakaya bodies into the Dharmakaya (known also as Atman, Monad, or I AM Presence).

The rays, the divine evolutions of peoples and planets are represented by 7 colors (new age) and more 5 colors (new age gold or solar rays). The colors of new age and solar rays are (in order): 1 blue (power of faith); 2 yellow (obedience); 3 pink (beauty; geniality); 4 white (ascension; peace; light); 5 green (nature); 6 red (true resurrection); 7 violet (New Age of Master Saint Germain); 8 turquoise (lucidity); 9 magenta (divine wonder; justiciars); 10 gold (materialization of wealth); 11 orange (sunshine); 12 Opaline (renewal).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Definition==
Students of Ascended Master Teachings organizations (also known as Ascended Master Activities) believe that the Presence of Life — God — individualizes as "Mighty I AM Presences," which then incarnate in lower-dimensional subtle and gross bodies throughout the created universes. They believe that their Teachings have been given to humanity by the Ascended Masters. Ascended Masters are believed to be individuals who have lived in physical bodies, acquired the Wisdom and Mastery needed to become Immortal and Free of the cycles of "re-embodiment" and karma, and have attained their "Ascension" (the Sixth Initiation). They consider the Ascension to be the complete permanent union of the raised and purified outer self with their Mighty "I AM" Presence - that True Identity that is the unique Individualization of Almighty God residing in each person. This knowledge is believed to have previously been taught for millions of years only within "Ascended Master Retreats" and "Mystery Schools". It is believed by adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that this wisdom was partially released by the [[Theosophical Society]] beginning in 1875, by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]], and began to have more detailed public release in the 1930s by the ''Ascended Masters'' through [[Guy Ballard]] in the [[I AM Activity]].&lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence"&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 89, 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I"&gt;Luk, A.D.K. ''Law of Life - Book I'' (Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications, 1989), pp. 1–78, 91–102, 120–143, 215–216. The name "A. D. K. Luk" was the pseudonym of Alice Beulah (Schutz) Booras (April 10, 1905 - Jan. 14, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; However, theosophists maintain that the concept of Ascended Master is an exaggeration and corruption of the more modest theosophical concept of "Master of the Ancient Wisdom."[https://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine?id=2382]  A similar problematic conflation of the term exits in the case of the Alice Bailey teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Beliefs about Ascended Masters==
Originally presented by [[Helena P. Blavatsky]] in the 1870s, the idea of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Mahatmas was adopted by people who at some point had had a connection with the Theosophical movement, such as Alice Bailey, [[Helena Roerich]], and [[Manly P. Hall]]. Later on many other organizations, especially in the [[United States]], developed the concept of Ascended Masters, which departs from the theosophical one in several aspects.

It is believed{{By whom?|date=August 2013}} that Ascended Masters are individuals who were formerly embodied on the Earth and learned the lessons of life during their incarnations. They gained mastery over the limitations of the [[Plane (esotericism)|matter plane]]s, balanced at least 51% of negative [[karma]], and fulfilled their [[Dharma]] (divine plan). An Ascended Master, in such an understanding, has become [[God]]-like and a source of unconditional "Divine Love" to all life, and through the Ascension has united with his or her own "God Self," the "I AM Presence."

It is further claimed by various groups and teachers that the Ascended Masters serve as the teachers of mankind from the realms of [[Spirit]], and that all people will eventually attain their Ascension and move forward in spiritual evolution beyond this planet. According to these teachings, they remain attentive to the spiritual needs of humanity, and act to inspire and motivate its spiritual growth. In many traditions and organizations, they are considered part of the ''Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth'', and members of the ''Great Brotherhood of Light'', also known as the ''Great White Lodge,'' ''[[Great White Brotherhood]],'' or ''Universal White Brotherhood'' (per [[Peter Deunov]]).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book I''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications, 1989, pp. 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alice Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]] there are sixty ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'', defined as beings who have reached the Fifth Level of Initiation or above, with Djwhal Khul in a pivotal role as the master who telepathically dictated the many [[esoteric]] teachings in Baileys' books. [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] revealed, by taking "dictations" from them, the names of many dozens of additional Ascended Masters that were previously unknown.

The concept of recognizing the spiritual self, one's own psychological and karma battles and how to overcome them, and eventual Ascension of all humanity is covered in [[James Redfield]]'s ''[[Celestine Prophecy]]'' and its sequels, ''[[The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision]]'' and ''[[The Secret of Shambhala: In Search of the Eleventh Insight]]''.  These books, while controversial, are recent popularizations of the concept of Ascension.

In Ascended Master teachings there is also mention of Serapis Bey, a being who was incarnated as a high priest in one of the "Temples of the Sacred Fire" on [[Atlantis]], and who migrated to [[Egypt]] at the time of the destruction of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays''. Summit University, Livingston, Montana, USA, 1986, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed {{By whom|date=February 2017}} that he was incarnated as the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep III]] (who constructed the [[Temple of Luxor]] to the god [[Amun|Amon]])&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and also as [[Leonidas]], the King of [[Sparta]],&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; who was killed in 480 BC defending the pass of [[Thermopylae]] against the invasion of [[Greece]] by Emperor [[Xerxes I]] of the [[Persian Empire]]. According to teachings of Agni Yoga,&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, Elena Ivanovna. ''Letters to America''. In 4 Vols (1923–1952).  T. 4. Moscow: Sfera, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Serapis Bey purports to be, in past lives, the Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]], and the philosophers [[Confucius]], [[Plato]] and [[Seneca the Younger]] (Lucius Annaeus Seneca). He is referred to in the book ''Supermundane'' as ''The Thinker''.

===Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life===
This is properly called Isness; students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that there is One God, the "Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life", "The One", Who is the Source of all Love, Light, and Truth in existence, and that all forms of existence and consciousness emanate from this "Allness of God" - "The One". ''The Voice of the I AM'' states "All Life is One" &lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM''. Saint Germain Press December 1940 page 32&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is "One Substance, One Energy, One Power, One Intelligence" as the Source of all consciousness and creation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM'', Saint Germain Press, July 1942, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This Divine Being and Mind is considered to be above and distinct from all creation (in the sense of classical [[theism]]), transcending all creation yet interpenetrating all existence. Belief in this one God stresses the essential unity of the spiritual and material components of the universe. God creates through Individualized Identities that have distinct Self-Consciousness and that make up the Spiritual Hierarchy of Creation, yet remain connected through the flow of the "River of Life" and "Lifestream" to the one undivided God — the All in All — the Good — the Source from which all Life, Light, and Love come.(or from which all things, yin &amp; yang come. Even what one may perceive as darkness "evil" or "bad" is in someway working out for the Good and toward the elevation and ascension of all people. All things pervading or pouring out from the One perfect intelligent mind i.e. God), there is always an uninterrupted Oneness that is maintained with the Allness of God. From the One God all other realities, including Hierarchy, humanity and the material universe, are the result of a process of emanation.

===The Individualized "I AM" Presence===
This is properly called Atma Brahman; adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that each person is an incarnation of an "Individualized Presence" of the "Most High Living God" — the "Mighty I AM Presence" — as part of humans' very nature and being. God (as Life and Love) manifests in the 7 octaves of the created universe through individual Divine Identities. As embodied individuals, we are the outer expression of that God Self in form. It is our unique and immortal True Identity, yet always sharing in the Allness of the ONE GOD.

==Origins==
The founder of the Theosophical Society, Helen Blavatsky, in the late 19th century brought attention to the idea of secret initiatory knowledge, by claiming her ideas were based on traditions taught to her by a group of highly enlightened yogis which she called the Mahatmas or Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. These Mahatmas, she claimed, were physical beings living in the [[Himalayas]], usually understood as [[Tibet]]:
 {{quote|... they are living men, born as we are born, and doomed to die like every mortal. We call them “masters” because they are our teachers; and because from them we have derived all the Theosophical truths&amp;nbsp;... They are men of great learning, whom we call Initiates, and still greater holiness of life.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. (1968 [1889]). ''The Key to Theosophy''. London: Theosophical Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Blavatsky's death in 1891, the concept of the Mahatmas was developed by her successors in the Theosophical Society leadership, [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles W. Leadbeater]], who described them in great detail and added [[Master Jesus]] and Maitreya. In Leadbeater's book, ''The Masters and the Path'' (1925), the Masters are presented as human beings full of wisdom and compassion, albeit still limited by human bodies, which they choose to retain in order to keep in touch with humanity and help in its evolution.&lt;ref&gt;See also: ''[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa#The K.H. Letters to C.W. Leadbeater|K.H. Letters to C.W. Leadbeater]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later organizations that used many of the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] for their own purposes, developed concept of Ascended Masters which bears some important differences with the Theosophical one. The ascended master Saint Germain has been releasing the ancient teachings in a more modern and simplified form, as can be found in the books of Peter Mt. Shasta, which show how the Masters can work with those who have an open heart and the desire to benefit humanity.&lt;ref&gt;"Adventures of a Western Mystic: Apprentice to the Masters" (Church of the Seven Rays, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other beliefs about Ascended Masters==
Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the beliefs of various organizations that have continued and expanded the concepts released in the original Saint Germain instruction in the 1930s through [["I Am" Activity|The "I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref name="AM Ascended Master Dictation List' 1995"&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'', Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.

''Unveiled Mysteries'' says:
{{quote|Truly the Great Ascended Masters are Gods. It is no wonder in the mythology of the ancients that their activities have been brought down to us in the guise of myth and fable.

When Jesus said, 'All these things I have done, ye shall do and even greater things shall ye do,' he knew whereof he spoke," continued Saint Germain. "He came forth to reveal the Conscious Dominion and Mastery that it is possible for every human being to attain and express while still here on Earth.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}}}

==Jesus==
{{Main|Master Jesus}}
Jesus is one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in Theosophy and is one of the Ascended masters (also collectively called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]; with white being in reference to the light) in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy. The Master Jesus is regarded by Theosophists, was regarded by Alice Bailey and was later regarded by students of the "Ascended Master Teachings" as the Master of the [[Seven Rays|Sixth Ray]].&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust, 1925, p. 1237.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Ascended Master Teachings organizations that the Master Jesus was "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" until December 31, 1959, when, according to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], Lady Master Nada fully took on that Office in the Spiritual Hierarchy. According to Prophet, Jesus became World Teacher, along with Kuthumi, on January 1, 1956, succeeding Maitreya, who took the Office of "Planetary Buddha" and "Cosmic Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K. ''The Law of Life: Book II'', Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications, 1989; pages 267–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana: Summit University Press 1986 page 225&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is not accepted by adherents of traditional Theosophy and the followers of Alice A. Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]] - they believe that the Master Jesus is still the Chohan of the Sixth Ray and that Maitreya is still the World Teacher.

According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the [[Prophet]] of the Church Universal and Triumphant, the largest Ascended Master Teachings religion, the Master Jesus incarnated twice as the Emperor of Atlantis, once in 33,050 BC and again in 15,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 142-143&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in order to aid the [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magicians]] in the war of the white magicians and the [[black magic]]ians that was going on in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] at that time.

According to Alice A. Bailey, the Master Jesus was previously incarnated as [[Joshua]], the Hebrew military leader in the 13th century BC, and [[Joshua the High Priest]] in the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: Lucis Publishing, 1922, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara==
{{Main|Sanat Kumara}}
According to the post-1900 publications of Theosophy (specifically, the writings of [[Charles W. Leadbeater]], Alice A. Bailey, and [[Benjamin Creme]], as well as the Ascended Master Teachings of Guy Ballard, [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings teachers), Sanat Kumara&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html Sanat Kumara] at ascension-research.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm A Progress Report On Our Ascension] at luisprada.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an "advanced being" of the Ninth Initiation (the highest Initiation possible on planet Earth) who is regarded as the Lord or Regent of [[Earth]] and of [[human race|humanity]], and the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]], a city said by Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to be a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]].

It is believed by these authors that he is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, which is composed of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Fifth Initiation), Ascended Masters (Sixth Initiation), Chohans and Bodhisattvas (Seventh Initiation), Buddhas (Eighth Initiation), and highly spiritually-evolved volunteers from other worlds, who have all joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner. ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'', Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara was mentioned briefly  by the theosophist Helena Blavatsky.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna. ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'', Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara - Volume I: pp. 89, 457–458; Volume II: pp. 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition  have misunderstood as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna. ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'', Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II, pp. 243 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when her follower Charles W. Leadbeater wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the Great White Brotherhood of Mahatmas who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997), pp. 296-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later theosophists such as Alice Bailey and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have embellished the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.

==Comparison with Masters of Wisdom==
There is considerable difference between the concept of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in Theosophy (as described by Blavatsky, [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], and others) and the current concept of Ascended Masters, developed by Guy Ballard and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] fifty-five years after the [[Theosophical Society]] was founded.

They added more than 200 new "Ascended Masters" that they claimed to receive dictations from in addition to receiving dictations from the original ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' of Theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press--See Profiles of the Ascended Masters Pages 13-394--More than 200 Ascended Masters are listed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ascended Masters, as their name suggests, are supposed to be Masters who have experienced the miracle of ascension, as it is said Jesus did. The original teaching, channeled by Guy Ballard, was that a new Ascended Master would not die but would take the body up with him. This teaching of ascension is in direct opposition to the Theosophical teachings. Mahatma K.H. refers to the idea disparagingly in one of his letters to Sinnett:
{{quote|There was but one hysterical woman alleged to have been present at the pretended ascension, and&amp;nbsp;... the phenomenon has never been corroborated by repetition.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T., and Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 5. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Blavatsky also rejects ascension as a fact, calling it "an allegory as old as the world."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Collected Writings vol. 8, p. 389. Wheaton: Theosophical Publishing House, 1977-91; See also CW 4:359-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Theosophical view, the Masters of Wisdom retain their physical bodies.

The Masters of the Wisdom are not like the Ascended ones, who are said to become Godlike, all-powerful beings beyond the laws of nature. In their teachings, the Theosophical Masters even denied that such beings exist. Mahatma K.H. wrote:
{{quote|If we had the powers of the imaginary Personal God, and the universal and immutable laws were but toys to play with, then indeed might we have created conditions that would have turned this earth into an Arcadia for lofty souls.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T; Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 474. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In their letters, the Mahatmas constantly talk about the "immutable laws" of the universe, and that they can help humanity only within the limits of these laws.

Proponents of the Ascended Masters sometimes attempt to account for these discrepancies by claiming that when the Theosophical Society (TS) was founded most of the Theosophical Mahatmas were still "unascended Masters". This leaves room to detach the Ascended Masters from the limitations. However, the Mahatma K.H. wrote: "We are not infallible, all-foreseeing 'Mahatmas' at every hour of the day."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T; Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 450. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As he explained: "An adept—the highest as the lowest—is one only during the exercise of his occult powers."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T; Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 257. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to the Theosophical teachings, the higher the adept, the less we are likely to hear from him:
{{quote|The more spiritual the Adept becomes, the less can he meddle with mundane, gross affairs and the more he has to confine himself to a spiritual work&amp;nbsp;... The very high Adepts, therefore, do help humanity, but only spiritually: they are constitutionally incapable of meddling with worldly affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. ''Collected Writings'' vol. 6, p.247. Wheaton: Theosophical Publishing House, 1977-91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Theosophical view the Masters do not pay attention to personal desires. Theosophy teaches that the psychological ego is false, that the idea that we are this body, emotions, and mind is a mistake of perception and the source of sorrow. It says that real happiness comes only as an unsought by-product of reducing rather than increasing our attachment and identification with the personal. Blavatsky wrote that "Occultism is not . . . the pursuit of happiness as man understands the word; for the first step is sacrifice, the second renunciation."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. ''Collected Writings'' vol 8, p. 14, Wheaton: Theosophical Publishing House, 1977-91.&lt;/ref&gt; K.H. agreed with this when he wrote: "We—the criticized and misunderstood Brothers—we seek to bring men to sacrifice their personality—a passing flash—for the welfare of the whole humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T., and Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H. in Chronological Sequence, p. 222. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; During the early times of the Theosophical Society, some members, misunderstanding the nature of the Mahatmas, would bring HPB some personal requests to ask of them. In a letter Blavatsky explained:
{{quote|The Masters would not stoop for one moment to give a thought to individual, private matters relating but to one or even ten persons, their welfare, woes and blisses in this world of Maya [illusion], to nothing except questions of really universal importance. It is all you Theosophists who have dragged down in your minds the ideals of our Masters; you who have unconsciously and with the best of intentions and full sincerity of good purpose, desecrated Them, by thinking for one moment, and believing that They would trouble Themselves with your business matters, sons to be born, daughters to be married, houses to be built,&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;C. Jinarajadasa, ''Early Teachings of the Masters'' p. iv. Chicago: Theosophical Press, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This kind of interest is a very marked feature of the Ascended Masters. The Ascended Masters Teachings teach ways to attract material or emotional possessions to a person's life, and also how to dissolve unpleasant karma, a conception that the Theosophical Mahatmas emphatically opposed. For example, K.H. wrote: "Bear in mind that the slightest cause produced, however unconsciously, and with whatever motive, cannot be unmade, or its effects crossed in their progress—by millions of gods, demons, and men combined."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T., and Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 77-78. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Ascended Masters are portrayed as cosmic fathers who will take care of their followers' problems. In contrast, Mahatma M. said: "We are leaders but not child-nurses."&lt;ref&gt;Eek, Sven, ed. ''Damodar and the Pioneers of the Theosophical Movement'', p. 605. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maitreya==
{{Main|Maitreya (Theosophy)}}
''Maitri'' is Sanskrit for "loving kindness." The [[Gautama Buddha|historical Buddha]] was reported to have said near the time of his death in the 4th century BCE that many Buddhas (awakened ones) had come before him, and that in the future another Buddha would come who would be greater than him, and who would embody "Maitri." This prophecy created the expectation of a Buddha Maitreya, which was probably fulfilled in the advent of the being now called "Jesus," likely Apollonius of Tyanna, who on his travels in India and the Far East was reported in many texts to have been called, "Issa," probably short for "Rishi" (great sage). His teachings embody that principal of loving kindness. ''Maitreya'' or ''Lord Maitreya'' is described in Theosophical literature of the late 19th-century and subsequent periods as an advanced spiritual entity and high-ranking member of a hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, the so-called ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom''. According to Theosophical [[doctrine]], one of the Hierarchy's functions is to oversee the evolution of Humankind; in accord with this function Maitreya is said to hold the so-called ''Office of the World Teacher''. Theosophical texts posit that the purpose of this Office is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence. Humanity is thereby assisted on its presumed cyclical, but ever progressive, [[Evolution (term)|evolutionary]] path. Reputedly, one way the knowledge transfer is accomplished is by Maitreya occasionally manifesting or [[Incarnation|incarnating]] in the physical realm; the manifested entity then assumes the role of World Teacher of Humankind.

The Theosophical concept of Maitreya has many similarities to the earlier [[Maitreya]] doctrine in [[Buddhism]]. However, they differ in important aspects, and developed differently. The Theosophical Maitreya has been assimilated or appropriated by a variety of quasi-theosophical and non-theosophical [[New Age]] and [[Esoteric]] groups and movements. These have added, and advanced, their own interpretations and commentary on the subject.

=== {{anchor|dev}} Development of the concept ===
The first mention of Maitreya in a Theosophical context occurs in the 1883 work [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] by [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] (1840&amp;ndash;1921), an early Theosophical writer. The concepts described by Sinnett were amended, elaborated on, and greatly expanded in ''The Secret Doctrine'', a book originally published 1888. The work was the [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] of Helena Blavatsky, one of the physical founders of the [[Theosophical Society]] and of contemporary Theosophy. In it, the [[Messianism|messianic]] Maitreya is linked to both Buddhist and [[Hindu]] religious traditions. In the same work Blavatsky was to assert that there have been, and will be, multiple messianic (or messianic-like) instances in human history. These successive appearances of "emissarie{{interp|s}} of Truth" are according to the Blavatsky writings part of the unceasing oversight of Earth and of its inhabitants by a physically hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, called ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom''. The Theosophist, ""Alice Bailey,"" who broke with the Indian branch of the [[Theosophical Society]], and who was heavily influenced by orthodox Christianity, started the expectation that the ""Maitreya" would actually be reborn on the earth  as a physical being, fulfilling the Christian ideal of a [[Second Coming]], rather than the [[New Age]] ideal of the Christ being reborn in the heart of each individual.

==Initiation==
Initiation is a concept in Theosophy that there are nine levels of spiritual development that beings who live on [[Earth]] can progress upward through.  Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that [[human being]]s on [[Earth]] progress through as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], although [[evil]] acts may cause bad [[karma]] which may cause one to temporarily regress. It is believed{{By whom|date=August 2013}} that when [[soul]]s have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and have no further need to reincarnate.  At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls  have the opportunity to become members of the Spiritual Hierarchy.  This concept was developed by both [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and Alice A. Bailey beginning in the 1920s.
  
According to C.W. Leadbeater, Initiation is a process by which "we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, Charles W. ''The Masters and the Path'', Adyar, Madras, India, Theosophical Publishing House, 1925, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alice A. Bailey, ''Initiation'' is the "process of undergoing an [[Higher consciousness|expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness]]"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: Lucis Publishing, 1922, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by Theosophists that all [[soul]]s that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to [[reincarnate]]. Those who do not elect to become [[pratyeka buddha]]s and go directly into Spiritual Hierarchy governing [[nirvana]], gradually evolving upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, with other higher levels beyond.

The concept of Initiation is also recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Sixth Initiation is referred to as ''Ascension''. The first six initiations were named by Charles W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of [[Jesus]]

==The Great White Brotherhood==
The [[Great White Brotherhood]], in belief systems akin to [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] and [[New Age]], are said to be supernatural beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans.&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sects, 'Cults', and Alternative Religions: A World Survey and Sourcebook|last= Barrett|first= David|year= 1996|publisher= Blandford|location= London|isbn= 0-7137-2567-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or the Ascended masters.&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt; Various people have said they have received messages from these beings, including most notably [Helena Blavatsky (Theosophy), [[Aleister Crowley]] ([[Thelema]]), Alice A. Bailey ([[New Group of World Servers]]), Guy Ballard ([["I AM" Activity]]), Geraldine Innocente (The Bridge to Freedom), [[Mark L. Prophet]] &amp; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (Church Universal and Triumphant) and [[Benjamin Creme]] ([[Share International]]).&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;

The Masters are collectively called the "Great White Brotherhood" by various theosophists and esotericists. The use of the term "white" refers to their advanced spirituality (in other words, that they have a white colored 
[[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]) and has nothing to do with race. Blavatsky described many of the Masters as ethnically [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] or [[India]]n ([[Hindu]]), not [[European ethnic groups|European]].&lt;ref&gt;Sinnett, Alfred Percy. ''[[s:The Occult World/Occultism and Its Adepts#Page 24|The Occult World]]''. Boston: Colby &amp; Rich, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; She did, however, describe them as being from all cultures and races, such as the "Greek gentleman" known as [[Master Hilarion|Hilarion]].&lt;ref name="enigma"&gt;Sisson, Marina Cesar. [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/sisson1.htm ''Helena Blavatsky and the Enigma of John King'']; originally published as ''Informativo HPB'', No. 3, 4 and 5 English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teachings of various organizations that have taken the Theosophical philosophical concepts and added their own elements.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, Gordon J.; Partridge, Christopher. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'', Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of those believed to be Ascended Masters by these organizations are: Jesus, Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], Maitreya, [[Confucius]], [[Duke of Chou|Lord Lanto]] (Confucius' historical mentor), [[Mary (mother of Jesus)]], Lady Master Nada, [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]], Saint Germain, and Kuthumi, to name but a few.&lt;ref name="AM Ascended Master Dictation List' 1995"/&gt; It is believed that all of these put aside any differences they might have had in their Earthly careers, and unite instead to advance the spiritual well-being of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dictations==
Within "The I AM Activity" (founded by Guy Warren Ballard in the early 1930s), contact and cooperation with the Ascended Masters became a central part of each member's life. Through the Ballards as "Messengers", the Ascended Masters were believed to have regularly communicated with the students of "The I AM Activity." Those Addresses (known as "Dictations") were delivered before gatherings of members in Conclaves held throughout the United States of America, and published in the monthly periodical ''The Voice of The "I AM"'', and some were collected and reprinted in the "green books" of ''The Saint Germain Series''. In all, 3,834 Dictations from the Masters were received through Guy and Edna Ballard. Other "Ascended Master Activities" believed that the Ascended Masters, Cosmic Beings, Elohim, and Archangels continued to present a program for both individual development and spiritual transformation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004. Describes the religious organizations based on a belief in the Ascended Master Teachings, such as The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom and The Summit Lighthouse. pages 330 - 334&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that further instruction from the Ascended Masters and the rest of the Spiritual Hierarchy continued through new Dispensations with new Messengers, such as The Bridge to Freedom,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' 1951 - 1961 Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence.

==The Aquarian Church==
The Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (ACCU) is a denomination founded in 2006 based on ''The [[Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]]'' transcribed from the [[Akashic records|Akashic Records]] by [[Levi Dowling|Levi H. Dowling]]. The Aquarian Christine Church actively promotes Ascended Master Teachings and shares many beliefs in common with the I AM Movement, White Eagle Lodge and New Thought and Theosophical groups.  The book "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel" by ACCU founder Jacob L. Watson, expounds on the church's teachings which draw heavily from the writings of A.D.K. Luk (pen-name of Alice Beulah  Schutz) (April 10, 1905 - Jan. 14, 1994), the Saint Germain Series published by the Saint Germain Press (The Saint Germain Foundation), and especially from "The Lost Years of Jesus" compiled by Elizabeth Clare Prophet and published by The Summit Lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Jacob L. "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
[[René Guénon]] wrote a detailed critique of Theosophy titled ''Theosophy: history of a pseudo-religion'' (1921). In the book Guenon speculated that Blavatsky had acquired all her knowledge naturally from other books not from any supernatural masters. Guenon points out that Blavatsky spent a long time visiting a library at New York where she had easy access to the works of [[Jacob Boehme]], [[Eliphas Levi]], the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] and other [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] treatises. Guenon also speculated that Blavatsky had borrowed passages from extracts of the ''[[Kanjur]]'' and ''[[Tanjur]]'', translated by the eccentric orientalist [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]], published in 1836 in the twentieth volume of the ''Asiatic Researchers of Calcutta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=René |last1= Guénon |others= Alvin Moore, Jr. and Cecil Bethell (trans.)| title = Theosophy: history of a pseudo-religion | year=2004 | pages= 82–89 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7_WwVFntyFwC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K. Paul Johnson]] suggests in his book ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. Paul. ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'', Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which speculates that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Paul. “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements”, ''The New York Times'', 5 October 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] in his book ''The skeptic's dictionary'' (2003) speculates that Blavatsky used trickery into deceiving others into thinking she had paranormal powers. Carroll further speculates that Blavatsky had faked a materialization of a tea cup and saucer as well as written the messages from her masters herself.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd. ''The skeptic's dictionary'', 2003, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are bodies of texts that reflect distinct classical narrative in the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian sub-continent]] are called the vamsavali ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: ''vaṃśāvalī'', [[Devanagari]]: वंशावली). They bear special significance in the study of Nepalese history and its historical tradition. In continuation to the ''itihāsa''-''purāṇa'' tradition &lt;ref&gt;Thāpar, Romilā. (2009).

As a distinct historical narrative, they have a lot to reflect about the past in a broader sense. In [[Nepal]], such chronicles are abundant and historically important, but yet least researched. This sector is yet to be explored fully &lt;ref&gt;Ricardi Jr., Theodore. (1973). Book Review: History of Nepal. In Kuloy, Hallvard K. (Ed.). ''Kailash: A Journal of Himalayan Studies''. Vol. I.

The ''vaṃśāvalī''s, etymologically, refer only to the list of people of certain ''vaṃśa''s (''[[gotra]]'' or clan, ancestry in general).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Warrant officers (WO1–CW5) ==
[[Warrant Officer]]s (WO) and Chief Warrant Officers (CWO) in the US Military rank below officers but above officer candidates and enlisted servicemen. The first warrant officer rank, WO1 does not have a "commission" associated with it, instead having a "Warrant" from the Secretary of the Army. Warrant officers are allowed the same courtesies as a commissioned officer, but may have some restrictions on their duties that are reserved for commissioned officers. Warrant officers usually receive a commission once they are promoted to Chief Warrant Officer 2 (CW2), but are usually not referred to as "commissioned officers". WO1s may be and sometimes are appointed by commission as stated in title 10USC.

== For employment ==
[[Job hunting|Job seekers]] frequently send a cover letter along with their [[curriculum vitae]] or applications for employment as a way of introducing themselves to potential employers and explaining their suitability for the desired positions.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web |title=Cover Letters |website=MIT Global Education &amp; Career Development |url=https://gecd.mit.edu/jobs-and-internships/resumes-cvs-cover-letters-and-linkedin/cover-letters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers may look for individualized and thoughtfully written cover letters as one method of screening out applicants who are not sufficiently interested in their positions or who lack necessary basic skills.&lt;ref name="Yate2004"/&gt; Cover letters are typically categorized according to two purposes:
* applying for a specific, advertised opening (“letter of application”)
* expressing interest in an organization when the job seeker is uncertain whether there are current openings (“letter of inquiry”) &lt;ref name=CareerVT&gt;{{cite web |title=Cover letter types and samples |website=Career and Professional Development |publisher=Virginia Tech, Division of Student Affairs |url=http://career.vt.edu/job-search/presenting_yourself/cover-letters.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== For internship ==
Students are often asked to submit a cover letter for an internship application. Such cover letter should include examples of extracurricular and academic experience. Despite this specific information, [https://resumewritinglab.com/cover-letter-for-internship.html cover letters for internship] should have a [[Business_letter#Form|standard business letter format]]. 

* The ''{{dfn|application letter}}'', which responds to a known job opening.
* The ''{{dfn|inquiry letter}}'', which inquires about possible positions.

== Other uses ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
Résumé cover letters may also serve as [[marketing]] devices for prospective job seekers. Cover letters are used in connection with many business documents such as loan applications ([[mortgage loan]]), contract drafts and proposals, and executed documents. Cover letters may serve the purpose of trying to catch the reader's interest or persuade the reader of something, or they may simply be an inventory or summary of the documents included along with a discussion of the expected future actions the sender or recipient will take in connection with the documents.

A '''criminal charge''' is a formal accusation made by a governmental authority (usually a [[Prosecutor|public prosecutor]] or the [[Police|police]]) asserting that somebody has committed a [[crime]].  A charging document, which contains one or more criminal charges or '''counts''', can take several forms, including:

* [[complaint]]
* [[information (formal criminal charge)|information]]
* [[indictment]]
* [[Summons#Citation|citation]]
* [[traffic ticket]]

The charging document is what generally starts a criminal case in [[court]]. But the procedure by which somebody is charged with a crime and what happens when somebody has been charged varies from country to country and even, within a country, from state to state.

Before a person is proven guilty, the charge must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref name="Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond A Reasonable Doubt|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Beyond+a+Reasonable+Doubt|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Punishment ==
There can be multiple punishments due to certain criminal charges. Minor criminal charges such as [[misdemeanor]]s, tickets, and infractions have less harsh punishments.  The judge usually sentences the person accused of committing the charges right after the hearing. The punishments generally include fines, suspension, probation, a small amount of jail time, or alcohol and drug classes. If the criminal charges are considered more serious like a [[felony]], then there is a more lengthy process for determining the punishment. Felonies include the most serious crimes such as [[murder]] and [[treason]]. In addition to the trial that decides innocence or guilt, there is a separate trial (after one is [[convicted]]) that determines the punishment(s) for the criminal charges committed.&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Larson|first=Aaron|title=Criminal Charges|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/criminal_charges.html|work=Law Offices of Aaron Larson|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights when facing criminal charges==
In the United States, people facing criminal charges in any situation are given rights by the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vinson|first1=Carl|title=Your Basic Constitutional Rights in the Criminal Justice System|url=https://www.georgialegalaid.org/resource/your-basic-constitutional-rights-in-the-crimi|website=GeorgiaLegalAid.org|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights include things like the [[right to remain silent]], [[habeas corpus]], and the [[right to an attorney]]. It is important for someone facing criminal charges to know their rights so they can take the proper action using their rights. Among those rights are a criminal suspect's [[Miranda Rights]] which are read to a suspect prior to interrogation while in the custody of the police. If a suspect is not given a Miranda warning prior to interrogation it is possible that the suspect's statements will be excluded from evidence in a later criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Geoffrey R.|title=The Miranda Doctrine in the Burger Court|journal=The Supreme Court Review|date=1977|volume=99|page=169|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/scr.1977.3109510?journalCode=scr|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prosecution ==
Many people avoid criminal charges by staying out of the state where they committed the crime. A person facing state criminal charges is always prosecuted in the state where they committed the charges.&lt;ref name=Cornell /&gt;  A person may be able to get away with minor violations like a ticket, but they will not be able to hide from something like a misdemeanor or a felony.  
There are about sixty criminal charges that are considered more serious that people face every day. These charges can range from less serious actions such as [[shoplifting]] or [[vandalism]] to more serious crimes such as [[murder]].&lt;ref name=FindLaw /&gt;

== Reckoning ==
A person may not even know if he/she was charged. If he/she is really worried, he/she can contact an [[Lawyer|attorney]] to ascertain if he/she was charged with any crime(s). A police officer may also charge someone after they investigate the possible crime(s) he/she committed.&lt;ref name="Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Procedure|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Criminal_procedure|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FindLaw&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finley|first1=Laura|title=Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia of Trends and Controversies|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1610699289|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3J1DQAAQBAJ|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denman Waldo Ross''' (1853-1935) was an [[United States|American]] painter, art collector, and scholar of art history and theory. He was a professor of art at [[Harvard University]] and a trustee of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].

==Early life==
Denman Waldo Ross was born in 1853. He completed his undergraduate studies at [[Harvard University]] in 1875, and earned his doctorate in political economy from the same institution five years later.

==Career==
Ross came to be interested in art soon after this, and began teaching courses in design and art theory at Harvard by 1889. Ross would spend much of the rest of his life lecturing on these and related topics, working with the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston on their burgeoning Oriental Art department, and traveling the world in search of artworks to add to his personal collection. Ross was also a member of some of Boston's elite inner circles, and is known to have brushed elbows not only with other prominent people associated with the Museum of Fine Arts and the art world, but also with the likes of [[Louis Brandeis]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Joseph Lindon Smith]], [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] and various members of Boston's most [[Boston Brahmin|prominent families]].

A number of his students at Harvard, the Museum of Fine Arts, and elsewhere he lectured, went on to become prominent artists. [[Hyman Bloom]] and [[Jack Levine]] were among these, as was [[Marie Danforth Page]].&lt;ref name="Tufts(U.S.)1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Eleanor Tufts]]|author2=National Museum of Women in the Arts (U.S.)|author3=International Exhibitions Foundation|title=American women artists, 1830-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvxPAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=International Exhibitions Foundation for the National Museum of Women in the Arts|isbn=978-0-940979-01-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection of objects donated by Ross to the Museum of Fine Arts over the course of his career as a collector covers a wide geographical, chronological, and material diversity. He collected a myriad of European art objects, along with a great many Chinese and Japanese paintings and textiles. Among the many objects in the Denman Waldo Ross collection at the Museum are a stone head from [[Angkor Wat]], a 7th-century Chinese scroll painting attributed to [[Yan Liben]], a set of ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[Byōbu|folding screen paintings]] of [[Kyoto]]'s [[hanamachi|pleasure quarters]], and a number of Chinese Buddhist [[stele]]s and paintings.

In 1907, he published a manual of design : "A Theory of Pure Design: Harmony, Balance, Rhythm" by Houghton-Mifflin and co.

'''''A Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies''''' is a 1911 religious encyclopedia of biographies.

Edited by [[William C. Piercy]] and [[Henry Wace (Anglican priest)|Henry Wace]], [[Dean of Canterbury]] (1836–1924) in English-language version, it is in the [[public domain]] {{as of|2004|lc=y}}. The [[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]] has scanned the original printed copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/ |title=''A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an account of the Principal Sects and Heresies'' |publisher=[http://www.ccel.org/ Christian Classics Ethereal library]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[Hendrickson Publishers]] reprinted it under the title ''A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography And Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |location=Peabody |url=http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/Henry%20Wace%20Christian%20Bio%20&amp;%20Lit%206th%20Century.pdf |isbn=1-56563-460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its predecessor was ''A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines'' (four volumes, 1877–87) edited by Wace and [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines |publisher=John Murray, Albemarle Street |location=London |url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp34349}}&lt;/ref&gt; That in turn represented an updated version of ''[[Smith's Bible Dictionary]]'' of 1863.

The '''Earth Human STR Allele Frequencies Database'''&lt;ref&gt;EHSTRAFD - Earth Human STR Allele Frequencies Database. c2009 [cited on 14 Jun 2009 - R1]. Available from http://www.ehstrafd.org&lt;/ref&gt; is a scientific project based on a dynamic web interface and a relational database management system. Its main purpose is the management of STR populational data reported from all over the world, providing highly specialized population genetics tools and also an overview of world population genetic structure at global scale.

At the bottom of EHSTRAFD approach stays peer-review journals standardization trend in publishing populational data&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Lincoln, Angel Carracedo.

== Database Tools (Modules) ==

''Allele Frequency Global Tracking'' (AFGT) - allows searching for allele frequency distribution at global and regional level. STR Loci are available in AFGT if there are reported in at least ten EHSTRAFD populations. The AFGT locus list is permanently updated with each EHSTRAFD release.

''Regional Profile Frequency'' (RPF) - allows calculating the frequency of a genetic profile at global and regional level, base on EHSTRAFD current records. RPF is available just for ISSOL ([[Interpol]] Standard Set Of Loci), ESS (European Standard Set - recommended by [[ENFSI]]) and [[CODIS]] (Combined DNA Index System) loci.

''Most Probable Geographical Origin'' (MPGO) - allows searching for the most probable geographical origin of a given STR genetic profile. Geographical origin is estimated by the profile frequency in different populations. MPGO is available just for ISSOL ([[Interpol]] Standard Set Of Loci), ESS (European Standard Set - recommended by [[ENFSI]]) and [[CODIS]] (Combined DNA Index System) loci.

'''''Extremist Groups''': An International Compilation of [[Terrorism|Terrorist Organization]]s, Violent Political Groups, and Issue-Oriented Militant Movements'' is a [[reference work|reference book]] compiling information on over 200 groups classified as [[extremist]].

Contributing editor Richard H. Ward describes it (in the preface) as "part of a broader effort (on the part of the OICJ) to better understand the [[motivation]]al, [[psychological]], and [[sociological]] aspects of those who would attack societies throughout the world."

The first edition was compiled and analyzed by Jeffrey A. Builta; it was published in 1996 with 1,121 pages.  The second edition was compiled by Sean Hill as Senior Researcher and Richard H. Ward as contributing editor, with a foreword by Kathleen Kiernan, Assistant Deputy Director, [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]]. It was released in 2002 as a 961-page hardcover ({{ISBN|0-942511-73-5}}) and paperback ({{ISBN|0-942511-74-3}}) by the Office of International Criminal Justice and the [[Institute for the Study of Violent Groups]] at [[Sam Houston State University]]. The third edition was published in 2006, a paperback of 456 pages with 145 entries.

The profile of each group provides (when able): what the group is also known as; when it was formed; its stated aims/[[ideology]]/policy; the location of its [[headquarters]]; its area of operations; its size; the nature of its structure; names of its leaders (with their position); membership information (either the type of the population recruited from, or the names of prominent members with their record); sources of its funding; its [[modus operandi]]/[[tactic (method)|tactics]]; its publications; its business network contacts; a chronology of its significant actions and activities; a trend assessment; and sources for further reading.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="974">In '''''Food and Allied Workers Union and Another v The Cold Chain''''', an important case in [[South African labour law]], the Labour Court held that there was nothing absurd in permitting a senior managerial employee to participate in the activities of a trade union, provided that the employee complies with his contractual obligations. In this case, the employee was offered a managerial position as an alternative to retrenchment, on condition that he no longer participated in the activities of the trade union. When he refused, he was retrenched. The court did not hesitate to find the dismissal to be automatically unfair.

'''Fletcher Aluminium Ltd v O'Sullivan [2001] 2 NZLR 731''' is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding that a restrictive covenant in a business sale may be enforceable even if there is no goodwill involved.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
O'Sullivan developed some aluminum windows. Fletcher Aluminium, interested in the designs, entered into an agreement with him to purchase the designs for $1.7 million, as well as giving him a job as a franchise manager. Part of the agreement included a restraint of trade clause.

Later, O'Sullivan undertook employment from a rival firm, and Fletchers sought to enforce the restraint of trade agreement.

==Held==
The court granted the restraint of trade injunction.

The '''Frick Art Reference Library''' is a research institution affiliated with [[The Frick Collection]]. It is located at 10 East 71st Street (between Madison and Fifth Avenue) in New York City. The library is housed in a six-story building designed by the architect [[John Russell Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|title=Streetscapes/The Frick Art Reference Library; A Memorial Built by a Daughter for Her Father|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/15/realestate/streetscapes-frick-art-reference-library-memorial-built-daughter-for-her-father.html|accessdate=17 August 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Helen Clay Frick]] founded the Frick Art Reference Library in 1920 as a memorial to her father, [[Henry Clay Frick]], who died in 1919. Its first home was the bowling alley of the Frick residence, which is now The Frick Collection. In 1924, the library moved from the bowling alley to a one-story building at 6 East 71st Street, designed by the architecture firm, [[Carrère and Hastings]]. The library opened to the public in its current building on January 14, 1935.

==Mission==
The Frick Art Reference Library is open to adults (18 or older). In addition, it serves the greater art and art history research community through its membership in the [[New York Art Resources Consortium]], which also includes the libraries of the [[Brooklyn Museum]] and [[The Museum of Modern Art]]. The library established the [[Center for the History of Collecting]] in 2007. The center supports the study of the formation of collections of fine and decorative arts, both public and private, from Colonial times to the present through its fellowships, symposia, and publications.

==Collections==
The collections held at the Frick Art Reference Library focus on art of the Western tradition from the fourth century (A.D.) to the mid twentieth century (A.D.), and chiefly include information about paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints, and illuminated manuscripts. Archival materials augment its research collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/research/archives Archival materials]&lt;/ref&gt; The Library holds more than 228,000 monograph and 3,300 periodical titles. The collection includes several highlights: an auction catalog collection that contains approximately 90,000 items; the [[Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive]] which holds more than 1 million images including photographs and clippings of works of art; and the electronic resources collection which consists of more than 2,000 subscription databases and e-journals, as well as e-books.

==List of Chief Librarians==
There have been seven Chief Librarians (known as the [[Andrew W. Mellon]] Chief Librarian since 1992) of the Frick Art Reference Library:
* [[Stephen J. Bury]], 2010 to present
* [[Patricia Barnett]], 1995 to 2008
* [[Helen Sanger]], 1978 to 1994 (the first Andrew W. Mellon Chief Librarian)
* [[Mildred Steinbach]], 1970 to 1977
* [[Hannah Johnson Howell]], 1947 to 1970
* [[Ethelwyn Manning]], 1924 to 1947
* [[Ruth Savord]], 1920 to 1924

'''''Grace Quan''''' is a modern reconstruction of a Chinese-American [[Shrimp fishery|shrimp fishing]] [[Junk (ship)|junk]], similar to those in the fleet that operated in [[San Francisco Bay]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name =GQ&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.nps.gov/safr/learn/historyculture/shrimpjunk.htm | title =The Grace Quan | website =[[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] | publisher =[[National Park Service]] | access-date = June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The junk was built in 2003 as a joint project between [[China Camp State Park]] in [[San Rafael, California]] and the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]], and is now jointly exhibited and operated by both institutions. It functions as a "working sailing museum" to educate the public about a previously forgotten chapter in the history of Chinese-American immigrants to California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sullivan | first = Kathleen| title =Chinese shrimp junk to get festive send-off on Saturday | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| date =April 9, 2004 | url =http://m.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Chinese-shrimp-junk-to-get-festive-send-off-on-2768874.php| accessdate = June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian fishermen began catching shrimp in [[San Francisco Bay]] around 1869, followed by Chinese fishermen in 1871, using traditional bag nets imported from China. Soon, immigrant Chinese fishermen from [[Guangdong]] dominated shrimp fishing in Northern California.&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt; The Chinese also fished for shrimp in nearby [[Tomales Bay]], but those fisheries were abandoned in the 1890s. Junks were built at several places along the West Coast of the United States by Chinese shipwrights using traditional techniques and local lumber.

By the end of the 19th century, dozens of traditional Chinese shrimp fishing junks built in California were operating on the bay.&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt; As many as nine to ten million pounds of shrimp were harvested from the bay annually before restrictions on the fishery were imposed.&lt;ref name = Plank /&gt;

Although a small quantity of shrimp were sold locally, most were boiled and dried, resulting in a shelf-stable product that was exported to China and Hawaii.&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt; Drying resulted in two products: one third by weight the higher-grade product, called [[Dried shrimp|dried shrimp meat]], which was used for human consumption, and two thirds the lower-grade product, called shrimp meal, which was used for fish food and plant fertilizer.&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt;

Political opposition to the fishery began in 1885, based on the assumption that [[bycatch]] in the Chinese nets was killing large numbers of desirable young fish, especially [[Oncorhynchus|salmon]] and [[striped bass]].&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt; The opposition was exacerbated by the prevalent [[Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States|anti-Chinese sentiment]] in California in the late 19th century. Studies showed that the concerns were greatly exaggerated, and that the fishermen ate or gave away the edible fish. A 1932 report concluded that "the average striped bass is too spry to be taken in any such rig."&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt; Restrictive regulations were implemented, beginning in 1901 with an annual four-month closure of the fishery during the height of the season, a ban on the export of dried shrimp in 1905, followed by a ban on Chinese nets in 1911, forcing a switch to [[Trawling|beam trawl nets]], which required motorized boats.&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt; Arrests of Chinese fishing crews were common in the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt; The ban on exports was lifted in 1919, leading to a tripling in production in the 1920s.&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt;

California state fishery records show that in 1930, the catch was 2,687,831 pounds of shrimp from the bay, 35 boats were operating, and 72 men were employed.&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt; There were 12 shrimp fishing camps at [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco|Hunter's Point]] in San Francisco, and two in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], including China Camp.&lt;ref name = Bonnot /&gt; Only a handful of traditional sail powered junks remained in service, and most of the boats were converted motorized junks or Western style fishing boats.&lt;ref name = Bonnot&gt;{{cite news | last = Bonnot| first =Paul | title = The California Shrimp Industry| newspaper =Fish Bulletin No. 38 | location = Terminal Island, California| publisher =Division of Fish and Game of California | date =1932 | url =http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt3f59n68z&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text | accessdate = June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fishery went into a steep decline in 1936, due to a collapse in the export market due to the ongoing effects of the [[Great Depression]] and the intensification of war and revolution in China. After [[World War II]], the fishery was limited to a much lower volume catch for local sale as [[fishing bait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Construction ==
[[File:Grace Quan construction.jpg|thumb|Construction of ''Grace Quan'' in 2003]]
The kernel of the idea that eventually became ''Grace Quan'' goes back to 1995, when John Muir, while an undergraduate student, ran across an old photo of a Chinese junk sailing along the San Francisco waterfront.&lt;ref name = Plank /&gt; Muir is a distant relative of the [[John Muir|famous conservationist]] of the same name. While pursuing a master's degree, Muir excavated the wrecks of two junks at China Camp and took measurements.&lt;ref name = Plank /&gt; He later visited shipyards in Guangdong that still build wooden commercial fishing boats and studied their traditional construction methods.&lt;ref name = Plank /&gt; Muir later became small boat curator at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, and developed a proposal to build a replica of a late 19th century Chinese-style fishing junk, using the materials and techniques that were used to build similar boats in California.&lt;ref name = Plank/&gt;

Muir negotiated an agreement between the two parks to build the junk using volunteer labor and [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] lumber for most of the hull, milled from logs donated by a conservation group. Construction began in March, 2003.&lt;ref name = Plank /&gt; Traditional Chinese shipbuilding techniques were used, such as flame bending of planks, and edge-nailing using hand forged nails.&lt;ref name = Plank&gt;{{cite news | last =Lee | first =Lydia | title =Resail junk / Plank by plank, volunteers are building a Chinese shrimp boat the old-fashioned way to cruise the bay | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| date =August 29, 2003 | url =http://m.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Resail-junk-Plank-by-plank-volunteers-are-2559388.php| accessdate = June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joints between the planks were sealed using traditional caulk made by volunteers out of a mixture of [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[linseed oil]].&lt;ref name = GQ /&gt; This substance is called ''chu'nam'', and also includes organic fibers,  such as animal hair, grasses or bamboo fiber.&lt;ref name = Cassel/&gt;

The keel was laid on April 24, 2003, and the junk was launched on October 25, 2003.&lt;ref name =GQ /&gt; At the launch ceremony, it was announced that the junk would be named ''Grace Quan'', in honor of Frank Quan's mother.&lt;ref name = Tribute /&gt;

== Specifications ==
[[File:Grace Quan docked.jpg|thumb|''Grace Quan'' docked at China Camp State Park]]
''Grace Quan'' is {{convert|42|ft|3|in}} long and its [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) is {{convert|10|ft|4|in}}.&lt;ref name =GQ /&gt; It is a [[catboat]] rigged with a single mast.

Its [[Draft (hull)|draft]] with the [[daggerboard]] and [[rudder]] down is {{convert|5|ft}}. Its draft with the daggerboard and rudder raised is {{convert|1|ft|adj=on}}.&lt;ref name =GQ /&gt;

The junk is built of lumber native to California. The [[keel]], [[Plank (wood)|planks]], [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] and [[Deck (ship)|deck]] are made of redwood. The [[Mast (sailing)|mast]], [[Stem (ship)|stem]], [[thwart]]s and [[oar]]s are made of [[Douglas fir]].&lt;ref name = GQ /&gt; The mast was made from an 80 foot tall Douglas fir tree from [[Napa County, California|Napa County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://friendsofchinacamp.org/the-park/highlights | title =Highlights: The Grace Quan | date = 2016| website = China Camp State Park| publisher =Friends of China Camp | access-date =June 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oars include a traditional Chinese [[Sculling#China|sculling oar]] called a ''yuloh'', used from the [[stern]], and a pair of oars that can be used from the [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. These oars allow the crews of shrimp fishing junks to maneuver around the fixed nets when the wind is not blowing.&lt;ref name =GQ /&gt;

The boat's sail is made of cotton, and is treated with [[Notholithocarpus|tanbark oak]]&lt;ref name =GQ /&gt; which helps weatherproof the sail, and gives the sail its distinctive tan colour.&lt;ref name =GQ /&gt; The sail has six wooden [[Batten#Battens in sailing|battens]], which contribute to its distinctive appearance.

[[File:Frank Quan.jpg|thumb|Frank Quan at the tiller of ''Grace Quan'']]
In 2005, ''Grace Quan'' sailed from San Francisco Bay to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], where schoolchildren toured the boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/view.htm?id=03BEBAB1-155D-4519-3E35921079251C29

The junk is docked at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park at [[Hyde Street Pier]] in the winter and at China Camp State Park in San Rafael in the summer. It sails between these locations twice a year, a distance of about 15 [[nautical mile]]s.

In 2014, the junk took a voyage around San Francisco Bay, visiting the sites of several historic Chinese immigrant shrimp fishing villages, including stops in [[Richmond, California]], [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco|Hunters Point]] in San Francisco and [[Redwood City, California]] in the south bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chinese-whispers.org/events/bay-chronicles-2014/ | title =Public Programs: the forgotten history of Chinese shrimp fishing around San Francisco Bay | last =Yung | first =Rene | date =2014 | website =Chinese Whispers | access-date =June 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Replica&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.nps.gov/safr/learn/news/shrimpjunksailchartsimmigrationhistory.htm| title =Replica SF Junk Grace Quan Sails to Chart Overlooked Bay Area Immigration History | date =August 6, 2014 | website =San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park| publisher =National Park Service | access-date =June 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
When the junk was being built, Phil Choy, a historian with the [[Chinese Historical Society of America]], said, "This project dispels the perception that all Chinese were laundrymen and houseboys and cooks. They had know-how. They were enterprising and resourceful."&lt;ref name = Plank /&gt;

Rene Yung, director of community cultural group Chinese Whispers said in 2014 that "The historic Chinese immigrant experience in America was marked by oppression and erasure of their contributions from [[national memory]]. The once-thriving Chinese shrimping industry and community around San Francisco Bay is one of these forgotten stories." He described the voyage of ''Grace Quan'' as a tribute to "this pioneer community and San Francisco’s maritime heritage."&lt;ref name = Replica /&gt;

'''''Ist das Ihr Fahrrad Mr O’Brien?''''' (Is this your bicycle, Mr. O'Brien?) is a German biographical radio play about life, works and legacy of Irish modernist writer '''[[Brian O'Nolan]]''' ({{lang-ga|Brian Ó Nualláin}}; 5 October 1911 – 1 April 1966).[[File:AlbrechtBehmelCoverRadioplayOBrien2013.jpg |thumb|cover of first edition 2003]]

==Plot summary==

Irish novelist Brian O'Nolan uses numerous pseudonyms for his literary works. In this radio-drama, these pseudonyms meet and argue with characters from O’Nolan’s novels and narrations. The plot roughly follows O’Nolans real life as a student in Nazi-Germany, his return to inter-war Ireland, unemployment and career in the civil service,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writerstears.com/?p=227 writer’s tears]&lt;/ref&gt; his declining health, dislike of James Joyce and constant financial troubles. 

In the German original the drama was subtitled ‘’Eine Hörspielcollage aus der Welt der Wissenschaft und des Suffs’’ (A radio play patchwork from a world of science and booze), a claim that was brought to life by creative use of sound footage, music, audio-gags, and music by [[The Dubliners]] and other celtic folksingers.&lt;ref&gt;Keating, Sara. [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1017/1224305920174.html "Trinity plays host to Flann 100 as admirers celebrate comic genius"], ''The Irish Times'', 17 October 2011. "In a twist of Mylesian absurdity, however, the highlight of the day's cultural programme proved to be a science lecture by Prof Dermot Diamond, in which Diamond convincingly argued that O'Brien was not just a literary genius but a scientific prophet. Diamond set recent experiments in the fields of thermodynamics, quaternion theory and atomic theory against excerpts from O'Brien's books, suggesting that O'Brien anticipated some of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sources and setting==
The radio play draws from a number of novels, articles, and letters by O’Brien using German translations by [[Harry Rowohlt]] and original English texts alike. Rowohlt, an expert on O’Nolan and popular voice artist himself, was not included in the project by the producers.

*''[[The Third Policeman]]''
*''[[An Béal Bocht]]''
*''[[The Hard Life]]''
*''[[The Dalkey Archive]]''
*’’[[Cruiskeen Lawn]]’’

Accordingly, the play’s many settings include some of O’Nolans favorite places, namely [[Trinity College, Dublin]]; editorial offices of the [[Irish Times]]; a pub in pre-war Cologne; the Irish country-side; rural police stations, roads, barns, and stables.

==Characters and performers==
*Narrator: Hüseyin Cirpici
*Flann O'Brien: Martin Engler
*3rd Policeman: Udo Thies
*Professor De Selby: Ernst August Schepmann
*The plain people of Ireland: Peter Penewsky

In the play, a number of writers, historic, literary or public figures, and scientists are mentioned to illustrate O’Nolan’s colorful and over-populated universe, such as Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, [[Graham Greene]], James Joyce, [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], [[Harry Rowohlt]], Homer, Jonathan Swift, George Bernhard Shaw, the Marx Brothers, [[Brendan Behan]], [[Éamon de Valera]], Karl Kraus, Sherlock Holmes, and Erwin Schrödinger.

==Awards==
Soon after the play was first aired, the first nominations for German radio awards were announced. Later that year it won the prestigious ‘Radio Play of the Month Award’ by the German National Academy of Performing Arts.&lt;ref&gt;Jury [http://www.jokan.de/hsp-news-2003.html Albrecht Behmels Collage zu Leben und Werk des irischen Dichters Flann O'Brien], ''Albrecht Behmels Collage zu Leben und Werk des irischen Dichters Flann O'Brien besticht durch die herzerfrischende Art des Erzählens wobei die weit verbreiteten Klischees über Irlands Bewohner (Melancholie und heftiger Alkoholkonsum) ironisch gebrochen und derart respektlos aufpoliert werden, dass ein funkelndes, fesselndes Hör-Erlebnis entsteht. Dabei gelingt es durchaus, neben seinem umwerfenden Witz auch die Tragik Flann O'Briens deutlich zu machen - ohne jede Vordergründigkeit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|’’This radio-play about Irish writer Flann O’Brien is a refreshingly narrated, ironically twisted array of uberwell-known stereotypes about the Irish, like melancholy or heavy drinking. Endowed with brilliant humor, it brings to life the tragic side of O’Nolans existence, too.’’}}

== Current ownership ==
Since most radio shows and plays aired by German national broadcasting companies are not accessible online, current owner and sole distributor is the [[Saarländischer Rundfunk]]. The play has been regularly re-broadcast by federal Deutschlandfunk, and regional stations like [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]], [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] and [[Suedwestrundfunk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/hoerspiel/234404/Deutschlandfunk Deutschlandfunk 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Iznogoud''''' (pronounced "he's/is no good" with a [[French (language)|French]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]) is a [[France|French]] [[comics]] series featuring an [[eponymous]] character, created by the [[comic book creator|comics writer]] [[René Goscinny]] and [[comics artist]] [[Jean Tabary]]. The comic series chronicles the life of Iznogoud, the [[Grand Vizier]] and second in command of [[Baghdad]], at an undefined period in the past. His greatest desire is to replace the [[Caliph]] or [[Sultan]] of Baghdad [[Haroun El Poussah|Haroun El Plassid]], leading him to repeatedly utter the phrase "I want to be Caliph instead of the Caliph", a phrase that has been adopted in the French language to indicate overly ambitious people. Iznogoud is supported by his faithful servant, Wa'at Alahf.

After the death of Goscinny in 1977 Tabary continued with writing the character. The stories have been translated into several languages, including English, and the title has been adapted to animated and live-action film.

So far 29 graphic novels featuring Iznogoud have been published in French, with at least 26 of those published in English and a number of other languages. Iznogoud was also adapted into a cartoon series produced by [[Saban Entertainment]], with 52 episodes to its name, again with most of them having been translated to other languages as well.

==Publication history==
The series made its debut in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''Record'' on 15 January 1962 under the title, ''Les aventures du Calife Haroun el Poussah''.&lt;ref name="BDO-R1962"&gt;{{cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Record année 1962|url=http://bdoubliees.com/record/annees/1962.htm|language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually recognised that the wicked supporting character ought to be the focus of the strip, and it was renamed ''Iznogoud''.&lt;ref name="lambiek"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambiek Comiclopedia|title=Jean Tabary|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/t/tabary_jean.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, it resumed serial publication in Goscinny's ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine.

Goscinny's taste for sharp satirical writing keeps the repetitive format of the stories constantly fresh, making Iznogoud one of the most popular anti-heroes in the French comic strip world. Goscinny's skills with puns, made famous in ''[[Astérix]]'', is also evident in ''Iznogoud''. Most of the puns in the original French make little sense if translated directly into English, requiring of translators ([[Anthea Bell]] and [[Derek Hockridge]] in the case of the English translations) to find creative solutions for equivalent puns while still keeping within the spirit of the original text.

When Goscinny died in 1977, Tabary eventually decided to carry on the work himself, just as [[Albert Uderzo]] did with ''Asterix''. While the Goscinny period was characterized by "albums" comprising several short-length tales each, Tabary turned the series in a new direction, by dedicating every new album entirely to a single story, larger and much more detailed, usually revolving around a new unique concept.

In 1987 a game was produced by [[Infogrames]] entitled ''Iznogoud''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iznogoud Games|url=http://www.iznogoudworld.com/Games/games.html|publisher=iznogoudworld.com|accessdate=5 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126215602/http://www.iznogoudworld.com/Games/games.html|archivedate=26 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series was adapted to animated film in 1995 with a [[cartoon]] [[TV series]], where the caliph is referred to as a [[sultan]]. A live-action ''Iznogoud'' film starring [[Michaël Youn]] and [[Jacques Villeret]], ''Iznogoud: Calife A La Place Du Calife'', was released in France in February 2005.

The publisher [[Cinebook Ltd]] is currently publishing English language translations of the books in the Iznogoud series. The first book in the series, "The Wicked Wiles of Iznogoud", was published in March 2008. Further volumes continue to appear at approximately six month intervals. In India, Euro Books published the English versions of 12 Iznogoud titles in 2009.

==Synopsis==
'''Iznogoud''' is the second in command ([[Grand Vizier]]) to the [[Caliph]] of [[Baghdad]] '''[[Haroun El Poussah]]''' (Haroun El Plassid in English, a pun on the historical Caliph, [[Harun al-Rashid]]; "poussah" is roughly translated as "oaf") but his sole aim in life is to overthrow the Caliph and take his place. This is frequently expressed in his famous [[catchphrase]], "I want to be Caliph instead of the Caliph" ("je veux être calife à la place du calife"), which has passed into everyday French for qualifying over-ambitious people who want to become chief. Iznogoud is always assisted in his plans by his faithful henchman, '''Dilat Larath''' (Wa'at Alahf in English, se dilater la rate = have a good laugh, in French).

===Supporting characters===
Goscinny and Tabary occasionally make appearances themselves. In one episode, Tabary uses a magical time-travelling closet to help Iznogoud seize the Caliph title. In another episode, Iznogoud gets a magical calendar that lets him travel in time when he rips off its pages. He rips too many and he is transported to the 20th century, inside the studio of Tabary. In another episode, Iznogoud gets a magical drawing paper set that makes anybody or anything drawn on it disappear once the paper is torn apart. Unfortunately, the drawing needs to be realistic, and Iznogoud is a poor artist. In search of an art teacher, he meets Tabary, renamed "Tabary El-Retard".

There are occasionally "behind-the-scenes" moments, as when Iznogoud travels in a country in a mirror, and all is reversed, including text in balloons. Tabary is shown complaining to Goscinny about going through this frustrating "reversal" work, and even threatens him with a gun, to convince him into making a non-reversed "translated" version. They also appear debating after a contemporary crowd demands that they make Iznogoud caliph.

Other recurring characters include '''Sultan Pullmankar''' (''Sultan Streetcar'' in English), the Caliph's neighbour who is described as a touchy man with a powerful army. Iznogoud often tries to provoke Pullmankar to become angry at the Caliph, in order to instigate a war. However, Pullmankar never gets angry with the caliph, only with Iznogoud.

The crew of [[Redbeard (comics)|Redbeard]], another comics series published in Pilote, appears in ''A Carrot for Iznogoud'', as it did in many stories of René Goscinny's most famous creation [[Asterix]].

==References in society==
Notably, the character has also made his mark on French popular culture and public life. Wanting to become "Caliph in the Caliph's place" has become a popular expression in French, describing people perceived as over-ambitious. The ''Prix Iznogoud'' (Iznogoud Award) was created in 1992 and is given each year to "a personality who failed to take the Caliph's place", chosen among prominent French figures who have recently known spectacular failures. The award has been given to various personalities, amongst them [[Édouard Balladur]] (1995), [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (1999) and [[Jean-Marie Messier]] (2002). The jury is headed by politician [[André Santini]], who gave the award to himself after failing to become president of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] in the [[French regional elections, 2004|2004 regional elections]].

Published by [[Jane's Information Group]], a subsidiary of [[IHS Inc.]], it purports to be "the most comprehensive military communications information resource available."&lt;ref name=JMC&gt;[[IHS Inc.|IHS]] [[Jane's]]  [http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence/systems/military-communications.aspx?pu=1&amp;rd=janes_com Military Communications] Retrieved 2012-01-23&lt;/ref&gt; The former European editor of the [[Journal of Electronic Defense]], John Williamson, was appointed editor in  1984. Previously R.J. Raggett was the editor.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Raggett. ''Defence Security comes in short bursts''. [[The Times]], 7 September 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rodney Cowton, Defence Correspondent of [[the Times]] reviewed ''Jane's Military Communications 1983''. Mr Raggett provided shipboard communications analysis of the [[Falklands Conflict]] from the British  perspective: facilities for shipboard information storage &amp; processing too small;  backlogs of up to 1,000 messages; rooms not large enough to handle increased people traffic of the war environment; Argentines were able to intercept insecure communications. In 1983 these problems were considered "inevitable" considering the volume of up to 250,000 messages. 'Bob' Raggett predicted in the introduction that, by 2000, "electronic systems could render a nuclear attack by an unfriendly power virtually impossible".&lt;ref name=Times1&gt;Rodney Cowton, ''A way to stop nuclear heart attacks''  [[The Times]], 21 June 1983&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983 the publication cost £55.00 (''2011: £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|55|1983|2011|r=-1}}}}'');&lt;ref name=Times1/&gt; the 2011-2012 Yearbook, containing 2,500 images and 2,600 entries, was priced at £540.00 with online access costing £1,850.00.&lt;ref name=JMC/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16609">[[Len Deighton]] (born 18 February 1929) is an English author known for his novels, works of [[military history]], screenplays and cookery writing. He had a varied career, including as a pastry cook, waiter, co-editor of a magazine, teacher and air steward before writing his first novel in 1962: ''[[The IPCRESS File]]''.&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt;{{sfn|Jackson|Gwilliam|1999|p=4}} He continued to produce what his biographer John Reilly considers "stylish, witty, well-crafted novels" in spy fiction,{{sfn|Reilly|1980|p=449}} including three trilogies and a prequel featuring [[Bernard Samson]].{{sfn|Jackson|Gwilliam|1999|pp=6–8}}{{efn|The ten books are:&lt;br /&gt;
* ''[[Berlin Game]]'' (1983)
* ''[[Mexico Set]]'' (1984)
* ''[[London Match]]'' (1985)
* ''[[Spy Hook]]'' (1988)
* ''[[Spy Line]]'' (1989)
* ''[[Spy Sinker]]'' (1990)
* ''[[Faith (novel)|Faith]]'' (1994)
* ''[[Hope (novel)|Hope]]'' (1995)
* ''[[Charity (novel)|Charity]]'' (1996)

The prequel, published in 1987, is ''[[Winter (Deighton novel)|Winter]]''.{{sfn|Jackson|Gwilliam|1999|pp=6–8}}}}

Deighton authored two television scripts, the first of which was ''Long Past Glory'' in 1963; he also wrote a film script, ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' (1969). His long-held interest in cooking—his mother had been a professional chef and instilled a love for cuisine in her son—led to an illustrated cookery column in the Sunday newspaper, ''[[The Observer]]'', for two years. The work was collected into two later books, ''[[Len Deighton's Action Cookbook]]'' and ''Où est le garlic'' (both 1965); he subsequently wrote several other cookery books.{{sfn|Jackson|Gwilliam|1999|pp=6, 11, 14}} Deighton has produced several other works of non-fiction, including a study of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], a history of the airship, Second World War military history and a short [[e-book]] about [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]].{{sfn|Jackson|Gwilliam|1999|pp=10–12}}{{sfn|Burton|2016|p=121}}

[[File:Pretzels SOPA Blackout Mockup v4.png|thumb|250px|Wikipedia's January 18, 2012 blackout page (as proposed by Wikipedia user Pretzels on 16 January)]]

The [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA) and [[PROTECT IP Act]] (PIPA) have found broad support from organizations that rely on copyright, including the Motion Picture Association of America,&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/14/white-house-sopa-pipa_n_1206347.html |title=White House Will Not Support SOPA, PIPA |publisher=[http://www.huffingtonpost.com The Huffington Post] |date=January 17, 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |author=Smith, Catharine}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Recording Industry Association of America,&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt; Macmillan Publishers, Viacom, and various other companies and unions in the cable, movie, and music industries.

On December 22, 2011, [[Lamar S. Smith|Lamar Smith]], the bill's sponsor, released a list of 142 organizations that support SOPA on the [[House Judiciary Committee]]'s website.&lt;ref name="Supporters"&gt;Smith, Lamar ''United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee'' List of Supporters H.R. 3661, the "Stop Online Piracy Act" [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Iqvu-xQP77EJ:judiciary.house.gov/issues/Rogue%2520Websites/List%2520of%2520SOPA%2520Supporters.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg0oCVA4hmp-4nqUR1Uddu-VOeYCMHj1NxjckCTPIQ7vtbDdiQn1is8ThqEsYn1lOOmtsK9N2aHSeI7ZMVwqmGuRBvb0zYcvVkzFx24r02uZkb1vrX2v2_0QNL0iA-QmoJeP_bO&amp;sig=AHIEtbSdnMcencdkTTXQMM-L7PxwqHaf3Q&amp;pli=1 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Other lists have been released by the organizations themselves.

Following the list's original release, it was updated multiple times. As of the morning of December 29, 2011, the official list had 18 fewer supporters, including only 124 of the original 142 supporters. The growing publicity of this list on websites such as [[Reddit]] resulted in what might be referred to as a public relations disaster for some of the supporters listed. Arguably the first and most prominent case regarded [[Go Daddy|GoDaddy.com]], a popular internet domain registrar and web hosting company which openly supported SOPA. GoDaddy sustained significant losses, losing over 72,000 domains in less than one week, as a result of a proposed boycott of their services, pending it renounce its support of SOPA. GoDaddy has since announced that it "no longer supports SOPA legislation," then amended that statement to "GoDaddy OPPOSES SOPA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |title=GoDaddy bows to boycott, now 'opposes' SOPA copyright bill |publisher=CBS Interactive, Inc. |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57349913-281/godaddy-bows-to-boycott-now-opposes-sopa-copyright-bill/ |website=News.cnet.com |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of works by [[Bede]].

==Bede's list of his works==
At the end of Bede's most famous work, the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', Bede lists his works.  His list includes several books that have not survived to the present day; it also omits a few works of his which he either omitted or which he wrote after he finished the ''Historia''.  His list follows, with an English translation given; the title used to describe the work in this article is also given, for easier reference.&lt;ref name=Giles_314-317&gt;The translation is taken from Giles' edition of Bede, with some slight modernization in regard to capitalization.  Giles, ''Complete Works'', pp.&amp;nbsp;314&amp;ndash;317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LK_154&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-List'', p.&amp;nbsp;154.&lt;/ref&gt;

''De templo Salomonis''

Composed not long before 731.&lt;ref name=LK_75&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt;  This work discusses the passage in 1 Kings 3:1 to 7:51 in which Solomon builds a temple.  Bede was here extending a long tradition of commentary on the temple in patristic literature.&lt;ref name=C_OTT_xvii-xviii&gt;Connolly, ''On the Temple'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xvii&amp;ndash;xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Commentary on Tobit''

Laistner suggests that this may have been written at about the same time as ''De templo Salmonis'', since in both Bede stresses allegorical interpretation; however, he comments that there is no textual evidence to support this.&lt;ref name=LK_78&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no other indication of the date of composition.  As with the commentary on Habakkuk, Bede draws on the work of [[Jerome]] and on [[St Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''City of God''.&lt;ref name=C_TH_18-21/&gt;

===Homilies===
''Homilies''

Bede's list of his works refers to two books of homilies, and these are preserved.  In addition, innumerable homilies exist that have been attributed to him; in most cases the attribution is spurious but there may be additional homilies of Bede beyond those in the main two books that survive.&lt;ref name=LK_114-116&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', pp.&amp;nbsp;114&amp;ndash;116.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear whether the homilies were ever actually preached, or were instead intended for devotional reading.  They are organized around particular dates in the church calendar, with forty of them dealing with either Christmas or Easter.  The remaining ten are concerned with the feast days of saints.  The homilies are thought to be among Bede's later works, dating perhaps to the late 720s.  Thirty-four of them were included in a widely disseminated anthology of readings put together in [[Charlemagne]]'s reign by [[Paul the Deacon]].  It is possible that Bede composed these homilies to complement the work of [[Gregory the Great]], who had assembled his own collection of homilies: the two sets of homilies only have one reading in common, and that reading is one which Gregory had indicated needed further attention.&lt;ref name=HG_v_xxii&gt;Martin &amp; Hurst, ''Homilies on the Gospels'', pp.&amp;nbsp;vi&amp;ndash;xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letters===
Bede lists five letters in the list he gives of his works in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', as follows: "Item librum epistolarum ad diversos: quarum de sex aetatibus saeculi una est; de mansionibus filiorum Israhel una; una de eo quod ait Isaias; 'et claudentur ibi in carcerem et post dies multos visitabantur'; de ratione bisexti una; de aequnioctio iuxta Anatolium una".  Two additional letters are known: the letter to Albinus he wrote to accompany a copy of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', and the ''Epistle to Egbert''.&lt;ref name=LK_119&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; The first five letters below are the ones Bede mentioned; they are given in the same order that Bede describes them.

''Letter to Plegwin''

One of Bede's works on chronology, ''De temporibus'', led to him being accused of heresy in front of [[Wilfrid|Wilfred]], the bishop of York; Bede was not present but heard of the charge from a monk named Plegwin.  This letter is Bede's response to Plegwin; he justifies his work and asks Plegwin to deliver the letter to a monk named David so that it could be read to Wilfred.  The letter was first published in Dublin in 1664 by Sir James Ware.&lt;ref name=Giles_I_clxxiv&gt;Giles, ''Works'', I, p.&amp;nbsp;clxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  Five manuscripts survive.&lt;ref&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', p.&amp;nbsp;120.  The ms that Laistner lists as "untraced" is Phillipps 9428, which is now HM 27486 in the Huntington Library: see {{cite web| url = http://sunsite3.berkeley.edu/hehweb/HM27486.html | title = Guide To Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts in the Huntington Library  | accessdate=25 April 2009 |publisher=Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Letter to Acca: "de eo quod ait Isaias"''

This letter was first published in 1843 by [[J. A. Giles]], in his edition of the complete works of Bede.  Giles used the only known manuscript, Paris B.N. 2840.&lt;ref name=LK_119/&gt;&lt;ref name=Giles_I_clxxvi&gt;Giles, ''Works'', I, clxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

''Letter to Acca: "de mansionibus filiorum Israhel"''

As with the previous letter to Acca, the first publication was in J.A. Giles' 1843 edition of Bede's works.  There are two manuscripts of this letter; it appears in Paris B.N. 2840, and also in a manuscript now in Zurich.&lt;ref name=LK_119/&gt;&lt;ref name=Giles_I_clxxvi/&gt;

''Letter to Helmwald''

Bede's letter to Helwmald was published in 1980 in the [[Corpus Christianorum|CCSL]] series, edited by C.W. Jones.  An English translation by Faith Wallis appeared in 1999.&lt;ref name=PASE_sources/&gt;

''Letter to Wicthede''

Bede's letter to Wicthede was first printed in Hervagius's 1563 folio editions of Bede's works, but the manuscript Hervagius used included a reference to the year 776.  It was argued on this basis that the letter was not by Bede, but subsequently a comparison with other manuscripts determined that the passage was a spurious interpolation, and the letter is now accepted as genuine.&lt;ref name=Giles_I_clxxv&gt;Giles, ''Works'', I, p.&amp;nbsp;clxxv.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many manuscripts are now known; Laistner lists over thirty.&lt;ref name=LK_121&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Letter to Albinus''

Bede wrote this short letter to Albinus, the abbot of the monastery of St Peter and St Paul in Canterbury, to thank him for providing documents to Bede to assist him in writing the ''Ecclesiastical History''.  With the letter Bede sent a copy of his ''De templo Salomonis'', and also a copy of the ''History''; the date of the letter is therefore after 731, when the ''History'' was completed.  The letter was sent to Albinus in the hands of Nothhelm, a London priest who subsequently became Archbishop of Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Giles_I_clxxii-clxxiii&gt;Giles, ''Works'', I, pp.&amp;nbsp;clxxii&amp;ndash;clxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE_Nothhelm&gt;Keynes, "Nothhelm", pp.&amp;nbsp;335&amp;nbsp;336.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was first published by [[Jean Mabillon]] in his ''Vetera Analecta'', which began publication in 1675.&lt;ref name=Giles_I_clxxii-clxxiii/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09479b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Jean Mabillon |accessdate=2009-04-23 |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|location=New York|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mabillon used a manuscript from the monastery of St Vincent in [[Metz]] which has since been lost.&lt;ref name=LK_119/&gt; The text survives in two twelfth-century manuscripts from Austria: London, British Library, Add. 18329 (from [[St. Georgenberg-Fiecht Abbey|St. Georgenberg-Fiecht]]), and [[Göttweig Abbey|Göttweig]], Stiftsbibliothek, 37 (rot).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westgard|first=Joshua A.|date=2010|title=New Manuscripts of Bede's Letter to Albinus|journal=Revue Bénédictine|volume=120|issue=2|pages=208–215|doi=10.1484/J.RB.5.100545|ref=Westgard2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Letter to Egbert''

This letter is not included in Bede's list of his own writings.&lt;ref name=LK_119/&gt;  Bede completed the letter on 5 November 734, not long before his death on 26 May 735; in it he explains that he is unable to visit Egbert, as he had the previous year, and so is writing to him instead.
&lt;ref name=Farmer_335-7&gt;Farmer, ''Bede'', pp.&amp;nbsp;335&amp;ndash;337.&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter contains Bede's complaints about what he saw as the errors of the ecclesiastics of his day, including monasteries that were religious in name only, ignorant and careless clergy, and a lack of monastic discipline.&lt;ref name=Plummer_xxxiv-xxxv&gt;Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xxxiv&amp;ndash;xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt;  Egbert was Bishop of York at the time Bede wrote to him; he was raised to the archbishopric later that year, and Bede was probably aware of his impending elevation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The letter was first published in Dublin in 1664 by Sir James Ware, using Harley 4688, a manuscript now in the British Museum.&lt;ref name=Plummer_I_cxlii&gt;Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', I, p.&amp;nbsp;cxlii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymns and poems===
In Bede's list of his works, he describes a book of hymns: "Librum hymnorum diverso metro sive rhythmo" and a book of poems: "Librum epigrammatum heroico metro sive elegiaco".  Although manuscripts by these names survived to the 15th century, none are extant today.  However, some of Bede's verse was transmitted through other manuscripts.&lt;ref name=LK_122-123&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122&amp;ndash;123.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Bede included poems in several of his prose works, and these have occasionally been copied separately and thus transmitted independently of their parent work.

''Hymns''

Only one hymn is definitely by Bede; his ''Hymn on Queen Etheldryd'', which is part of his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' but which appears independently in some manuscripts.  An additional fifteen hymns are thought to be of Bede's composition.  Thirteen of these now survive only in a 16th-century printed edition; two further hymns, on psalms XLI and CXXII, have survived in manuscript form.&lt;ref name=LK_122-123/&gt;

''De die iudicii''

The poem ''De die iudicii'' is assigned to Bede by most scholars.&lt;ref name=LK_124-127&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', pp.&amp;nbsp;124&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liber epigrammatum''

Bede refers to a book of epigrams; the work is not entirely lost but has survived only in fragments.&lt;ref&gt;See PASE, under sources Bede.Epig and Milred.Sylloge.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 16th century, the [[antiquary]] [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] transcribed a selection of epigrams from a now-lost manuscript; his selection includes several epigrams attributed to Bede which are likely to have come from the book Bede refers to.  Leland's source was originally owned by [[Milred]], bishop of [[Worcester]] from 745 to 775.  Historian Michael Lapidge suggests that Milred's collection of epigrams was assembled early in Milred's tenure as bishop, perhaps in about 750.&lt;ref name=LALL&gt;Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature, 600&amp;ndash;899'', pp.&amp;nbsp;357&amp;ndash;358.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bede's Death Song''

Cuthbert's letter on Bede's death, the ''Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae'',  is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as [[Bede#Vernacular poetry|Bede's Death Song]]

''Other poems''

The only other surviving poem of Bede's that is not part of one of Bede's prose works is a prayer in thirteen elegiac couplets which survives in a tenth-century manuscript in garbled form; it was first printed correctly in 1912.&lt;ref name=LK_129-130&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', pp.&amp;nbsp;129&amp;ndash;130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===School treatises===
Bede describes two of his school treatises in his list of works as "Item librum de metrica arte et huic adiectum alium de schematibus sive tropis libellum, hoc est de figuris modisque locutionum, quibus scriptura sancta contexta est".&lt;ref name=LK_131-132&gt;Laistner &amp; King, ''Hand-list'', p.&amp;nbsp;131&amp;ndash;132.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first is "a book on the art of poetry", and the second is a "little book of tropes and figures; that is, of the figures and manners of speaking in which the Holy Scriptures are written".&lt;ref name=Giles_317&gt;Giles, ''Complete Works'', p.&amp;nbsp;317.&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of extant manuscripts of these treatises contain both of them.&lt;ref name=LK_131-132/&gt;

[[File:Mappa Mundi from Bede, De natura rerum.jpg|thumbnail|right|Mappa Mundi (world map) from ''De natura rerum'', in a manuscript now held by the [[Bodleian Library]]]]
''De natura rerum''

Bede completed ''De natura rerum'' shortly after ''De temporibus'', which was written in 703.&lt;ref name=Wallis_lxiv&gt;Wallis, ''Reckoning of Time'', p.&amp;nbsp;lxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is modelled on the ''De natura rerum'' of [[Isidore of Seville]].&lt;ref name=Wallis_lxv/&gt;

''De temporibus''

This work was completed in 703.  It contains a short chronicle which was sometimes copied separately, known as the ''Chronica minora''.  There are also manuscripts of ''De temporibus'' which omit the chronicle.&lt;ref name=LK_144-145&gt;Laistner &amp; King, "Hand-List", pp.&amp;nbsp;144&amp;ndash;145.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a treatise covering the basics of the ''[[computus]]'', the medieval study of calculating the correct dates for the Christian calendar.&lt;ref name=Wallis_lxv&gt;Wallis, ''Reckoning of Time'', p.&amp;nbsp;lxv.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede used much material from Isidore of Seville's ''Etymologies'' for this work.&lt;ref name=Wallis_lxxx&gt;Wallis, ''Reckoning of Time'', p.&amp;nbsp;lxxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

''De temporum ratione''

This work was completed in 725.  It contains a chronicle which was often copied separately, known as the ''Chronica maiora''.  There are also manuscripts of ''De temporum ratione'' which omit the chronicle.&lt;ref name=LK_144-145/&gt;  The work was known to medieval readers as ''De temporibus'', but since that was also the title of an earlier work by Bede it was also referred to as ''De temporibus liiber secundus''.&lt;ref name=Wallis_xvi&gt;Wallis, ''Reckoning of Time'', p.&amp;nbsp;xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like ''De temporibus'' it deals with ''[[computus]]'', but at much greater length.  Bede's treatment of the topic was widely and rapidly disseminated during the Middle Ages; over one hundred manuscripts have survived to the present day, almost half of which were copied within a century of the work's composition.&lt;ref name=Wallis_lxxxvii&gt;Wallis, ''Reckoning of Time'', p.&amp;nbsp;lxxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be because Charlemagne instituted educational reforms that included making ''computus'' part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=Wallis_lxxxviii-lxxxix&gt;Wallis, ''Reckoning of Time'', pp.&amp;nbsp;lxxxviii&amp;ndash;lxxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doubtful works===
''De octo quaestionibus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knibbs |first=E. |date=2008 |title=The Manuscript Evidence for the ''De octo quaestionibus'' ascribed to Bede |journal=Traditio |volume=63 |pages=129–84 |jstor=27832080}}; {{cite journal |last=Gorman |first=M. |date=1999 |title=Bede's ''VIII Quaestiones'' and Carolingian Biblical Scholarship |journal=Revue Bénédictine |volume=109 |issue=1–2 |pages=32–74 |doi=10.1484/J.RB.5.105438}}; trans. A. G. Holder in W. T. Foley and A. G. Holder, ''Bede: A Biblical Miscellany'', Translated Texts for Historians (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1999) 149–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eric Knibbs, the treatise entitled the ''De octo quaestionibus'' is a 12th-century creation that cannot be ascribed to Bede, though the eight individual texts gathered under this title are much older. A subset of four (called, in some manuscripts, the ''Solutiones'') are almost certainly Bede's; the authorship of the other four is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knibbs |first=E. |date=2008 |title=The Manuscript Evidence for the ''De octo quaestionibus'' ascribed to Bede |journal=Traditio |volume=63 |pages=129–184 |jstor=27832080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrologia Latina]] vol. 94 includes a number of ''homiliae subdititiae'' "spurious homilies" attributed to Bede.

{{main article|Paenitentiale Bedae}}
The so-called ''[[Paenitentiale Bedae]]'', a disciplinary work composed between ca 700 and 800, may have been authored by Bede. The idea that Bede wrote a penitential has been accepted as uncontroversial by both medieval and modern scholars, including Hermann Wasserschleben, Bruno Albers and J.T. McNeill.&lt;ref&gt;J.T. McNeill and H.M. Gamer, ''Medieval handbooks of penance: a translation of the principal libri poenitentiales and selections from related documents'' (New York, 1938), 217-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, including Charles Plummer and M.L.W. Laistner, have challenged the attribution of this work to Bede on the grounds that Bede (they say) was too high-minded and too talented a Latinist to have composed a work of such stylistic simplicity treating such vulgar subjects as drinking, physical violence and sexual deviance.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Frantzen, ''The literature of penance in Anglo-Saxon England'' (New Brunswick, N.J., 1983), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A.J. Frantzen has adopted an agnostic attitude, acknowledging several arguments for and against Bedan authorship that taken together seem to leave the matter presently unanswerable.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Frantzen, ''The literature of penance in Anglo-Saxon England'' (New Brunswick, N.J., 1983), 69–77&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent and detailed study of the text was carried out by Reinhold Haggenmüller, who pronounced definitively against Bedan authorship; however, Haggenmüller's argument against Bedan authorship is hardly persuasive (it amounts merely to noticing that the oldest manuscript dates to about 60 years after Bede's death).&lt;ref&gt;R. Haggenmüller, ''Die Überlieferung der Beda und Egbert zugeschriebenen Bussbücher'', Europäische Hochschulschriften, Reihe 3: Geschichte und ihre Hilfswissenschaften 461 (Frankfurt am Main, 1991), 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact no scholar has yet been able to adduce concrete evidence that either confirms or denies Bedan authorship of the ''[[Paenitentiale Bedae]]''. McNeill and Gamer's summary of the problem is still perhaps the most fair and concise:&lt;ref&gt;J.T. McNeill and H.M. Gamer, ''Medieval handbooks of penance: a translation of the principal libri poenitentiales and selections from related documents'' (New York, 1938), 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fact that no penitential is included by Bede among the works he lists at the end of his ''Ecclesiastical History'' ... as of the years 702–31 can hardly be admitted as a conclusive argument against his having written one, in view of the omission from this list of a number of his other known works. The strongest objection to his authorship of this book is the lack of distinction and originality in the work itself. But the author may have intended a revision, which he did not live to make. Probably too, we should not expect to find the marks of genius in a penitential. The nature of these handbooks excludes sublimity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first attempt to print a complete set of Bede's works was made in 1563 by Johannes Hervagius (Johann Herwagen the younger, died 1564), a printer of [[Basle]], completing a project begun by his father (died 1557).&lt;ref&gt;M. Gorman, 'The glosses on Bede's "De temporum ratione" attributed to Byrhtferth of Ramsey', in M. Lapidge, M. Godden &amp; S. Keynes (eds), ''Anglo-Saxon England'' 25 (Cambridge University Press 1997), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F2RzU8BMLRUC&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 209 ff].&lt;/ref&gt; This, which is taken as the ''[[Editio princeps]]'', followed upon the first extended edition of Bede's Commentaries, edited by Franciscus Jametius, printed at Paris in three volumes in 1544, other works being available in separate editions.&lt;ref&gt;''Venerabilis Bedae Presbyteri Theologi Doctissimi...Commentationum in Sacras Literas'', 3 Vols (Apud Ioannem Roigny, Parisiis 1544), [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb11298325_00007.html 1]; [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb11298326_00007.html 2]; [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb11205496_00001.html 3] (Münchener DigitalisierungsZentrum, Digitale Bibliothek).&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal privilege of the first edition was granted by King [[Henry II of France]] to Bernard Brand, partner of Hervagius, in 1558, and re-granted to Hervagius the younger by [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] in 1561. (The latter was during the regency of [[Catherine de' Medici]] in the months preceding the [[Colloquy of Poissy]].) In his Preface ''Ad Lectorem'' Hervagius credits [[Jacobus Pamelius]] with the assembly of texts and a significant role in their editing.&lt;ref&gt;"Ut vero in Bedae libris conquirendis, sic etiam in non paucis locis emendandis et restituendis, praeter alios, non levem operam posuit Iacobus Pamelius, vir eruditus, atque in huiusmodi rebus oculatus, et diligens; cui etiam non parvum debent lectores." ''Opera'' I, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4x9-9XfrPOMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ad Lectorem" (front matter)]. (Google)&lt;/ref&gt; The entire edition was dedicated to Marquard, [[Schmitten, Germany#History|Freiherr von Hattstein]], [[Bishopric of Speyer|Prince-Bishop of Speyer]] (1560-1581) and provost of the [[Weissenburg Abbey, Alsace|collegiate church of Weissenburg, Alsace]]. The ''Epistola Nuncupatoria'' remarks that Hervagius had met the cost of the edition more for religious reasons than from expectations of financial return: the pure and uncorrupt doctrines of Bede offered the most useful and weighty answers to the explanation of controversies flourishing in their own times.&lt;ref&gt;"...quibus hoc nostro seculo, in tanta diversitate opinionum, nihil exhiberi potest... magis utile, aut ponderatius, ad explicationem controversiarum, quae nunc inter doctos vigent." ''Opera'' I, "Epistola Nuncupatoria".&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hervagius's edition, in eight folio volumes, was incomplete in some respects and included works that were later determined to be spuriously assigned to Bede. For example, the folio edition (following Jametius) includes commentary on St Paul that is not by Bede (attributed by [[Jean Mabillon|Mabillon]] to [[Florus of Lyon]]), and omits the commentary that Bede wrote.&lt;ref name=Giles_I_cxvi&gt;Giles, ''Works'', I, p.&amp;nbsp;cxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Giles_I_cxxxii&gt;Giles, ''Works'', I, p.&amp;nbsp;cxxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; A full contents listing appears in the prefatory material to Volume 1. A newly re-set edition was printed at [[Cologne]] in 1612, also in eight volumes, following the same order of texts. A further revised edition was printed at Cologne in 1688. [[Casimir Oudin]]'s commentary on the authenticity of the textual attributions to Bede in these editions was published in 1722,&lt;ref&gt;'Dissertatio de Scriptis Venerabilis Bedae Presbyteri, et Monachi', in ''Casimiri Oudini Commentarius De Scriptoribus Ecclesiae Antiquis'', 3 vols (Maur. Georg. Weidmanni, Francofurti ad Moenum 1722), I, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N4FFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1681#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false columns 1681-1712].&lt;/ref&gt; and was reproduced by Migne.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Latina'' Vol. 90, Columns 71-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:McCollum memo Page1.png|thumb|right|200px|'''McCollum memo''', page 1]]
'''The McCollum memo''', also known as the ''Eight Action Memo'' was a [[memorandum]], dated October 7, 1940 (more than a year before the [[Pearl Harbor attack]]), sent by Lieutenant Commander [[Arthur H. McCollum]], who "provided the president with intelligence reports on [Japan]... [and oversaw] every intercepted and decoded Japanese military and diplomatic report destined for the White House"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stinnett |first1=Robert |title=Day of Deceit |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2011}}&lt;!--Stinnett misrepresents, misstates, &amp; makes unsubstantiated claims--&gt; in his capacity as director of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]'s Far East Asia section.  It was sent to Navy Captains [[Dudley Knox]], who agreed with the actions described within the memo, and [[Walter Stratton Anderson]].

The memo outlined the general situation of several nations in [[World War II]] and recommended an eight-part course of action for the [[United States]] to take in regard to the [[Japanese Empire]] in the South Pacific, suggesting the United States provoke Japan into committing an "[[overt act]] of war".&lt;ref name="Deceit p.9"&gt;''Day of Deceit'', Robert B. Stinnett, New York 2000 p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The memo illustrates several people in the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] promoted the idea of goading Japan into war:&lt;ref&gt;''Day of Deceit'', Robert B. Stinnett, New York 2000 p.14&lt;/ref&gt; "It is not believed that in the present state of political opinion the United States government is capable of declaring war against Japan without more ado [...] If by [the elucidated eight-point plan] Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better."

The McCollum memo was first widely disseminated with the publication of [[Robert Stinnett]]'s book ''[[Day of Deceit|Day of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor]].'' Stinnett writes that McCollum's memo was a plan to "mobilize a reluctant America into joining Britain's struggle against the German armed forces then overrunning Europe. Its eight actions called for virtually inciting a Japanese attack on American ground, air, and naval forces in Hawaii, as well as on British and Dutch colonial outposts in the Pacific region."&lt;ref&gt;Stinnett, Robert. "Day of Deceit." Page 38 iTunes edition&lt;/ref&gt;  Stinnett presents the memo as part of his argument the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt Administration]] conspired to secretly provoke the Japanese to attack the United States in order to bring the United States into the European war without generating public contempt over broken political promises. Stinnett omits to mention McCollum never had contact with Roosevelt.&lt;ref&gt;Young,, Richard E., Admiral. "A Deceitful Book", review of ''Day of Deceit''. [http://www.artbarninc.org/REY/Stinnett.pdf] (retrieved 4 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2012}} Stinnett attributes to McCollum a position McCollum expressly repudiated.&lt;ref&gt;Young; McCollum, Arthur H., Rear Admiral. "The Calamitous 7th", ''The Saturday Review of Literature'', 29 May 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pearl Harbor Investigations'', Part 8, pp.2447-3443.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Eight-Action plan ==

The McCollum memo contained an eight-part plan to counter rising Japanese power over East Asia:

:A. Make an arrangement with Britain for the use of British bases in the Pacific, particularly Singapore
:B. Make an arrangement with the Netherlands for the use of base facilities and acquisition of supplies in the Dutch East Indies
:C. Give all possible aid to the Chinese government of Chiang-Kai-Shek
:D. Send a division of long range heavy cruisers to the Orient, Philippines, or Singapore
:E. Send two divisions of submarines to the Orient
:F. Keep the main strength of the U.S. fleet now in the Pacific[,] in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands
:G. Insist that the Dutch refuse to grant Japanese demands for undue economic concessions, particularly oil
:H. Completely embargo all U.S. trade with Japan, in collaboration with a similar embargo imposed by the British Empire

== Reception of the Eight Actions ==

The memo was read and appended by Captain Knox, who, despite being seemingly reluctant to "precipitate anything in the Orient", ultimately concurs. Specifically, he wrote (page 6):

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is unquestionably to our interest that Britain be not licked – just now she has a stalemate and probably can't do better. We ought to make certain that she at least gets a stalemate. For this she will probably need from us substantial further destroyers and air-reinforcements to England.  We should not precipitate anything in the Orient that would hamper our ability to do this – so long as probability continues. If England remains stable, Japan will be cautious in the Orient. Hence our assistance to England in the Atlantic is also protection to her and us in the Orient. However, I concur in your courses of action. We must be ready on both sides and probably strong enough to care for both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stinnett writes that while "no specific record has been found by the author indicating whether [Anderson] or Roosevelt actually ever saw it [...] a series of secret presidential routing logs plus collateral intelligence information in the Navy files offer conclusive evidence that they did see it".&lt;ref name=Stinnett9&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stinnett |first1=Robert |title=Day of Deceit |page=9 |chapter=Chapter 2: ''FDR's Back Door to War''}}&lt;/ref&gt; His evidence of "secret presidential routing logs" is not provided.&lt;ref&gt;Young.&lt;/ref&gt; Stinnett goes on to write, "throughout 1941, it seems, provoking Japan into an overt act of war was the principal policy that guided FDR's actions against Japan" and "Roosevelt's cabinet members, most notably Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]], are on record favoring the policy, according to Stimson's diary".&lt;ref name=Stinnett9/&gt; Further evidence that suggests Roosevelt had seen the memos was his support of "pop-up" cruises,&lt;ref name="Deceit p.9"/&gt; an elaboration upon Actions D and E of the eight recommended actions detailed in the memo: "I just want them to keep popping up here and there and keep the Japs guessing.  I don't mind losing one or two cruisers, but do not take a chance on losing five or six."&lt;ref name=Stinnett9/&gt;

Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], on the other hand, opposed the "pop-up" cruises, saying they were "most ill-advised and will result in war if we make this move",&lt;ref name=Stinnett9/&gt; but "the decision [on the 'pop-up' cruise matter] may go against me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stinnett |first1=Robert |title=Day of Deceit |page=323, footnote 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, at the time, Kimmel was not aware of Washington's eight-action policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Day of Deceit'', Robert B. Stinnett, New York 2000 p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral [[James O. Richardson]] also opposed the plan and "quoted the President as saying: 'Sooner or later the Japanese would commit an overt act against the United States and the nation would be willing to enter the war'."&lt;ref name="Day of Deceit"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stinnett |first1=Robert |title=Day of Deceit |page=11 |chapter=Chapter 2: FDR's Back Door to War}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--How this has anything to do with McCollum's memo, or even remotely evidence of either his or FDR's intent, remains unclear.--&gt;

Also, [[Admiral Nimitz]] turned down the command of the Pacific Fleet &lt;ref name="Day of Deceit"/&gt; so that he would not become the scapegoat{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} if the Japanese attacked the United States by surprise. In a History Channel interview, Admiral Chester Nimitz Jr. described his father's political maneuver: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;He said, 'It is my guess that the Japanese are going to attack us in a surprise attack.  There will be a revulsion in the country against all those in command at sea, and they will be replaced by people in positions of prominence ashore, and I want to be ashore, and not at sea, when that happens.'&lt;ref&gt;Interview for the History Channel Program ''Admiral Chester Nimitz, Thunder of the Pacific''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--How this has anything to do with McCollum's memo, or even remotely evidence of either his or FDR's intent, remains unclear.--&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The characterization of the McCollum memorandum as a recipe for war was not accepted by U. S. Army military historian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/people.cfm?authorID=25 | title=Dr. Conrad C. Crane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad Crane, who wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A close reading shows that its recommendations were supposed to deter and contain Japan, while better preparing the United States for a future conflict in the Pacific. There is an offhand remark that an overt Japanese act of war would make it easier to garner public support for actions against Japan, but the document's intent was not to ensure that event happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/Articles/01spring/spr-rev.htm|first=Conrad|last=Crane|journal=Parameters|publisher=[[US Army War College]]|title=Book Reviews: Day of Deceit|date=Spring 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program''' ('''NDIIPP''') of the United States is an archival program led by the [[Library of Congress]] to archive and provide access to digital resources. The [[U.S. Congress]] established the program in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/documents/ndiipp08/NDIIPPtoNOW_post.ppt |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |quote=2000 - NDIIP legislation is passed |title=A Brief History of NDIIPP |publisher=The Library of Congress - Digital Preservation |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227152433/http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/documents/ndiipp08/NDIIPPtoNOW_post.ppt |archivedate=December 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library was chosen because of its role as one of the leading providers of high-quality content on the Internet.  The Library of Congress has formed a national network of partners dedicated to preserving specific types of digital content that is at risk of loss.

In July 2010, the Library launched a [http://ndsa.org National Digital Stewardship Alliance] (NDSA) to extend the work of NDIIPP to more institutions.  The organization, which has been hosted by the [[Digital Library Federation]] since January 2016, focuses on several goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diglib.org/archives/10394/|title=Digital Library Federation to Host National Digital Stewardship Alliance|date=2015-10-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It develops improved preservation standards and practices; works with experts to identify categories of digital information that are most worthy of preservation; and takes steps to incorporate content into a national collection. It provides national leadership for digital preservation education and training.  NDSA also provides communication and outreach for all aspects of digital preservation. The NDSA membership includes universities, professional associations, commercial businesses, consortia, and government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndsa.org/|title=National Digital Stewardship Alliance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Digital Library Federation|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The [[digital preservation|preservation of digital content]] has become a major challenge for [[library|libraries]] and [[archive]]s whose mission is to preserve the intellectual and cultural heritage of the nation. In 1998 the Library of Congress began to develop a [[digital strategy]] with a group of senior managers who were charged with assessing the roles and responsibilities of the Library in the digital age. This oversight group was headed by the Associate Librarian for Strategic Initiatives, the Associate Librarian for Library Services, and the Register of Copyrights. This group held several planning meetings to assess the current state of digital archiving and preservation.

The Librarian of Congress [[James H. Billington]] commissioned the National Research Council Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] to evaluate the Library's readiness to meet the challenges of the rapidly evolving digital world. They recommended that the Library, working with other federal and non-federal institutions, take the lead in a national, cooperative effort to archive and preserve digital information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309071445 |title=LC 21: A Digital Strategy for the Library of Congress |publisher=Nap.edu |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2012-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625005141/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309071445 |archivedate=2012-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, Congress appropriated up to $100 million&lt;ref name="NDIIPP History"&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress |title=Program Background |url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/about/background.html |work=Webpage |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125051643/http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/about/background.html |archivedate=25 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ($75 million of which was slated for dollar for dollar cost matching) for the effort. Congress rescinded $47 million in unspent funds in 2007.  In 2009, NDIIPP received about $6.5 million as a line item in the Library's annual budget appropriation.

==Congressional legislation==
The U.S. Congress has asked the Library of Congress to lead a collaborative project, called the National Digital [[Information Infrastructure]] and Preservation Program. In December 2000, Congress passed special legislation (Public Law 106-554) in recognition of the importance of preserving digital content for future generations, appropriating $100 million to the Library of Congress to lead this effort. (A government-wide rescission of .22 percent in late December 2000 reduced this special appropriation to $99.8 million.)

This effort falls within the Library's mission, which is "The Library's mission is to support the Congress in fulfilling its constitutional duties and to further the progress of knowledge and creativity for the benefit of the American people."&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress |title=Mission |url=https://www.loc.gov/about/mission.html |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302135621/http://www.loc.gov/about/mission.html |archivedate=2 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This mission extends to materials in electronic formats as well. In addition, the Library is the home of the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] and is thus already engaged in issues relating to copyright in a digital environment.

==Participating organizations==
The National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program is a cooperative effort.

The Library is working closely with partners to assess considerations for shared responsibilities. Federal legislation calls for the Library to work jointly with the Secretary of Commerce, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Archives and Records Administration. The legislation also directs the Library to seek the participation of "other federal, research and private libraries and institutions with expertise in the collection and maintenance of archives of digital materials," including the National Library of Medicine, the National Agricultural Library, the Research Libraries Group, the Online Computer Library Center and the Council on Library and Information Resources.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress |title=Partners - Digital Preservation (Library of Congress) |url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/partners/ |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403113709/http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/partners/ |archivedate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Library is also working with the non-federal sector. The overall strategy is being executed in cooperation with the library, creative, publishing, technology and copyright communities. In early 2001 the Library established a National Digital Strategy Advisory Board to help guide it through the planning process. This board is made up of experts from the technology, publishing, Internet, library and intellectual-property communities as well as government.

The Library has also established a working group to look at ways that current copyright law can address how libraries and archives handle digital materials when preserving them and making them available to users.

==National significance==
The availability of electronic information is today taken for granted. With the rapid growth of the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]], millions of people have grown accustomed to using these tools as resources to acquire information—from a Ph.D. candidate conducting research for a dissertation to a teacher who might not be able to take a class on a field trip to see historical artifacts to a lifelong learner.

Digital has become the principal medium to create, distribute and store content, from text to motion pictures to recorded sound. Digital content now embodies much of the nation's intellectual, social and cultural history. Because digital materials can be so easily altered, corrupted or even lost, these materials must be saved now if they are to remain available to today's and tomorrow's generations.

NDIIPP is providing a national focus on important policy, standards and technical components necessary to preserve digital content. Investments in modeling and testing various options and technical solutions will take place over several years, resulting in recommendations to the U.S. Congress about the most viable and sustainable options for long-term preservation.

==Digital preservation partnership projects==
Included in the 300 partners (as of March 2013) are eight consortial partnerships comprising 33 institutions that are selecting, collecting and preserving specific types of digital content:

==Collections == 

In keeping with the mission of the NDIIPP, they are working with over 1,400 collections globally to preserve institution's at risk digital content. The collection's content ranges from Arts and Culture, Religion and Philosophy, Social Sciences, and World History and Cultures.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress |title=Collections - Digital Preservation (Library of Congress) |url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/collections/ |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403113546/http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/collections/ |archivedate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress provides a full [http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/collections/ list of the collections] as well as a [http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/collections/collections.html interactive map] of the collections' geographical location.

[[Image:Norma Oficial Mexicana logo.png|thumb|Norma Oficial Mexicana logo.]]
The '''Norma Oficial Mexicana''' (Official Mexican Standard), abbreviated '''NOM''', is the name of each of a series of official, compulsory [[Technical standard|standards]] and regulations for diverse activities in Mexico. They are more commonly referred to as ''NOMs'' or ''normas''.

The standards are prepared by the ''Dirección General de Normas (DGN)'' (General Directorate of Standards), which is the body representing Mexico in the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).

==Examples==
===Tequila===
In the case of [[tequila]], Mexico's [[Tequila Regulatory Council]] (CRT) regulates production NOMs. The NOM identifier means the tequila meets government standards - but this is not any guarantee of tequila's quality. However, without the NOM stamp of legitimacy, it is not guaranteed that the bottle contains tequila.

All 100% agave tequilas must have a NOM identifier on the bottle. The important laws since 1990 were NOM-006-SCFI-1993 and the later update NOM-006-SCFI-1994 revised in late 2005 NOM-006-SCFI-2005 and the most recent revision in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5282165&amp;fecha=13/12/2012 NOM-006-SCFI-2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The number after NOM is the distillery number, assigned by the government. NOM does not indicate the location of the distillery, merely the parent company or - in the case where a company leases space in a plant - the physical plant where the tequila was manufactured.

===Environment===
NOM-137-SEMARNAT-2003 - Issued on the ''[[Official Gazette of the Federation (Mexico)|Official Gazette]]'' on April 29, 2003, and related to [[atmospheric pollution]], [[gas desulfurizing plants]] and sour [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]], and [[emission standard|control of emissions]] of [[sulfur compounds]].

'''''Practical English Usage''''' is a standard [[reference book]] aimed at foreign learners of English and their teachers written by [[Michael Swan (writer)|Michael Swan]].

Published by [[Oxford University Press]], it has sold over 2 million copies since the first edition was published in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practical English Usage|url=https://elt.oup.com/catalogue/items/global/grammar_vocabulary/practical_english_usage_4th_edition/|website=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new, and greatly extended second edition was published in 1995. A third edition was released in 2005, and a fourth in 2016.

== Feature ==
It features basic descriptions of [[English grammar]] and usage as well as highlighting various words which are often problematic for non-native speakers. Although the model is basically [[British English]], it explains some of the stylistic differences between British and American usage.

The third edition also takes into account some of the most recent changes within British English, particularly the commonisation of various [[American English]] forms (such as the use of ''like'' as a conjunction - e.g. like I do).

==Influences==
In his Acknowledgements for the first edition, Swan refers to the aid given him by "various standard reference books - in particular, the splendid ''[[A Grammar of Contemporary English]]'', by [[Randolph Quirk|Quirk]], Greenbaum, [[Geoffrey Leech|Leech]] and Svartvik" (Longman 1972), and in the second edition, to "the monumental ''[[A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language]]''" (Longman 1985), by the same authors.

'''Project FUBELT''' (also known as '''Track II''') is the [[codename]] for the secret [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operations that were to prevent [[Salvador Allende]]'s rise to power before his confirmation and to promote a military coup in Chile.&lt;ref name="Smith, Jr."&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith, Jr.|first=W. Thomas|title=Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency|year=2003|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9781438130187|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jc9wBsImOIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=W. Thomas Smith, Jr.|accessdate=January 2, 2015|chapter=FUBELT, Project|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jc9wBsImOIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highlights of Project FUBELT are cited in declassified [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] documents released by the [[National Security Archive]] on September 11, 1998, 25 years after the coup, as well as in papers uncovered by a 1975 [[US Congress|congressional]] inquiry.

CIA [[memorandum|memoranda]] and reports on Project FUBELT include meetings between [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and CIA officials, CIA cables to its [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] station, and summaries of secret action in 1970, detailing decisions and operations to undermine the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|election of Salvador Allende]] in September 1970 and to promote a military coup.

In November 1970, the [[US National Security Council]] issued [[National Security Decision Memorandum|National Security Decision Memorandum 93]], which replaced FUBELT.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=Michael A. |author-link1= |year=2014 |chapter=Fubelt (Operation) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KDYBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of United States Intelligence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KDYBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |edition=2nd |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |publication-date= |page=108 |isbn=9780810878907 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revelations from declassified documents==
Among the revelations in the formerly secret documents were the following:
* Handwritten notes, taken by CIA director [[Richard Helms]], record the orders of President [[Richard Nixon]], to foster a coup in Chile&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch26-01.htm CIA, Notes on Meeting with the President on Chile, September 15, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the first meeting between Helms and high agency officials on the secret operations codenamed "FUBELT", a special task force under the supervision of CIA [[Director of the National Clandestine Service|Deputy Director for Plans]], [[Thomas Karamessines]], is established, headed by veteran agent [[David Atlee Phillips]]. The memorandum notes that the CIA must prepare an action plan for National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger within 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch03-01.htm CIA, Genesis of Project FUBELT, September 16, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Henry Kissinger, Thomas Karamessines and [[Alexander Haig]] (military assistant to Henry Kissinger), in a meeting on October 15, 1970, discuss promoting a coup in Chile, known as "Track II" of covert operations. Kissinger orders the CIA to "continue keeping the pressure on every Allende weak spot in sight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch06-01.htm CIA, Memorandum of Conversation of Meeting with Henry Kissinger, Thomas Karamessines, and Alexander Haig, October 15, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a secret cable, Thomas Karamessines conveyed Kissinger's orders to CIA station chief in Santiago, [[Henry Hecksher]]: "It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch05-01.htm CIA, Operating Guidance Cable on Coup Plotting, October 16, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The CIA ran a series of secret operations intended to push President [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] to support "a military coup which would prevent Allende from taking office on 3 November."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch01-01.htm CIA, Report of CIA Chilean Task Force Activities, 15 September to 3 November 1970, November 18, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Salvador Allende's election, the United States considered trying to get Chile expelled from the [[Organization of American States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch20-01.htm Department of State, Memorandum for Henry Kissinger on Chile, December 4, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Embassy officers and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning office]] called for the cutting off of economic and military assistance to Pinochet's government on human rights grounds, but were overruled by the Ambassador and officials of [[The Pentagon]] and [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch04-01.htm National Security Council, Disarray in Chile Policy, July 1, 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shuowen-子.png|thumb|right|upright|The ''Shuowen Jiezi'' entry for ''zǐ'' 子 "child", showing the [[Small Seal Script|small seal]] form (top right), with the "ancient script" and ''Zhòuwén'' forms on the left{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=73}}]]
The '''''Shizhoupian''''' ({{zh|c=史籀篇|p=Shǐzhòupiān}}) was an early dictionary of [[Chinese character]]s written in the [[Great Seal script]].  The work was traditionally dated to the reign of [[King Xuan of Zhou]] (827–782 BCE), but many modern scholars assign it to the [[State of Qin]] in the [[Warring States period]].  It is now known only through fragments.

The '''''Zhòuwén''''' ({{lang|zh|籀文}}) are 220 or so examples of ancient characters from the ''Shizhoupian'' quoted in the [[Han dynasty]] character dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=72}}
The ''zhòuwén'' characters have been described as generally symmetrical and balanced, and are on average (although not always) more complex than the later seal characters.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=74}} They contain many swirls and circles in place of later squared or rectilinear forms.

According to the postface of the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' and the "Treatise on Literature" chapter of the ''[[Book of Han]]'', the work was written during the reign of the late [[Western Zhou]] king Xuan by Shǐ Zhòu ({{lang|zh|史籀}} "Historian Zhou"), and consisted of 15 chapters ({{lang|zh|篇}} ''piān'').{{sfn|Galambos|2006|pp=154–155}}

[[Wang Guowei]] disputed this account in his commentary on the ''Shizhoupian'', arguing that the structure and style of the characters did not match inscriptions from the period.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=72–77}} Wang also questioned the traditional interpretation of ''zhòu'' ({{lang|zh|籀}}) as the historian's name, pointing out that in ancient times, according to the ''Shuowen'', it had the same meaning as {{lang|zh-Hant|讀}} ''dú'' ("to study and understand the meaning of books; to read"). According to this view, the title of the book was likely taken from the first sentence of the text (as is often done when assigning names to untitled ancient texts like those on bronzes), which presumably contained "the historian studies...".{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=74}}{{sfn|Chén|2003|p=17}}&lt;ref&gt;''Hànyǔ Dà Zìdiǎn'' pp. 1677, 1259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tang Lan identified Shǐ Zhoù (Historian Zhòu) with Shǐ Liú ({{lang|zh|史留}} "Historian Liú"), a name written with a similar character in the ''Book of Han'' chapter on "Notable Persons Past and Present" covering the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and Warring States periods.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=74}} A Historian Liú from the correct period is mentioned on an ancient ''dǐng'' tripodal cauldron in the collection of the [[Shanghai Museum]].{{sfn|Chén|2003|pp=17–19}}

The '''Socialist Reich Party of Germany''' ({{lang-de|Sozialistische Reichspartei Deutschlands}}) was a [[West Germany|West German]] [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] political party founded in the aftermath of [[World War II]] in 1949 as an openly [[Neo-fascism|Neo-fascist]] oriented split-off from the national conservative [[Deutsche Rechtspartei|German Right Party]] (DKP-DRP). The SRP was the first party to be banned by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1952.

== Origins ==
It was established on 2 October 1949 in [[Hameln]] by [[Otto Ernst Remer]], a former [[Wehrmacht]] major general who had played a vital role in defeating the [[20 July plot]], {{ill|Fritz Dorls|de}}, a former editor of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] newsletter in Lower Saxony, and [[Gerhard Krüger (politician)|Gerhard Krüger]], leader of the [[German Student Union]] under the Third Reich, after they had been excluded from the DKP-DRP. The SRP saw itself as a legitimate heir of the [[Nazi Party]]; most party adherents were former NSDAP members. Its foundation was backed by former [[Luftwaffe]] [[Oberst]] [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-15845-0010, Sozialistische Reichspartei, Dorls, Remer, Westarp.jpg|thumb|left|SRP leaders Dorls (l.), Remer, Wolf von Westarp in August 1952]]

== Party platform ==
The party claimed Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] was a [[United States]] puppet and that Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] was the last legitimate [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|President]] of the [[German Reich]] appointed by [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Lee]], ''[[The Beast Reawakens]]'' (Warner Books, 1998), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It denied the existence of [[the Holocaust]], claimed that the United States built the gas ovens of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] after the War and that films of [[Internment#Concentration_camp|concentration camps]] were faked.&lt;ref name="Lee, p. 50"&gt;Lee, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The SRP also advocated Europe, led by a reunited German Reich, as a "[[Third Position|third force]]" against both [[capitalism]] and [[communism]].&lt;ref name="Lee, p. 50"/&gt; It demanded the re-annexation of the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] and a "solution of the [[Jewish question]]". According to [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], "SRP propaganda concentrated on a vague 'popular socialism' in which the old National Socialists rediscovered well-worn slogans, and also on a nationalism whose championship of Reich and war was but a thinly disguised continuation of the ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Dietrich Bracher, ''The German Dictatorship. The Origins, Structure, and Consequences of National Socialism'' (Penguin, 1991), p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin A. Lee]], the SRP never openly criticised the [[Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; because the Soviet Union funded the SRP as it held anti-American and pro-Soviet views. The [[Communist Party of Germany]], on the other hand, did not receive Soviet funds because it was viewed as "ineffectual".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b8k4rEPvq_8C "Encyclopedia of modern worldwide extremists and extremist groups"], Stephen E. Atkins. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. {{ISBN|0-313-32485-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-32485-7}}. pp. 273-274&lt;/ref&gt; Remer said that if the USSR ever did invade Germany, he would "show the Russians the way to the [[Rhine]]" and that SRP members would "post themselves as traffic policemen, spreading their arms so that the Russians can find their way through Germany as quickly as possible".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Tetens, ''The New Germany and the Old Nazis'' (London: Secker &amp; Warburg, 1962), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Election results ==
Dorls had been elected as a DKP-DRP deputy to the [[Bundestag]] parliament in the [[West German federal election, 1949|1949 election]]. The SRP gained a second seat in parliament, when MP [[Fritz Rössler]] (alias Dr. Franz Richter) joined the party in 1950. In May 1951 it won 16 seats in the [[Lower Saxony]] state assembly ([[Landtag]]) election, receiving 11.0% of the votes with strongholds in the [[Stade (region)|Stade region]] (21.5%; [[Verden (district)|Verden district]]: 27.7%). In October 1951 it gained 7.7% of the votes in [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] and won 8 seats in the city's [[Bürgerschaft of Bremen|Bürgerschaft]] parliament. 

== Membership ==
The SRP had about ten thousand members. Affiliated associations were the ''Reichsfront'' [[paramilitary]] organisation and the ''Reichsjugend'' [[youth wing]], which were banned by decision of the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Minister of the Interior]] on 4 May 1951. On the same day, the [[Cabinet of Germany|West German cabinet]] decided to file an application to the Federal Constitutional Court to find the SRP anti-constitutional and to impose a ban. On 23 October 1952 the court according to Article 21 Paragraph 2 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] adjudicated the party unconstitutional and dissolved, prohibited the founding of any successor organisations, withdraw all Bundestag and Landtag mandates and seized the party's assets (BVerfGE 2, 1). In view of the verdict, the SRP leaders had already declared the Party dissolved on 12 September.

'''''Spice World''''' is a 1997 British [[Musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Bob Spiers]] and written by [[Kim Fuller]] and Jamie Curtis. The film stars [[Pop music|pop]] [[girl group]] the [[Spice Girls]] who all play themselves. The film—made in a similar vein to [[The Beatles]]' ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964)—depicts a series of  fictional events leading up to a major concert at [[London]]'s [[Royal Albert Hall]], liberally interspersed with dream sequences and [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] as well as [[Surrealism|surreal]] moments and humorous asides.

This is the second feature-length film directed by Spiers, following ''[[That Darn Cat (1997 film)|That Darn Cat]]'' (1997). The film features [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Claire Rushbrook]], [[Naoko Mori]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Barry Humphries]], and [[Alan Cumming]] in supporting roles. Filming took place in [[London]] for six of the eight filming weeks and also inside [[Twickenham Studios]], as well as at over 40 famous British landmarks. Shooting featured several fourteen-hour shooting sessions and a constant, heavy media presence due to the Spice Girls' large popularity at the time.

The film premiered on 15 December 1997 and was released to British cinemas on the British holiday [[Boxing Day]] (26 December). In North America, the film was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]], and [[Icon Entertainment International]] and premiered on 23 January 1998. In the United States, ''Spice World'' became a box office success and broke the record for the highest-ever weekend debut for [[Super Bowl]] weekend with box office sales of $10,527,222. The film grossed $151 million at the box office worldwide and over $100 million including DVD sales.&lt;ref name="ofi"&gt;Spice Girls Official. [http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/biography Biography]. 19 Management Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a box office success, the film received primarily negative reviews.

To celebrate its 20th Anniversary in 2017, ''Spice World'' was given a limited release across the United Kingdom showing at Odeon Cinemas. The film grossed just shy of £1 million bringing the total gross income $151 million worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Plot==
The film begins with the [[Spice Girls]] performing "[[Too Much (Spice Girls song)|Too Much]]" on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of fame and fortune. Meanwhile, sinister newspaper owner Kevin McMaxford ([[Barry Humphries]]) is attempting to ruin the girls' reputation for his newspaper's ratings. McMaxford dispatches photographer Damien ([[Richard O'Brien]]) to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Less threatening but more annoying is Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth ([[Alan Cumming]]), who stalks the girls along with his camera crew, hoping to use them as subjects for his next project. At the same time, the girls' uptight manager, Clifford ([[Richard E. Grant]]) and his sympathetic assistant Deborah ([[Claire Rushbrook]]), are fending off two over-eager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield and Graydon ([[George Wendt]] and [[Mark McKinney]]), who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for a feature film for the Spice Girls.

Amid this, the girls must prepare for their live concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in three days, the biggest performance of their career. At the heart of it, the constant practices, traveling, publicity appearances, and other burdens of celebrity affect the girls on a personal level, preventing them from spending much time with their pregnant best friend, Nicola ([[Naoko Mori]]), who is due to give birth soon. Throughout the busy schedule, the girls attempt to ask Clifford for time off to spend with Nicola and relax, but Clifford refuses after talking with the head of the girls' record label, the cryptic and eccentric "Chief" ([[Roger Moore]]). The stress and overwork compound, which culminate in a huge argument between Clifford and the girls. The girls suddenly storm out on the evening before their gig at the Albert Hall.

The girls separately think back on their humble beginnings and their struggle to the top. They reunite by chance outside the now-abandoned café where they practiced during their childhood years, they reconcile, and decide to take Nicola out dancing. However, Nicola goes into labor at the nightclub and is rushed to the hospital in the girls' bus, giving birth to a healthy baby girl. When [[Emma Bunton|Emma]] notices that the delivery "doctor" has a camera, the girls realize that he is Damien, who runs off with the girls in hot pursuit, only to hit his head after accidentally colliding with an empty stretcher. When Damien sees the girls standing over him, he tells them that they have made him see the error of his ways, and he goes after McMaxford, who is subsequently fired in a "Jacuzzi scandal".

After noticing the girls' bus driver, Dennis ([[Meat Loaf]]) is missing, [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria]] decides to take the wheel. It becomes a race against time as Victoria drives like a maniac through London. While approaching [[Tower Bridge]], the bridge begins to raise to let a boat through the [[River Thames]]. Victoria drives up the bridge and over the gap. The bus finally lands safely on the other side, but when Emma opens a trapdoor in the floor, she discovers a bomb, and the girls scream before Emma slams the trapdoor shut again.

The girls finally arrive at the Royal Albert Hall for their performance and run up the steps. However, the girls have one more obstacle to overcome: a London policeman ([[Kevin McNally]]) charges the girls with "dangerous driving, criminal damage, flying a bus without a license, and frightening the pigeons". Emma pushes forward and tells the policeman that she and the other girls were late for their performance at the Albert Hall. Emma smiles at the policeman, and he lets the girls off for their performance. The film ends when the girls perform their song "[[Spice Up Your Life]]" at the start of their Royal Albert Hall concert broadcast live on television around the world.

The supporting cast later talk about the girls' film during the closing credits. [[Melanie Chisholm|Mel C]] breaks the [[fourth wall]] and tells the other girls that the outgoing audience is watching them. The girls talk to the audience, commenting on "those two in the back row snogging" and on one's dress, and discuss their film, just minutes before the bomb in their bus explodes.

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:Spiceworld-gerihalliwell-outfit.jpg|thumb|Geri Halliwell's red swimsuit from the film.]]
Spiers had been working in America on the Disney film ''[[That Darn Cat (1997 film)|That Darn Cat]]'' at the peak of the Spice Girls' popularity. He was unaware of the group when first offered the job until his friend [[Jennifer Saunders]] advised that he take it. He arrived at a meeting with them in a New York hotel unaware of what they looked like.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Spiers and Stacey Adair, ''[[Joking Apart]]'', Series 2 Episode 2, DVD audio commentary, replaydvd.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[Frank Bruno]] was originally cast as the tour bus driver, but withdrew after a security guard prevented his son Franklin having an on-set photo taken with the girls.

Mentions of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] and scenes including the designer [[Gianni Versace]] had to be edited out in post-production following their deaths before the release of the film.&lt;ref name="20 things"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/01/20-things-you-didnt-know-about-spice-world/gary-glitter |title=20 Things You Didn't Know About "Spice World" |publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Magazine]] |date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film reunited [[Meat Loaf]] and [[Richard O'Brien]], who co-starred in the 1975 classic film ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''. The film also reunited O'Brien and [[Barry Humphries]], who costarred in the ''Rocky Horror'' follow-up, ''[[Shock Treatment]]'' (1981).

"Their company rang me up and asked if I would be in it", remarked [[Elvis Costello]] of his cameo. "I wouldn't have thought I was the kind of face you would get to do a cornflakes advert. Maybe twenty years ago. I was surprised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Du Noyer]]|authorlink=Paul Du Noyer|title=Cash for questions|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|issue=137|date=February 1998|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gary Glitter controversy====
[[Gary Glitter]] filmed a four-minute [[cameo appearance]] as himself, but shortly before the film was to be released he was [[Gary Glitter#Child pornography arrest and conviction|arrested on child pornography offences]]. The Spice Girls and the production team agreed that his cameo should be deleted from the final print. The performance of Glitter's "[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]" was retained.&lt;ref name="gary glitter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/the-truth-behind-the-lost-gary-glitter-cameo-in-142328383.html |title=The Truth Behind The Deleted Gary Glitter Cameo In The Spice Girls Movie |publisher=[[Yahoo!

===The Spice Bus===
[[File:Spice Bus.jpg|thumb|The bus used in the Spice World movie.]]
Official toy versions of the Spice Bus were produced upon the release of the movie.&lt;ref name="spice bus toys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivaspice.net/guide/official/toys/buses.htm |title=Toy Spice Buses |publisher=VivaSpice.net |accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2014, the actual Spice Bus used in the film was put on permanent display at [[Island Harbour Marina]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], England.&lt;ref name="spice bus display"&gt;[http://www.island-harbour.co.uk/spice/ The Spice Bus].

==Release==

===Rating===
In the United Kingdom, ''Spice World'' was granted a [[History of British film certificates#1994-2002|PG certificate]] by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] for "mild bad language, mild sex references".&lt;ref name="bbfc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/spice-world-movie-1997-0 | title=''SPICE WORLD - THE MOVIE'' (PG) | work=[[British Board of Film Classification]] | date=27 November 1997 | accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it received a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|PG rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for "some vulgarity, brief nudity and language".

===Box office===
Spiceworld was a number-one box office success in the United Kingdom, grossing more than £6.8 million during its opening weekend on Boxing Day, 1997. The film was also successful at the box office in the United States, breaking the record at that time for the highest-ever weekend debut for Super Bowl weekend (25 January 1998), with box office sales of $10,527,222.&lt;ref name="IMDb opening weekend"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/BusinessThisDay?day=25&amp;month=January Opening weekend box office sales in the US].

The film was released on VHS in May 1998 in many regions including the UK, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Japan and Australia. In June 1998, it came out on VHS in the US and Canada. Despite concerns that the high-profile departure of Halliwell from the Spice Girls would affect sales, global demand for the VHS was high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=YQ4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=spice+girls+world+music+awards&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPgvu7pZvSAhXIRo8KHSj3CnkQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=spice%20girls%20world%20music%20awards&amp;f=false|title=With Spice Girls Down to Four, Sales Still Ride High (pg. 8, 120) |publisher=Billboard Magazine |date=12 June 1998 |accessdate=18 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the film was number one on the video charts for six consecutive weeks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/video-chart/19980705/12/ Official Video Chart Top 100: 31 May 1998 - 11 July 1998].

The film received generally negative reviews from critics. Film review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave ''Spice World'' a rating of 35% based on reviews from 63 critics, with an average rating of 4.5 out of 10.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spice_world/ | title=Spice World (1998) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 32 out of 100 rating, based on 16 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/spice-world | title=Spice World Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMovie]] gave it two out of five stars.&lt;ref name="allmovie"&gt;{{AllMovie title|160114|Spice World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted American [[Film criticism|film critic]] [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one-half of a star and listed ''Spice World'' as one of his most hated films, saying: "The Spice Girls are easier to tell apart than the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|Mutant Ninja Turtles]], but that is small consolation: What can you say about five women whose principal distinguishing characteristic is that they have different names? They occupy ''Spice World'' as if they were watching it: They're so detached they can't even successfully [[Lip sync|lip-synch]] their own songs." And when he reviewed the film on his and [[Gene Siskel]]'s film critique programme ''[[Siskel &amp; Ebert]]'', only three weeks into 1998, he declared that he had already seen the worst film of that year, and called it "an entertainment-free dead zone". Ebert would include this film on the ''Worst of 1998'' special; but he chose ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' as the worst film of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050811/COMMENTARY/50808002 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Ebert's Most Hated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19980123%2FREVIEWS%2F801230303%2F1023&amp;AID1=%2F19980123%2FREVIEWS%2F801230303%2F1023&amp;AID2= | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Spice World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the film "is pleasant and painless enough to amuse ardent fans, who figure in the film quite often." She also noted that while it got a PG rating in the [[United States]], "nothing about it should disturb its target audience of media-wise, fun-loving 8-year-old girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 23 January 1998  | author = [[Janet Maslin]] | work = [[The New York Times]] | title = 'Spice World': Hits and Hairdos on the Spice Rack | url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/012398spice-film-review.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Sight and Sound]]'', in a positive review, Mark Sinker placed it alongside [[The Monkees]]' 1968 cult film ''[[Head (film)|Head]]''. He went on to say that it "sends up the amiable idiocy of pop packaging - and the slow witted mass-media response to it" and it was "tirelessly generous in its energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinker|first=Mark|date=February 1998|title=Spice World|journal=Sight and Sound|pages=49|issn=0037-4806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Derek Elley]], resident film critic for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'',  gave the film mixed reviews, calling the film "bright and breezy" and "as timely but evanescent as the [[Cool Britannia]] culture it celebrates". He stated that the film would "delight the Fab Five's pre-pubescent fans" but that it would "be forgotten within six months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/spice-world-1200452214/| work=Variety|title=Review: ‘Spice World’|last=Elley|first=Derek|date=18 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
The film has been listed in [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] founder [[John J.B. Wilson|John Wilson]]'s book ''The Official Razzie Movie Guide'' as one of "The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst |year=2005|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=0-446-69334-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The film, while being negatively reviewed, is remembered fondly by many who were part of its target audience of younger pop fans at the time of its release. It has arguably achieved cult status as a commentary on [[Popular culture|pop culture]], and is ultimately a more cohesive film by a pop group than predecessors like [[The Beatles]]' ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' or ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/gywe57/spice-girls-surreal-moments-from-cult-classic-spice-world Spice World cult film on broadly.vice.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/mbpwda/how-the-spice-world-movie-became-a-deranged-postmodern-masterpiece Spice World chef d'oeuvre on broadly.vice.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/crew-members-explain-spice-world-still-weird-20-years Spice World review on interviewmagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/spice-world-movie-air-vue-13415107 Spice World a real cult classic movie on getsurrey.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/spice-world-movie-vue-cinema-13414469 Spice World movie on chroniclelive.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a55766/spice-world-is-better-than-a-hard-days-night/ Spice World a brillant movie on esquire.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/our-region/edinburgh/spice-world-turns-20-film-to-be-screened-in-edinburgh-1-4526360 Spice World a cult film on scotsman.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/spice-world-movie-shown-belfast-13415276 Spice World on belfastliveco.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blogto.com/events/screen-queens-spice-world/ Spice World the movie clut film on blogto.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/why-spice-world-is-a-cinematic-masterpiece Spice World a masterpiece on buzzfeed.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stielers Handatlas''''' (after [[Adolf Stieler]], 1775–1836), formally titled '''''Hand-Atlas über alle Theile der Erde und über das Weltgebäude''''' (''Handy atlas of all parts of the world and of the universe''), was the leading German world [[atlas]] of the last three decades of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. Published by [[Justus Perthes]] of Gotha (established 1785 and still existing there) it went through ten editions from 1816 to 1945.&lt;ref name=esp /&gt;{{rp|290/2}} As with many 19th century publications, an edition was issued in parts; for example, the eighth edition was issued in 32 monthly parts.

== Editions ==
The earliest edition, by Stieler and [[Christian Gottlieb Reichard]],&lt;ref name=esp&gt;{{cite book|last1=Espenhorst|first1=Jürgen|title=Petermann's Planet|date=2003|publisher=Pangaea|location=Schwerte|isbn=3-930401-35-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|326/2}} was published as separate plates from 1817 to 1823.&lt;ref name=esp /&gt;{{rp|222/1}} There were 47 maps, though the intention had been to publish 50.&lt;ref name=esp /&gt;{{rp|222/1}} After Stieler's death Friedrich von Stülpnagel (1786–1865) edited the first (1834-1845) edition,&lt;ref name=esp /&gt;{{rp|238/1}} and the second (1845–47) with 107 maps.&lt;ref name=esp /&gt;{{rp|239/2}}. [[August Heinrich Petermann|Petermann]] contributed to the third (1854–62) edition&lt;ref name=esp /&gt;{{rp|222/1}} containing 83 maps, the fourth (1864-67)&lt;ref name=esp /&gt;{{rp|247/1}} and the fifth (1868-74),&lt;ref name=esp /&gt;{{rp|248/2}} each with 84 maps.

However, it was not until the sixth edition (1871–75, 90 maps), edited by [[August Petermann]] (1822–78), [[Hermann Berghaus]] (1828–1890) and Carl Vogel (1828–1897), that the work reached the high scientific level and the unsurpassed relief ''Stieler's Atlas'' is famous for. A seventh edition was issued 1879-82; an eighth 1888-91 (both 95 maps) under the direction of Hermann Berghaus, Vogel and Hermann Habenicht (1844–1917). Although the printing industry had already changed to [[lithography]] for some time, some maps in ''Stieler's Atlas'' were still reproduced by [[copper-plate]] printing on hand presses with hand colouring into the 1890s.

The ninth edition (1901–05), edited by Habenicht, with one hundred maps, over double the number of the initial edition, was the first one printed on cylinder machines by means of lithography, which halved the price and made the ''Stieler'' accessible to a broad public. 16 maps hereof were exclusively translated to English, transferred to [[Imperial units]] and became part the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th edition]] of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1910–1911).&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Lierz: ''Karten aus Stielers Hand-Atlas in der „{{sic|Encyclopaedia Britannica|hide=yes}}“.'' In: ''Cartographica Helvetica.'' Heft 29, 2004, {{ISSN|1015-8480}}, S. 27–34 [http://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?pid=chl-001:2004:29-30::28 online].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Haack]] (1872–1966) edited the tenth (centenary) edition (1920–25, 108 maps), with an index to 320,000 entries being the most comprehensive world atlas of modern times.

English versions of the ninth and tenth editions appeared as ''Stieler's Atlas of Modern Geography'', and editions with similar titles were also issued in French, Italian and Spanish. An international edition (1934–1940) remained with 84 of the 114 maps planned incomplete due to wartime circumstances. The work was engraved on 432 copper plates which have been preserved.

The '''Sutherland Steam Mill Museum''' is a restored steam woodworking mill from the 1890s located in [[Denmark, Nova Scotia]]. The mill operated until 1958. Today it is part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] system.

The museum represents the transition from water powered mills, such as that preserved at the nearby [[Balmoral Grist Mill Museum]], to the more powerful and efficient [[steam mill|steam-driven mill]]. The mill was located in at the centre of a vast woodland area and was situated next to a railroad. Thus it had excellent access to both raw materials and to markets though shipping terminals at [[Pictou]] and [[Wallace, Nova Scotia|Wallace]]. At its peak, the mill employed more than a dozen workers, and it produced sawn lumber, sleds and carriages, sashes and doors and other architectural products such as [[Victorian architecture#North America|gingerbread]]. The founder of the mill, Alexander Sutherland retired in 1940 and his son and successor Wilfred Sutherland retired in 1958. The mill became a museum in 1970 and it was adopted into the Nova Scotia Museum Complex in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland Steam Mill (brochure) n.d, Nova Scotia Museum Complex&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum lies next to the Shortline Railbed section of the [[Trans-Canada Trail]]. The Museum offers free bike loans for day use on the trail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sutherlandsteammill.novascotia.ca/borrow-bike-trail-program Sutherland Steam Mill "Borrow a Bike" program]. Accessed July 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It also offers free woodworking space within the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sutherlandsteammill.novascotia.ca/maker-space Sutherland Steam Mill Maker Space].

'''''The Cuisines of Mexico''''' is the first of [[Diana Kennedy]]’s nine cookbooks, credited with introducing Americans to [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican food]] beyond [[Tex-Mex]].

==Background to the book==
The book was the result of Kennedy’s love of Mexican food, which she discovered when she moved to [[Mexico City]] to live with her husband, ''New York Times'' reporter Paul P. Kennedy in 1957.  The couple moved to New York City by the end of 1965, with Paul dying in 1967 of cancer&lt;ref name=schoeder&gt;{{cite web  |author= Eric James Schroeder  |title= "Every Recipe Has a Story": An Interview with Diana Kennedy  |publisher= Writing on the Edge  |location= University of California, Davis  |url= http://woe.ucdavis.edu/samples/DianaKennedyInterview.pdf  |accessdate= November 2, 2015  |deadurl= yes  |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151121235812/http://woe.ucdavis.edu/samples/DianaKennedyInterview.pdf  |archivedate= November 21, 2015  |df=   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theexpat&gt;{{cite web |author=Beth Bracklauer |title=The Expat:Diana Kennedy |publisher=Saveur magazine |date=August 12, 2012  |url= http://www.saveur.com/article/Travels/Diana-Kennedy  |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make a living, Kennedy began teaching Mexican cooking classes in her Upper West Side apartment, with the cuisine quite novel at the time.&lt;ref name=schoeder/&gt;&lt;ref name=theexpat/&gt; Although ''New York Times'' food writer [[Craig Claiborne]] once mentioned to her that she should write a Mexican cookbook and encouraged her cooking classes. The book began to come together after then-poetry editor at [[Harper (publisher)|Harper and Row]] Fran McCullough took one of her classes and offered to be her editor. The two would eventually work on Kennedy’s first five cookbooks.&lt;ref name=schoeder/&gt;&lt;ref name=guillermoprieto&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alma Guillermoprieto  |title= Disappearing dishes  |journal= The New Yorker  |location= New York  |date=August 2002  |volume= 78 |issue=24 |page=98  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theexpat/&gt; Although Kennedy had been collecting recipes since her time in Mexico City, she decided to go to Mexico to do further research.&lt;ref name=schoeder/&gt; This research, she believes, is what separates her from other cookbook writers is that she has taken the time and effort to explore Mexico and do field research on how the cuisine varies.&lt;ref name=kracklauer&gt;{{cite web |author=Beth Bracklauer |title=The Interview:Diana Kennedy |publisher=Saveur magazine |date=September 3, 2012  |url= http://WWW.SAVEUR.COM/ARTICLE/TRAVELS/MEXICO-DIANA-KENNEDY-INTERVIEW  |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy did not have any prior writing experience before the book, but after several rewrites, she published ''The Cuisines of Mexico'' in 1972. This book became a best-seller and is still one of the most authoritative single volumes on Mexican cooking.&lt;ref name=schoeder/&gt;&lt;ref name=sgreenberg&gt;{{cite news |author= Sarah Greenberg  |title= The Brit who saved Mexican food  |newspaper=The Guardian  |location=London |date=October 12, 2003  |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/oct/12/foodanddrink.features6  |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
It began to change Americans' understanding of Mexican food, expanding it beyond [[Tex-Mex]] into the various regional cuisines and dishes,&lt;ref name=fiery&gt;{{cite news |author=William Booth  |title= Diana Kennedy, fiery chronicler of Mexican food traditions  |newspaper=Washington Post  |location=Washington, DC |date=January 11, 2011  |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/11/AR2011011103354.html  |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sgreenberg/&gt; and is the basis of establishing authentic Mexican food in this country.&lt;ref name=guillermoprieto/&gt; The contents of this book along with two that followed, ''The Tortilla Book'' and ''Mexican Regional Cooking'', were compiled in 2000 into ''The Essential Cuisines of Mexico''.

[[File:The Record Guide.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Dust-jacket of the 1955 edition]]
'''''The Record Guide''''' was an English reference work that listed, described, and evaluated [[gramophone record|gramophone]] recordings of classical music in the 1950s. It was a precursor to modern guides such as ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]''.

==Publication history==
The guide was conceived and written by [[Edward Sackville-West, 5th Baron Sackville|Edward Sackville-West]] and the music critic [[Desmond Shawe-Taylor (music critic)|Desmond Shawe-Taylor]]. Their aim, as set out in the preface to the first edition in 1951, was "to try to supply a guide-book to the vast available repertory of the gramophone". The book ran to 763 pages, but nevertheless confined its coverage to records available in Britain in the domestic catalogues up to and including December, 1950. A reviewer wrote of the first edition: "It is not an encyclopaedia … for the principle of it is selective rather than comprehensive. We cannot, therefore, fairly charge the authors with omissions other than those which are inadvertent. The point is made with subtlety in the introduction. 'Inadvertent omissions there are bound to be, in spite of every effort to avoid them but it should not be assumed by the reader that an unquoted record has been simply overlooked. It is much more likely to have been excluded deliberately.'"&lt;ref name=ar/&gt;

The book considers recordings  in alphabetical order of composer. Each composer section begins with an introduction assessing and describing the composer's works, after which the recordings are described and evaluated, using a star system, with two stars as the top rating. Of the introductions, the reviewer of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'' wrote, "these paragraphs vary from a few lines to a couple of pages (the length being unrelated to the importance of the composer) and anyone unfamiliar with the authors would not have to read far before realising that two exceptionally intelligent musical minds had been at work."&lt;ref name=ar&gt;Robertson, Alec,  [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/September%201951/11/776047/THE+RECORD+GUIDE#header-logo Review of The Record Guide,] ''The Gramophone'', September 1951, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

To the keep the guide current, Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor produced interim updates, ''The Record Year'' in 1952 and 1953. At this time the [[LP record|long playing record]] was being introduced, but records were also being issued in the old 78 r.p.m. format. By 1955 the number of new releases threatened to overwhelm the authors, who recruited two younger colleagues to help them, [[Andrew Porter (music critic)|Andrew Porter]] and William Mann. Between them they produced a full new edition of ''The Record Guide'' in 1955, running to 957 pages,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Alec,  [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/January%201956/23/802865/The+Record+Guide.+By+Edward+SackvilleWest+and+Desmond+ShaweTaylor.+%28Collins%2C+35s.%29 Review,] ''The Gramophone'', January 1956, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and a final supplement in 1956.

Four years after the last in the series of ''The Record Guide'' was published, three young musical writers emulated its layout and ''modus operandi'' in ''The Stereo Record Guide'', which has evolved into ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]''

'''''The Young Shepherdess''''' is an 1885 painting by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] (1825–1905). It is owned by the [[San Diego Museum of Art]]. 

The painting depicts a barefoot young woman in peasant clothing, turned away from but still facing the viewer. She holds a plant in her hands. See also [[The Shepherdess]], a similar painting by the same artist.

This and similar images by the artist attracted collectors in Europe and America because of their nostalgic content.&lt;ref name="frickart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frickart.org/collection_exhibitions/pastexhibitions/86.php |title=Frick Art &amp;amp; Historical Center &amp;#124; Past Exhibitions &amp;#124; In The Studios of Paris WILLIAM BOUGUEREAU His American Students |publisher=frickart.org |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829040814/http://www.frickart.org/collection_exhibitions/pastexhibitions/86.php |archivedate=2013-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such works the artist depicted a variety of poses and expressions, in this case showing the mild curiosity of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nX0IJ4RNCW4C&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=The+Young+Shepherdess+is+an+1885+painting+by+William-Adolphe+Bouguereau&amp;source=web&amp;ots=L6oTkVBC3_&amp;sig=LPCcoQRMxBgW3TQBKE-UeXr_b9k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=39&amp;ct=result#PPA50,M1]{{Dead link|date=August 2015}}{{Dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In portraying a shepherdess Bouguereau is working within the [[pastoral]] mode or theme, as developed by [[ancient Greek]] and [[Hellenistic]] artists and poets. French painters who preceded him in this include [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Poussin]], and [[Watteau]].

'''''Throwback''''' is a public artwork by [[People of the United States|American]] artist [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], located at the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SIRIS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=1996 | title=Throwback, (sculpture). | work=Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!373071~!0#focus | accessdate= 3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is the third of an edition of three in the series with one [[artist's proof]].

==Description==
The artwork is constructed sheets of aluminum that have been welded together at precise angles to form a geometric, four-sided, hollow, elongated ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Throwback Save Outdoor Sculpture! entry|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=134J93Q519U93.3754&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!373071~!68&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Smith,+Tony,+1912-1980,+sculptor.&amp;index=AUTHOR&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1|publisher=Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture, Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculpture is coated with a flat-black industrial fluoropolymer exterior paint applied to achieve a matte finish.  Currently sited on a patch of turf in the Sculpture Garden of the Hirshhorn, the sculpture is supported by three subterranean plates with brackets at three points.&lt;ref name="Hirshhorn"&gt;Conservation file. 2010. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
In the early to mid-sixties, Smith experimented with tetrahedral and octahedral forms in sculptures such as ''Willy'' and ''Amaryllis''. Over a decade later, Smith returned to these earlier geometries with ''Throwback''.  Thus the title of the work alludes to this act of looking back.  Smith elaborated on this point, "In a certain sense the piece is unique. I did not have the prospect or opportunity of making a large architectural sculpture so I decided to do something more conventional. I made an object that recalls an earlier period."&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;Hunter, S. 1979. The sculpture of Tony Smith. In Tony Smith: Ten Elements and Throwback, ed. Pace Gallery. New York: Pace Gallery. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Paper Company]] was the first to purchase [[Throwback (1/3)|the first sculpture of the edition]] and originally displayed it at the company's New York headquarters.&lt;ref name="Glueck"&gt;Glueck, G. 1980. Tony Smith, 68, sculptor of minimalist structures. New York Times, December 27.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now owned by the [[City of New York]] and on display at 1166 Avenue of the Americas.

The second version was purchased by [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] and is currently on display.&lt;ref name="SFMOMA"&gt;{{cite web | author=San Francisco Museum of Art | year=2010 | title=Tony Smith | work=Our Collection | publisher=SFMOMA | url=http://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/282 | accessdate= 3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The artists proof has not been fabricated.

Several other versions of the work exist.  In 1976, a smaller (62 × 150 inches), unique version of the work was installed at [[Grove Isle]], Coconut Grove, Florida.  A full-scale plywood model, painted black, was created for exhibition at the [[Pace Gallery]] in 1979.  A cardboard maquette (measuring 13 1/2 × 32 1/2 × 16 inches) was intended to serve as the model of an edition of 9 bronzes.&lt;ref name="McClintic"&gt;McClintic, M. 1979. Memorandum: propose acquisition of Throwback, 28 September 1979. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Archives, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the maquette was ultimately produced in a numbered edition of 6.

===Acquisition===
While the work is dated from 1976–1977, the Hirshhorn's edition of the work was acquired from the Pace Gallery in 1980.  [[Lippincott, Inc]] fabricated the sculpture in North Haven, Connecticut, in the same year.&lt;ref name="Glimcher"&gt;Glimcher, A.B. 1979. Letter from Arnold B. Glimcher to Abram Lerner, 12 December 1979. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Archives, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting on a tip, [[Texas]] investigators, entered onto the defendant’s property in [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] and peeked through a hole in a barn where they discovered [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] being cultivated.  With this information the officers gained a [[search warrant]], which they used to search the property.  The defendant was eventually arrested, tried and convicted for ''possession with intent to distribute''.  The defendant challenged on [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] grounds, claiming that the barn was inside the "curtilage" of his home.  The court found that it was not and that the search was legal pursuant to the "open fields" doctrine.  The court held that the search was [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] and that the barn was not within the curtilage of the appellant's home because the barn was located a significant distance from the house, was separated from the house by an interior fence, was not being used for activities associated with the intimacies of home life, and was readily visible from the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3761">[[Image:Yildiz Park 03.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to Yıldız Park]]
'''Yıldız Park''' ({{lang-tr|Yıldız Parkı}}) is a historical, [[urban park]] in [[Beşiktaş]] district of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. It is one of the largest public parks in Istanbul. The park is located in [[Yıldız]] quarter between the palaces of [[Yıldız Palace|Yıldız]] and [[Çırağan Palace|Çırağan]].

==History==
[[Image:Ciragan Palace 1840.JPG|thumb|Painting of [[Çırağan Palace]] with the hilly slopes of Yıldız Park, seen from the Bosphorus (1840)]]
Yıldız Park was once part of the imperial garden of [[Yıldız Palace]]. Extending down the slopes from the palace, this walled park was reserved only for palace dwellers during the reign of Sultan [[Abdulhamid II]].

The area of Yıldız used to be a forest in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times. Starting during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the sultans made it their hunting grounds. In the next centuries, it remained as a grove behind the seaside palaces. The neighbourhood began to flourish in the wake of construction of the palace in the 19th century. It took its name from the first pavilion, namely ''Yıldız Kasrı'', commissioned by [[Selim III]] in early 19th century.

The {{convert|25|acre|km2|sing=on}} of the palace's external garden were surrounded by high walls and detached from a grove during the reign of [[Abdulhamid II]] in the 19th century. A small artificial lake, pavilions, summer houses and a porcelain factory were established in this section.
