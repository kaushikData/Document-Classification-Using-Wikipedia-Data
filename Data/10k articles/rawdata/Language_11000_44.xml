      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="848">The Adult literacy index (ALI) is a [[statistics|statistical measure]] used to determine how many adults can read and write in a certain area or nation. Adult literacy  is one of the factors in measuring the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) of each nation, along with life expectancy, education, and [[standard of living]].
&lt;br /&gt;
The equation for calculating the Adult Literacy Index is
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{ALR} {100}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;small&gt;ALR = Adult literacy rate (ages 15 and older)&lt;/small&gt;

'''Aegisub''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|dʒ|i|s|ʌ|b}}) is a [[Free Software|free]] [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[cross-platform]] [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]] editing program. It is extensively used in [[fansub]]bing, the practice of creating or translating unofficial, noncommercial subtitles for visual media by [[fan (person)|fans]]. It is the successor of the original [[SubStation Alpha]] and [[Sabbu]].

It has been designed for [[synchronization|timing]] and styling of subtitles, as well as the creation of [[karaoke]]. Aegisub's native subtitle format is [[SubStation Alpha|Advanced SubStation Alpha]] text, which supports subtitle positioning and styling.&lt;!--supporting cites in that article--&gt; The program also supports other common formats such as [[SubRip]]. Features include support for timing to both audio and video, and can use many video processing bindings to process those, such as [[FFmpeg]] and [[Avisynth]]. It can also be extended with the [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] and [[MoonScript]] scripting languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automation|url=http://docs.aegisub.org/3.2/Automation/|work=User Manual Aegisub 3.2|access-date= 6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fansubbing terms, Aegisub is used for translating, timing, editing, typesetting, quality checking, karaoke timing and karaoke effecting. Although, many groups use different tools for some of those steps, such as [[Adobe After Effects]] for typesetting, or a simple text editor for translation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">'''Arto Salminen''' (22 October 1959 – 15 November 2005) was a Finnish writer known for his [[social commentary]].

Salminen, who was born in [[Helsinki]], had also worked as a journalist and taxi driver; he wrote six novels which criticised with a morbid black sense of humour such current phenomena in Finnish society as [[Neoliberalism|neoliberalist]] politics, the decline of the [[welfare state]], [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] media, [[reality television]] and so on. His books gained a small cult following in Finland and they also received excellent reviews even though they did not sell particularly well.

Salminen received the Koskenkorva Prize in 1998, and the Olvi Prize in 2004. He died of a sudden stroke at [[Hausjärvi]] in November 2005.

Salminen's novel ''Varasto'' was posthumously adapted as [[The Storage|a successful comedy film]] in 2011.

An '''audio synchronizer''' is a variable [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] delay used to correct or maintain [[audio video sync|audio-video sync]] or timing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/audio/broadcasting_managing_lip_sync/index.html |title=Managing lip sync |publisher=[[Broadcast Engineering (magazine)|Broadcast Engineering]] |date=2007-09-01 |author=Aldo Cucnini |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727071623/http://broadcastengineering.com/audio/broadcasting_managing_lip_sync/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[lip sync error]]. See for example the specification for audio to video timing given in ATSC Document IS-191.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=IS-191: Relative Timing of Sound and Vision for Broadcast Operations |publisher=[[ATSC]] |date=2003-06-26 |url=http://www.atsc.org/cms/index.php/standards/document-download/doc_download/47-is-191-relative-timing-of-sound-and-vision-for-broadcast-operations |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60UbU5Ziv?url=http://www.atsc.org/cms/index.php/standards/document-download/doc_download/47-is-191-relative-timing-of-sound-and-vision-for-broadcast-operations |archivedate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[television]] systems use large amounts of [[video]] signal processing such as [[MPEG]] preprocessing, encoding and decoding, [[Video synching#Communication|video synchronization]] and resolution conversion in [[pixelated]] displays. This video processing can cause delays in the video signal ranging from a few microseconds to tens of seconds. If the television program is displayed to the viewer with this video delay the audio-video [[Synchronization in telecommunications|synchronization]] is wrong, and the video will appear to the viewer after the sound is heard. This effect is commonly referred to as A/V sync or [[lip sync]] error and can cause serious problems related to the viewer's enjoyment of the program.

==Error correction==
To correct audio video sync problems, the video processing circuitry outputs a DDO ([[Delay (audio effect)#Digital delay|digital delay]] output) signal, which carries information about the amount of delay the video signal experiences due to the [[video processing]]. The DDO may, for example, be provided by equipment which adheres to the [[SMPTE timecode|SMPTE]] &lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&amp;queryText=SMPTE%20ST2064 ST2064&lt;/ref&gt; [[Audio to video synchronization|Audio to Video Synchronization]] Standard. The audio synchronizer receives the DDO signal and in response delays the audio by an equivalent amount, thereby maintaining proper audio-video sync. Modern audio synchronizers operate by digitizing and writing the audio signal into a ring memory, which is most commonly a [[RAM]]-based memory having independent read and write ability. At the appropriate delay time (as conveyed by the DDO) after an audio sample (or group of samples) are written into the memory, the previously stored [[audio sample]] is read from the ring memory. The storage and reading of the audio samples take place continuously in response to the respective memory write and read addresses, which increment by 1 count for every write or read operation. For example, an audio sample would be written at address 1, a different sample read from (previously written) address 5, another sample is written at address 2, yet another read from 6, write at 3, read from 7 and so on. The delay between writing and reading a particular sample is 4 addresses which, when multiplied by the amount of time it takes to change from one address to the next, gives the total [[Delay (audio effect)|audio delay]].

===Tracking changes===
Unfortunately, video delays frequently make quick and large changes, for example, a jump in delay time from 2 seconds to 6 seconds is possible. To maintain proper audio-video sync, the audio delay must track these video delay changes. Changing the audio delay requires changing the difference between the write address and the read address. This change can be accomplished by causing either the write or read address to jump forward or backward, however, this jump causes some audio samples to repeat or be lost resulting in an unwanted and annoying pop, click, gap, distortion and/or noise in the audio signal. Some audio synchronizers operate by making repeated, very small jumps that cause unwanted (but less annoying) distortion and noise in the audio signal, rather than pops, gaps, and clicks. Other audio synchronizers change delay by changing the speed of the reading of audio from the ring memory. If audio samples are read out of the memory more slowly than they are written, the delay increases. If audio samples are read out faster than they are written the delay decreases. Using variable speed reading prevents pops, clicks, gaps, distortion and noise from being introduced into the audio, but does create unwanted and annoying pitch errors. For example, reading faster than writing causes the audio pitch to increase and reading slower than writing causes the pitch to decrease.

===Variable speed reading===
Audio synchronizers that use variable speed reading are generally preferred in professional applications. The control of audio delay is generally more accurate and more easily accomplished. Pitch errors in lower performance devices are uncompensated and kept to a level generally not perceived by the average viewer, by limiting the amount of change of reading speed. Typically the change limit is in the order of 0.2%. Unfortunately, this limits the rate of delay change and when large video delay changes occur the slow tracking rate of these uncompensated synchronizers can cause the audio-video sync to be off for several seconds or minutes until the audio delay catches up with the video delay. Additionally, listeners with excellent pitch perception may notice and be annoyed by even these small pitch errors.

===Pitch correction circuit===
In higher performance audio synchronizers, the rate of delay change is allowed to be much faster, generally in the order of 25%, and the resulting pitch error is corrected with a pitch correction circuit. The pitch correction circuitry is frequently a proprietary design, due to the difficulty in performing correction so the errors are imperceptible to critical listeners. These higher performance audio synchronizers allow the audio delay to track even large and quick video delay changes without generating any artifacts that are perceptible to even critical listeners for most audio program material.

===Recent developments===
Recent development in video processing devices permit those devices to sense when a large video delay change will need to be made beforehand and allow that change information to be communicated to the audio synchronizer. The "advanced notice" from the video processing device allows the audio synchronizer to anticipate and take advantage of particular audio material (e.g., periods of relative silence or periods without music) to facilitate making corresponding large audio delay changes that do not risk generating noticeable audio artifacts. Further developments permit handshaking between the video processing device and the audio synchronizer to control when the video delay change is made to optimize the timing of the tracking audio delay change thereby further reducing the risk of generating noticeable audio artifacts and at the same time reducing the risk of missynchronization due to rapid video delay changes.

'''Bisects and splits''' refer to [[postage stamp]]s that have been cut in part, most commonly in half, but also other fractions, and postally used for the proportionate value of the entire stamp, such as a two cent stamp cut in half and used as a one cent stamp.&lt;ref&gt;L. N. Williams, ''Fundamentals of Philately'', Pennsylvania (rev. ed. 1990), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; When stocks of a certain [[Postage stamp|stamp]] ran out, postmasters sometimes resorted to cutting higher denominated stamps in half, vertically or diagonally, thus obtaining two "stamps" each representing half of the original monetary value, or "face" value, of the uncut stamp. The general public also resorted to this practice, sometimes pursuant to official or tacit permission and sometimes without any express authorization.

Many of these instances have been well documented in postal history. One example is the bisects of the Island of [[Guernsey]] during the German military [[occupation of the Channel Islands]] during [[World War II]].  Early Mexican stamps are known to have been used cut in [[Postage stamps and postal history of Mexico#Bisects and splits|half, three-quarters, quarters and even eighths.]]&lt;ref&gt;James H. Beal et al., Mexico, in James M. Chemi, ''The Yucatan Affair'', Pennsylvania, 1980 (2d. printing), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many bisects and splits are considerably more valuable than the stamps from which they were made. These, however, only have [[philatelic]] value when the cut portion is still affixed to the envelope or a piece showing the postmarks, as otherwise it cannot be confirmed that the stamp was in fact postally used as a split and not simply a complete stamp that was cut up after use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/tips_20070611/refreshercourse.aspx|title=Klug, Janet; ''More tips for when to soak a stamp and when to save a cover intact'' in Linns.com Refresher Course section }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''breech-loading swivel gun''' was a particular type of [[swivel gun]] and a small [[breech-loading cannon]] invented in the 14th century. It was equipped with a [[swivel]] for easy rotation and was loaded by inserting a mug-shaped device called a chamber, filled with gunpowder and projectiles. It had a high rate of fire, as several chambers could be prepared in advance and quickly fired in succession and was especially effective in [[anti-personnel]] roles. It was used for centuries by many countries of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Breech loading swivel gun with mug and wedge.jpg|thumb|left|Breech-loading swivel gun with mug-shaped chamber, and wedge to hold it in place.]]
Although [[breech-loading]] is often considered a modern innovation which facilitated the loading of cannons,&lt;ref name="Turnbull, p. 105"&gt;Turnbull, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; breech-loading swivel guns were invented in the 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fggBGcbQDsQC&amp;pg=PA105 ''Samurai - The World of the Warrior'' Stephen Turnbull p. 105]&lt;/ref&gt; and used worldwide from the 16th century onward by numerous countries, many of them non-European. They have been called by many names, sometimes "Murderer" in English, "Perrier à boîte" in French, "Berços" in Portuguese, "Versos" in Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;''Spanish Galleon 1530-1690 by Angus Konstam p.15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6ApBsCi1FnMC&amp;pg=PA15]''&lt;/ref&gt; "Stangenbüchse" in German, "Folangji" ("佛朗机炮/佛朗機砲, [[Franks|Frankish]] gun") in Chinese, "Bulang-kipo" ("불랑기포[佛郞機砲]") in Korean,&lt;ref&gt;[[:ko:불랑기포]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Furanki" (仏郎機砲, "Frankish gun") or 子砲 ("Child cannon") in Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fggBGcbQDsQC&amp;pg=PA106 ''Samurai - The World of the Warrior'' Stephen Turnbull p. 106]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Musée de l'Armée, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Cetbang" in Javanese.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dr. J.L.A. Brandes, T.B.G., LII (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were used until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Musée de l'Armée, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breech-loading swivel guns were developed surprisingly early, and were used from 1336 onward.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The guns were loaded with [[mug]]-shaped chambers, in which gunpowder and projectile had been filled in advance. The chamber was then put in place, blocked with a wedge, and then fired. As the loading was made in advance and separately, breech-loading swivel guns were quick-firing guns for their time.&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; An early description of a breech-loading swivel gun puts the weight of the gun at {{convert|118|kg}}, equipped with three chambers for rotations, each {{convert|18|kg}} in weight, and firing a {{convert|280|g}} [[lead]] shot.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The guns had a disadvantage: they leaked and lost power around the chambers, but this was compensated by the high rate of fire as multiple chambers could be prepared in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull p. 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; Breech-loading swivel gun could fire either cannonballs against obstacles, or [[grapeshot]] against troops.&lt;ref&gt;''Firearms: a global history to 1700'' by Kenneth Warren Chase p.143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=esnWJkYRCJ4C&amp;pg=PA143]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ming_bronze_cannon.JPG|thumb|A [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] [[bronze]] cannon with open breech.]]
During the Middle-Ages, breech-loading swivel guns were developed by the Europeans also partly as a cheaper alternative to the very expensive [[bronze]] cast [[muzzle-loading]] cannons, as bronze was many times more expensive than iron. As cast iron was not yet technologically feasible for the Europeans, the only possibility was to use [[wrought iron]] bars hammered together and held with hoops like barrels. With this method, a one piece design was very difficult, and a fragmental structure, with separated chamber and barrel was then selected.&lt;ref&gt;''Firearms: a global history to 1700'' by Kenneth Warren Chase p.143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=esnWJkYRCJ4C&amp;pg=PA143]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tudor Warships (1): Henry VIII's Navy'' Angus Konstam p.34 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YKqsjKHwQ-8C&amp;pg=PA34]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Breech loading swivel cannon Munich 1632.jpg|thumb|left|Breech-loading swivel cannon, left by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] at [[Munich]], 1632.]]
Around 1500, Europeans learnt how to cast iron, and shifted their cannon productions to one-piece iron muzzle-loaders. China started to adopt European breech-loading swivel guns from 1500 onward, limiting at the same time the production of their own muzzle-loaders, because of the high effectiveness of the breech-loading swivel gun as an [[anti-personnel]] gun, which to them was more interesting than the sheer power of a cannonball.&lt;ref&gt;''Firearms: a global history to 1700'' by Kenneth Warren Chase p.143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=esnWJkYRCJ4C&amp;pg=PA143]&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the breech-loading swivel gun continued in Europe however, with, as early as the 17th century, characteristics very similar to the modern [[machine-gun]] or [[mitrailleuse]].&lt;ref&gt;HISTORY AND DESCRIPTIVE GUIDE OF THE U.S. NAVY YARD, WASHINGTON COMPILED BY F.

Breech-loading swivel guns were used to advantage at the bow and stern on [[warships]], but were also used in fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Breech loading cannons were used in [[Majapahit]] conquest (1336-1350). Prior to this, the Javanese acquired firearm technology from [[Mongol invasion of Java|1293 Mongol invasion]]. The cannon is called [[Cetbang]] and can be configured as stationary gun or swivel gun, mounted on various vessels of Majapahit navy. At that time soldiers of other kingdoms in the Nusantaran archipelago fought using melee weapons in an elevated platform in their ships called ''Balai''. This new weapon proved very effective, and Majapahit is able to conquer the archipelago in only 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bullet|last=Apoorv shelke, Kalpesh Khatavkar, Nikhil Rane &amp; Paresh Patil|first=|publisher=PediaPress|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China and Japan, breech-loading swivel guns were brought after China defeated the Portuguese in the 16th century. At the [[Battle of Xicaowan]] in 1522, after defeating the Portuguese in battle, the Chinese captured Portuguese breech-loading swivel guns and then reverse engineered them, calling them "Folangji" (佛郎機 ([[Franks#Legacy|Frankish]]) guns, since the Portuguese were called "[[Folangji]]" by the Chinese. A shipwreck in 1523 apparently brought the gun to China, but the transmission may have occurred earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DK2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=DK|title=Weapon: A Visual History of Arms and Armor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Px5E3EIF5jQC&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2 October 2006|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-0-7566-4219-8|pages=100–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, [[Ōtomo Sōrin]] seems to have been the first recipient of the guns, possibly as early as 1551. In 1561 the Portuguese, allied with Otomo in the [[Siege of Moji]], bombarded rival Japanese position, possibly with swivel guns.&lt;ref name="Turnbull, p. 105"/&gt; In the [[Battle of Takajō]] in 1587, Ōtomo Sōrin used two swivel guns obtained from the Portuguese. The guns were nicknamed {{nihongo|''Kunikuzushi''|国崩し|"Destroyer of Provinces"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later portions of the Ming dynasty (mid 16th century onward) it appears that these type of guns were the most common and numerous type of artillery used by the Ming forces. a great deal of variation of such cannons were produced, and it appeared in pretty much all of the conflicts of this time, including the [[Imjin War]]. Until the introduction of heavy Dutch cannons in the early 17th century, there were even attempts by the Ming to make large heavy versions of such guns.

Other countries also used swivel guns. In [[Bali]], such a gun was found in the possession of the Raja of [[Badung]], and is now located in the [[Bali Museum]]. Numerous such guns were also used in [[Northern Africa]] by Algerian rebels in their resistance to French forces.&lt;ref&gt;Musée de l'Armée, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breech-loading swivel guns were also used extensively in [[Southeast Asia]] as early as the 16th century, apparently even before the arrival of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] there, and continued to be in use as a preferred anti-personnel weapon as late as the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Southeast Asia: a historical encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East ..., Volume 1'' by Keat Gin Ooi p.505 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA505]&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans fought ''[[Moros (Philippines)|Moros]]'' equipped with breech-loading swivel guns in [[the Philippines]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''Southeast Asia: a historical encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East ..., Volume 1'' by Keat Gin Ooi p.505 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA505]&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel [[rifled]] breech-loading swivel guns are known which were manufactured by the [[United States]] towards the end of the 19th century, and used in colonial theaters such as in [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Musée de l'Armée]] exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzzword compliance is a modern version of the old practice of being ''checkbox compliant'', ensuring that a product has all the features listed in product [[review]]s. Since many of the decision-makers regarding technology purchases may only be semi-literate technically, the use of [[buzzword]]s makes a product sound more valuable. Among the technically literate, the phrase is sometimes used in a sardonic way, as in: "I have no idea what it does, but it sure is buzzword compliant", implying that perhaps the effort on the product has gone into marketing and public relations rather than the technology.

Technical staff, and those involved in recruiting and hiring them, also speak of a [[résumé]] or [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] being "buzzword compliant" when it contains a large number of such terms.	This can be a matter of some practical importance to a job-seeker.	In many large organizations, those who receive and evaluate applications for employment will not be familiar with the domain of the job, and therefore can only assess buzzword compliance with the job description when deciding which applications the [[Human resource management|hiring manager]] will see.

In 2018. David C. Hay published a comprehensive book addressing the problems of language within the data architecture field.  It addresses both conceptual (business-oriented) and technology modeling.  It includes an extensive glossary and bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Achieving Buzzword Compliance: Data Architecture Language and Vocabulary.|last=Hay|first=David|publisher=Technics Publications|year=2018|isbn=|location=New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''Chagatai'' relates to the [[Chagatai Khanate]] (1225 –1680s), a descendant empire of the [[Mongol Empire]] left to [[Genghis Khan]]'s second son, [[Chagatai Khan]].&lt;ref name="BabakVaisman2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vladimir Babak|author2=Demian Vaisman|author3=Aryeh Wasserman|title=Political Organization in Central Asia and Azerbijan: Sources and Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a9SPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA343#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=23 November 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-77681-7|pages=343–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[Chagatai Khan#Chagatai Turks|Chagatai Turk]]s and [[Tatars]], who were the speakers of this language, claimed descent from Chagatai Khan.

==History==
[[File:Folio from an album, Mir Ali Shir Nawa I, calligrapher, Afghanistan, Herat, late 15th century AD, Chagatai Turkish text in Nastaliq script, ink, gold, color on paper, decoupage - Cincinnati Art Museum - DSC04236.JPG|thumb|right|Late 15th century Chagatai Turkish text in Nastaliq script.]]
Chagatai belongs to the [[Karluk languages|Karluk branch]] of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]]. It is descended from the [[Old Turkic language]] that served as a [[lingua franca]] in Central Asia, with a strong infusion of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] words and turns of phrase. Its literary form was based on two earlier literary [[Middle Turkic languages]], Karakhanid and [[Khorezmian language (Turkic)|Khorezmian]]. It can be divided into three periods:

# Pre-classical Chagatai (1400&amp;ndash;1465)
# Classical Chagatai (1465&amp;ndash;1600)
# Post-classical Chagatai (1600&amp;ndash;1921)

The first period is a transitional phase characterized by the retention of archaic forms; the second phase starts with the publication of Ali-Shir Nava'i's first Divan and is the highpoint of Chagatai literature, followed by the third phase, which is characterized by two bifurcating developments. One is the preservation of the classical Chagatai language of Nava'i, the other trend is the increasing influence of the dialects of the local spoken languages.

The Chagatai Turkic language lived its heyday under the [[Timurid dynasty]]. Chagatai remained the universal literary language of Central Asia until the Soviet reforms of the early 20th century, and had a marked influence on the development of the [[Hindustani language]].

==Influence on later Turkic languages==

[[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] are the two modern languages most closely related to Chagatai. Uzbeks regard Chagatai as the origin of their own language and claim Chagatai literature as their own. In 1921 in [[Uzbekistan]], then a part of the [[Soviet Union]], Chagatai was replaced by a literary language based on a local Uzbek dialect. The so-called [[Berendei]], a 12th-century nomadic Turkic people possibly related to the Cumans, seem also to have spoken Chagatai.

''[[Ethnologue]]'' records the use of the word "Chagatai" in [[Afghanistan]] to describe the "Tekke" dialect of [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]].  Up to and including the eighteenth century, Chagatai was the main literary language in [[Turkmenistan]] as elsewhere in Central Asia. While it had some influence on Turkmen, the two languages belong to different branches of the Turkic language family.

==Literature==
The most famous of the Chagatai poets is Ali-Shir Nava'i, who – among his other works – wrote ''[[Muhakamat al-Lughatayn]]'', a detailed comparison of the Chagatai and Persian languages, in which he argued for the superiority of the former. His fame is attested by the fact that Chagatai is sometimes called "Nava'i's language". Among prose works, [[Timur]]'s biography is written in Chagatai Turkic, as is  the famous ''[[Baburnama]]'' (or ''Tuska Babure'') of [[Babur]], the Timurid founder of  the [[Mughal Empire]].

Important works continued to be written in the Chagatai language into the early twentieth century. Among them are [[Musa Sayrami]]'s ''Tārīkh-i amniyya'' (completed 1903) and its revised version ''Tārīkh-i ḥamīdi'' (completed 1908), representing the best sources on the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)]] in [[Xinjiang]].&lt;ref name=pref&gt;[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/M.Asien/XX/1900-1920/Sairami/pred.htm МОЛЛА МУСА САЙРАМИ: ТА'РИХ-И АМНИЙА] (Mulla Musa Sayrami's ''Tarikh-i amniyya'': Preface)], in: "Материалы по истории казахских ханств XV&amp;ndash;XVIII веков (Извлечения из персидских и тюркских сочинений)" (''Materials for the history of the Kazakh Khanates of the 15&amp;ndash;18th&amp;nbsp;cc.

The [[Qing dynasty]] commissioned dictionaries on the major languages of China which included Chagatai Turki, such as the [[Pentaglot Dictionary]].

Chagatai literature is still studied in modern Turkey and regarded as part of the Turkic heritage.

The Chagatai alphabet is based on the [[Perso-Arabic alphabet]] and known as ''Kona Yëziq'' (old script).

*'''Maintenance''' is the intermeddling of a disinterested party to encourage a [[lawsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Curzon, L.B. | title=Dictionary of Law | edition=6th | publisher=Longman | location=London | isbn=0-582-43809-8 | year=2002 | pages=260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is "A taking in hand, a bearing up or upholding of quarrels or sides, to the disturbance of the common right."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Coke|Coke]] (1641) ''Institutes''&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Champerty''' (from [[Old French]] ''[[champart]]'', a feudal lord's share of produce) is the "maintenance" of a person in a lawsuit on condition that the subject matter of the action is to be shared with the maintainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Curzon, L.B. | title=Dictionary of Law | edition=6th | publisher=Longman | location=London | isbn=0-582-43809-8 | year=2002 | pages=61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among laypersons, this is known as litigation finance.

In ''Giles v Thompson'' &lt;ref&gt;''Giles v Thompson'' [1993] 3 All ER 321 at 328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case details[http://swarb.co.uk/giles-v-thompson-ca-1992/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johan Steyn, Baron Steyn|Lord Justice Steyn]] declared: " In modern idiom maintenance is the support of litigation by a stranger without just cause. Champerty is an aggravated form of maintenance. The distinguishing feature of champerty is the support of litigation by a stranger in return for a share of the proceeds".

At common law, maintenance and champerty were both [[crime]]s and [[tort]]s, as was [[Barratry (common law)|barratry]] (the bringing of [[vexatious litigation]]). This is generally no longer so&lt;ref&gt;Part II of the UK Criminal Law Act 1967, available at &lt;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/part/II&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as, during the nineteenth century, the development of [[legal ethics]] tended to obviate the risks to the public, particularly after the scandal of the [[Swynfen will case]] (1856–1864).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Moral panic at the English Bar: Paternal vs. commercial ideologies of legal practice in the 1860s | author=Pue, W. W. | journal=Law and Social Inquiry | volume=15 | year=1990 | pages=49–118 | doi=10.1111/j.1747-4469.1990.tb00275.x | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the principles are relevant to modern [[contingent fee]] agreements between a [[lawyer]] and a client and to the [[Assignment (law)|assignment]] by a [[plaintiff]] of his rights in a lawsuit to someone with no connection to the case. Champertous contracts can still, depending on jurisdiction, be [[void (law)|void]] for [[Public policy (law)|public policy]] or attract [[legal liability|liability]] for [[Costs (law)|costs]].

==History==
The restrictions arose to combat abuses in [[medieval]] England. Unscrupulous [[Nobility|noble]]s and [[royal court|royal official]]s would lend their names to bolster the credibility of doubtful and [[fraud]]ulent claims in return for a share of the property recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking extrajudicially in the early seventeenth century, [[Edward Coke|Lord Chief Justice Coke]] described the origins of maintenance in this way:&lt;ref&gt;1 Coke Litt 368b, cited in Friston, M, Civil Costs Law and Practice (2nd ed), Jordans, {{ISBN|978-1846613128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Maintenance, ''manutenentia'', is derived from the verb ''manutenere'', and signifieth in law a taking in hand, bearing up, or upholding of quarrels and sides, to the disturbance or hindrance of common right.}}

The comments were made in context of the court previously having been anxious to prevent a wide range of maintenance; the phrase "maintenance" had been used to apply not just to those who gave support in civil claims, but also to those who sought to maintain robbers, heretics and even "a new sect coming from beyond the sea, clad in white garments".&lt;ref&gt;Friston, M, Civil Costs Law and Practice (2nd ed), Jordans, {{ISBN|978-1846613128}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judicial independence]] was gradually established, however, and by the early 19th century [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Works'' (Bowring (ed), 1843) vol 3, pp 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|A mischief, in those times it seems but too common, though a mischief not to be cured by such laws, was, that a man would buy a weak claim, in hopes that power might convert it into a strong one, and that the sword of a baron, stalking into court with a rabble of retainers at his heels, might strike terror into the eyes of a judge upon the bench. At present, what cares an English judge for the swords of a hundred barons? Neither fearing nor hoping, hating nor loving, the judge of our days is ready with equal phlegm to administer, upon all occasions, that system, whatever it be, of justice or injustice, which the law has put into his hands.}}

==By jurisdiction==

===Australia===
In Australia, champerty and maintenance as common law [[cause of action|causes of action]] (as either a [[crime]] or a [[tort]]) have mostly been abolished by statute. 
In [[New South Wales]], champerty and maintenance were abolished by the ''[[Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993]]''.&lt;ref name=austlii_NSWConsolidatedActs_MCaBAA1993&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/mcabaa1993408/| title=MAINTENANCE, CHAMPERTY AND BARRATRY ABOLITION ACT 1993| date=| accessdate=2008-12-22| publisher=www.austlii.edu.au [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]]| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531162057/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/mcabaa1993408/| archive-date=31 May 2008| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], champerty and maintenance was abolished as a tort by section 32 of the ''[[Wrongs Act 1958]]''.&lt;ref name=auslii_VicConsolidatedActs_WrongsAct1958_s32&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/wa1958111/s32.html| title=WRONGS ACT 1958| date =| accessdate = 2008-12-22| publisher=www.austlii.edu.au [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a crime by section 332A of the ''[[Crimes Act 1958]]''&lt;ref name=auslii_VicConsolidatedActs_CrimesAct1958_s332A&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca195882/s322a.html| title=Crimes Act 1958 - SECT 322A| date =| accessdate = 2008-12-22| publisher=www.austlii.edu.au [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the common law crimes of champerty and maintenance were abolished, alongside all remaining common law offences except contempt of court, by the 1953 consolidation of the Criminal Code. However, champerty and maintenance remain torts in some Canadian jurisdictions.

In [[Ontario]], champertous agreements are invalid under the Champerty Act, [[Revised Statutes of Ontario|RSO]] 1897, c. 327.

===England and Wales===
Maintenance and champerty have not been crimes or torts since the passing of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Law Act 1967]], ss.13-14&lt;/ref&gt; though [[embracery]] was a crime until the [[Bribery Act 2010]]. However, the 1967 Act stated:

{{quotation | The abolition of criminal and civil liability under the law of England and Wales for maintenance and champerty shall not affect any rule of that law as to the cases in which a [[contract]] is to be treated as contrary to [[public policy (law)|public policy]] or otherwise [[illegal agreement|illegal]]. | section 14(2) }}

There are circumstances in which a non-party who funds litigation can be liable for [[costs (English law)|costs]], if the action fails.&lt;ref&gt;[[Superior Courts Act 1981]], s.51(1) and (3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Aiden Shipping Co Ltd v. Interbulk Ltd'' [1986] AC 965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/655.html Arkin v Bouchard Lines]'' [2005] EWCA Civ 655&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in ''[[Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1998] Ch 170&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal reincarnated the tort against the assignment of a [[wrongful trading]] claim by a liquidator to a specialist litigation company to pursuing directors for wrongful trading. This has come under criticism given that claims against directors are enforced sub-optimally as company liquidators, typically accountants, are cautious to take on risks rather than save as much of the company as possible.

===UK Criminal/Civil Law===
The common law was amended by two acts of law, the [[Serious Crime Act 2007|Serious Crimes act 2007]] section 44 to section 46. The act replaces the common law crime of [[incitement]] with a statutory offence of [[encouraging or assisting crime]]. While at common law there is still perverting and tending to [[Perverting the course of justice|pervert the course of public justice]], and [[Malicious prosecution|malicious prosecutions]], which is [[abuse of process]] laws.
The [[Criminal Justice Act 1967|Criminal justice act 1967]] at [https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/5 section 5] regulated concealments and giving false information.
 The law recognises fundamental dishonesty, and dishonesty, the matters in law, relates to the "Cause" The term “fundamental dishonesty” was first coined in the April 2013 amendments to the CPR, The CJC recommended that the definition in Brighton &amp; Hove Bus &amp; Coach Co Ltd -v- Brooks [2011] EWHC 2504 (Admin) should form the basis of any definition of fraud to be used in removing claims (even if partly valid due to [[Parity (law)|parity]]) from an unsuccessful claimant. 
On the basis which is well known in relation to Fraud:
 the fraud must be pleaded by the defendant;
 statements and representations must have been made that were false;
 that were likely to interfere with the course of justice in some material respect; and
 at the time they were made the maker had no honest belief in their truth and knew they were likely to interfere with the course of justice.
The CJC explicitly rejected the suggestion that anything short of fraud, such as exaggerations or [[Cognitive bias mitigation|perception of a truth]].
( see lord Denning in Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley: CA QB 702, [1956] 1 All ER 341)

In Law [[Common purpose]] or joint enterprise is a liability of those aiding, paying, planning and partaking in the crime or wrong.
The Observance of due process 1368  said " ''eschew the Mischiefs and Damages done to divers of his Commons by false Accusers, which oftentimes have made their Accusations more for Revenge and singular Benefit, than for the Profit of the King, or of his People, which accused Persons''..." 
Therefore the crime exists where the course of justice is perverted that there was no [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] and that the others supporting them knew that the claim was false and had concealed this facts and aided in the perversion itself. Due to "old law" the crime extended to solicitors, prosecutors and police as well as the private individuals and witnesses. which will and can fall also as [[Perjury]].
'''To Champion''' a cause which is known to be unlawful false and a abuse, is Champerty and Maintenance. maintenance is not only monies (funding), but in the loss to others from the venture.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, champerty and maintenance were long thought to be obsolete both as a crime and a tort, but these two principles have been revived in recent years in response to the prevalence of recovery agents which present problems quite different from the mischief which historically these rules intended to combat.

The recovery agents typically perform "ambulance chasing" on accident victims, offering to arrange lawyers to handle their claims on a "no win no fee" basis. If the claim succeeds the recovery agents share a portion of the damages. This is seen as deception on uneducated victims who are ignorant to the availability of legal aid. The division of the damages in effect deprives the victims of the just compensation that they are entitled to for their bodily injury. The intermeddling of recovery agents in the lawsuit also presents ethical problems to lawyers, who may have undermined impartiality in advising on settlement. In response, the Department of Justice and the Law Society of Hong Kong carried out a massive publicity campaign aiming at educating the public to refuse recovery agents, citing that maintenance and champerty are criminal offences under the laws of Hong Kong.

In 2008, 21 people were arrested for champerty, maintenance and conspiracy. They were recovery agents "helping" accident victims on a "no win no fee" basis. One of the people arrested was a lawyer. Champerty and maintenance carries a sentence of up to seven years in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/080708/html/080708en08004.htm Caution issued on recovery agents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121093407/http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/080708/html/080708en08004.htm |date=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mingpaonews.com/20080709/gca2.htm 包攬訴訟屬刑事可判囚]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2009, Winnie Lo Wai Yan, a solicitor, was convicted for conspiracy to maintain and a recovery agent was convicted for conspiracy to champer. She was found to have agreed to share 25% from the damages paid to the next friend of an 18-year-old traffic accident victim who suffered from permanent total loss of earning capacity. On 10 July 2009, Lo was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment and the recovery agent was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment (Case number: DCCC 610/2008). Lo appealed in the same year and on 3 December 2010, her appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Case number: CACC 254/2009).

On 30 January 2012, Lo's conviction was quashed in the Court of Final Appeal (Case number: FACC 2/2011). The Reasons for Judgment, published on 23 February 2012, stated that there is a serious problem with the finding made and endorsed by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal respectively that Lo knew that there had been champerty involved. Although the judge found maintenance and champerty are constitutional, he questioned whether criminal liability for maintenance should be retained in Hong Kong as liability for both maintenance and champerty were abolished in places such as England and South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk/lrs/common/ju/ju_frame.jsp?DIS=80458|title=Judgment|work=judiciary.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2013, Louie Mui Kwok-keung, a barrister, was sentenced in the District Court to 3.5 years of imprisonment. He pleaded not guilty on 18 February 2013, to five counts of champerty and maintenance, allegedly committed between 1999 and 2008. He was the first barrister in the city to be convicted of such crimes (Case number: DCCC 890/2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1200505/history-made-barrister-louie-mui-jailed-illegal-deals-clients|title=History made as barrister Louie Mui is jailed for illegal deals with clients|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The [[Maintenance and Embracery Act 1634]] passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland]] provides that "all statutes heretofore made in England concerning maintenance, champerty and [[embracery]], or any of them now standing and being in their full strength and force, shall be put in due execution in this realme of Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1634/act/15/enacted/en/html|title=Maintenance and Embracery Act, 1634|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act is still in force in the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="rte783117"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0420/783117-court-persona-digital-telephony/|title=Case against State, O'Brien, Lowry will be dropped|date=20 April 2016|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Persona, which lost to [[Esat Digifone]] in a 1997 telecoms bidding process [[Moriarty Tribunal#Volume II|criticised by the Moriarty Tribunal]], applied to launch a lawsuit against those involved in the 1997 bidding, to be funded by a UK company, Harbour Litigation Funding, in return for part of any damages awarded.&lt;ref name="rte783117" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rte743615"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2015/1118/743615-courts-esat/|title=Application for funding agreement in licence case|date=18 November 2015|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] ruled that such [[third-party funding]] constituted champerty prohibited by the 1634 act; Persona said it would have to drop the case, being unable to afford the [[Euro|€]]10m expenses.&lt;ref name="rte783117" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rte743615" /&gt;

===New Zealand===
Maintenance and champerty are torts, not crimes, under New Zealand law. Despite calls for their abolition, the [[New Zealand Law Commission]] recommended their preservation in a 2001 report titled ''Subsidising Litigation''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/UploadFiles/Publications/Publication_79_174_R72.pdf Subsidising Litigation]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', pages 2 and 11. Wellington: [[New Zealand Law Commission]]. {{ISBN|1-877187-72-0}}. Published 30 April 2001. Accessed 28 May 2009. Also published as New Zealand Parliamentary Paper E 3172.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
This concept exists in American jurisprudence but disdained by "fans of entrepreneurial lawyering in the academy and elsewhere".&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vegasinc.com/news/2011/jun/14/judge-rules-righthaven-lacks-standing-sue-threaten |title=Judge rules Righthaven lacks standing to sue, threatens sanctions over misrepresentations |first=Steve |last=Green |publisher=Vegas Inc |date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been recent common usage of the term in the media in [[Nevada]]&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt; and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/0/2003/2003-ohio-2721.pdf Rancman v. Interim Settlement Funding Corp., 99 Ohio St.3d 121, 2003-Ohio-2721.]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[NAACP v. Button]]'' laws that overburden free speech rights in the name of preventing champerty were found to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Courts in Florida have found that the causes of action for maintenance and champerty are no longer viable in Florida, but have been superseded by laws related to abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and wrongful initiation of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., ''Hardick v. Homol'', 795 So.2d 1107 (Fla. 5th DCA 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Florida courts have held that champerty and maintenance may continue to exist as affirmative defenses, but only as to the enforceability of the champertous contract itself.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., ''Malibu Media LLC v. Zumbo'', 2014 WL 2742830 (M.D. Fla. 2014) (not reported in F.Supp.3d).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''facility condition index''' (FCI) is used in [[facilities management]] to provide a benchmark to compare the relative condition of a group of facilities.  The FCI is primarily used to support asset management initiatives of federal, state, and local government facilities organizations.  This would also include universities, housing and transportation authorities, and primary and secondary school systems.

Mathematically the FCI is represented as

       Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement Deficiencies of the Facility(-ies)
 FCI = -----------------------------------------------------------------------
           Current Replacement Value of the Facility(-ies)

The FCI as a tool was first published in 1991 by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO).&lt;ref name=nacubo&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Applied Management Engineering]] (AME) was approached by a research group working on a project that was sponsored by [http://www.nacubo.org NACUBO]. The group asked for a written description of the facility condition assessment process, and related data analysis.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The resulting written process and analysis served as the basis for the book.&lt;ref name=nacubo/&gt;

Two of the AME employees that contributed were William H. (Bill) Thomas and the late Emmett Richardson.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Both had previously worked for the [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] (NAVFAC), which is the U.S. Navy's facilities engineering [[Systems command|Systems Command]].  Thomas and Richardson had calculated the FCI for budget preparation and used the ratio to allocate operations and maintenance money across naval activities and installations.  The FCI was a strictly informal tool that Thomas and Richardson used while working for the Navy.  It was developed and adopted as an industry benchmark by AME.

==Application==
To calculate an FCI a facility manager needs to quantify the cost of maintenance, repair and replacement deficiencies.  This is typically the outcome of a [[Facility Condition Assessment]].  The current replacement value is defined as what monetary value the organization places on the facility.

The FCI is a relative indicator of condition, and should be tracked over time to maximize its benefit.  It is advantageous to define condition ratings based on ranges of the FCI. ''Managing the Facilities Portfolio'' provided a set of ratings: good (under 0.05), fair (0.05 to 0.10), and poor (over 0.10) based on evaluating data from various clients at the time of the publication.

Today, many organizations are determining an appropriate FCI range for these ratings based upon their mission and strategic goals. The Higher Education Facilities Officers, APPA, use the FCI as part of their Strategic Assessment Model, and as a key Facilities Performance Indicator. Recommendation #6 in the National Research Council publication entitled "Stewardship of Federal Facilities states that performance indicators should be used to evaulate the effectiveness of facilities maintenance and repair programs. The American Public Works Association publication, Special Report #62, describes the use and value of facility condition rating systems in Chapter 3.6.

Within the US Federal Government, the "condition index" (CI) is a general measure of the constructed asset’s condition at a specific
point in time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/frpc Federal Real Property Council]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the US Federal Government, CI is calculated using the same formula of the ratio of Repair Needs to Plant Replacement Value (PRV) but results are presented as a percentage where higher values mean better conditions.  "Repair Needs" is the amount necessary to ensure that a constructed asset (i.e. building or structure) is restored to a condition substantially equivalent to the originally intended and designed capacity, efficiency, or capability. "Plant Replacement Value" (or "Functional Replacement Value") is the cost of replacing an existing building or structure at today’s standards.

The FCI can be used in the development and usage of [[Building Information Modeling]] for existing buildings. It is anticipated that future BIM will adhere to the format set forth by the [[Construction Specifications Institute]].

'''Filip Shiroka''' (1859&amp;ndash;1935) was a classical [[Rilindja]] ({{lang-sq|Renaissance}}) [[poet]] whose verse was first to become known in later years.

He was born and raised in [[Shkodër]] and educated there by the [[Franciscan]]s.&lt;ref name="Fajtori"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Fajtori.com| language=Albanian |accessdate=2013-10-07| url= http://www.letersia.fajtori.com/Letersi/E_Rilindjes/Filip_Shiroka/|title=Hyrje|trans-title=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his teachers was poet [[Leonardo De Martino]] (1830-1923), whose influence is omnipresent in Shiroka's verse. His earliest verse publication, ''All'Albania, all'armi, all'armi!'' ("To [[Albania]], to arms, to arms!"), was a nationalist poem on the defense of [[Ulcinj]], which was written in [[Italian language|Italian]] and printed in the [[Osservatore Cattolico]] (''Catholic Observer'') of [[Milan]] in 1878.  Like many Albanian intellectuals of the late 19th century, Shiroka spent much of his life in exile. In 1880, after the defeat of the [[League of Prizren]], he emigrated to the [[Middle East]], and settled in [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] where he worked as an engineer in [[railway]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Elsie|Elsie, Robert]].  [http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors_classical/shiroka.html "Filip Shiroka"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805123356/http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors_classical/shiroka.html |date=5 August 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shiroka became a member of a society named Vëllazëria Shqiptare (Albanian brotherhood) that was founded in Cairo during 1894 by Albanian expatriates.&lt;ref name="Skendi152"/&gt;

Shiroka's [[nationalist]], satirical and meditative verse in Albanian was written mostly from 1896 to 1903. It appeared in journals such as [[Faik Konitza]]'s ''Albania'', the Albanian periodicals published in Egypt, and the Shkodër religious monthly ''Elçija i Zemers t'Jezu Krisctit'' ("The Messenger of the Sacred Heart"). Shiroka, who also used the [[pseudonym]]s Gegë Postripa&lt;ref name="Skendi152"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&amp;ots=zGjQbVyql8&amp;sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Filip%20Shiroka&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=152.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ulqinaku, is the author of at least sixty poems, three short stories, articles and several translations, in particular of religious works for Catholic [[liturgy]]. His verse collection, ''Zâni i zêmrës'', Tirana, 1933, ("The voice of the heart"), which was composed at the turn of the century, was published by Ndoc Nikaj two years before Shiroka's death in [[Beirut]].&lt;ref name="Fajtori"/&gt;

Shiroka's verse, inspired by early-19th-century French and Italian romantic poets such as [[Alfred de Musset]] (1810-1857), [[Alfonse de Lamartine]] (1790-1869), and [[Tommaso Grossi]] (1790-1853), whom he had read as a young man in Shkodër, does not cover any unusual thematic or [[Word|lexical]] range, nor is it all of literary quality, though the latter assertion is no doubt valid for most Rilindja poets. Shiroka is remembered as a deeply emotional lyricist, and as one of linguistic purity, who was obsessed with his own fate and that of his distant homeland. Recurrent in his work, there is the theme of nostalgia for the country of his birth.

'''Be off, swallow'''&lt;br/&gt;
Farewell, for spring has come,&lt;br/&gt;
Be off, swallow, on your flight,&lt;br/&gt;
From Egypt to other lands,&lt;br/&gt;
Searching over hill and plain&lt;br/&gt;
Be off to Albania on your flight,&lt;br/&gt;
Off to Shkodër, my native town!

Convey my greetings&lt;br/&gt;
To the old house where I was born,&lt;br/&gt;
And greet the lands around it&lt;br/&gt;
Where I spent my early years;&lt;br/&gt;
Be off thither on your flight,&lt;br/&gt;
And greet my native town!

...

And when you come to Fush' e Rmajit,&lt;br/&gt;
Swallow, stop there and take your rest;&lt;br/&gt;
In that land of sorrow are the graves&lt;br/&gt;
Of the mother and father who raised me;&lt;br/&gt;
Weep in your exquisite voice&lt;br/&gt;
And lament them with your song!

For ages I have not been to Albania&lt;br/&gt;
To attend those graves;&lt;br/&gt;
You, swallow, robed in black,&lt;br/&gt;
Weep there on my behalf,&lt;br/&gt;
With that exquisite voice of yours&lt;br/&gt;
Lament them with your song!

[[File:Wikitongues Pablo speaking Garifuna.mp3|thumb|right|Recording of a Garifuna speaker]]
'''Garifuna''' (Karif) is a minority language widely spoken in villages of [[Garifuna people]] in the western part of the northern coast of [[Central America]].

It is a member of the [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] language family but an atypical one since it is spoken outside the Arawakan language area, which is otherwise now confined to the northern parts of South America, and because it contains an unusually high number of [[loanword]]s, from both [[Carib languages]] and a number of [[European languages]] because of an extremely tumultuous past involving warfare, migration and colonization.

The language was once confined to the Antillean islands of [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] and [[Dominica]], but its speakers, the Garifuna people, were deported en masse by the British in 1797 to the north coast of [[Honduras]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dreyfus-Gamelon|first1=Simone|title=Et Christophe Colomb vint...|journal=Ethnies|date=1993|volume=Chroniques d'une conquête|issue= 14|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where the language and Garifuna people have since spread along the coast south to Nicaragua and north to [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]].

Parts of Garifuna vocabulary are split between men's speech and women's speech, and some concepts have two words to express them, one for women and one for men. Moreover, the terms used by men are generally loanwords from Carib while those used by women are [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]].

The Garifuna language was declared a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] in 2008 along with [[Garifuna music]] and dance.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00001 |title=Language, dance and music of the Garifuna |date=2008 |work=unesco.org |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
Garifuna is spoken in [[Central America]], especially in [[Honduras]] (146,000 speakers),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} but also in [[Guatemala]] (20,000 speakers), [[Belize]] (14,100 speakers), [[Nicaragua]] (2,600 speakers), and the [[US]], particularly in [[New York City]], where it is spoken in [[Queens]], [[Brooklyn]] and the [[Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

== History{{anchor|History}} ==
The Garinagu (singular ''Garifuna'') are a mix of West/Central African, [[Arawaks|Arawak]], and [[Island Caribs|Carib]] ancestry. Though they were captives removed from their homelands, these people were never documented as slaves. The two prevailing theories are that they were the survivors of two recorded shipwrecks or they somehow took over the ship on which they came. The more Western and Central African-looking people were transferred by the British from Saint Vincent to islands in the [[Bay of Honduras]] in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, M. H. 1997, [http://www2.ku.edu/~lba/courses/articles/Crawford%20Carib.pdf Biocultural adaptation to disease in the Caribbean: Case study of a migrant population] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105001105/http://www2.ku.edu/~lba/courses/articles/Crawford%20Carib.pdf |date=November 5, 2012 }}. ''Journal of Caribbean Studies''. Health and Disease in the Caribbean. 12(1): 141–155.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Their linguistic ancestors, [[Island Caribs|Carib people]], who gave their name to the Caribbean, once lived throughout the [[Lesser Antilles]], and although their language is now [[extinct language|extinct]] there, ethnic Caribs still live on [[Dominica]], [[Trinidad]], [[Saint Lucia]], and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]. The Caribs had conquered the previous population of the islands, [[Maipurean languages|Arawakan peoples]] like the [[Taíno people|Taino]] and [[Palikur people]]s. During the conquest, which was conducted primarily by men, the Carib married Arawakan women. Children were raised by their mothers speaking Arawak, but as boys came of age, their fathers taught them [[Carib language|Carib]], a language still spoken in mainland South America. When European [[missionaries]] described the Island Carib people in the 17th century, they recorded two unrelated languages: Carib spoken by the men and Arawak spoken by the women. However, while the boys acquired Carib vocabulary, after a few generations, they retained the Arawakan grammar of their first language. Thus, [[Island Carib language|Island Carib]], as spoken by men, was genetically either a [[mixed language]] or a [[relexification|relexified]] language. Over the generations, men substituted fewer Arawak words, and many Carib words diffused to the women so the amount of distinctly male vocabulary diminished until both genders spoke Arawak, with an infusion of Carib vocabulary and distinct words in only a handful of cases.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Vocabulary ==
The vocabulary of Garifuna is composed as follows:
*45% Arawak (Igneri)
*25% Carib (Kallínagu)
*15% French
*10% [[English language|English]]
*5% [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or English technical terms

Also, there also some few words from [[African languages]].

===Gender differences===
Relatively few examples of [[diglossia]] remain in common speech, and men and women use different words for the same concept such as ''{{lang|cab|au ~ nugía}}'' for the pronoun "I". Most such words are rare and often dropped by men. For example, there are distinct Carib and Arawak words for 'man' and 'women', four words altogether, but in practice, the generic term ''{{lang|cab|mútu}}'' "person" is used by both men and women and for both men and women, with grammatical gender agreement on a verb, adjective, or demonstrative, distinguishing whether ''{{lang|cab|mútu}}'' refers to a man or to a woman (''{{lang|cab|mútu lé}}'' "the man", ''{{lang|cab|mútu tó}}'' "the woman").

There remains, however, a diglossic distinction in the [[grammatical gender]] of many inanimate nouns, with abstract words generally being considered grammatically feminine by men and grammatically masculine by women. Thus, the word ''{{lang|cab|wéyu}}'' may mean either concrete "sun" or abstract "day"; with the meaning of "day", most men use feminine agreement, at least in conservative speech, while women use masculine agreement. The equivalent of the abstract [[impersonal pronoun]] in phrases like "it is necessary" is also masculine for women but feminine in conservative male speech.

== Grammar ==
=== Personal pronouns ===
With independent [[personal pronoun]]s, Garifuna distinguishes [[grammatical gender]]:

{| border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4"
|
! singular, male speaker
! singular, female speaker
! plural
|-
! 1st person
| ''au''
| ''nugía''
| ''wagía''
|-
! 2nd person
| ''amürü''
| ''bugía''
| ''hugía''
|-
! 3rd person
| ''ligía''
| ''tugía''
| ''hagía''
|}

The forms ''au'' and ''amürü'' are of [[Cariban languages|Cariban]] origin, and the others are of Arawakan origin.

=== Plural of nouns ===
[[Pluralization]] of [[nouns]] is irregular and is realized by means of [[suffix]]ing:

*''isâni'' "child" – ''isâni-gu'' "children"
*''wügüri'' "man" – ''wügüri-ña'' "men"
*''hiñaru'' "woman" – ''hiñáru-ñu'' "women"
*''itu'' "sister" – ''ítu-nu'' "sisters"

The plural of ''Garífuna'' is ''Garínagu''.

=== Possession ===
[[Possession (linguistics)|Possession]] on nouns is expressed by [[grammatical person|personal]] [[prefix]]es:

*''ibágari'' "life"
*''n-ibágari'' "my life"
*''b-ibágari'' "your (singular) life"
*''l-ibágari'' "his life"
*''t-ibágari'' "her life"
*''wa-bágari'' "our life"
*''h-ibágari'' "your (plural) life"
*''ha-bágari'' "their life"

=== Verb ===
For the Garifuna [[verb]], the [[grammatical tense]], [[grammatical aspect]], [[grammatical mood]], [[negation]], and [[Grammatical person|person]] (both [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[object (grammar)|object]]) are expressed by [[affix]]es, partly supported by [[particle (grammar)|particles]].

The paradigms of [[grammatical conjugation]] are numerous.

==== Examples ====
The conjugation of the verb ''alîha'' "to read" in the [[Present tense|present]] [[Continuous and progressive aspects|continuous tense]]:
*''n-alîha-ña'' "I am reading"
*''b-alîha-ña'' "you (singular) are reading"
*''l-alîha-ña'' "he is reading"
*''t-alîha-ña'' "she is reading"
*''wa-lîha-ña'' "we are reading"
*''h-alîha-ña'' "you (plural) are reading"
*''ha-lîha-ña'' "they are reading"
&lt;br&gt;
The conjugation of the verb ''alîha'' "to read" in the simple present tense:
*''alîha-tina'' "I read"
*''alîha-tibu'' "you (singular) read"
*''alîha-ti'' "he reads"
*''alîha-tu'' "she reads"
*''alîha-tiwa'' "we read"
*''alîha-tiü'' "you (plural) read"
*''alîha-tiñu'' "they (masculine) read"
*''alîha-tiña'' "they (feminine) read"
&lt;br&gt;
There are also some irregular verbs.

=== Numerals ===
From "3" upwards, the numbers of Garifuna are exclusively of [[French language|French]] origin and are based on the [[vigesimal]] system,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} which, in today's French, is apparent at "80":

*1 = ''aban''
*2 =''biñá, biama, bián''
*3 = ''ürüwa'' (&lt; ''trois'')
*4 = ''gádürü'' (&lt; ''quatre'')
*5 = ''seingü'' (&lt; ''cinq'')
*6 = ''sisi'' (&lt; ''six'')
*7 = ''sedü'' (&lt; ''sept'')
*8 = ''widü'' (&lt; ''huit'')
*9 = ''nefu'' (&lt; ''neuf'')
*10 = ''dîsi'' (&lt; ''dix'')
*11 = ''ûnsu'' (&lt; ''onze'')
*12 = ''dûsu'' (&lt; ''douze'')
*13 = ''tareisi'' (&lt; ''treize'')
*14 = ''katorsu'' (&lt; ''quatorze'')
*15 = ''keinsi'' (&lt; ''quinze'')
*16 = ''dîsisi'', ''disisisi'' (&lt; "''dix-six''" → ''seize'')
*17 = ''dîsedü'', ''disisedü'' (&lt; ''dix-sept'')
*18 = ''dísiwidü'' (&lt; ''dix-huit'')
*19 = ''dísinefu'' (&lt; ''dix-neuf'')
*20 = ''wein'' (&lt; ''vingt'')
*30 = ''darandi'' (&lt; ''trente'')
*40 = ''biama wein'' (&lt; 2 X ''vingt'' → ''quarante'')
*50 = ''dimí san'' (&lt; "''demi cent''" → ''cinquante'')
*60 = ''ürüwa wein'' (&lt; "''trois-vingt''" → ''soixante'')
*70 = ''ürüwa wein dîsi'' (&lt; "''trois-vingt-dix''" → ''soixante-dix'')
*80 = ''gádürü wein'' (&lt; ''quatre-vingt'')
*90 = ''gádürü wein dîsi'' (&lt; ''quatre-vingt-dix'')
*100 = ''san'' (&lt; ''cent'')
*1,000 = ''milu'' (&lt; ''mil'')
*1,000,000 = ''míñonu'' (&lt; engl. ''million''?)

The use of French borrowings rather than Carib or Arawak terms is unclear, but may have to do with their succinctness, as numbers in indigenous American languages, especially those above ten, tend to be longer and more cumbersome.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

&lt;!-- This article uses a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (glossaries)#Structured glossaries|structured glossary]] format. --&gt;
&lt;!-- The standard used in this glossary is to link common names used in dyeing (piped to Latin name as needed). Link Latin names only if there are separate articles under the common and Latin names. --&gt;

:''This glossary contains terms specific to [[dyeing]]. For terms used in the creation or manufacturing of textiles, including spinning, knitting, weaving, and individual fabrics and finishing processes, see [[Glossary of textile manufacturing]]. For terms used in [[sewing]] and [[tailor]]ing, see [[Glossary of sewing terms]].''
'''[[Dyeing]]''' is the [[craft]] of imparting [[colors]] to [[textile]]s in loose [[fibre|fiber]], [[yarn]], cloth or garment form by treatment with a [[dye]]. [[Archeology|Archaeologists]] have found evidence of [[textile]] dyeing with [[natural dye]]s dating back to the [[Neolithic]] period. In China, dyeing with plants, barks and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years.&lt;ref name="Goodwin11"&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural insect dyes such as [[Tyrian purple]] and [[kermes (dye)|kermes]] and plant-based dyes such as [[isatis tinctoria|woad]], [[Indigo dye|indigo]] and [[rubia|madder]] were important elements of the economies of Asia and Europe until the discovery of man-made [[dye|synthetic dyes]] in the mid-19th century. Synthetic dyes quickly superseded natural dyes for the large-scale commercial textile production enabled by the [[industrial revolution]], but natural dyes remained in use by traditional cultures around the world.

{{Punctuation marks|☞|caption=Index}}
The symbol ☞ is a [[punctuation]] mark, called an '''index''', '''manicule''' (from the Latin root ''manicula'', meaning "little hand") or '''fist'''. Other names for the symbol include '''printer's fist''', '''bishop's fist''', '''digit''', '''mutton-fist''', '''hand''', '''hand director''', '''pointer''', and '''pointing hand'''.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Manicule hand drawn from 15th century.png|left|thumb|Manicule from the fifteenth century]]
[[File:Cheers Boston 2005.jpg|left|thumb|Pointing hands used in the signage outside the bar [[Cheers Beacon Hill|Cheers]] in Boston, part of a Victorian decorative theme]]
The symbol originates in scribal tradition of the medieval and Renaissance period, appearing in the margin of manuscripts to mark corrections or notes.
 
Manicules are first known to appear in the 12th century in handwritten [[manuscript]]s in Spain,&lt;ref name="Glaister"&gt;Geoffrey Ashall Glaister s.v. "digit 2.", ''Encyclopedia of the Book'', 2nd Edition,  2001, p. 141.
"This type ornament has a long history, the printed outline of a hand being used as a paragraph mark by, among other early printers, Huss at Lyons in 1484 in the edition of Paulus Florentinus’s ‘Breviarum totius juris canonici’ he printed with Johannes Schabeler. As with other typographic conventions this was taken from scribal practice, carefully drawn hands pointing
to a new paragraph being found in early 12th century (Spanish) manuscripts. It is also known as a fist, hand, or index."&lt;/ref&gt; and became common in the 14th and 15th centuries in Italy with some very elaborate with shading and artful cuffs.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;   Some were playful and elaborate, but others were as simple as "two squiggly strokes suggesting the barest sketch of a pointing hand" and thus quick to draw.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

After the popularization of the [[printing press]] starting in the 1450s, the handwritten version continued in handwritten form as a means to [[annotate]] printed documents. 
Early printers using a type representing the manicule included 
Mathias Huss and Johannes Schabeler in Lyons in their 1484  edition of Paulus Florentinus'  ''Breviarum totius juris canonici''.&lt;ref name="Glaister"/&gt;

In the modern period, the pointing hand became more popular in publications, advertising, and directional signage.&lt;ref name=Sherman13&gt;Sherman, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[fingerpost]]s have relief-printed or even fully three-dimensional physical manifestations of pointing hands,&lt;ref&gt;Pictures from an image search for "manicule fingerpost": [https://www.flickr.com/photos/historyanorak/258670481/], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bcp1549/1361816867/], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bcp1549/1361822589/]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Postal Service]] has also used a pointing hand as a graphical indicator for its "[[Return address|Return to Sender]]" stamp.

In modern printing, it was used as a standard typographical symbol marking notes. The  American ''Dictionary of Printing and Bookmaking'' (1894) treats it as the seventh in the standard sequence of footnote markers, following the paragraph sign ([[pilcrow]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hasler (1953:4).  The standard sequence of reference marks was *, †, ‡, §, ‖, ¶, and ☞.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gill Sans Q, punctuation and manicules (22065785558).jpg|left|thumb|Examples of manicules]]
Sherman (2005) argues  that as the symbols became standardized, they were no longer reflective of individuality in comparison to other writing, and this explains their diminished popularity.{{clarify|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage examples==
[[Image:John Wilkes Booth wanted poster new.jpg|thumb|left|133px|1865 wanted poster of [[John Wilkes Booth]] using index-fist character.]]

The typical use of the pointing hand is as a bullet-like symbol to direct the reader’s attention to important text, having roughly the same meaning as the word "attention" or "[[nota bene|note]]".  It is used this way both by annotators and printers.  Even in the first few centuries of use, it can be seen used to draw attention to specific text, such as a title (in some cases in the form of a row of manicules), inserted text, noteworthy passage, or [[sententiae]].  In some cases, [[Fleuron (typography)|flower marks]] and [[asterisks]] were used for similar purposes. Less commonly, in earlier centuries the pointing hand acted as a [[section divider]] with a [[pilcrow]] as paragraph divider; or more rarely as the paragraph divider itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, p. 14-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Some encyclopedias use it in articles to cross-reference, as in &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps"&gt;☞ other articles&lt;/span&gt;.  
It occasionally sees use in magazines and comic books to indicate to the reader that a story on the right-hand page continues onto the next.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In linguistics, the symbol is used in [[optimality theory]] tableaux to identify the optimal output in a candidate of generated possibilities from a given input.&lt;ref&gt;Prince and Smolensky, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

American science fiction writer [[Kurt Vonnegut]] used the symbol as a form of margin on the first line of every paragraph in his novel ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]''. The literary effect of this was to create separation between each paragraph, reinforcing the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] style of the text.

[[Thomas Pynchon]] parodies this punctuation mark in his novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' by depicting a [[middle finger]], rather than an index finger, pointing at a line of text.&lt;ref&gt;

==Computer cursor==
An upward pointing hand is often used in the mouse [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] in [[graphical user interfaces]] (such as those in [[Adobe Acrobat]] and [[Photoshop]]) to indicate an object that can be manipulated.  
The first is believed to be the [[Xerox Star]].&lt;ref name=Sherman13/&gt; Many web browsers use an upward pointing hand cursor to indicate a clickable [[hyperlink]]. [[CSS]] 2.0 allows the "cursor" property to be set to "hand" or "pointer" to intentionally change the mouse cursor to this symbol when hovering over an object; "move" may produce a closed fisted hand.  
Many [[video games]] made in the 1980s and '90s, primarily text-based [[adventure games]], also used these cursors.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Unicode==
[[Unicode]] (version 1.0, 1991) introduced six "pointing index" characters in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block:
*{{unichar|261A|Black left pointing index}}
*{{unichar|261B|Black right pointing index}}
*{{unichar|261C|White left pointing index}}
*{{unichar|261D|White up pointing index}}
*{{unichar|261E|White right pointing index}}
*{{unichar|261F|White down pointing index}}

Unicode 6.0 (2010) included several [[emoji]] pointing hands:
*{{unichar|1F446|White up pointing backhand index}}
*{{unichar|1F447|White down pointing backhand index}}
*{{unichar|1F448|White left pointing backhand index}}
*{{unichar|1F449|White right pointing backhand index}}

Unicode 7.0 (2014) incorporated more indices from the [[Wingdings]] fonts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13432">'''''Intensifier''''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|int}}''') is a [[linguistics|linguistic]] term (but ''not'' a proper [[lexical category]]) for a [[grammatical modifier|modifier]] that makes no contribution to the [[proposition]]al meaning of a [[clause]] but serves to enhance and give additional emotional context to the word it modifies. Intensifiers are grammatical [[Expletive attributive|expletive]]s, specifically ''expletive attributives'' (or, equivalently, ''attributive expletives'' or ''attributive-only expletives''; they also qualify as ''expressive attributives''), because they function as semantically [[Emptiness|vacuous]] filler.  Characteristically, [[English language|English]] draws intensifiers from a class of words called ''degree modifiers'', words that [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantify]] the idea they modify. More specifically, they derive from a group of words called ''adverbs of degree'', also known as ''degree adverbs''. However, when used grammatically as intensifiers, these words cease to be degree [[adverb]]s, because they no longer quantify the idea they modify; instead, they emphasize it emotionally.  By contrast, the words ''[[Wiktionary:moderately#Adverb|moderately]]'', ''[[Wiktionary:slightly#Adverb|slightly]]'', and ''[[Wiktionary:barely#Adverb|barely]]'' are degree adverbs, but ''not'' intensifiers.  The other hallmark of prototypical intensifiers is that they are adverbs which lack the primary characteristic of adverbs: the ability to modify verbs. Intensifiers modify exclusively [[adjective]]s and adverbs. However, this rule is [[Necessary and sufficient condition|insufficient]] to classify intensifiers, since there exist other words commonly classified as adverbs that never modify verbs but are not intensifiers, e.g. ''[[Wiktionary:questionably#Adverb|questionably]]''.

For these reasons, [[Rodney Huddleston|Huddleston]] argues that intensifier not be recognized as a primary [[grammatical category|grammatical]] or [[lexical category]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Technical term|Technically]], intensifiers roughly qualify a point on the [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] [[semantic property]], which is [[Wiktionary:gradable|gradable]].  [[Syntax|Syntactically]], intensifiers pre-modify either adjectives or adverbs.  [[Semantics|Semantically]], they increase the emotional content of an expression.  The basic intensifier is ''very''. A versatile word, [[English language|English]] permits ''very'' to modify adjectives and adverbs, but not verbs. Other intensifiers often express the same intention as ''very''.

==Syntax==
Not all intensifiers are the same syntactically—they vary on whether they can be used attributively or [[Predicative expression#Predicative vs. attributive adjectives|predicatively]]. For example, ''really'' and ''super'' can be used in both ways:&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte&gt;Tagliamonte, Sali A. (2012). ''Variationist Sociolinguistics.'' UK: Wiley-Blackwell. p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

::a. The car is ''really'' expensive. &lt;small&gt;- Predicative intensifier &lt;/small&gt;
::b. the ''really'' expensive car &lt;small&gt;- Attributive intensifier &lt;/small&gt;
::a. Today was ''super'' cold. &lt;small&gt;- Predicative intensifier&lt;/small&gt;
::b. a ''super'' cold day &lt;small&gt;- Attributive intensifier &lt;/small&gt;

However, words such as ''so'' can only occur as predicative intensifiers&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte /&gt; while others, such as ''-ass'', typically are only attributive intensifiers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|title=Can "[adjective]-ass" occur predicatively?|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=8542|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::a. The car is ''so'' expensive. &lt;small&gt;- Predicative intensifier &lt;/small&gt;
::b. *the ''so'' expensive car &lt;small&gt;- Attributive intensifier (not grammatical) &lt;/small&gt;
::a. *Today was ''cold-ass''. &lt;small&gt;- Predicative intensifier (not grammatical)&lt;ref group=note&gt;The exception to this is ''badass'' which appears to be the source of this intensifier rather than an instance of it.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
::b. a ''cold-ass'' day &lt;small&gt;- Attributive intensifier&lt;/small&gt;

==Illocutionary force==

Use of an intensifier subtly suggests to the reader what emotion he should feel. By naming an emotion within the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], the writer compels the reader to consider this emotion and hence he begins to feel it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Persuasiveness, credibility==

=== Legal ===
In general, overuse of intensifiers negatively affects the persuasiveness or credibility of a legal argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lance N. Long and William F. Christensen|title=Using Intensifiers is Very Bad - Or is it? |date=Fall 2008|publisher=Idaho Law Review|ssrn=1138084}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But if a judge's authoritative written opinion uses a high rate of intensifiers, a lawyer's written appeal of that opinion that also uses a high rate of intensifiers is associated with an increase in favorable outcomes for such appeals.  Also, when judges disagree with each other in writing, they tend to use more intensifiers.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

[[David F.

'''Istriot''' is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] spoken by about 400 people in the southwestern part of the [[Istria]]n peninsula in [[Croatia]], particularly in [[Rovinj]] and [[Vodnjan]]. It should not be confused with the [[Venetian_language#Regional_variants|Istrian dialect]] of the Venetian language.

 }}

Istriot is a Romance language related to the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages|Ladin]] populations of the [[Alps]]. According to the Italian linguist [[Matteo Bartoli]], the Ladin area used to extend – until the year 1000 AD – from southern [[Istria]] to [[Friuli]] and eastern [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Matteo. ''Le parlate italiane della Venezia Giulia e della Dalmazia''. Tipografia italo-orientale. Grottaferrata 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its classification remained mostly unclear, in 2017 it was classified by the [[Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History]] with the [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian Language]] in the Dalmatian Romance subgroup,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/istr1244|title=Glottolog 3.1 - Istriot|last=|first=|date=|website=glottolog.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet due to the specificities of the language, which has always had a very limited number of speakers. Istriot was also viewed:

* as an independent Northern Italian language, belonging neither to the [[Venetian language]] nor to the [[Gallo-Italic]] group (opinion shared by linguists [[Tullio De Mauro]] and [[Maurizio Dardano]]);
* as a variety of the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]] by the Istriot [[:de:Antonio Ive|Antonio Ive]]&lt;ref name=PTZ/&gt;
* as an independent language of the [[Italo-Dalmatian]] group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=ist Ethnologue entry for Istriot]&lt;/ref&gt;
* as an autochthonous [[Romance languages|Romance language]] heavily influenced by [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Friulian language|Friulian]] and Slavic superstrates by [[:de:Mirko Deanović|Mirko Deanović]]&lt;ref name=PTZ&gt;{{cite book|title=Lexicon Grammaticorum |first=Harro |last=Stammerjohann |year=2009 |place=Tübingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Istria]] was a region of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], Istriot was considered by the authorities as a subdialect of Venetian.&lt;ref&gt;Tagliavini, Carlo. ''Le origini delle lingue neolatine''. Patron Ed. Bologna 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, its speakers never referred to it as "Istriot"; it had six names after the six towns where it was spoken. In [[Vodnjan]] it was named "Bumbaro", in [[Bale, Croatia|Bale]] "Vallese", in Rovinj "Rovignese", in [[Šišan]] "Sissanese", in [[Fažana]] "Fasanese" and in [[Galižana]] "Gallesanese". The term ''Istriot'' was coined by the 19th-century Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]].

This language is still spoken by few people in the Istriot communities in [[Fertilia]] and Maristella, in [[Sardinia]].

There are about 1,000 speakers left, making it an [[endangered language]].

&lt;poem&gt;
 La nostra zì oûna longa cal da griebani:

 i spironi da Monto inda uò salvà,
 e 'l brasso da Vistro uò rastà scuio
 pei grutoni pioûn alti del mar,
 ca ruzaghia sta tiera viecia-stara.
 Da senpro i signemo pissi sensa nom,
 ca da sui sa prucoûra 'l bucon
 par guodi la veîta leîbara del cucal,
 pastadi dala piova da Punente a da Livante
 e cume i uleîi mai incalmadi.
 Fra ste carme zì stà la nostra salvissa,
 cume i riboni a sa salva dal dulfeîn
 fra i scagni del sico da San Damian;
 el nostro pan, nato gra li gruote, zi stà inbinideî
 cul sudur sula iera zbruventa da Paloû...
 e i vemo caminà par oûna longa cal da griebani,
 c'ancui la riesta lissada dali nostre urme.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
 La nostra è una lunga strada irta di sassi:

 gli speroni di Monto ci hanno salvato,
 ed il braccio di Vistro è rimasto scoglio
 per le grotte poste più in alto del mare,
 che erode questa antica terra.
 Da sempre siamo pesciolini
 che da soli si procurano il boccone
 per godere la libera vita del gabbiano,
 oppressi dalla pioggia di Ponente e di Levante
 come olivi senza innesti.
 Fra queste insenature è stata la nostra salvezza,
 come i pagelli si salvano dal delfino
 fra le tane della secca di San Damiano;
 il nostro pane, nato tra le grotte, è stato benedetto
 col sudore nell'aia ribollente di Palù...
 ed abbiamo camminato per una lunga strada dissestata,
 che oggi rimane spianate dai nostri passi.
&lt;/poem&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4901">In [[science-fiction]] criticism, a '''Jonbar hinge''' or '''Jonbar point&lt;!--redirected here--&gt;'''&lt;ref name=SFE-JP/&gt; is the fictional [[concept]] of a crucial [[point of divergence]] between two outcomes, especially in [[time-travel]] stories. It is sometimes referred to as a '''Jon Bar hinge''' or '''change-point'''.&lt;ref name=CF1993/&gt;

==Origin==
The phrase is derived from the [[Jack Williamson]] novel ''[[The Legion of Time]]'' (serialized 1938, collected 1952). It refers to one action from its character John Barr, in which picking up one of two objects (a magnet and a pebble) is a major turning point in history: choosing one will lead to a [[utopia]]n civilization named Jonbar, while the other to the tyranny of the state of Gyronchi.

This crucial moment (about which other characters are forewarned and must act), is thus a "Jonbar point" in the novel's timeline, a forking-place upon which hinges the rest of its history.

==Background==
Jonbar hinges often refer to small non-descript events that had an important effect on history, but because of [[time travel]] the outcome of the choice or event was changed leading to a different future or an [[alternate history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ask.metafilter.com/85629/The-weak-things-of-the-world-shall-confound-the-mighty |title=The weak things of the world shall confound the mighty |accessdate=6 December 2008 |author= |date=March 8, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[MetaFilter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/articles/books/2005/nz9645.php |title=Century Rain by Alastair Reynolds |accessdate=6 December 2008 |author=Pauline Morgan |date=November 28, 2005 |work= |publisher=SF Crowsnest (via [[archive.org]]) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516135819/http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/articles/books/2005/nz9645.php |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can, however, refer to any kind of change in history without having to deal with time travel, as [[Paul Di Filippo]] used the term when reviewing [[S.

The term is also used when describing an important upcoming event or decision humanity will have to make in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groundzeromedia.org/invest/7day/7day.html |title=The Martian Chronicle for the 21st Century Apocalypse |accessdate=7 December 2008 |author=Clyde Lewis |date= |work= |publisher=Ground Zero |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107231539/http://www.groundzeromedia.org/invest/7day/7day.html |archivedate=7 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With approximately 16 million speakers, it is the second most widely spoken [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]] (after [[Vietnamese Language|Vietnamese]]). Khmer has been influenced considerably by [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli|Pali]], especially in the royal and religious [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], through [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The more colloquial registers have influenced, and have been influenced by, [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and [[Cham language|Cham]], all of which, due to geographical proximity and long-term cultural contact, form a [[sprachbund]] in peninsular [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name ="enfield"&gt;[http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:57458:2/component/escidoc:57459/Enfield_2005_areal.pdf Enfield, N.J. (2005).

Smyth, Judith Margaret Jacob|year=1993|publisher=Routledge (UK)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRyungEACAAJ|isbn=978-0-7286-0218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to Old Khmer being the language of the historical empires of [[Chenla Kingdom|Chenla]], [[Angkor]] and, presumably, their earlier predecessor state, [[Funan Kingdom|Funan]].

The vast majority of Khmer speakers speak '''Central Khmer''', the dialect of the central plain where the Khmer are most heavily concentrated. Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of the Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the [[Khmer Empire]]. The [[Northern Khmer dialect]] is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of [[Isan|Northeast Thailand]] and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the [[Khmer Krom|Khmer of Vietnam]] while the Khmer living in the remote [[Cardamom mountains]] speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the [[Middle Khmer]] language.

Khmer is primarily an [[analytic language|analytic]], [[isolating language]]. There are no [[inflection]]s, [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugations]] or [[grammatical case|case]] endings. Instead, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and auxiliary words are used to indicate [[Grammar|grammatical]] relationships. General word order is [[subject–verb–object]], and [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] follow the word they modify. [[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifiers]] appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In spoken Khmer, [[topic-comment]] structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.{{Contains special characters}}

Khmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a [[tonal language]]. Words are [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a [[minor syllable]]. The language has been written in the [[Khmer script]], an [[abugida]] descended from the [[Brahmi script]] via the southern Indian [[Pallava script]], since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write [[consonant cluster|clusters]] and a division of consonants into two series with different [[inherent vowel]]s. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hul|first1=Reaksmey|last2=Woods|first2=Ben|title=Campaign Aims to Boost Adult Literacy|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/campaign-aims-to-boost-adult-literacy-78943/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=The Cambodia Daily|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main article|Austroasiatic languages}}

Khmer is a member of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language family, the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India.&lt;ref name=DiffZide&gt;Diffloth, Gerard &amp; Zide, Norman.

''A Mon–Khmer comparative dictionary''. Canberra: Australian National University.

==Geographic distribution and dialects==
[[File:Approximate Location of Khmer Dialects.png|thumb|280px|Approximate locations where various dialects of Khmer are spoken]]
Khmer is spoken by some 13 million people in [[Cambodia]], where it is the official language. It is also a second language for most of the minority groups and indigenous hill tribes there. Additionally there are a million speakers of Khmer native to southern [[Vietnam]] (1999 census)&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|khm|Central Khmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.4 million in northeast [[Thailand]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|kxm|Northern Khmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khmer [[dialect]]s, although mutually intelligible, are sometimes quite marked. Notable variations are found in speakers from [[Phnom Penh]] (Cambodia's capital city), the rural [[Battambang Province|Battambang]] area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as [[Surin province]], the [[Cardamom Mountains]], and southern Vietnam.&lt;ref name="SIDWELL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sidwell|first1=Paul|title=Khmer/Cambodian|website=Mon-Khmer.com|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=6 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119044006/http://people.anu.edu.au/~u9907217/languages/Khmer-Cambodian.html|archivedate=2011|format=lecture|url=http://people.anu.edu.au/~u9907217/languages/Khmer-Cambodian.html|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Khmer American: Identity and Moral Education in a Diasporic Community |author= Nancy Joan Smith-Hefner|year=1999|publisher=University of California|isbn=0-520-21349-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JoP"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wayland|first1=Ratree|last2=Jongman|first2=Allard|title=Acoustic correlates of breathy and clear vowels: the case of Khmer|journal=Journal of Phonetics|date=2003|volume=31|pages=181–201|url=https://kuppl.ku.edu/sites/kuppl.drupal.ku.edu/files/images/general/jongman/Wayland%20%26%20Jongman%2003.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2016|doi=10.1016/s0095-4470(02)00086-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects form a [[dialect continuum|continuum]] running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a [[Khmer Krom]] speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native of [[Sisaket Province]] in Thailand.

* [[Middle Khmer]]
** Cardamom (Western) Khmer
** Central Khmer
*** Surin (Northern) Khmer
*** Standard Khmer and related dialects (including Khmer Krom)

'''Standard Khmer''', or '''Central Khmer''', the language as taught in Cambodian schools and used by the media, is based on the dialect spoken throughout the [[Geography of Cambodia#Central plain|Central Plain]],&lt;ref name="HUFF" /&gt; a region encompassed by the northwest and central provinces.

'''[[Northern Khmer dialect|Northern Khmer]]''' (called ''Khmer Surin'' in Khmer) refers to the dialects spoken by many in several border provinces of present-day northeast Thailand. After the fall of the Khmer Empire in the early 15th century, the Dongrek Mountains served as a natural border leaving the Khmer north of the mountains under the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of [[Lan Xang]]. The conquests of Cambodia by [[Naresuan]] the Great for [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] furthered their political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper, leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the Middle Khmer period.&lt;ref name="Bernon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olivier|first1=Bernon de|editor1-last=Cholticha|editor1-first=Bamroongraks|editor2-last=Wilaiwan|editor2-first=Khanittanan|editor3-last=Laddawan|editor3-first=Permch|title=Khmer of Surin: Lexical Remarks|journal=The International Symposium on Language and Linguistics|date=1988|pages=258–262|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/bernon1988khmer.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2016|location=Bangkok, Thailand: Thammasat University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal languages [[Isan language|Lao]] and [[Thai language|Thai]], lexical differences, and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants. Syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}}, which has become silent in other dialects of Khmer, is still pronounced in Northern Khmer. Some linguists classify Northern Khmer as a separate but closely related language rather than a dialect.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = David | year = 1990 | title = On the 'language' status of Northern Khmer | url = | journal = JLC | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 98–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SUW&gt;[http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/24:1-26.pdf Phonetic variation of final trill and final palatals in Khmer dialects of Thailand] Suwilai, Premsrirat; Mahidol University; Mon-Khmer Studies 24:1–26; pg 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Western Khmer]]''', also called Cardamom Khmer or Chanthaburi Khmer, is spoken by a very small, isolated population in the [[Cardamom Mountains|Cardamom mountain]] range extending from western Cambodia into eastern [[Central Thailand]]. Although little studied, this variety is unique in that it maintains a definite system of [[Register (phonology)|vocal register]] that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern Khmer.&lt;ref name="DiffZide" /&gt;

'''Phnom Penh Khmer''' is spoken in the capital and surrounding areas. This dialect is characterized by merging or complete [[elision]] of syllables, which speakers from other regions consider a "relaxed" pronunciation. For instance, "Phnom Penh" is sometimes be shortened to "m'Penh". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an "r" either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a [[consonant cluster]] (as in the English word "bread"). The "r", [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] or [[Alveolar tap|flapped]] in other dialects, is either pronounced as a [[uvular trill]] or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant, causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or "dipping" [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] much like the "hỏi" tone in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. For example, some people pronounce {{IPA|/trəj/}} ('fish') as {{IPA|[təj]}}: the {{IPA|/r/}} is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, effectively doubling its length. Another example is the word {{IPA|/riən/}} ('study'), which is pronounced {{IPA|[ʀiən]}}, with the uvular "r" and the same intonation described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand |author= William Allen A. Smalley|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago|isbn=0-226-76288-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Khmer Krom]]''' or '''Southern Khmer''' is spoken by the indigenous Khmer population of the [[Mekong Delta]], formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, have been forced to take Vietnamese names.&lt;ref name=UNPC&gt;Unrepresented Peoples and Nations Organization [http://www.unpo.org/members/7887 Khmer Krom Profile] Retrieved 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, very little research has been published regarding this dialect. It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer.&lt;ref&gt;Thach, Ngoc Minh.

University of Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Khmer Khe language|Khmer Khe]]''' is spoken in the [[Tonlé San|Se San]], [[Srepok River|Srepok]] and [[Kong River|Sekong]] river valleys of [[Sesan District|Sesan]] and [[Siem Pang District|Siem Pang]] districts in [[Stung Treng Province]]. Following the decline of Angkor, the Khmer abandoned their northern territories, which the Lao then settled. In the 17th century, Chey Chetha XI led a Khmer force into Stung Treng to retake the area. The Khmer Khe living in this area of Stung Treng in modern times are presumed to be the descendants of this group. Their dialect is thought to resemble that of pre-modern Siem Reap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Try|first1=Tuon|last2=Chambers|first2=Marcus|title=Situation Analysis|journal=Stung Treng Province Cambodia, IUCN, MRC, UNDP|date=2006|pages=45–46|url=http://cmsdata.iucn.org.iucn.vm.iway.ch/downloads/cambodia_situation_analysis_stung_treng_province_camboida_english_pdf_1.pdf|accessdate=20 January 2016}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] study of the Khmer language divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian.&lt;ref name="Sak"&gt;Sak-Humphry, Channy. [http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/sak-humphry1993syntax.pdf ''The Syntax of Nouns and Noun Phrases in Dated Pre-Angkorian Inscriptions'']. Mon Khmer Studies 22: 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the [[Khmer Empire]] from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably [[Saveros Pou]], Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and [[lexicon]]. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.&lt;ref name="Sak" /&gt;

The following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of Khmer.&lt;ref name="Sidwell2009" /&gt;

Just as modern Khmer was emerging from the transitional period represented by Middle Khmer, Cambodia fell under the [[French protectorate of Cambodia|influence]] of [[France|French]] [[French colonial empire|colonialism]].&lt;ref name=CBHP&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Harris | first = Ian | title = Cambodian Buddhism: History and Practice | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | edition = | year = 2008 | location = Hawaii | pages =  | doi = | isbn = 0-8248-3298-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thailand, which had for centuries claimed suzerainty over Cambodia and controlled succession to the Cambodian throne, began losing its influence on the language.&lt;ref name="Candler1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=David P.|title=A history of Cambodia|date=1992|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=0813309263|edition=2, illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887 Cambodia was fully integrated into [[French Indochina]], which brought in a [[French language|French]]-speaking aristocracy. This led to French becoming the language of higher education and the intellectual class. By 1907, the French had wrested over half of modern-day Cambodia, including the north and northwest where Thai had been the prestige language, back from Thai control and reintegrated it into the country.&lt;ref name="Candler1" /&gt;

Many native scholars in the early 20th century, led by a monk named [[Chuon Nath]], resisted the French and Thai influences on their language. Forming the government sponsored Cultural Committee to define and standardize the modern language, they championed Khmerization, purging of foreign elements, reviving affixation, and the use of Old Khmer roots and historical Pali and Sanskrit to coin new words for modern ideas.&lt;ref name=CBHP /&gt;&lt;ref name="coinage"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sasagawa|first1=Hideo|title=The Establishment of the National Language in Twentieth-Century Cambodia: Debates on Orthography and Coinage|journal=Southeast Asian Studies|date=2015|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/197740/1/sas_4_1_5_sasagawa.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents, led by [[Keng Vannsak]], who embraced "total Khmerization" by denouncing the reversion to classical languages and favoring the use of contemporary colloquial Khmer for neologisms, and [[Ieu Koeus]], who favored borrowing from Thai, were also influential.&lt;ref name="coinage" /&gt; Koeus later joined the Cultural Committee and supported Nath. Nath's views and prolific work won out and he is credited with cultivating modern Khmer-language identity and culture, overseeing the translation of the entire Pali Buddhist canon into Khmer. He also created the modern Khmer language dictionary that is still in use today, thereby ensuring that Khmer would survive, and indeed flourish, during the French colonial period.&lt;ref name=CBHP /&gt;

The phonological system described here is the inventory of sounds of the standard spoken language,&lt;ref name="HUFF"&gt;Huffman, Franklin. 1970.

Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-01314-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; represented using appropriate symbols from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA).

===Consonants===
{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
! || [[Labial consonant|Labial]] || [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]] || [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]] || [[Velar consonant|Velar]] || [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]

|}

The voiceless plosives {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /c/, /k/}} may occur with or without [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] (as {{IPA|[p]}} vs. {{IPA|[pʰ]}}, etc.); this difference is contrastive before a vowel. However, the aspirated sounds in that position may be analyzed as sequences of two [[phoneme]]s: {{IPA|/ph/, /th/, /ch/, /kh/}}. This analysis is supported by the fact that [[infix]]es can be inserted between the stop and the aspiration; for example {{IPA|[tʰom]}} ('big') becomes {{IPA|[tumhum]}} ('size') with a nominalizing infix. When one of these plosives occurs initially before another consonant, aspiration is no longer contrastive and can be regarded as mere phonetic detail:&lt;ref name="ELL"&gt;{{cite book|last=Minegishi|first=M|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics|editor=Keith Brown|publisher=Elsevier|year=2006|edition=2|pages=4981–4984|chapter=Khmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SOAS&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=JM|title=Classical Civilizations of South-East Asia: Key Papers from SOAS|editor=VI Braginskiĭ|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|chapter=The Structure of the Word in Old Khmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; slight aspiration is expected when the following consonant is not one of {{IPA|/ʔ/, /b/, /d/, /r/, /s/, /h/}} (or {{IPA|/ŋ/}} if the initial plosive is {{IPA|/k/}}).

The voiced plosives are pronounced as [[implosive consonant|implosives]] {{IPA|[ɓ, ɗ]}} by most speakers, but this feature is weak in educated speech, where they become {{IPA|[b, d]}}.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of Linguistics'', OUP 2003, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

In syllable-final position, {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʋ/}} approach {{IPA|[ç]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively.  The stops {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /c/, /k/}} are unaspirated and have [[no audible release]] when occurring as syllable finals.&lt;ref name="HUFF" /&gt;

In addition, the consonants {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} occur occasionally in recent [[loan word]]s in the speech of Cambodians familiar with French and other languages.

===Vowels===
Various authors have proposed slightly different analyses of the Khmer vowel system. This may be in part because of the wide degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers, even within a dialectal region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/21736/1/jaas031010.pdf| title= On Takeo Dialects of Khmer: Phonology and World List| first=Makoto| last=Minegishi| year=1986| accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description below follows Huffman (1970).&lt;ref name="HUFF" /&gt; The number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system and that of the Battambang dialect on which the standard is based.&lt;ref name=Accoustic&gt;Wayland, Ratree.

===Syllable structure===
A Khmer [[syllable]] begins with a single consonant, or else with a [[consonant cluster|cluster]] of two, or rarely three, consonants. The only possible clusters of three consonants at the start of a syllable are {{IPA|/str/, /skr/}},&lt;ref name=ppak&gt;[http://www.panl10n.net/english/Outputs%20Phase%202/CCs/Cambodia/ITC/Papers/2007/0701/phonetic-and-phonological-analysis.pdf Phonetic and Phonological Analysis of Khmer]&lt;/ref&gt; and (with aspirated consonants analyzed as two-consonant sequences) {{IPA|/sth/, /lkh/}}. There are 85 possible two-consonant clusters (including [pʰ] etc. analyzed as /ph/ etc.). All the clusters are shown in the following table, phonetically, i.e. superscript ʰ can mark either contrastive or non-contrastive aspiration (see [[#Consonants|above]]).

Slight vowel [[epenthesis]] occurs in the clusters consisting of a plosive followed by {{IPA|/ʔ/, /b/, /d/}}, in those beginning {{IPA|/ʔ/, /m/, /l/}}, and in the cluster {{IPA|/kŋ-/}}.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

After the initial consonant or consonant cluster comes the syllabic [[nucleus (syllable)|nucleus]], which is one of the [[#Vowels|vowels]] listed above. This vowel may end the syllable or may be followed by a [[syllable coda|coda]], which is a single consonant. If the syllable is stressed and the vowel is short, there must be a final consonant. All consonant sounds except {{IPA|/b/, /d/, /r/, /s/}} and the aspirates can appear as the coda (although final /r/ is heard in some dialects, most notably in [[Northern Khmer dialect|Northern Khmer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nacaskul|first1=Karnchana|title=The syllabic and morphological structure of Cambodian words|journal=Mon-Khmer Studies Journal|date=1978|volume=7|page=187|url=https://sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/7:183-200.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011131733/https://sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/7:183-200.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[minor syllable]] (unstressed syllable preceding the main syllable of a word) has a structure of CV-, CrV-, CVN- or CrVN- (where C is a consonant, V a vowel, and N a nasal consonant). The vowels in such syllables are usually short; in conversation they may be [[vowel reduction|reduced]] to {{IPA|[ə]}}, although in careful or formal speech, including on television and radio, they are clearly articulated. An example of such a word is {{lang|km|មនុស្ស}} ''mɔnuh, mɔnɨh, mĕəʾnuh'' ('person'), pronounced {{IPA|[mɔˈnuh]}}, or more casually {{IPA|[məˈnuh]}}.&lt;ref name=ModSpok&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huffman|first1=Franklin|title=Modern Spoken Cambodian|date=1970|publisher=Cornell Southeast Asia Program Publications|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=0877275211|edition=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Stress===
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] in Khmer falls on the final syllable of a word.&lt;ref name="Schiller"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/schiller1994khmer.pdf | title= Khmer Nominalizing and Causitivizing Infixes| year=1994 | first=Eric| last= Schiller | publisher=University of Chicago| accessdate =2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this predictable pattern, stress is non-[[phoneme|phonemic]] in Khmer (it does not distinguish different meanings).

Most Khmer words consist of either one or two syllables. In most native disyllabic words, the first syllable is a [[minor syllable|minor]] (fully unstressed) syllable. Such words have been described as ''sesquisyllabic'' (i.e. as having one-and-a-half syllables). There are also some disyllabic words in which the first syllable does not behave as a minor syllable, but takes [[secondary stress]]. Most such words are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]], but some are single [[morpheme]]s (generally loanwords). An example is {{lang|km|ភាសា}} ('language'), pronounced {{IPA|[ˌpʰiəˈsaː]}}.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|10}}

Words with three or more syllables, if they are not compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are nonetheless adapted to Khmer stress patterns.&lt;ref name=KhDict&gt;Headley, Robert K.; Chhor, Kylin; Lim, Lam Kheng; Kheang, Lim Hak; Chun, Chen. 1977. ''Cambodian-English Dictionary''. Bureau of Special Research in Modern Languages. The Catholic University of America Press. Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|0-8132-0509-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary stress falls on the final syllable, with [[secondary stress]] on every second syllable from the end. Thus in a three-syllable word, the first syllable has secondary stress; in a four-syllable word, the second syllable has secondary stress; in a five-syllable word, the first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} Long polysyllables are not often used in conversation.&lt;ref name="HUFF" /&gt;{{rp|12}}

Compounds, however, preserve the stress patterns of the constituent words. Thus {{lang|km|សំបុកចាប}}, the name of a kind of cookie (literally 'bird's nest'), is pronounced {{IPA|[sɑmˌbok ˈcaːp]}}, with secondary stress on the second rather than the first syllable, because it is composed of the words {{IPA|[sɑmˈbok]}} ('nest') and {{IPA|[caːp]}} ('bird').&lt;ref name=KhDict /&gt;

===Phonation and tone===
{{See also|Tonogenesis}}
Khmer once had a [[phonation]] distinction in its vowels, but this now survives only in the most archaic dialect ([[Western Khmer dialect|Western Khmer]]).&lt;ref name=DiffZide /&gt; The distinction arose historically when vowels after Old Khmer voiced consonants became [[breathy voice]]d and diphthongized; for example {{IPA|*kaa, *ɡaa}} became {{IPA|*kaa, *ɡe̤a}}. When consonant voicing was lost, the distinction was maintained by the vowel ({{IPA|*kaa, *ke̤a}}); later the phonation disappeared as well ({{IPA|[kaː], [kiə]}}).&lt;ref name=ELL /&gt; These processes explain the origin of what are now called a-series and o-series consonants in the [[Khmer script]].

Although most Cambodian dialects are not [[tonal language|tonal]], colloquial Phnom Penh dialect has developed a tonal contrast (level versus peaking tone) as a by-product of the [[elision]] of {{IPA|/r/}}.&lt;ref name=ELL /&gt; 

===Intonation===
[[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] often conveys [[semantic]] context in Khmer, as in distinguishing [[declarative sentence|declarative statements]], questions and exclamations. The available grammatical means of making such distinctions are not always used, or may be ambiguous; for example, the final [[interrogative particle]] {{lang|km|ទេ}} {{IPA|/teː/}} can also serve as an emphasizing (or in some cases negating) particle.&lt;ref name=CamParts&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacob|first1=Judith M|title=A Diachronic Survey of some Khmer particles (7th to 17th centuries)|journal=Essays in honour of HL Shorto|date=1991|volume=1991|page=193|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/jacob1991diachronic.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intonation pattern of a typical Khmer declarative phrase is a steady rise throughout followed by an abrupt drop on the last syllable.&lt;ref name=ppak /&gt;
:{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំមិនចង់បានទេ}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[↗kʰɲom mɨn cɒŋ baːn &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ↘teː]}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ('I don't want it')&lt;ref name=ppak /&gt;

Other intonation contours signify a different type of phrase such as the "full doubt" interrogative, similar to [[yes-no question]]s in English. Full doubt interrogatives remain fairly even in tone throughout, but rise sharply towards the end.
:{{lang|km|អ្នកចង់ទៅលេងសៀមរាបទេ}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[↗neaʔ caŋ &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ↗tɨw leːŋ siəm riəp &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ꜛteː]}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ('do you want to go to Siem Reap?')&lt;ref name=ppak /&gt;

Exclamatory phrases follow the typical steadily rising pattern, but rise sharply on the last syllable instead of falling.&lt;ref name=ppak /&gt;
:{{lang|km|សៀវភៅនេះថ្លៃណាស់}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[↗siəw pʰɨw nih&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ↗tʰlaj &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ꜛnah]}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ('this book is expensive!')&lt;ref name=ppak /&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Khmer grammar}}

Khmer is primarily an [[analytic language]] with no [[inflection]]. Syntactic relations are mainly determined by word order. Old and [[Middle Khmer]] used particles to mark [[grammatical categories]] and many of these have survived in Modern Khmer but are used sparingly, mostly in literary or formal language.&lt;ref name=CamParts /&gt; Khmer makes extensive use of [[auxiliary verbs]], "directionals" and [[serial verb construction]]. Colloquial Khmer is a [[zero copula]] language, instead preferring predicative adjectives (and even predicative nouns) unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more complex sentences. Basic word order is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO), although subjects are often [[Null-subject language|dropped]]; [[prepositions]] are used rather than postpositions.&lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Franklin. 1967. ''An outline of Cambodian Grammar''. PhD thesis, Cornell University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Topic-prominent language|Topic-Comment]] constructions are common and the language is generally [[head-initial]] (modifiers follow the words they modify). Some grammatical processes are still not fully understood by western scholars. For example, it is not clear if certain features of Khmer grammar, such as [[Agent (grammar)|actor nominalization]], should be treated as a morphological process or a purely syntactic device,&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|46, 74}} and some derivational morphology seems "purely decorative" and performs no known syntactic work.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|53}}

[[Lexical category|Lexical categories]] have been hard to define in Khmer.&lt;ref name=Haiman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haiman|first1=John|title=Cambodian: Khmer (London Oriental and African Language Library, Book 16)|date=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9027238162|url=https://vk.com/doc12620867_132512378?hash=3e9bd161bfa4a9372d&amp;dl=f1cfca7e3360435207|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|360}} [[Henri Maspero]], an early scholar of Khmer, claimed the language had no parts of speech,&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt; while a later scholar, Judith Jacob, posited four parts of speech and innumerable particles.&lt;ref name=Jacob68&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacob|first1=Judith|title=Introduction to Cambodian (School of Oriental and African Studies)|date=1968|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0197135560}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}} [[John Haiman]], on the other hand, identifies "a couple dozen" parts of speech in Khmer with the caveat that Khmer words have the freedom to perform a variety of syntactic functions depending on such factors as word order, relevant particles, location within a clause, intonation and context.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt; Some of the more important lexical categories and their function are demonstrated in the following example sentence taken from a hospital brochure:&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|378}}

===Morphology===
Modern Khmer is an [[isolating language]], which means that it uses little [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. There is some [[Morphological derivation|derivation]] by means of [[prefixes]] and [[infixes]], but this is a remnant of Old Khmer and not always productive in the modern language.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite book|title=Colloquial Cambodian: A Complete Language Course |author= David Smyth|year=1995|publisher=Routledge (UK)|isbn=0-415-10006-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khmer morphology is evidence of a historical process through which  the language was, at some point in the past, changed from being an [[agglutinative language]] to adopting an isolating typology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karnchana|first1=Nacaskul|title=The syllabic and morphological structure of Cambodian words|journal=Mon-Khmer Studies Journal|date=1978|volume=3|pages=183–200|url=https://sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/7:183-200.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011131733/https://sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/7:183-200.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affixed forms are [[Lexicalization|lexicalized]] and cannot be used productively to form new words.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|311}} Below are some of the most common affixes with examples as given by Huffman.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|312–316}}

[[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] in Khmer is a common derivational process that takes two forms, coordinate compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two [[Bound and unbound morphemes|unbound morphemes]] (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|296}} Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, one of the most productive derivational features of Khmer, use [[reduplication]] of an entire word to derive words whose meaning depends on the class of the reduplicated word.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|185}} A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.

Coordinate compounds:&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|296–297}}

|-
| 'fast' || || 'very fast, quickly' ||  || 'women' || || 'women, women in general'
|}

====Nouns and pronouns====
Khmer [[noun]]s do not inflect for [[grammatical gender]] or [[grammatical number|singular/plural]]. There are no [[Article (grammar)|articles]], but indefiniteness is often expressed by the word for "one" ({{lang|km|មួយ}}, {{IPA|/muəj/}}) following the noun as in {{lang|km|ឆ្កែមួយ}} ({{IPA|/cʰkae muəj/}} "a dog").  Plurality can be marked by [[postnominal]] particles, numerals, or reduplication of a following adjective, which, although similar to intensification, is usually not ambiguous due to context.&lt;ref name=msc /&gt;

:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/cʰkae}} || {{IPA|craən/}} || style="width:25%; text-align: center" | or || {{IPA|/cʰkae}} || {{IPA|piː/}} || style="width:25%; text-align: center" | or  || {{IPA|/cʰkae}} || {{IPA|tʰom}} || {{IPA|tʰom/}}
|-
| dog || many || style="width:25%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || dog || two || style="width:25%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || dog || large || large
|-
| colspan=2 | 'many dogs' || style="width:25%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=2 | 'two dogs' || style="width:25%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=3 | 'large dogs'
|}

[[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifying particles]] are used after numerals, but are not always obligatory as they are in [[Thai grammar|Thai]] or [[Chinese classifier|Chinese]], for example, and are often dropped in colloquial speech. Khmer nouns are divided into two groups: mass nouns, which take classifiers; and specific, nouns, which do not. The overwhelming majority are mass nouns.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|67–68}}

:{| style="width:35%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/kʰmaw.daj}} || {{IPA|piː}} || {{IPA|daəm/}}
|-
| pencil || two || long cylindrical object[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}]
|-
| colspan=3 | 'two pencils'
|}

Possession is colloquially expressed by word order. The possessor is placed after the thing that is possessed.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|160}} Alternatively, in more complex sentences or when emphasis is required, a possessive construction using the word {{lang|km|របស់}} ({{IPA|/rɔbɑh/ ~ /ləbɑh/}}, "property, object") may be employed. In formal and literary contexts, the possessive particle {{lang|km|នៃ}} ({{IPA|nɨj}}) is used:&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|358}}

:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/puəʔmaːʔ}} || {{IPA|kʰɲom/}} || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | or || {{IPA|/puəʔmaːʔ}} || {{IPA|rɔbɑh}} || {{IPA|kʰɲom/}} || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | or  || {{IPA|/puəʔmaːʔ}} || {{IPA|nɨj}} || {{IPA|kʰɲom/}}
|-
| friend || I || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || friend || property || I || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || friend || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|poss}}|possessive}} || I
|-
| colspan=2 | 'my friend' || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=3 | 'my friend' || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=3 | 'my friend'
|}

[[Pronoun]]s are subject to a complicated system of social register, the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker, audience and referent (see [[#Social registers|Social registers]] below). Kinship terms, nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns (including for the first person) among intimates. Subject pronouns are frequently [[null-subject language|dropped]] in colloquial conversation.&lt;ref name=msc /&gt;

Adjectives, verbs and verb phrases may be made into nouns by the use of [[nominalization]] particles. Three of the more common particles used to create nouns are {{IPA|/kaː/}}, {{IPA|/sec kdəj/}}, and {{IPA|/pʰiəp/}}.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|45–48}} These particles are prefixed most often to verbs to form abstract nouns. The latter, derived from Sanskrit, also occurs as a suffix in fixed forms borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali such as {{IPA|/sokʰa.pʰiəp/}} ("health") from {{IPA|/sok/}} ("to be healthy").&lt;ref name=KhDict /&gt;

:{| style="text-align: left;"

|}

====Adjectives and adverbs====
[[Adjective]]s, [[demonstrative]]s and [[numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] follow the noun they modify. Adverbs likewise follow the verb. Morphologically, adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished, with many words often serving either function. Adjectives are also employed as verbs as Khmer sentences rarely use a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]].&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;

[[Comparison (grammar)|Degrees of comparison]] are constructed syntactically. [[Comparative]]s are expressed using the word {{lang|km|ជាង}} {{IPA|/ciəŋ/}}: "A X {{IPA|/ciəŋ/}} [B]" (A is more X [than B]).  The most common way to express [[superlative]]s is with {{lang|km|ជាងគេ}} {{IPA|/ciəŋ keː/}}: "A X {{IPA|/ciəŋ keː/}}" (A is the most X).&lt;ref name=msc&gt;Huffman, F. E., Promchan, C., &amp; Lambert, C.-R. T. (1970). ''Modern spoken Cambodian''. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-01315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensity is also expressed syntactically, similar to other languages of the region, by [[reduplication]] or with the use of [[intensifier]]s.&lt;ref name=msc /&gt;

:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/srəj}} || {{IPA|nuh/}} || {{IPA|sʔaːt/}} || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/srəj}} || {{IPA|nuh}} || {{IPA|sʔaːt}} || {{IPA|sʔaːt/}} || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || {{IPA|/srəj}} || {{IPA|nuh}} || {{IPA|sʔaːt}} || {{IPA|nah/}}

|-
| colspan=3 | 'That girl is pretty.' || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=4 | 'That girl is very pretty.' || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=4 | 'That girl is very pretty.'
|}

====Verbs====
As is typical of most East Asian languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-927311-1.pdf East and Southeast Asian Languages: A First Look] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120111832/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-927311-1.pdf |date=2012-11-20 }} at Oxford University Press Online&lt;/ref&gt; Khmer verbs do not inflect at all; [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[Linguistic modality|mood]] can be expressed using auxiliary verbs, particles (such as {{lang|km|កំពុង}} {{IPA|/kəmpuŋ/}}, placed before a verb to express [[continuous aspect]]) and adverbs (such as "yesterday", "earlier", "tomorrow"), or may be understood from context. [[Serial verb construction]] is quite common.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|253}}

Khmer verbs are a relatively [[open class (linguistics)|open class]] and can be divided into two types, main verbs and auxiliary verbs.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|254}} Huffman defined a Khmer verb as "any word that can be (negated)",&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|56}} and further divided main verbs into three classes.

[[Transitive verb]]s are verbs that may be followed by a [[direct object]]:

:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|ɲam}} || {{IPA|baj/}} || style="width:40%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|tɨɲ}} || {{IPA|baːrəj/}}
|-
| I || eat || rice || style="width:40%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || I || buy || cigarettes
|-
| colspan=3 | 'I eat rice.' || style="width:40%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=3 | 'I buy cigarettes.'
|}

[[Intransitive verb]]s are verbs that can not be followed by an object:

:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|daə}} || {{IPA|tɨw}} || {{IPA|pʰsaː/}} || ''style="width:25%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/ʔaɲcəɲ}} || {{IPA|ʔɑŋkuj/}}
|-
| I || walk || {{smallcaps|directional}} || market || style="width:25%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || to invite || to sit
|-
| colspan=4 | 'I walk to the market.' || style="width:25%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=2 | 'Please sit.'
|}

Adjectival verbs are a word class that has no equivalent in English. When modifying a noun or verb, they function as adjectives or adverbs, respectively, but they may also be used as main verbs equivalent to English "be + ''adjective''".

:{|
| {{smallcaps|Adjective:}} || {{IPA|/proh}} || {{IPA|&lt;u&gt;lʔɑː&lt;/u&gt;/}}
|-
| || boy || &lt;u&gt;handsome&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| || colspan=2 | 'handsome boy'
|}
:{|
| {{smallcaps|Adverb:}} || {{IPA|/proh}} || {{IPA|nuh}} || {{IPA|tʰʋəː kaː}} || {{IPA|&lt;u&gt;lʔɑː&lt;/u&gt;/}}
|-
| || boy || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|dem}}|demonstrative}} || to work || &lt;u&gt;good&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| || colspan=4 | 'That boy works well.'
|}
:{|
| {{smallcaps|Verb:}} || {{IPA|/proh}} || {{IPA|nuh}} || {{IPA|&lt;u&gt;lʔɑː&lt;/u&gt;/}}
|-
| || boy || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|dem}}|demonstrative}} || &lt;u&gt;handsome&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| || colspan=3 | 'That boy is handsome.'&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|56}}
|}

===Syntax===
[[Syntax]] is the rules and processes that describe how sentences are formed in a particular language, how words relate to each other within clauses or phrases and how those phrases relate to each other within a sentence to convey meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moravcsik|first1=Edith M.|editor1-last=Mushira|editor1-first=Eid|editor2-last=Iverson|editor2-first=Gregory|title=Principles and Prediction: The analysis of natural language. Papers in honor of Gerald Sanders (Volume 98 of ''Current Issues in Linguistic Theory'')|date=1993|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=9027276978|pages=73–74|chapter=Why is Syntax Complicated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khmer syntax is very [[analytic language|analytic]]. Relationships between words and phrases are signified primarily by word order supplemented with auxiliary verbs and, particularly in formal and literary registers, grammatical marking particles.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt; Grammatical phenomena such as [[Affirmative and negative|negation]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] are marked by particles while [[interrogative]] sentences are marked either by particles or [[interrogative word]]s equivalent to English "wh-words".

A complete Khmer sentence consists of four basic elements—an optional topic, an optional subject, an obligatory predicate, and various adverbials and particles.&lt;ref name=FSI&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehrman|first1=Madeline Elizabeth|last2=Kem|first2=Sos|last3=Lim|first3=Hak Kheang|title=Contemporary Cambodian: Grammatical Sketch|date=1974|publisher=Foreign Service Institute, US Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic and subject are [[noun phrase]]s, predicates are [[verb phrase]]s and another noun phrase acting as an [[Object (grammar)|object]] or verbal attribute often follows the predicate.&lt;ref name=FSI /&gt;

====Basic constituent order====
When combining these noun and verb phrases into a sentence the order is typically SVO:

:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|ʔaoj}} || {{IPA|ceik}} || {{IPA|muəj}} || {{IPA|cɑmnuən/}}
|-
| {{abbr|{{smallcaps|sbj}}|subject}} || {{smallcaps|verb}}|| {{abbr|{{smallcaps|obj}}|object}} ||
|-
| I || give || banana || one || bunch[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}]
|-
| colspan=5 | 'I gave a bunch of bananas.'
|}

When both a [[direct object]] and [[indirect object]] are present without any grammatical markers, the preferred order is SV(DO)(IO). In such a case, if the direct object phrase contains multiple components, the indirect object immediately follows the noun of the direct object phrase and the direct object's modifiers follow the indirect object:

:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|ʔaoj}} || {{IPA|ceik}} || {{IPA|cruːk}} || {{IPA|muəj}} || {{IPA|cɑmnuən/}}
|-
| {{abbr|{{smallcaps|sbj}}|subject}} || {{smallcaps|verb}}|| {{abbr|{{smallcaps|dir&amp;nbsp;obj}}|direct object}}|| {{abbr|{{smallcaps|ind&amp;nbsp;obj}}|indirect object}} ||
|-
| I || give || banana || pig || one || bunch[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}]
|-
| colspan=6 | 'I gave the pig a bunch of bananas.'&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|207}}

This ordering of objects can be changed and the meaning clarified with the inclusion of particles. The word {{IPA|/dɑl/}}, which normally means "to arrive" or "towards", can be used as a preposition meaning "to":
:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|ʔaoj}} || {{IPA|ceik}} || {{IPA|muəj}} || {{IPA|cɑmnuən}} || {{IPA|dɑl}} || {{IPA|cruːk/}}
|-
| I ||  give ||  banana ||  one || bunch[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}] || toward || pig
|-
| colspan=7 | 'I gave a bunch of bananas to the pigs.'&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|207}}
|}

Alternatively, the indirect object could precede the direct object if the object-marking preposition {{IPA|/nəw/}} were used:
:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|ʔaoj}} || {{IPA|cruːk}} || {{IPA|nəw}} || {{IPA|ceik}} || {{IPA|muəj}} || {{IPA|cɑmnuən/}}
|-
| I ||  give ||  pig || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|obj&amp;nbsp;marker}}|object marker}} || banana || one || bunch[{{abbr|{{smallcaps|clf}}|classifier}}]
|-
| colspan=7 | 'I gave the pig a bunch of bananas.'&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|207}}
|}

However, in spoken discourse OSV is possible when emphasizing the object in a [[topic–comment]]-like structure.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|211}}
:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/tuːk}} || {{IPA|muəj}} || {{IPA|kɔŋ}} || {{IPA|pram}} || {{IPA|ʔɑŋ/}}
|-

|-
| colspan=5 | 'In a boat sit five monks.'&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|148}}
|}
:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/ʋɪʔciə}} || {{IPA|cao}} || {{IPA|luəc}} || {{IPA|mɨn}} || {{IPA|baːn/}}
|-

|-
| colspan=5 | 'Science, a thief can not steal.'&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|211}}
|}

====Noun phrase====
The noun phrase in Khmer typically has the following structure:&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|50–51}}&lt;ref name=Jacob68 /&gt;{{rp|83}}
:{{smallcaps|Noun Phrase}} = ({{smallcaps|Honorific}}) {{smallcaps|Noun}} ({{smallcaps|Adjectival modifiers}}) ({{smallcaps|Numeral}}) ({{smallcaps|Classifier}}) ({{smallcaps|[[Demonstrative]]}})
The elements in parentheses are optional. [[Honorific]]s are a class of words that serve to index the social status of the referent. Honorifics can be kinship terms or personal names, both of which are often used as first and second person pronouns, or specialized words such as {{IPA|/preah/}} ('god') before royal and religious objects.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|155}} The most common demonstratives are {{IPA|/nih/}} ('this, these') and {{IPA|/nuh/}} ('that, those'). The word {{IPA|/ae nuh/}} ('those over there') has a more distal or vague connotation.&lt;ref name=KhDict /&gt; If the noun phrase contains a possessive adjective, it follows the noun and precedes the numeral. If a descriptive attribute co-occurs with a possessive, the possessive construction ({{IPA|/rɔbɑh/}}) is expected.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|73}}

Some examples of typical Khmer noun phrases are:

|}

The Khmer particle {{IPA|/dɑː/}} marked attributes in Old Khmer noun phrases and is used in formal and literary language to signify that what precedes is the noun and what follows is the attribute. Modern usage may carry the connotation of mild intensity.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|163}}

:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/ʋiəl}} || {{IPA|srae}} || {{IPA|dɑː}} || {{IPA|lʋɨŋ lʋəːj/}}
|-
| field || paddy || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|adj marker}}|adjective marker}} || vast
|-
| colspan=4 | '(very) expansive fields and paddies'
|}

====Verb phrase====
Khmer verbs are completely uninflected, and once a subject or topic has been introduced or is clear from context the noun phrase may be dropped. Thus, the simplest possible sentence in Khmer consists of a single verb. For example, {{IPA|/tɨw/}} 'to go' on its own can mean "I'm going.", "He went.", "They've gone.", "Let's go.", etc.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|17}} This also results in long strings of verbs such as:
:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|cɑng}} || {{IPA|tɨw}} || {{IPA|daə}} || {{IPA|leːng/}}
|-
| I || to want || to go || to walk || to play
|-
| colspan=5 | 'I want to go for a stroll.'&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|187}}
|}

Khmer uses three verbs for what translates into English as the copula. The general copula is {{IPA|/ciə/}}; it is used to convey identity with nominal predicates.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|212}} For locative predicates, the copula is {{IPA|/nɨw/}}.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|212}} The verb {{IPA|/miən/}} is the "existential" copula meaning "there is" or "there exists".&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|208}}
:{| style="width:35%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/piəsaː}} || {{IPA|ciə}} || {{IPA|kaː}} || {{IPA|sɑmdaeŋ}} || {{IPA|cət}} || {{IPA|kumnɨt}} || {{IPA|krŏəp}} || {{IPA|jaːŋ/}}

| {{IPA|/ʋiə}} || {{IPA|nɨw}} || {{IPA|cɪt}} || {{IPA|ʋŏət/}} || ''style="width:30%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/miən}} || {{IPA|pʰaen kaː/}}
|-

|-
| colspan=4 | 'He is close to the temple.' || style="width:30%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=2 | 'There is a plan.'
|}

[[Negation]] is achieved by putting {{lang|km|មិន}} {{IPA|/mɨn/}} before the verb and the particle {{lang|km|ទេ}} {{IPA|/teː/}} at the end of the sentence or clause. In colloquial speech, verbs can also be negated without the need for a final particle, by placing {{lang|km|ឥត}} {{IPA|/ʔɑt/~/ʔət/}} before them.&lt;ref name=msc /&gt;
:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|cɨə/}} || ''style="width:15%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|mɨn}} || {{IPA|cɨə}} || {{IPA|teː/}} || ''style="width:15%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|ʔɑt}} || {{IPA|cɨə/}}
|-

|-

|}

Past tense can be conveyed by adverbs, such as "yesterday" or by the use of perfective particles such as {{IPA|/haəj/}}
:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/kŏət}} || {{IPA|tɨw}} || {{IPA|msəlmɨɲ/}} || ''style="width:30%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/kŏət}} || {{IPA|tɨw}} || {{IPA|haəj/}}
|-
| he || to go || yesterday || style="width:30%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || he || to go || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|pfv}}|perfective}}
|-
| colspan=3 | 'He went yesterday.' || style="width:30%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=3 | 'He left.' or 'He's already gone.'&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|22}}
|}

Different senses of future action can also be expressed by the use of adverbs like "tomorrow" or by the future tense marker {{IPA|/nɨŋ/}}, which is placed immediately before the verb, or both:
:{| style="width:35%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/sʔaek}} || {{IPA|kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|nɨŋ}} || {{IPA|tɨw}} || {{IPA|saːlaː riən/}}
|-
| tomorrow || I || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|fut}}|future}} || to go || school
|-
| colspan=5 | 'Tomorrow, I will go to school.'&lt;ref name=KhDict /&gt;
|}

[[Imperative mood|Imperatives]] are often unmarked.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|240}} For example, in addition to the meanings given above, the "sentence" {{IPA|/tɨw/}} can also mean "Go!". Various words and particles may be added to the verb to soften the command to varying degrees, including to the point of politeness ([[Jussive mood|jussives]]):&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|240}}
:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/cou}} || {{IPA|saːk}} || {{IPA|lbɑːŋ}} || {{IPA|kʰluən}} || {{IPA|aeŋ}} || {{IPA|coh/}} || ''style="width:30%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/soum}} || {{IPA|tʰʋəː}} || {{IPA|taːm}} || {{IPA|bɑndam}} || {{IPA|kŏət}} || {{IPA|tɨw/}}
|-
| {{abbr|{{smallcaps|imp}}|imperative}} || try || try || you || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|refl}}|reflexive}} || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|imp}}|imperative}} || style="width:30%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || please || do || follow || instruction || he || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|imp}}|imperative}}
|-
| colspan=6 | 'Go ahead and try it yourself.' || style="width:30%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=6 | 'Please follow his instructions.'
|}

Prohibitives take the form "{{IPA|/kom/}} + {{smallcaps|verb}}" and also are often softened by the addition of the particle {{IPA|/ʔəj/}} to the end of the phrase.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|242}}
:{| style="width:35%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/kom}} || {{IPA|nɨw}} || {{IPA|tiː}} || {{IPA|nih}} || {{IPA|ʔəj/}}
|-
| {{abbr|{{smallcaps|proh}}|prohibitive}} || to be || place || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|dem}}|demonstrative}} || {{smallcaps|cohortative}}
|-
| colspan=5 | 'Don't stay in this place.'
|}

====Questions====
There are three basic types of questions in Khmer.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|46}} Questions requesting specific information use [[question words]]. [[Yes–no question|Polar questions]] are indicated with interrogative particles, most commonly {{IPA|/teː/}}, a homonym of the negation particle. [[Tag questions]] are indicated with various particles and rising inflection.&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|57}} The SVO word order is generally not [[Inversion (linguistics)|inverted]] for questions.

:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/loːk}} || {{IPA|tɨw}} || {{IPA|naː/}} || style="width:10%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/loːk}} || {{IPA|sdap}} || {{IPA|baːn}} || {{IPA|teː/}} || style="width:10%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/loːk}} || {{IPA|tɨw}} || {{IPA|psaː}} || {{IPA|haəj}} || {{IPA|rɨː}} || {{IPA|nɨw/}}
|-
| you || to go || where || style="width:10%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || you || understand || {{smallcaps|modal}} || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|q}}|question}} || style="width:10%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || you || to go || market || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|prf}}|perfect}} || or || yet
|-
| colspan=3 | 'Where are you going?' || style="width:10%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=4 | 'Can you understand?' || style="width:10%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || colspan=7 | 'Have you gone to the store yet?'
|}

In more formal contexts and in polite speech, questions are also marked at their beginning by the particle {{IPA|/taə/}}.

:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/taə}} || {{IPA|loːk}} || {{IPA|ʔɑɲcəːɲ}} || {{IPA|tɨw}} || {{IPA|naː/}}
|-

|-
| colspan=5 | 'Where are you going, sir?'&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|302}}
|}

====Passive voice====
Khmer does not have a passive voice,&lt;ref name=CamParts /&gt; but there is a construction utilizing the main verb {{IPA|/trəw/}} ("to hit", "to be correct", "to affect") as an auxiliary verb meaning "to be subject to" or "to undergo"—which results in sentences that are translated to English using the passive voice.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|286–288}}
:{| style="width:25%; height:50px"
| {{IPA|/piː}} || {{IPA|msəlmɨɲ}} || {{IPA|kʰɲom}} || {{IPA|trəw}} || {{IPA|cʰkae}} || {{IPA|kʰam/}}
|-
| from || yesterday || I || to&amp;nbsp;undergo || dog || to&amp;nbsp;bite
|-
| colspan=6 | 'Yesterday I was bitten by a dog.'&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|302}}
|}

====Clause syntax====
Complex sentences are formed in Khmer by the addition of one or more [[clause]]s to the main clause. The various types of clauses in Khmer include the [[coordinate clause]], the [[relative clause]] and the [[subordinate clause]]. Word order in clauses is the same for that of the basic sentences described above.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt; Coordinate clauses do not necessarily have to be marked; they can simply follow one another. When explicitly marked, they are joined by words similar to English conjunctions such as {{IPA|/nɨŋ/}} ("and") and {{IPA|/haəj/}} ("and then") or by clause-final conjunction-like adverbs {{IPA|/dae/}} and {{IPA|/pʰɑːŋ/}}, both of which can mean "also" or "and also"; disjunction is indicated by {{IPA|/rɨː/}} ("or").&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|217–218}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mori|first1=K.|editor1-last=Soichi|editor1-first=I.|title=Khmer final particles ''phɔɔŋ'' &amp; ''dae''|journal=SEALS XIII Papers from the 13th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society 2003|date=2007|pages=139–149-6|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/mori2007khmer.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2016|publisher=Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, The Australian National University|location=Canberra, ACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative clauses can be introduced by {{IPA|/dael/}} ("that") but, similar to coordinate clauses, often simply follow the main clause. For example, both phrases below can mean "the hospital bed that has wheels".&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|313}}
:{| style="text-align: left;"
| {{IPA|/krɛː}} || {{IPA|pɛːt}} || {{IPA|miən}} || {{IPA|kɑŋ}} || {{IPA|ruɲ/}} || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp; || {{IPA|/krɛː}} || {{IPA|pɛːt}} || {{IPA|dael}} || {{IPA|miən}} || {{IPA|kɑŋ}} || {{IPA|ruɲ/}}
|-
| bed || hospital || have || wheel || to push || style="width:20%; text-align: center" | &amp;nbsp;  || bed || hospital || {{abbr|{{smallcaps|rel}}|relative}} || have || wheel || to push
|}

Relative clauses are more likely to be introduced with {{IPA|/dael/}} if they do not immediately follow the head noun.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|314}} Khmer subordinate conjunctions always precede a subordinate clause.&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;{{rp|366}} Subordinate conjunctions include words such as {{IPA|/prŭəh/}} ("because"), {{IPA|/hak bəj/}} ("seems as if") and {{IPA|/daəmbəj/}} ("in order to").&lt;ref name=ModSpok /&gt;{{rp|251}}&lt;ref name=Haiman /&gt;

==Numerals==
{{Main article|Khmer numerals}}
Counting in Khmer is based on a [[biquinary]] system (the numbers from 6 to 9 have the form "five one", "five two", etc.) However, the words for multiples of ten from 30 to 90 are not related to the basic Khmer numbers, but are probably borrowed from Thai. [[Khmer numerals]], which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than [[Western Arabic numerals]]. 

The principal number words are listed in the following table, which gives Western and Khmer digits, Khmer spelling and IPA transcription.&lt;ref name="cc" /&gt;

Intermediate numbers are formed by compounding the above elements. Powers of ten are denoted by loan words: {{lang|km|រយ}} {{IPA|/rɔːj/}} (100), {{lang|km|ពាន់}} {{IPA|/pŏən/}} (1,000), {{lang|km|ម៉ឺន}} {{IPA|/məɨn/}} (10,000), {{lang|km|សែន}} {{IPA|/saen/}} (100,000) and {{lang|km|លាន}} {{IPA|/liən/}} (1,000,000) from Thai and {{lang|km|កោដិ}} {{IPA|/kaot/}} (10,000,000) from Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=JacobNotes&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacob|first1=Judith M|title=Notes on the numerals and numeral coefficients on Old, Middle, and Modern Khmer|journal=Lingua|date=1965|volume=15|page=144|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024384165900112|accessdate=24 January 2016|doi=10.1016/0024-3841(65)90011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ordinal number]]s are formed by placing the particle {{lang|km|ទី}} {{IPA|/tiː/}} before the corresponding cardinal number.&lt;ref name=KhDict /&gt;

==Social registers==
Khmer employs a system of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] in which the speaker must always be conscious of the social status of the person spoken to. The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for "to eat" used between intimates or in reference to animals is {{IPA|/siː/}}. Used in polite reference to commoners, it is {{IPA|/ɲam/}}. When used of those of higher social status, it is {{IPA|/pisa/}} or {{IPA|/tɔtuəl tiən/}}. For monks the word is {{IPA|/cʰan/}} and for royals, {{IPA|/saoj/}}.&lt;ref name ="cl" /&gt; Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.&lt;ref name=KhDict /&gt;

Khmer is written with the Khmer script, an [[abugida]] developed from the [[Pallava script]] of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared.&lt;ref name="OMNI"&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/khmer.htm Khmer Alphabet at Omniglot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to [[Thai script|Thai]] and [[Lao script|Lao]], both of which were based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the [[Mon script]], the ancestor of the modern [[Burmese script]].&lt;ref name="OMNI" /&gt; Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.&lt;ref name=UNCel&gt;[http://www.un.org.kh/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=469:celebration-of-international-literacy-day-2011-supporting-cambodias-development-efforts&amp;catid=43:latest-press-releases&amp;Itemid=76 United Nations in Cambodia "Celebration of International Literacy Day, 2011"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonant symbols in Khmer are divided into two groups, or series. The first series carries the inherent vowel {{IPA|/ɑː/}} while the second series carries the inherent vowel {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. The Khmer names of the series, {{IPA|/aʔkʰosaʔ/}} ('voiceless') and {{IPA|/kʰosaʔ/}} ('voiced'), respectively, indicate that the second series consonants were used to represent the voiced phonemes of Old Khmer.  As the voicing of stops was lost, however, the contrast shifted to the phonation of the attached vowels, which, in turn, evolved into a simple difference of vowel quality, often by [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]].&lt;ref name=ELL /&gt;  This process has resulted in the Khmer alphabet having two symbols for most consonant phonemes and each vowel symbol having two possible readings, depending on the series of the initial consonant:&lt;ref name="HUFF" /&gt;

The [[official language]] of [[the Netherlands]] is [[Dutch language|Dutch]], spoken by almost all people in the Netherlands. Dutch is also spoken and official in [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Belgium]], [[Curaçao]], [[Saba]], [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Suriname]]. It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], [[Low Franconian]] language that originated in the Early Middle Ages (c. 470) and was standardised in the 16th century.

There are also some recognised provincial languages and regional dialects.

&lt;!-- Please list the actual official regional languages first and then non-official (i.e. Limburgish and Low-Saxon) after that --&gt;
*[[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is a co-official language in the [[provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Friesland]]. West Frisian is spoken by 453,000 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taal.phileon.nl/fries.php|title=Taal in Nederland .:. Fries|website=taal.phileon.nl|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[English language|English]] is an official language in the special municipalities of [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]] ([[BES Islands]]), as well as the autonomous states of [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]]. It is widely spoken on Saba and Sint Eustatius (see also: [[English language in the Netherlands]]). On Saba and St. Eustatius, the majority of the education is in English only, with some bilingual English-Dutch schools.
*[[Papiamento]] is an official language in the special municipality of [[Bonaire]]. It is also the native language in the autonomous states of [[Curaçao]] and [[Aruba]].
*[[Low Saxon dialects in the Netherlands|Several dialects]] of [[Dutch Low Saxon]] (''Nederlands Nedersaksisch'' in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north-east of the country and are recognised as regional languages according to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Low Saxon is spoken by 1,798,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*Another Low Franconian dialect is [[Limburgish]], which is spoken in the south-eastern province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. [[Limburgish]] is spoken by 825,000 speakers. Though there are movements to have Limburgish recognised as an official language (meeting with varying amounts of success,) it is important to note that Limburgish in fact consists of a large number of differing dialects that share some common aspects, but are quite different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taal.phileon.nl/lim_situatie.php|title=Taal in Nederland .:. Limburgs|website=taal.phileon.nl|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, both [[West Low German|Low Saxon]] and [[Limburgish]] spread across the Dutch-German border and belong to a common Dutch-[[German language|German]] [[dialect continuum]].

The Netherlands also has its separate [[Dutch Sign Language]], called ''Nederlandse Gebarentaal'' (NGT). It is still waiting for recognition and has 17,500 users.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport "Meer dan een gebaar" en "actualisatie 1997-2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minority languages, regional languages and dialects in the Benelux ==
=== West Frisian dialects ===
[[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is an official language in the Dutch province of [[Friesland]] (''Fryslân'' in West Frisian). The government of the Frisian province is bilingual. Since 1996 West Frisian has been recognised as an official minority language in the [[Netherlands]] under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], although it had been recognised by the Dutch government as the second state language (''tweede rijkstaal''), with official status in Friesland, since the 1950s.

This is a list of [[irregular verbs]] in the [[English language]].

==Past tense irregular verbs==

For each verb listed, the [[citation form]] (the bare [[infinitive]]) is given first, with a link to the relevant [[Wiktionary]] entry. This is followed by the [[simple past]] tense ([[preterite]]), and then the [[past participle]]. If there are irregular [[present tense]] forms (see [[#Present tense irregular verbs|below]]), these are given in parentheses after the infinitive. (The [[present participle]] and [[gerund]] forms of verbs, ending in ''[[-ing]]'', are always regular. In English, these are used as verbs, adjectives, and nouns.) In the case of [[English modal verbs|modal verbs]] the present and preterite forms are listed, since these are the only forms that exist.

The right-hand column notes whether the verb is [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] or [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] and whether it belongs to a subclass, and links to descriptions elsewhere. Information about the development of these verbs generally can be found at [[English irregular verbs]]; details of the etymology and usage of specific verbs can be found by consulting Wiktionary.

In some cases, there are two or more possibilities for a given form. In the table, the preferred or more common usage is generally listed first, though for some words the usage is nearly equal for the two choices. Sometimes the usage depends on the [[American and British English differences|dialect]]. In many cases, such as ''spell'' (''spelt'' vs. ''spelled''), ''learn'' (''learnt'' vs. ''learned''), and ''spill'' (''spilt'' vs. ''spilled''), [[American English]] normally uses the regular form, while [[British English]] tends to favor the irregular. In other cases, such as ''dive'' (''dived'' vs. ''dove'') and ''sneak'' (''sneaked'' vs. ''snuck''), the opposite is true. [[Australian English|Australian]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] and [[South African English]] tend to follow the British practice, while [[Canadian English]] often sides with the American usage.

The table includes selected archaic or dialectal forms, marked * (some of these forms may survive in specialist uses).

{{see also|English irregular verbs#Verbs with irregular present tenses}}
Though the list of verbs irregular in the preterite or past participle is long, the list of irregular ''[[present tense]]'' verbs is very short. Excepting [[modal verb]]s like "shall", "will", and "can" that do not inflect at all in the present tense, there are only four (only two if pronunciation is ignored):
*[[wiktionary:be|be]]: ''I '''am''', thou '''art''', you '''are''', he '''is''', we '''are''', they '''are'''''.
*[[wiktionary:do|do]] (and compounds such as "undo" and "redo"): ''I do, you do, he '''does''', we do, they do'' where "does" is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|z}} in contrast to {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|uː}}, the pronunciation of the infinitive and the other present tense forms.
*[[wiktionary:have|have]]: ''I have, you have, he '''has''', we have, they have''.
*[[wiktionary:say|say]] (and compounds such as "gainsay" and "naysay"): ''I say, you say, he '''says''', we say, they say'' where "says" has the standard pronunciation {{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|z}} (in contrast to the {{IPAc-en|s|eɪ}} used for the infinitive and other present tense forms).

[[Arabic]] and its different [[Varieties of Arabic|dialect]]s are spoken by around 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the [[Arab world]] as well as in the [[Arab diaspora]] making it one of the five [[List of languages by total number of speakers|most spoken languages in the world]]. Currently, 22 countries are [[Member states of the Arab League|member states]] of the [[Arab League]] (as well as 5 countries were granted an observer status) which was founded in [[Cairo]] in 1945. Arabic is classified as a [[macrolanguage]] comprising 30 modern varieties, including its standard form &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: ara|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=ara}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Arabic is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of people who live in countries of the Arab world as well as of [[Arabs]] who live in the diaspora, particularly in [[Latin America]] (especially [[Arab Brazilians|Brazil]] and [[Arab Argentines|Argentina]]) or [[Arabs in Europe|Western Europe]] (like [[Arabs in France|France]], [[Arabs in Spain|Spain]], [[Arabs in Germany|Germany]] or [[Arabs in Italy|Italy]]).

[[Cypriot Arabic]] is an recognized [[minority language]] in the [[Member state of the European Union|EU member state]] [[Cyprus]] and is the only European variety of Arabic within the Arabic [[macrolanguage]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: ara|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=ara}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Also|Languages of Turkey}}
There is an [[Arabs in Turkey|Arab minority in Turkey]] who speak Arabic as their native language. Therefore, Arabic is a recognized minority language in [[Turkey]].

Historically Arabic was the official language (in the territory which form nowadays the state of Turkey) during the time when this [[History of Anatolia#Arab conquests and threats|region was a part of]] the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] between 661 and 750 and later when it [[Arab–Byzantine wars#Raids under the last Umayyads and the rise of Iconoclasm|belonged to]] the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750–1258).

The national public broadcaster of Turkey the [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] (also known as TRT) broadcasts [[TRT Al Arabiya]] a 24 hours a day TV channel in Arabic language (launched in April 2010).

In 2015, the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Turkey’s Ministry of Education]] announced that as of the 2016-17 academic year, Arabic language courses (as a second language) will be offered to students in elementary school starting in second grade. The Arabic courses will be offered as an elective language course like [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] which are already being offered to elementary school students for a long time. According to a prepared curriculum, second and third graders will start learning the Arabic language by listening-comprehension and speaking, while introduction to writing will join these skills in fourth grade and after fifth grade students will start learning the language in all its four basic skills.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Monitor]]: [https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/11/turkey-arabic-education-divides-country.html ''Turks divided over plans to introduce Arabic-language teaching''], 2 November 2015, Retrieved 29 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hürriyet Daily News]]: [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/arabic-to-be-offered-as-second-language-in-turkish-elementary-schools--90244 ''Arabic to be offered as second language in Turkish elementary schools''], 23 October 2015, Retrieved 29 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution declares in Chapter II: (The Official Language, Script, Calendar, and Flag of the Country) in Article 16 "''Since the language of the Qur`an and Islamic texts and teachings is Arabic, ..., it must be taught after elementary level, in all classes of secondary school and in all areas of study.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]]: [https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Iran_1989?lang=en ''Iran (Islamic Republic of)`s Constitution of 1979. - Article: 16 Official or national languages''], 1979, retrieved 25 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically Arabic was the official language (in the territory which form nowadays the [[State of Israel]]) for around 1,382 years from 636 until 2018. The [[Knesset]] canceled Arabic as an official language and gave Arabic a special status of the country Israel by adopting the relevant Basic Law. The [[Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People]] (an [[Basic Laws of Israel|Israeli Basic Law]] which specifies the nature of the State of Israel as the [[nation-state]] of the [[Jewish People]]) states in No. 4 (B) that "''The Arabic language has a special status in the state; Regulating the use of Arabic in state institutions or by them will be set in law.''" The law declares in No. 4 (C): "''This clause does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect.''" The law was adopted by the [[Knesset]] 62 in favor, 55 against and two abstentions on 19 July 2018.&lt;ref name=SOI-180719&gt;{{cite web |title=Full text of Basic Law: Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People |url=https://knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=13978 |website=The Knesset: Press Releases |publisher=State of Israel |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic is an [[indigenous language]] in the territory which form nowadays the state of Israel and which is still the [[lingua franca]] of [[Arab citizens of Israel]] as well as of [[Arabs|Arab foreigners]] (especially [[Palestinians]] who have only a [[Palestinian Authority passport]] which is not recognized of many countries as these countries don`t recognize the State of Palestine why these Palestinians are seen as [[statelessness]] of many countries). In addition, Arabic is spoken of Arab Jews in Israel who [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigrated from different Arab countries to Israel]] (as [[Aliyah]]) and got the [[Israeli nationality law|Israeli citizenship]] according to the [[Israeli Nationality Law of 1952]].

The Arabic language is mentioned in the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution of Pakistan]]. It declares in article 31 No. 2 that ''"The State shall endeavour, as respects the [[Muslim]]s of [[Pakistan]] (a) to make the teaching of the [[Quran|Holy Quran]] and [[Islamic studies|Islamiat]] compulsory, to encourage and facilitate the learning of Arabic language ..."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Pakistan]]: [https://pakistanconstitutionlaw.com/article-31-islamic-way-of-life ''Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 - Article: 31 Islamic way of life''], 1973, retrieved 13 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an [[Arabs in Pakistan|Arab minority in Pakistan]]. In addition, a remarkable number of [[Pakistanis]] are able to speak Arabic as they were living in the rich [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC Countries]] for working reasons (in [[Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] around 2.5 million; in [[Pakistanis in the United Arab Emirates|UAE]] around 1.5 million; in [[Pakistanis in Qatar|Qatar]] around 650,000; in [[Pakistanis in Kuwait|Kuwait]] around 430,000; in [[Pakistanis in Oman|Oman]] around 300,000; in [[Pakistanis in Bahrain|Bahrain]] around 180,000) for a very long time. These [[overseas Pakistani]]s who are living in countries of the [[Arab world]] are also named [[Pakistanis|Arab Pakistanis or Pakistani Arabs]].

The National Education Policy 2017 declares in article 3.7.4 that: “''Arabic as compulsory part will be integrated in Islamiyat from Middle to Higher Secondary level to enable the students to understand the Holy Quran.''“ Furthermore, it specifies in article 3.7.6: “''Arabic as elective subject shall be offered properly at Secondary and Higher Secondary level with Arabic literature and grammar in its course to enable the learners to have command in the language.''“ This law is also valid for private schools as it defines in article 3.7.12: “''The curriculum in Islamiyat, Arabic and Moral Education of public sector will be adopted by the private institutions to make uniformity in the society.''“&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training]]: [http://www.moent.gov.pk/userfiles1/file/National%20Educaiton%20Policy%202017.pdf ''National Education Policy 2017''], p. 25, retrieved 19 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
{{Also|Languages of the Philippines}}
The Arabic language is mentioned in the [[Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986|Philippine constitution of 1986]]. It specifies that ''"Spanish and Arabic shall be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis."''&lt;ref name=OfficialLang&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joselito Guianan Chan |author2=Managing Partner |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/article14language.htm |title=1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, Article XIV, Section 7.|publisher=Chan Robles &amp; Associates Law Firm |accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic is mainly used by some [[Islam in the Philippines|Filipino Muslim]]s in both a [[liturgical language|liturgical]] and instructional capacity since the arrival of [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]] and establishment of several [[Sultan|Sultanates]] (like [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]], [[Sultanate of Sulu]] and [[Confederation of sultanates in Lanao|Sultanate of Ranaw]]) in the present-day state [[Philippines]]. Along with [[Malay language|Malay]], Arabic was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Malay Archipelago]] among Muslim traders and the Malay [[aristocracy]] in the [[History of the Philippines|history]]. Arabic is taught for free and is promoted in some Islamic centres predominantly in the [[Mindanao|southernmost parts of Philippines]].

===Umayyad Caliphate===
[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|350px|thumb|right|The expansion of the first [[Caliphate]]s: {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under [[prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Constitution of Medina|Muhammad]],&lt;br /&gt;622–632 [[Gregorian calendar|AD]]/ 1-11 [[Hijri year|AH]]}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]],&lt;br /&gt;632–661 AD/ 11-40 AH}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]],&lt;br /&gt;661–750 AD/ 40-129 AH}}]]

The [[Early Muslim conquests|early Muslim conquests]] ({{lang-ar|الفتوحات الإسلامية}}, '''al-Futūḥāt al-Islāmiyya''') and the following [[Spread of Islam|Expansion of Islam]] ({{lang-ar|انتشار الإسلام}}, '''Intishar al-Islām''') led to the [[Arabization|expansion of the Arabic language]] in [[North Africa|Northern Africa]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Western Asia]], [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. Along with the [[Islam|religion of Islam]], the Arabic language, [[Arabic numerals|Arabic number system]] and Arab customs spread throughout the entire Arab [[caliphate]]. The [[caliph]]s of the Arab dynasty established the first schools inside the empire which taught Arabic language and [[Islamic studies]] for all pupils in all areas within the caliphate. The result was (in those areas which belonged to the Arab empire) the creation of the society that was mostly Arabic-speaking because of the assimilation of native inhabitants.

During the period of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (661–750), the 5th [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] (646–705) established Arabic instead of the local languages as the sole official [[Official language|state language]] of government across the entire caliphate.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title='Abd al-Malik|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbasid Caliphate===
While the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750–1258) originally gained power by exploiting the social inequalities against non-[[Arab]]s in the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Empire]], during Abbasid rule the empire rapidly was [[Arabization|Arabized]]. As knowledge was shared in the Arabic language throughout the empire, people of different nationalities and religions began gradually to speak Arabic in their everyday lives. Resources from other languages began to be translated into Arabic, and a unique Islamic identity began to form that fused previous cultures with Arab culture, creating a level of [[civilization]] and knowledge that was considered a marvel in [[Europe]] and the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ochsenwald|Fisher|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatimid Caliphate===
The Arabic language remained the [[lingua franca]] of high culture under the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] (909–1171), [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Spanish Umayyads]] (856–1031) in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], and later [[List of Muslim states and dynasties|Muslim dynasties]] in [[North Africa]] and [[Spain]] and of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] (1250–1517) in [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] and [[Levant|Syria-Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayrettin Yücesoy (2015) “[https://www.academia.edu/17004690/Language_of_Empire_Politics_of_Arabic_and_Persian_in_the_Abbasid_World ''Language of Empire: Politics of Arabic and Persian in the Abbasid World''], p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Andalus===
In the history, [[Andalusian Arabic]] was the official language in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], formerly [[Al-Andalus]] for more than 700 years until the [[fall of Granada|fall of the last Islamic state in Iberia at Granada]] in 1492.

===Italy and Malta===
[[Siculo-Arabic]] (or Sicilian Arabic) was  a spoken language on the islands of [[Sicily]] and neighbouring [[Malta]] (at that time [[Emirate of Sicily]] (831–1091)) between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century.

===Greece===
Furthermore, a form of Arabic was spoken on the [[Mediterranean]] [[island]] of [[Crete]] (in those days [[Emirate of Crete]]) from the late 820s (c. 824 or 827/828) until the [[Siege of Chandax|Byzantine reconquest]] in 961.

===South Sudan===
Arabic (alongside English) was an official language in [[South Sudan]] from 1863 (these days a part of [[Egypt Eyalet]] (1517–1867)) until 2011 (that time the independent state [[South Sudan|Republic of South Sudan]]), when the former government canceled Arabic as an official language. Since 2011 English is the sole official language of South Sudan. The Arabic dialect [[Juba Arabic]] is still the [[lingua franca]] of the people in South Sudan.

===The Gambia===
In 2014, Gambian [[President of the Gambia|president]] [[Yahya Jammeh]] announced that [[The Gambia]] would drop English as the official language because it is a "colonial relic".&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Jazeera]]: [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/03/gambia-drop-english-as-colonial-relic-2014313141814734996.html "Gambia to drop English as 'colonial relic'"] 13 March 2014, Retrieved 12 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Index on Censorship]]: [https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/03/gambia-language ''Gambia’s president wants to ditch English as official language''], 28 March 2014, retrieved 12 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced Gambia’s official language English with Arabic in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[[France 24]]: [http://www.france24.com/en/20170111-gambia-profile-president-yahya-jammeh-proud-dictator "Gambia’s Yahya Jammeh, a dictator and ‘proud’ of it"] 11 January 2017, Retrieved 12 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such change was not enacted.

===Israel===
Historically Arabic was the official language (in the territory which form nowadays the [[Israel|State of Israel]]) for around 1,382 years. The Arabic language was spread with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]] (which took place between 634 and 638) and became the official language in the territory of [[Jund Filastin]] (which was a part of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] at that time). Arabic remained as the official language in this area during the time of different [[List of Sunni Muslim dynasties|Muslim dynasties]] which control this territory for several centuries, namely [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]], [[Damascus Eyalet]] (an [[eyalet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), [[Syria Vilayet]] (a first-level administrative division ([[vilayet]]) of the Ottoman Empire), [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]] (an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] district with special administrative status) as well as during the time when this territory came under the control of the [[British Empire]] (known as [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]]) and the following geopolitical entity [[Mandatory Palestine]].

The Arabic language (alongside [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]]) also remained as an official language in the State of Israel for the first 70 years after the proclamation in 1948 until 2018. The [[Knesset]] canceled the status of Arabic as an official language by adopting the relevant [[Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People]] on 19 July 2018. This [[Basic Laws of Israel|Israeli Basic Law]] states in No. 4 (A) that "''The state’s language is Hebrew.''"&lt;ref name=SOI-180719&gt;{{cite web |title=Full text of Basic Law: Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People |url=https://knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=13978 |website=The Knesset: Press Releases |publisher=State of Israel |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21976">An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that it is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]]. [[UNESCO]] defines [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|four levels of language endangerment]] between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;

'''Luiz Eduardo de Oliveira''' (born December 13, 1944),&lt;ref name="Lambiek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/l/leo.htm|title=Leo|publisher=Lambiek's Comiclopedia|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; more famous under his pen name '''Léo''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[comics]] creator.

==Biography==
After graduating as a mechanical engineer, Oliveira left Brazil because of the then [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]. He lived in [[Chile]] until the [[Chilean coup of 1973]], then in [[Argentina]], before returning to Brazil in 1974. He worked as an illustrator in the advertising industry in [[São Paulo]] before once more leaving Brazil, this time for France, in 1981. He had hoped to find work illustrating comics, but the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] industry was in difficulty at the time so he fell back on advertising once again, with a few comics pieces being published in [[L'Écho des savanes]] and [[Pilote]].

In 1986, with the assistance of [[Jean-Claude Forest]], Oliveira began contributing to the youth oriented magazines of [[Bayard Presse]]. He illustrated true stories for {{Ill|Okapi (magazine){{!}}Okapi|fr|3=Okapi (magazine)}} magazine. He then recounted [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s life in the album ''Gandhi, le pèlerin de la paix'', for {{Ill|Astrapi|fr}}. In 1988, he began illustrating the stories of the comics writer {{Ill|Rodolphe (author){{!}}Rodolphe|fr|3=Rodolphe (auteur)}}. The collaboration proved fruitful, producing eight albums in the series ''Trent'' and five of another series, ''Kenya''.

In 1993, Oliveira finally achieved a dream when [[Dargaud]] agreed to publish his first solo (writer-artist) series: ''Aldébaran''. This story has continued in the sequel series ''Bételgeuse'' and ''Antarès'', the former nominated for the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for a Series|Prize for a Series]] at the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]] in 2004.

'''Mal Paharia''' is a language spoken by 51,000 of 110,000 ethnic [[Mal Paharia people|Mal Paharia]] in the states of [[Jharkhand]] and [[West Bengal]] in [[India]], and regions of [[Bangladesh]]. The language is also known as Mal Pahoria, Malto, Malti, Paharia, Parsi, and Mal Pahariya. It has been variously regarded as a [[Bengali–Assamese languages|Bengali–Assamese]] language, a dialect of [[Malto language|Malto]], and a [[mixed language|mixed]] [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]–[[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language. There is a generally positive attitude among speakers of the language towards it, but it is considered vulnerable as some speakers have shifted to [[Bengali language|Bengali]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Mal Paharia uses the Devanagari script and rules for its writing/ reading/ speech.

==Classification==
Mal Paharia is classified under the Indo-European, Indo- Iranian, Indo- Aryna and Eastern Zone language groups.

==History==
Mal Paharia is derived from [[Malto language|Malto]] and the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The speakers of this language originated in Jharkhand as early as 1881, and since then it has declined in popularity. According to the 1921 census, the town had Indo-European 500 speakers at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=VIDYARTHI|first1=L.P.|title=Problems and Prospects of Tribal Development in India|jstor=41919217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialization and urbanization were factors in the fragmentation of the Bengali language into dialects because of the making of dams, mines, homes, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarkar|first1=Amitabha|title=DHARAMRAJ RITUAL: AS A PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION INTO HINDU FOLD|url=http://www.serialsjournals.com/serialjournalmanager/pdf/1338015965.pdf|website=www.serialsjournals.com|publisher=Serials Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a displacement in the population of the Indo-European speakers, which led to the emergence of Mal Paharia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekka|first1=Alexius|title=Jharkhand Tribals: Are They Really a Minority?|jstor=4410103|website=Economic and Political Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mal Paharia is considered a Northern Dravidian language, which is spoken in Northeastern India.&lt;ref&gt;"TreeName: Smith 2013". MultiTree: A digital library of language relationships. Institute for Language Information and Technology: Ypsilanti, MI. 2013. Web. Accessed May 4, 2016. Published July 27, 2013 . &lt;http://multitree.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Official status'''
The regions that use Mal Pahari are Jharkhand, West Bengal, and parts of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="The Linguist List"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mal Paharia|url=http://multitree.org/codes/mkb|publisher=MultiTree:A Digital Library of Language Relationships}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialects/ Varieties''' 
Mal Paharia can be considered a dialect of [[Bengali language|Benjali]] but can also be classified separately. It is also derived from [[Malto language|Malto]], which is a more commonly used language. Mal Paharia is considered a Dravidian language, which is spoken by the people of Jharkhand and in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="The Linguist List"/&gt;

'''Derived Languages'''
Mal Paharia does not have any daughter languages, only languages that are similar to it such as Kumarbhag Paharia and Sauria Paharia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Short|first1=Dan|title=Indo-European Language Family|url=http://www.danshort.com/ie/iefamilyfull.htm|website=danshort.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Script==
Mal Paharia uses the Devangari script,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saktinanda|first1=Guddi|title=ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN JHARKHAND – A MICROSCOPIC ANALYSISwebsite=http://oaji.net/|publisher=The Scholarly Research Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the chart there are a few examples of words in writing, and translated in English. The Devangari script has 11 vowels and 33 consonants.&lt;ref name="The Devanagari Script"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Templin|first1=David|title=The Devanagari Script|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/articles/devanagari.htm|website=omniglot.com|publisher=Omniglot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script is written from left to right, and it uses headstrokes on the letters. Some exceptions are; jha, tha, dha, bha, a and ā, because there is a break in the headstroke. While writing using the Devangari script, the headstroke is not always used.&lt;ref name="The Devanagari Script"/&gt; According to the phonetics used in Devangari script for the Mal Paharia language, vowels are ordered first, meaning each short vowel is following by a longer one. The consonants are ordered with respect to place and in rows. The 'rows' consist of; velar, palatal, retroflex, dental, labial.&lt;ref name="The Devanagari Script"/&gt; Each row has different rules, but within each one, the sibilants and fricatives are ordered last. Various letters take different forms when they are in  their initial/ final position. For example, the letter ''ra'' changes location depending on the preceding ''ya'', or a consonant other than ''ya'', or a consonant with a vertical stem/ rounded bottom.&lt;ref name="Devanagari Nagari Script"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Scriptsource|title=Devanagari (Nagari) Script|url=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&amp;key=Deva|website=Scriptsource.org|publisher=Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Magahi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Devanagari is not actually an alphabet, it uses an ''alphasyllabary'' system using vowels and consonants to form speech. Every letter represents a consonant, which is followed by a schwa vowel (अ).&lt;ref name="The Devanagari Script"/&gt; Diatrical marks are used to distinguish between different sounds of the vowels, since it can be used in many different ways. Conjunct consonants are used to represent combinations of sounds, thus increasing its versatility in word formation.

Devanagari uses the articulation of vowels in the mouth, when spoken. It uses five places of articulation listed in the chart below:&lt;ref name="The Devanagari Script"/&gt; 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Velar || Consonants are pronounced in the back of the tongue. For example: emphasis on the 'k' in 'keep'. 
|-
| Palatal || Consonants are pronounced by the tongue touching the palate, such as 'ch' in 'change'. 
|-
| Retroflex || Consonants are pronounced by the curl of the tongue, focusing on the front portion of the palate. For example: emphasis on the 't' in 'tip'. 
|-
| Dental || Consonants are pronounced by the tip of the tongue touching the back of the top front teeth. For example: emphasis on the 'th' in 'thin'. 
|-
| Labial || Consonants are pronounced with the use of lips, such as 'p' in 'pit'. 
|}

Among all of the consonants and vowels, they are voiced, unvoiced, or nasal. An example is given (in the chart below) for the Devangari script with relation to the five articulation of vowels in the mouth.&lt;ref name="The Devanagari Script"/&gt; 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|  || Unvoiced || Voiced || Nasal
|-
| Velar || क  ख|| ग	 घ || ङ
|-
| Palatal || च	 छ || ज	झ || ञ

|-
| Dental || त	 थ || द 	ध || न
|-
| Labial || प	  फ (फ़) || ब	 भ || म
|}

==Vocabulary==
Mal Paharia is identified as a Bengali–Assamese language, which uses the Devanagri script to form vocabulary. It is a borrowed script, since it does not have its own type of script, so the Devanagari script is shared by speakers in the Northeastern area of India and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="The Devanagari Script"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Devanagari Nagari Script"/&gt;

A '''minor premiership''' is the name of the title given to the team which finishes a sporting competition first in the league standings after the [[regular season]] but prior to commencement of the [[playoff]]s in several Australian sports leagues.

The etymology of the term was based on terminology in Australia from the end of the 19th century, where the [[regular season]] was referred to as the "minor rounds", and the [[playoffs|playoffs or finals]] were referred to as the "major rounds" (this terminology is still used in South Australia, but has fallen into disuse in other parts of the country). Emerging from this terminology came the "minor premiership", for the top-ranked team in the minor rounds, and the "major premiership", often shortened simply to [[premiership (disambiguation)|premiership]], for the winner of the finals series.

The term was important in the [[Early VFL Final systems|early finals systems]] of the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]], an [[Australian rules football]] league, where the minor premier had the right to a [[Grand final|challenge match]] for the major premiership if it were eliminated at any stage during the finals.

The term is used widely throughout Australian sports, and there is often a separate trophy presented for it. The [[National Rugby League]] awards the [[J. J. Giltinan Shield]]&lt;ref name="ABC News - 1 September 2017 -Melbourne Storm's NRL minor premiership result of proven winning formula"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-01/hinds:-the-secret-to-melbourne-storms-consistent-success/8860566|title=Melbourne Storm's NRL minor premiership result of proven winning formula|last=Hinds|first=Richard|date=1 September 2017|work=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] awards the H. Newman Reid Trophy and the [[Australian Football League]] has (since 1991) awarded the [[McClelland Trophy|Dr Wm. C. McClelland Trophy]]. The [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] recognises the minor premiers but no official trophy or award is given. Australia's premier [[association football]] competition, the [[A-League]], officially refers to the "minor premiership" as the "premiership", and the "major premiership" as the "championship", which is more common with other association football competitions, but "minor premiership" is still used colloquially in the sports media even though it is incorrect terminology with regard to the [[A-League]].

Although the concept of a minor premiership exists in [[North America]], and a separate award is often presented for the best record in the regular season, the term "minor premiership" is not used. The [[Presidents' Trophy]] is awarded by the [[National Hockey League]] to the team which finishes first in the standings at the end of the season, as are the [[Supporters' Shield]] in [[Major League Soccer]] and the [[NWSL Shield]] in the [[National Women's Soccer League]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17040">In [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]], '''Newcomb's paradox''', also referred to as '''Newcomb's problem''', is a [[thought experiment]] involving a game between two players, one of whom purports to be able to predict the future. Whether the problem actually is a [[paradox]] is disputed.

Newcomb's paradox was created by [[William Newcomb]] of the [[University of California]]'s [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]]. However, it was first analyzed and was published in a philosophy paper spread to the philosophical community by [[Robert Nozick]] in 1969,&lt;ref name='nozick'&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Essays in Honor of Carl G Hempel|chapter=Newcomb's Problem and Two Principles of Choice|url=http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/rjohns/nozick_newcomb.pdf|editor-last=Rescher|editor-first=Nicholas|year=1969|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in the March 1973 issue of Scientific American, in [[Martin Gardner]]'s "[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]."&lt;ref name='sciam'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American|author=Gardner, Martin|date=March 1974|title=Mathematical Games|at=p. 102}} Reprinted with an addendum and annotated bibliography in his book ''The Colossal Book of Mathematics'' ({{ISBN|0-393-02023-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is a much debated problem in the philosophical branch of [[decision theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Causal Decision Theory|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem==
There is a predictor, a player, and two boxes designated A and B. The player is given a choice between taking only box B, or taking both boxes A and B. The player knows the following:&lt;ref name="Wolpert"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. H. |last=Wolpert |first2=G. |last2=Benford |title=The lesson of Newcomb's paradox |journal=[[Synthese]]|date=June 2013 |volume=190 |issue=9 |pages=1637–1646 |doi=10.1007/s11229-011-9899-3 |jstor=41931515}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Box A is clear, and always contains a visible $1,000.
* Box B is opaque, and its content has already been set by the predictor:
** If the predictor has predicted the player will take both boxes A and B, then box B contains nothing.
** If the predictor has predicted that the player will take only box B, then box B contains $1,000,000.
Even while the player knows the above, he does not know what prediction has been made prior to his making a choice.

==Game theory strategies==
{| class="wikitable"
! Predicted choice !! Actual choice !! Payout
|-
|A + B || A + B || $1,000
|-
|A + B || B || $0
|-
|B || A + B || $1,001,000
|-
|B || B || $1,000,000
|}
In his 1969 article, Nozick noted that "To almost everyone, it is perfectly clear and obvious what should be done. The difficulty is that these people seem to divide almost evenly on the problem, with large numbers thinking that the opposing half is just being silly."&lt;ref name="Wolpert" /&gt; The problem continues to divide philosophers today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bellos|first1=Alex|title=Newcomb's problem divides philosophers. Which side are you on?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2016/nov/28/newcombs-problem-divides-philosophers-which-side-are-you-on|accessdate=13 April 2018|work=the Guardian|date=28 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourget, D., &amp; Chalmers, D. J. (2014). What do philosophers believe?. Philosophical Studies, 170(3), 465-500.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Game theory]] offers two strategies for this game that rely on different principles: the [[expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] principle and the [[strategic dominance]] principle. The problem is called a ''paradox'' because two analyses that both sound intuitively logical give conflicting answers to the question of what choice maximizes the player's payout.
* Considering the expected utility when the probability of the predictor being right is almost certain or certain, the player should choose box B. This choice statistically maximizes the player's winnings, setting them at about $1,000,000 per game.
* Under the dominance principle, the player should choose the strategy that is ''always'' better; choosing both boxes A and B will ''always'' yield $1,000 more than only choosing B. However, the expected utility of "always $1,000 more than B" depends on the statistical payout of the game; when the predictor's prediction is almost certain or certain, choosing both A and B sets player's winnings at about $1,000 per game.

[[David Wolpert]] and [[Gregory Benford]] suggest that there is no conflict between the two strategies; Newcomb's problem actually represents two different games with different probabilistic outcomes, and the conflict arises because of this imprecise definition of the game. They also note that the optimal strategy for either of the games does not depend on the infallibility of the predictor, and the questions of causality, determinism, and free will do not factor into these strategies.&lt;ref name="Wolpert" /&gt;

==Causality and free will==
{| class="wikitable"
! Predicted choice !! Actual choice !! Payout
|-
|A + B || A + B || $1,000
|-
|B || B || $1,000,000
|}
Causality issues arise when the predictor is posited as [[infallible]] and incapable of error; Nozick avoids this issue by positing that the predictor's predictions are "''almost'' certainly" correct, thus sidestepping any issues of infallibility and causality. Nozick also stipulates that if the predictor predicts that the player will choose randomly, then box B will contain nothing. This assumes that inherently random or unpredictable events would not come into play anyway during the process of making the choice, such as [[free will]] or [[quantum mind]] processes.&lt;ref name='langan'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Noesis|author=Christopher Langan|issue=44|title=The Resolution of Newcomb's Paradox|url=http://megasociety.org/noesis/44/newcomb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these issues can still be explored in the case of an infallible predictor. Under this condition, it seems that taking only B is the correct option. This analysis argues that we can ignore the possibilities that return $0 and $1,001,000, as they both require that the predictor has made an incorrect prediction, and the problem states that the predictor is never wrong. Thus, the choice becomes whether to take both boxes with $1,000 or to take only box B with $1,000,000—so taking only box B is always better.

[[William Lane Craig]] has suggested that, in a world with perfect predictors (or [[Time travel|time machines]], because a time machine could be used as a mechanism for making a prediction), [[retrocausality]] can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Craig |year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person truly knows the future, and that knowledge affects their actions, then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. The chooser's choice will have already ''caused'' the predictor's action. Some have concluded that if time machines or perfect predictors can exist, then there can be no [[free will]] and choosers will do whatever they're fated to do. Taken together, the paradox is a restatement of the old contention that free will and [[determinism]] are incompatible, since determinism enables the existence of perfect predictors. Put another way, this paradox can be equivalent to the [[grandfather paradox]]; the paradox presupposes a perfect predictor, implying the "chooser" is not free to choose, yet simultaneously presumes a choice can be debated and decided. This suggests to some that the paradox is an artifact of these contradictory assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Craig |first=William Lane |authorlink=William Lane Craig |year=1988 |title=Tachyons, Time Travel, and Divine Omniscience |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=135–150 |jstor=2027068|doi=10.2307/2027068 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Drescher]] argues in his book ''Good and Real'' that the correct decision is to take only box B, by appealing to a situation he argues is analogous—a rational agent in a deterministic universe deciding whether or not to cross a potentially busy street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drescher |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Drescher |year=2006 |title=Good and Real: Demystifying Paradoxes from Physics to Ethics |isbn=978-0262042338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew David Irvine|Andrew Irvine]] argues that the problem is structurally isomorphic to [[Braess' paradox]], a non-intuitive but ultimately non-paradoxical result concerning equilibrium points in physical systems of various kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Irvine |title=How Braess' paradox solves Newcomb's problem |journal=International Studies in the Philosophy of Science |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=141–60 |doi=10.1080/02698599308573460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influencing the predictor==
Simon Burgess has argued that we need to recognize two stages to the problem. The first stage is that before which the predictor has gained all the information on which the prediction will be based. If, for example, we suppose that the prediction is at least partially based on a brain scan of the player then the first stage will not be over at least until that brain scan has been taken. An important point to appreciate is that while the player is still in that first stage, they will presumably be able to influence the predictor's prediction (e.g., by committing to taking only one box). The second stage commences after the completion of the brain scan (and/or after the gathering of any other information on which the prediction is based). As Burgess points out, the first stage is the one in which all of us currently find ourselves. Moreover, there is a clear sense in which the first stage is more significant than the second because it is then that the player can determine whether the $1,000,000 is in box B. Once they get to the second stage, the best that can be done is to determine whether to get the $1,000 in box A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Simon|title=Newcomb's problem: an unqualified resolution|journal=Synthese|date=January 2004|volume=138|issue=2|pages=261–287|doi=10.1023/b:synt.0000013243.57433.e7 |jstor=20118389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those persuaded by Burgess's approach do not say either that it is simply rational to take just box B or that it is conversely rational to take both boxes, but
rather argue a player should make their decision while in the first stage and that that decision should be to commit to only box B. Once in the second stage, the rational decision would be to take both boxes, although by that stage the player should already have made up their mind to take just box B. Burgess has repeatedly emphasized that he is not arguing that the player should change their mind on getting to the second stage. The safe and rational strategy to adopt is to simply make a commitment to just box B while in the first stage and to have no intention of wavering from that commitment, i.e., make an 'unqualified resolution'. Burgess points out that those who make no such commitment and therefore miss out on the $1,000,000 have simply failed to be prepared. In a more recent paper Burgess has explained that, given his analysis, Newcomb's problem should be seen as being akin to the [[Kavka's toxin puzzle|toxin puzzle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Simon|title=Newcomb's problem and its conditional evidence: a common cause of confusion|journal=Synthese |date=February 2012 |volume=184 |issue=3 |pages=319–339 |doi=10.1007/s11229-010-9816-1 |jstor=41411196}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because both problems highlight the fact that one can have a reason to intend to do something without having a reason to actually do it.

With regard to causal structure, Burgess has consistently followed Ellery Eells and others in treating Newcomb's problem as a common cause problem. Contrary to David Lewis, he argues against the idea that Newcomb's problem is another version of the [[prisoner's dilemma]]. Burgess's argument on this point emphasizes the contrasting causal structures of the two problems.

==Consciousness==
Newcomb's paradox can also be related to the question of machine consciousness, specifically if a perfect simulation of a person's brain will generate the consciousness of that person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=R. M. |last=Neal |title=Puzzles of Anthropic Reasoning Resolved Using Full Non-indexical Conditioning |work=|eprint=math.ST/0608592  |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose we take the predictor to be a machine that arrives at its prediction by simulating the brain of the chooser when confronted with the problem of which box to choose. If that simulation generates the consciousness of the chooser, then the chooser cannot tell whether they are standing in front of the boxes in the real world or in the virtual world generated by the simulation in the past. The "virtual" chooser would thus tell the predictor which choice the "real" chooser is going to make.

==Fatalism==
Newcomb's paradox is related to [[fatalism|logical fatalism]] in that they both suppose absolute certainty of the future. In logical fatalism, this assumption of certainty creates circular reasoning ("a future event is certain to happen, therefore it is certain to happen"), while Newcomb's paradox considers whether the participants of its game are able to affect a predestined outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|publisher=Clarendon Press Oxford|year=1996|pages=352–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions to Newcomb's problem==
Many thought experiments similar to or based on Newcomb's problem have been discussed in the literature.&lt;ref name='nozick'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Yudkowsky-TDT'&gt;[http://intelligence.org/files/TDT.pdf Timeless Decision Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a quantum-theoretical version of Newcomb's problem in which box B is [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] with box A has been proposed.&lt;ref name='Piotrowski'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Quantum Information|volume=1|issue=3|year=2003|pages=395–402|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0219749903000279|author1=Piotrowski, Edward|author2=Jan Sladowski |title=Quantum solution to the Newcomb's paradox|doi=10.1142/S0219749903000279|arxiv=quant-ph/0202074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The meta-Newcomb problem===
Another related problem is the meta-Newcomb problem.&lt;ref name='bostrom'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Analysis|volume=61|issue=4|author=Bostrom, Nick|year=2001|title=The Meta-Newcomb Problem|pages=309–310|doi=10.1093/analys/61.4.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setup of this problem is similar to the original Newcomb problem. However, the twist here is that the predictor may elect to decide whether to fill box B after the player has made a choice, and the player does not know whether box B has already been filled. There is also another predictor: a "meta-predictor" who has correctly predicted ''every'' outcome in the past, and who predicts the following: "Either you will choose both boxes, and the predictor will make its decision after you, or you will choose only box B, and the predictor will already have made its decision."

In this situation, a proponent of choosing both boxes is faced with the following dilemma: if the player chooses both boxes, the predictor will not yet have made its decision, and therefore a more rational choice would be for the player to choose box B only. But if the player so chooses, the predictor will already have made its decision, making it impossible for the player's decision to affect the predictor's decision.&lt;ref name='Yudkowsky-TDT'/&gt;

'''Robyn Léwis''' (born October 1929) is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[author]], [[politician]] and former [[archdruid]].

Born '''Robyn Lewis''', he studied at [[Pwllheli Grammar School]] and [[University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]] before becoming a [[solicitor]] and [[barrister]].  He became active in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and stood, unsuccessfully, in [[Denbigh (UK Parliament constituency)|Denbigh]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]].&lt;ref name="times"&gt;''The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970'', p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, Léwis left Labour and joined [[Plaid Cymru]].  He was elected to [[Lleyn Rural District]] Council, and stood for the party in [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarfon]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], where he came second with more than 33% of the vote.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;  He was subsequently elected as a Vice President of Plaid.&lt;ref name="willing"&gt;"[http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/dr-robyn-lewis-im-willing-2817883 Dr Robyn Lewis: I'm willing to return to Plaid Cymru]", ''[[North Wales Daily Post]]'', 18 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rupert Kniele''' (1844–1911) was a German [[volapükist]] and [[volapükologist]]. He wrote the first history of the [[Volapük]] movement (German: ''Das erste Jahrzehnt der Weltsprache Volapük'', English: ''The First Decade of the World Language Volapük'') in 1889. He was the head for [[Württemberg]], and the president of the Württemberg Land Federation for Volapük.

After the crisis of the first Volapük movement (in the time of the Paris conference) he remained loyal to [[Johann Martin Schleyer]] and his version of the language against that of [[Auguste Kerckhoffs]]; however, after several years he began to side with the second, and even to propose, a compromise grammar.  He left the Volapük movement in 1895; after that time, he was never involved with universal languages.

'''Sindhi Adabi Sangat''' ({{lang-sd|سنڌي ادبي سنگت}}) is an organization of the writers of [[Sindhi language]] that has branches in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] and abroad as well. Because of its great number and well-built organization, it is considered as the biggest ''Adabi Tanzeem'' (literary organization) of [[Asia]].

It was in 1952 that [[Abdul Ghafoor Ansari]] and [[Nooruddin Sarki]] coined in Sindhi Adabi Sangat. It initially was restricted to literary activities in [[Karachi]]. However, envied by the circles it soon multiplied to have branches all over Sindh and has now branches oversees as well.

In 1952, Noor-ud-din Sarki and Abdul Ghafoor Ansari restructured the literary forum of Sindhi language and called it Sindhi Adabi Sangat. Initially its activities were confined to the city of Karachi. Inspired by the success of its activities in Karachi, interest developed over the rest of Sindh.  This led to the launch of other branches in other parts of Sindh as well.

Realizing the growing popularity of Sindhi Adabi Sangat, it was invited for the first time as a group in the 'Eighteenth Sindhi Adabi Conference' in April 1956 at Larkana by Jamait-ul-shoora-e-Sindh. Taking the advantage of the opportunity, the Sangat called upon the friends for the central organization of the Sangat. That is how Sindhi Adabi Sangat formed at the central level in 1956 with [[Ayaz Qadri]] as its Secretary and its report was published in quarterly [[Mehran (magazine)|Mehran]]. There are two opinions as regards the origin of Sindhi Adabi Sangat: some believe that the group in the first place was formed before the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, while the others suggest that it started after the independence.

A report published in the August 1947 issue of the monthly magazine ''[[Naeen Dunya]]'', mentioned that: a meeting of Sindhi writers' was called at 'Babrs Shippers chamber' on last Sunday. The meeting was presided over by Prof. [[M.U Malkani]] where among many other writers were present the literary veterans like Lal Chand Dino Mal, Aasanand Mamtura, Chohar Mal Hinduja, Manohar Das Koromal, Jeratti Subani, [[Sobho Gianchandani]], [[Gobind Malhi]], Bihari Chabra, Anand Golani, Kerith Babani, Mohan Punjabi, and Bhagwan Lalvani. It is believed that [[Ghobind Malhi]] was the first secretary to Sindhi Adabi Sangat which was formed during March–April 1947. However, it did not survive the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]].

Taj Baloch, Shamsherul Haidri, [[Anwar Pirzado]], [[Abdul Rehman Pirzado]] [[ Yousif Sindhi]], [[ Dr Zulfiqar Siyal]], [[Dr Adal Soomro ]] and [[Taj Joyo]] have been active members of Sangat in sixties, seventies and eighties.

Whatever the case be, Sindhi Adabi Sangat in its present form commenced in 1952.

The '''Tango Desktop Project''' is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] initiative to create a set of design guidelines and to provide a consistent [[user experience]] for applications on [[desktop environment]]s. The project has created a set of [[computer icon|icon]]s known as the Tango Icon Library, which is described as a "proof of concept".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library |accessdate=2011-06-15 |title=Tango Icon Library – Tango Desktop Project |date=2010-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120233412/http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library |archive-date=2016-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tango Desktop Project is a project of [[freedesktop.org]], and is closely linked with other freedesktop.org guidelines such as the Standard Icon Theming Specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec |title=icon-theme-spec |publisher=Freedesktop.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

The objective of the project is to allow software developers to easily integrate their software, in terms of appearance, with the desktop computer. The visual inconsistencies that arise from different [[Freedesktop.org|desktop]] environments ([[KDE]], [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]]...) and custom distributions make it hard for third parties to target [[Linux]]. Ideally, any project that follows the Tango guidelines will have a [[look and feel]] that matches well with other icons and applications that follow the guidelines.

The style does not aim to be visually unique to distinguish itself. Instead, a secondary aim of the project is to create a standard style that makes applications look appropriate running on operating systems common at that time, such that [[Independent software vendor|ISV]]s will find that their application does not look out of place on [[Windows XP]], [[macOS|Mac OS X]], [[KDE]], [[GNOME]], or [[Xfce]].

Apart from the visual guidelines, the project aims to provide a set of common metaphors for the icons. Tango follows the Freedesktop.org's [[Standard Icon Theming Specification]] and actively develops the [[Freedesktop.org]]'s [[Standard Icon Naming Specification]], defining names for the most common icons and the used metaphors.

Many free software projects, such as [[GIMP]], [[Scribus]], and [[GNOME]], have started to follow the Tango style guidelines for their icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Tango Showroom |date=2008-09-12 |website=Tango Desktop Project |url=http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Showroom |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906111805/http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Showroom |archive-date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[ReactOS]] and [[Mozilla Firefox 3]] uses Tango icons when it is unable to find the user's installed iconset, and also for icons not covered by said iconset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A first look at the Firefox 3 visual refresh for Linux | url = https://blog.mozilla.org/faaborg/2007/11/13/update-on-the-firefox-3-linux-theme/ | date=2007-11-13 | accessdate=2008-07-11 | first = Alex | last = Faaborg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible for proprietary closed source applications to use Tango Desktop Project icons. Examples highlighted by the Tango Showroom include VMware Workstation 6 and Medsphere OpenVista CIS.

== History ==

The Tango icons were originally released under a [[copyleft]] [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses|license]] (Attribution-ShareAlike), but were released into the [[public domain]] in 2009 in order to make it easier to reuse them.

== Palette ==

This is the [[hexadecimal]] color [[Palette (computing)|palette]] used by the Tango Desktop Project, organized by color group and brightness:&lt;ref name=TangoGuidelines/&gt;

'''''Jelly Roll Morton: The Complete Library of Congress Recordings''''' is a 2005 [[box set]] of recordings from [[jazz]] pioneer [[Jelly Roll Morton]].  The set spans 128 tracks over eight [[compact disc|CDs]]. It won two [[Grammy Award]]s in [[48th Grammy Awards|2006]], [[Grammy Award for Best Historical Album|Best Historical Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes|Best Album Notes]].

== Background ==
In 1938, noted [[musicology|musicologist]] and Morton [[biography|biographer]] [[Alan Lomax]] conducted a series of interviews with Morton at the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt; [[Richard Cook (journalist)|Richard Cook]] and [[Brian Morton (Scottish writer)|Brian Morton]] describe these recordings as Jelly Roll Morton's "virtual history of the birth pangs of jazz as it happened in the New Orleans of the turn of the century. His memory was unimpaired, although he chose to tell things as he preferred to remember them, perhaps; and his hands were still in complete command of the keyboard."&lt;ref name="penguin" /&gt;

Excerpts from the sessions first appeared on a 1948 album.&lt;ref name="wynn" /&gt; [[Riverside Records]] issued the recordings as [[LP record]]s in 1955.&lt;ref name="allmusic2" /&gt;  [[Ron Wynn]] and Bruce Boyd Raeburn note that "though the albums came out posthumously, the interviews generated tremendous new interest in Morton's life and music."&lt;ref name="wynn" /&gt; During the 1990s, [[Rounder Records]] released a series of [[compact disc]]s including the musical content, but not the dialogue, from the 1938 sessions.&lt;ref name="allmusic3" /&gt; Both the Riverside and earlier Rounder releases were heavily expurgated, and as recently as 2008, when selections from the complete Rounder collection were featured in a [[BBC Radio 4]] documentary on Morton, presenter Marybeth Hamilton noted that, even then, some of the recordings were still considered unsuitable for broadcast, due to the obscene nature of some of the lyrics and Morton's narration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00by4y6 BBC Radio 4 - The Dream Time of Jazz (originally broadcast 7 July 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2005 release ==
In 2005, Rounder released the 1938 recordings in their entirety as part of an eight-disc box set.&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;  The first seven discs include Lomax's 1938 interviews, in which Morton describes his life and the early days of jazz, plays [[piano]], and [[Singing|sings]].&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt; The eighth disc includes 1949 recordings of Morton's contemporaries, reminiscing about Morton and providing musical demonstrations.&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt;

The set was originally released in a piano-shaped box and included a copy of ''Mister Jelly Roll'', Lomax's biography about Morton.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rounder1" /&gt; The set also includes a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file including additional liner notes, complete transcriptions of the recorded dialogue and lyrics, additional unrecorded interviews and archival documents and photos.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;

In 2007, Rounder released ''Jelly Roll Morton: The Library of Congress Recordings by Alan Lomax'', a single disc consisting of selected highlights from the box set.&lt;ref name="allmusic2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rounder2" /&gt;

arwulf arwulf, writing for [[allmusic]], described the recordings as having been "beautifully restored."&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;

[[Harvey Pekar]], writing for ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'', gave the set a five-star rating (of a possible five), noting that "[Morton's] oral history here is provocative, and his playing bears out some of the hard-to-believe statements that have been made by (and about) him."&lt;ref name="pekar" /&gt;

Richard Cook and Brian Morton, writing for ''[[The Penguin Guide to Jazz]]'', gave the set a four-star rating (of a possible four), describing it as "surely the most comprehensive coverage of the speech and music to date.… It is a wonderfully illustrated lecture on Morton's music by the man who created it. Indispensable records for anyone interested in jazz history."&lt;ref name="penguin" /&gt;

'''William Laughton Lorimer''' (1885-1967) was a Scottish scholar. Born at [[Strathmartine]] on the outskirts of [[Dundee]], he was educated at the [[High School of Dundee]], [[Fettes College]], and [[Trinity College, Oxford]]. He is best known for the [[Bible translations into Scots|translation]] of the [[New Testament]] into [[Scots language|Scots]].

Lorimer spent his professional life as a scholar of [[Ancient Greek]] at various universities, ending his career as Professor of Greek at the [[University of St Andrews]]. However he also had a lifelong interest in the Scots language and besides the translation, was a longtime contributor to the [[Scottish National Dictionary]]. For the last ten years of his life he worked on translating the New Testament from the original Greek sources into Scots. Although he did not finish the final revision of his translation, the work was completed by his son Robin and published posthumously on his behalf in 1983.

'''Write-only documentation''' ('''WOD''') is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] term for [[documentation]] that is [http://www.doceo.co.uk/reflection/2006/10/on-write-only-documents.htm written to satisfy a process] but never read subsequent to its writing.

==Derogatory term==
While '''write-only documentation''' may have begun as a [[Terminology|derogatory term]] assigned by [[technical writer]]s/[[programmer]]s to documentation that had no other use than to be a required text to meet [[Contract|contractual obligations]], the term is in use as a general term for documentation that is seen to be a waste of effort.&lt;ref name="sphereofinfluence.com"&gt;http://www.sphereofinfluence.com/roi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passing comments==
Most online [[reference]]s to '''write-only documentation''' are made in passing when explaining or writing about some other subject. For example, the term is used in passing when building the case for [[Write-only memory (joke)|write-only memory]], the subject of an April Fool's Day joke in 1973 from engineers at integrated circuit manufacturer [[Signetics]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wyrdology.com/festivals/april-fools-day/wom.html&lt;/ref&gt; in  discussing a community project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.krysalis.org/cgi-bin/krywiki.pl?CoPDoC&lt;/ref&gt; when discussing accountability in running software building projects,&lt;ref name="sphereofinfluence.com" /&gt; and referring to a project as potential to degenerate into write-only documentation.&lt;ref&gt;http://publica.fraunhofer.de/eprints/N-39469.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overall use of the term in language==
While the term "write-only documentation" has been in use for several years (it can be determined that it was in use in 1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~lo/95.12/0345.html|title=Learning-Org Dec 1995: Learning Histories LO4315|website=www.theworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is unclear as to where it started to gain traction and what led to its general use in software projects/documentation projects.
