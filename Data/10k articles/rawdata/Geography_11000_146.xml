'''2EC''' is a radio station broadcasting to the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]] of [[New South Wales]], Australia, specifically the local government areas of [[Eurobodalla]] and [[Bega Valley]]. It is owned by East Coast Radio Pty. Ltd, which is a subsidiary of [[Grant Broadcasters]].

== History ==
2BE began test broadcasting in February 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | page = 4 | title = LOCAL and GENERAL. | work = [[The Southern Record and Advertiser]] | location = Candelo, NSW | accessdate = 2014-11-08 | date = 1937-02-05 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133468856 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The station was officially opened on September 30, 1937. &lt;ref name=opening&gt;{{Cite news | page = 4 | title = LOCAL and GENERAL. | work = [[The Southern Record and Advertiser]] | location = Candelo, NSW | accessdate = 2014-11-08 | date = 1937-10-01 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133473503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


2EC has a long [[Radio broadcast stations (AM radio) of New South Wales - historical summary#2EC Bega|history]] of serving its community.

== Frequencies ==
*'''765 AM'''- [[Bega Valley]] and surrounds. Can be heard throughout most of the coverage area, and along the coastline for great distances. Transmitter is located at Kalaru {{nowrap|({{coord|-36.7442|149.9369|type:landmark_region:AU|display=inline|name=2EC, Kalaru transmitter}}).}}
*'''1584 AM'''- Narooma town and immediate surrounds. Because of the low power used by this translator, it can only be heard around 30&amp;nbsp;km distant. Transmitter is located just outside Narooma {{nowrap|({{coord|-36.2276|150.1384|type:landmark_region:AU|display=inline|name=2EC, Narooma transmitter}}).}}
*'''105.5 FM'''- [[Eden, New South Wales|Eden]] and surrounds. Transmitting 1&amp;nbsp;kW from Bimmil Hill near Eden {{nowrap|({{coord|-37.0110|149.8896|type:landmark_region:AU|display=inline|name=2EC, Bimmil Hill transmitter}}),}} the translator covers Merimbula, Eden and Mallacoota (VIC) adequately. In exceptional atmospheric conditions, this transmitter can cover much of the 2EC license area, and has been heard as far north as Sydney.
*'''105.9 FM'''- Eurobodalla local government area, plus some towns in the southern Shoalhaven such as Bawley Point and Lake Tabourie. Transmits at 20&amp;nbsp;kW (directional pattern) from Mt. Wandera west of Moruya {{nowrap|({{coord|-35.7960|150.0054|type:landmark_region:AU|display=inline|name=2EC, Mt. Wandera transmitter}}).}} In good atmospheric conditions, the transmitter can be heard in the Bega Valley region, as well as north to the Shoalhaven and Illawarra. The transmission has been heard as far north as Buladelah on the NSW north coast.

== Programming ==
The station airs an [[adult contemporary]] format, playing the South Coast's biggest variety of music. 2EC primarily targets 35- to 54-year-olds.

In contrast to many radio stations in regional Australia, 2EC airs very little networked programming. A strong focus is on the community, with segments such as ''Lost and Found'', ''Jobfile'' and ''Community Contact'' featured throughout the day. Discussions about local events and issues are held regularly, with strong local news heard most hours. 

The 2EC morning show often speaks to key local people such as Bega MP Andrew Constance and Eden Monaro Federal Member Mike Kelly.

The radio station has a very local feel, which is also incorporated with their websites, www.2ec.com.au and www.guidetofarsouthcoast.com.au

== On air lineup (weekdays) ==
*'''Kimmi Saker'''- 6 am to 9am)
*'''Johnny C'''- 9am to 12pm (including flock of 80's)
*'''The Run Home With Tim'''- 2 pm to 6 pm
*'''''20 20 Retro Countdown with Aaron Stevens'''''- 12 pm to 2 pm

Weekend programming includes the ''2EC Fishing Show'', ''Real Estate Show'' and the ''2EC Sports Show with Tony Megahey''. Networked music program ''My Generation'' on Sunday mornings from 7am. The station is unique in NSW in that it takes both NRL and AFL coverage, possibly owing to its position near the Victorian border. AFL is heard Saturday afternoon from midday, whilst NRL is covered Friday night and Sunday afternoons with the ''2EC Continuous Call Team''.

== Affiliations ==
* Croc Media (AFL coverage)
* [[2GB]] Sydney (NRL coverage)

Power FM South Coast is a sister station, playing contemporary hit music.

The '''83rd parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 83 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[true north|north]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]], in the [[Arctic]]. It passes through the [[Arctic Ocean]] and  [[North America]].

The [[Extreme points of Earth#Latitude and longitude|northernmost]] land on earth, whether the permanent [[Kaffeklubben Island]] or the shifting/resubmerging [[Bar (river morphology)|gravel banks]] of [[Oodaaq]], [[ATOW1996]], or [[83-42]] are roughly 40 [[Minute_of_arc#Cartography|minutes of arc]] (75 to 79 kilometres) north of this parallel.  

==Around the world==
Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the parallel 83° north passes through:

'''''Ash-Sharāṫ''''' or '''''Ash-Sharâh''''' ({{lang-ar|اَلـشَّـرَاة}}, also known as '''''Bilâd ash-Sharāṫ''''' ({{lang-ar|بِـلَاد اَلـشَّـرَاة}}) or '''''Jibâl ash-Sharâṫ''''' ({{lang-ar|جِـبَـال اَلـشَّـرَاة}})) is a highland region in modern-day southern [[Jordan]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was formerly a sub-district in [[Bilad al-Sham]] during the [[7th century|7th]]–[[11th century|11th]] centuries [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="Johns et al., 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johns |first1=Jeremy |editor1-last=Rogan |editor1-first=Eugene L. |editor2-last=Tell |editor2-first=Tariq |title=Village, Steppe and State: The Social Origins of Modern Jordan |pages=10–11 |publisher=British Academic Press |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lh1_ernmsnwC&amp;pg=PA10 |chapter=''The Long Durée'': State and Settlement Strategies in Southern Transjordan across the Islamic Centuries |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salibi1977"&gt;{{cite book |last=Salibi |first=Kamal S. |authorlink=Kamal Salibi |title=Syria Under Islam: Empire on Trial |pages=74–1097 |volume=1 |publisher=Caravan Books |location=Delmar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzWCAAAAIAAJ |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salibi1993"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salibi |first1=Kamal S. |title=The Modern History of Jordan |pages=4–36 |publisher=I.

==Geography==
In modern-day [[Jordan]], the region of Al-Sharat starts immediately south of [[Wadi Mujib]]. The northern range contains mountains with peaks up to 1,200 meters above sea level, while to the south the mountains get as high as 1,500 meters above sea level. The principal city of Bilad al-Sharat is [[al-Karak]]. The northern part of the region in Jordan is under the administration of the [[Karak Governorate]], while the more arid part south of [[Wadi Arabah]] comes under the [[Ma'an Governorate]].&lt;ref name="Salibi1993"/&gt;

In the [[9th century]], Al-Sharat's capital was Adhruh, but by the late [[10th century]], it apparently was replaced by [[Zoara|Sughar]] (Zoar). Other principal towns in the district included [[Tabuk, Saudi Arabia|Tabuk]], [[Ma'an]] (Mu'an), [[Midian|Madyan]], Aynunah (on the northern [[Red Sea]] coast), [[Ayla (city)|Wayla]] (Ayla) and [[Rabba|Maab]] (Rabba).&lt;ref name="LeStrange1890"&gt;{{cite book |title=Palestine Under the Moslems: A Description of Syria and the Holy Land from A.D. 650 to 1500 |url=https://archive.org/details/palestineundermo00lestuoft |author=Le Strange, G. |authorlink=Guy Le Strange |publisher=Committee of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] |location=[[London]] |year=1890 |pages=28–39 |oclc=1004386 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From the beginning of the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]], Al-Sharat formed the southern ''kurah'' (district) of ''[[Jund Dimashq]]'' (Province of Damascus), until the late 9th century, after which it became part of ''[[Jund Filastin]]'' (Province of Palestine).&lt;ref name="Salibi1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeStrange1890"/&gt; It was the [[Tulunids]] who first attached Al-Sharat to Filastin for practical purposes, as the district was closer to Filastin than [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name="Salibi1993"/&gt; In 985, during the late [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period, the [[Jerusalem]]ite geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] described Al-Sharat as its own district, neither belonging to Dimashq nor Filastin, in the larger province of ''Ash-[[Shaam]]'' ({{lang-ar|اَلـشَّـام}}, the 'Syria' or '[[Levant]]').&lt;ref name="LeStrange1890"/&gt;

The district of Al-Sharat corresponded with the mountains of [[Moab]]. Persian geographer [[Al-Istakhri]] (d. 957) described the district as "extremely fertile and rich" and dominated by marauding [[Bedouin]] tribes.&lt;ref name="LeStrange1890"/&gt; In the late 10th century, the old-established [[Qays–Yaman rivalry|Yamani]] tribes of [[Lakhmids|Lakhm]] and [[Banu Judham|Judham]] were engaged in a struggle over dominance of Al-Sharat with newcomers from the tribe of [[Tayy]].&lt;ref name="Salibi1977"/&gt; Though information about the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] administration over the Levant is vague, Caliph [[al-Aziz Billah|al-Aziz]] (975–996) may have made Al-Sharat (south of [[Wadi Mujib]]) its own province which lasted until the [[Crusaders|Crusader]] invasion in the early [[12th century]].&lt;ref name="Johns et al., 1994"/&gt;

The Crusaders annexed Al-Sharat in the 1110s. Initially, it was part of the royal [[demesne]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], but in 1126, the feudal lordship of [[Oultrejordain]] was formed out of the former district of Al-Sharat. Its jurisdiction extended from the [[Zarqa River]] in the north to the [[Red Sea]] in the south. The Crusaders built the fortresses of [[Montreal (Crusader castle)|Montreal]] (Shawbak) in 1115 and [[al-Karak|Crac]] (al-Karak) in 1145.&lt;ref name="Johns et al., 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salibi1993"/&gt; Both became major centers of the lordship. By the mid-12th century, the inhabitants of Al-Sharat were mainly Bedouin from various [[Qays]]i tribes. At that time, the Muslim geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] (d. 1165) wrote about the fertility of the district and that it produced an abundance of olives, almonds, figs, grapes and pomegranates.&lt;ref name="LeStrange1890"/&gt;

Bilad al-Sharat was conquered by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] under [[Saladin]] in 1187. During Ayyubid rule, Syrian geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (d. 1229) noted that Al-Sharat was a mountainous region through which the [[Hajj]] caravan road from [[Damascus]] to [[Mecca]] passed.&lt;ref name="LeStrange1890"/&gt; During [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] rule, Al-Sharat became ''Mamlakat al-Karak'' (Province of al-Karak). By the [[mid-19th century]], Bedouin from the [[Howeitat|Huwaytat]] tribe were encroaching into the southern parts of Bilad al-Sharat, and amid the Bedouin-induced anarchy in the region, Christians from [[Tafilah]] and al-Karak began fleeing to the north. During that time, Bilad al-Sharat, with the exception of [[Aqaba]], was largely part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] district of Mutassarifyya al-Karak.&lt;ref name="Salibi1993"/&gt;

'''Apparent wind''' is the wind experienced by a moving object.

==Definition of apparent wind==
The ''apparent wind'' is the wind experienced by an observer in motion and is the [[relative velocity]] of the wind in relation to the observer.{{CN|date=September 2016}}

The ''[[velocity]] of the apparent wind'' is the [[vector sum]] of the ''velocity of the headwind'' (which is the velocity a moving object would experience in still air) plus the ''velocity of the true wind''.  The headwind is the [[additive inverse]] of the object's velocity; therefore, the ''velocity of the apparent wind'' can also be defined as a vector sum of the ''velocity of the true wind'' minus the ''velocity of the object''.{{CN|date=September 2016}}

==Apparent wind in sailing==
In [[sailing]], ''apparent wind'' is the speed and direction of wind indicated by a wind instrument ([[anemometer]]) on a ''moving'' craft (on water, land or ice) in undisturbed air. It is composed of the ''combined'' speeds and directions of the craft and wind observed by a ''stationary'' wind instrument—the ''true wind''. A true wind coming from the bow increases the apparent wind induced by the speed of the craft, coming from the stern it decreases apparent wind, and coming from the side the apparent wind angle and speed change according to the combined speed and direction of each the craft and the true wind. Apparent wind is important to sailors in order to set sail angle with respect to the wind and to anticipate how much power the wind will generate on a [[point of sail]]. Apparent wind differs in speed and direction from the '''true wind''' that is experienced by a stationary observer and composed of the true wind speed (TWS) and true wind direction (TWD) or the TWS and true wind angle (TWA) relative to the boat if it were stationary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are My Electronics Telling Me About Boatspeed and Heading?|url=https://www.sailingworld.com/what-are-my-electronics-telling-me-about-boatspeed-and-heading|website=Sailing World|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[nautical terminology]], apparent wind is measured in [[Knot (unit)|knots]] and [[degree (angle)|degree]]s.

Note that a number of additional factors come into play when converting the measurements from the masthead anemometer into the true wind if a high degree of accuracy is required, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornton|first1=Tim|title=The Offshore Yacht|publisher=Adlard Coles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchaj|first1=C.A.|title=The AeroHydrodynamics of Sailing|publisher=Adlard Coles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sailing Instruments Calibration|url=http://www.ockam.com/category/sailing-instruments-calibration/|website=Ockam Instruments|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Leeway]] (or drift on power vessels) - it is very seldom that a craft is pointing in the direction it is going, and on a sailboat the angle of leeway is the difference between the heading of the craft and its actual track through the water. This must be corrected for when converting apparent wind angle to true wind direction. The same effect is found when the craft is altering course.
* Mast twist - the rigging loads often put a significant amount of torsion on the mast, especially if the rig has runners, so it is twisted along its length
* Mast rotation - many racing [[multihull]]s have a mast that can be rotated, so the anemometer reading needs to be corrected by the angle of rotation of the mast
* Heel angle - this is a simple trigonometric correction
* Upwash from the sails - the airflow around the top of the mast is distorted by the presence of the sails. This effect varies with the sails set at the time, the wind speed and the point of sail, but is noticed by the true wind angle changing from port to starboard tack, and the true wind speed changing from when beating to running
* Boat motions - as the masthead is so distant from the centre of motion of the craft, inertial effect on both the wind vane and the anemometer cups can be significant when the craft is moving, especially when pitching and rolling
* Wind shear - there can be a significant change in both wind speed and direction between the water's surface and the top of the mast, especially in conditions of unstable, light airs. The wind instruments are just measuring conditions at the masthead, and these are not necessarily the same at all heights

In the presence of a current, the true wind is considered to be that measured on the craft drifting with the water over the bottom, and wind with respect to the sea bed as the ''ground'' or ''geographical wind''.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Instruments==
The '''apparent wind''' on board (a boat) is often quoted as a speed measured by a [[Mast (sailing)|masthead]] [[transducer]] containing an [[anemometer]] and [[Weather vane|wind vane]] that measures wind speed in [[Knot (unit)|knots]] and wind direction in degrees relative to the [[Course (navigation)|heading]] of the boat. Modern instrumentation can calculate the true wind velocity when the apparent wind and boat speed and direction are input.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Implications on sailing speeds==
In [[sailboat racing]], and especially in [[speed sailing]], apparent wind is a vital factor, when determining the [[points of sail]] a sailboat can effectively travel in. 
A vessel traveling at increasing speed relative to the ''prevailing wind'' will encounter the wind driving the sail at a decreasing angle and increasing velocity. Eventually, the increased drag and diminished degree of efficiency of a sail at extremely low [[Angle of attack|angles]] will cause a loss of accelerating force. This constitutes the main limitation to the speed of wind-driven vessels and vehicles.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

[[windsurfing|Windsurfers]] and certain types of boats are able to sail faster than the true wind. These include fast [[multihull]]s and some [[Planing (sailing)|planing]] monohulls.  [[ice yachting|Ice-sailors]] and [[land sailing|land-sailors]] also usually fall into this category, because of their relatively low amount of [[drag (physics)|drag]] or [[friction]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}

In the foiling AC72 America's cup catamarans, the boats sail through the water at up to double the environmental wind strength. The effect of this is to radically change the apparent wind direction when sailing "downwind". In these boats the forward speed is so great that the apparent wind is always forward—at an angle that varies between 2 and 4 degrees to the wing sail. This means that AC72's  are effectively tacking downwind, although at a greater angle than the normal 45-degree upwind angle, usually between 50 and 70 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;TVNZ Live America's cup Broadcast. Interview with Tom Schnackenburg. 22/9/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other areas of relevance==
In [[fixed-wing aircraft]], apparent wind is what is experienced on board, and it determines the necessary speeds for take-off and landing.  [[Aircraft carrier]]s generally steam directly upwind at maximum speed, in order to increase apparent wind and reduce the necessary take-off velocity.  Land-based [[airport]] traffic, as well as most mid-sized and large birds generally take off and land facing upwind for the same reason.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Calculating apparent velocity and angle==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2016}}
&lt;math&gt;A = \sqrt{W^2 + V^2 + 2WV\cos{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; = velocity (boat speed over ground, always =&gt; 0)
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = true wind velocity (always =&gt; 0)
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = true pointing angle in degrees (0 = upwind, 180 = downwind)
* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = apparent wind velocity  (always =&gt; 0)
The above formula is derived from the [[Law of cosines]] and using &lt;math&gt;\cos(\alpha') = \cos(180^\circ-\alpha) = -\cos(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;.

The angle of apparent wind (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;) can be calculated from the measured velocity of the boat and wind using the inverse cosine in degrees (&lt;math&gt;\arccos&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;math&gt; \beta = \arccos \left( \frac{W\cos \alpha+V}{A} \right) = \arccos \left( \frac{W\cos \alpha+V}{\sqrt{W^2 + V^2 +2WV\cos{\alpha}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

If the velocity of the boat and the velocity and the angle of the apparent wind are known, for instance from a [[Apparent wind#Instruments|measurement]], the true wind velocity and direction can be calculated with:

&lt;math&gt;W = \sqrt{A^2 + V^2 - 2AV\cos{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \arccos \left( \frac{A\cos \beta-V}{W} \right) = \arccos \left( \frac{A\cos \beta-V}{\sqrt{A^2 + V^2 -2AV\cos{\beta}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

''Note:'' Due to quadrant ambiguity, this equation for &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is only valid when the apparent winds are coming from the [[starboard]] direction (0° &lt; ''β'' &lt; 180°).  For [[port]] apparent winds (180° &lt; ''β'' &lt; 360° or 0° &gt; ''β'' &gt; -180°), the true pointing angle (''α'') has the opposite sign:

&lt;math&gt; \alpha = -\arccos \left( \frac{A\cos \beta-V}{W} \right) = -\arccos \left( \frac{A\cos \beta-V}{\sqrt{A^2 + V^2 -2AV\cos{\beta}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Aquatic biomonitoring''' is the [[science]] of inferring the [[ecological]] condition of [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, [[stream]]s, and [[wetland]]s by examining the [[organism]]s that live there. While aquatic biomonitoring is the most common form of such biomonitoring, any [[ecosystem]] can be studied in this manner.

Biomonitoring typically takes different approaches:

* ''[[Bioassay]]s'', where test organisms are exposed to an environment to see if [[mutation]]s or deaths occur. Typical organisms used in bioassays are [[fish]], water fleas ([[Daphnia]]), and [[frog]]s.
* ''Community assessments'', also called ''[[biosurvey]]s,'' where an entire [[Community (ecology)|community]] of organisms is sampled, to see what types of [[taxa]] remain. In [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, these assessments often focus on [[invertebrate]]s, [[algae]], [[macrophyte]]s (aquatic plants), fish, or [[amphibian]]s.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= 6|pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, other large vertebrates ([[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s) are considered as well.
* ''Online biomonitoring devices'', using the ability of animals to permanently taste their environment. Different types of animals are used for that purpose either under lab or field conditions. The use of valve opening/closing activity of [[clams]] is one of the possible ways to monitor ''in-situ'' the quality of freshwater and coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;

Aquatic invertebrates have the longest history of use in biomonitoring programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Barbour |first1=M.T. |last2=Gerritsen |first2=J. |last3=Snyder |first3=B.D. |last4=Stribling |first4=J.B. |date=1999 |title=Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers: Periphyton, Benthic Macroinvertebrates and Fish |edition=2nd |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20004OQK.txt |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Office of Water |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 841-B-99-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical unpolluted temperate streams of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], certain insect taxa predominate. Mayflies ([[Ephemeroptera]]), caddisflies ([[Trichoptera]]), and stoneflies ([[Plecoptera]]) are the most common insects in these undisturbed streams. In rivers disturbed by [[urbanization]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and other perturbations, flies ([[Diptera]]), and especially midges (family [[Chironomidae]]) predominate.  Aquatic invertebrates are responsive to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J.E., K.B. Lunde, R.D. Mazor, L.A. Bêche, E.P. McElravy, and V.H. Resh. 2010.

== Importance==
Aquatic Biomonitoring is important in monitoring marine life and their ecosystems. Monitoring aquatic life can also be beneficial in understanding land ecosystems as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/dep/water/monitoring/biomonitoring/why.htm|title=Why Biological Monitoring? -- Monitoring and Assessment, Bureau of Land and Water Quality, Maine Department of Environmental Protection|website=www.maine.gov|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before there were tetrapods, there were fish. These fish then evolved into tetrapods that we see today. Because of this, aquatic life still has a major impact on life on land. Aquatic biomonitoring can represent the overall health and status of the environment, detect different environmental trends and how different stressors will affect those trends, and interpret the affect of different environmental activity will have on the overall health of the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straightupenvironmental.com/biomonitoring/|title=biomonitoring – StraightUp Environmental|website=www.straightupenvironmental.com|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution and general stresses to aquatic life can have a huge impact on the environment in general. The main sources of pollution to oceans, rivers, and lakes are [[sewage]], [[oil spill]]s, [[land runoff]], [[litter]]ing, [[ocean mining]], and [[nuclear waste]]. These types of pollution cause a huge upset to marine life and can endanger any species in the water or that live close to the water. When aquatic species are affected, it causes a ripple effect. Many aquatic animals are a main food source for many land animals. For example: if a specific species of fish ingest toxins and become sick, the birds that ingest that species of fish will also become sick. Then the animal that ingest that bird will also become sick. This is a problem that can be avoided by monitoring all life and conditions in different bodies of water, including fresh and salt water.

The main draw back on aquatic biomonitoring is simplifying data and making data easier for all to understand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking data from monitoring sites and making it available for people to use in the health fields and other environmental fields can be a challenge.

== Practice ==
Mechanisms that are used for Aquatic Biomonitoring are monitoring and assessing aquatic species and ecosystems, monitoring the behavior of certain aquatic species and assessing any changes in species behavior, and looking at contaminants in the water and their effect on marine life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartram|first=Jamie|date=1996-01-01|title=Water quality monitoring: a practical guide to the design and implementation of freshwater quality studies and monitoring programmes|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253953121|journal=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is graded on several scales. One is the water’s appearance. Is the water clear, cloudy, full of algae. Next, water is graded on its chemistry levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/23847.html|title=Biomonitoring - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; How much of each enzyme or mineral located in the water is extremely important. Any changes in any of these factors can change the water’s environment overall and therefore change how life in the water is. These changes can severely impact aquatic life. Certain contaminants, such as metal and certain organic waste, can cause death of some individuals and which could ultimately cause extinction to certain species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This would be detrimental to not only aquatic ecosystems, but also to some ecosystems on land as well. Extinction of any species can have a ripple effect and can cause disruption in other biomes and ecosystems.

The '''Arctic ice pack''' is the [[sea ice]] cover of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and its vicinity. The Arctic ice pack undergoes a regular seasonal cycle in which ice melts in spring and summer, reaches a minimum around mid-September, then increases during fall and winter. Summer ice cover in the [[Arctic]] is about 50% of winter cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/ Polar Sea Ice Cap and Snow – Cryosphere Today], University of Illinois&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the ice survives from one year to the next. Currently 28% of Arctic [[Oceanic basin|basin]] sea ice is [[Sea ice#Old sea ice|multi-year ice]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2008/040708.html Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis – April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; thicker than seasonal ice: up to {{convert|3|-|4|m|abbr=on|1|sp=us}} thick over large areas, with ridges up to {{convert|20|m|abbr=on|1|sp=us}} thick.  As well as the regular seasonal cycle there has been an underlying trend of [[Arctic sea ice decline|declining sea ice in the Arctic]] in recent decades.

==Climatic importance==
===Energy balance effects===
{{Main|Albedo}}

[[Sea ice]] has an important effect on the heat balance of the [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]] oceans, since it insulates the (relatively) warm ocean from the much colder air above, thus reducing heat loss from the oceans. Sea ice is highly [[albedo|reflective of solar radiation]], reflecting about 60% of incoming [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]] when bare and about 80% when covered with snow. This is due to a feedback known as the albedo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huwald|first=Hendrik|last2=Higgins|first2=Chad W.|last3=Boldi|first3=Marc-Olivier|last4=Bou-Zeid|first4=Elie|last5=Lehning|first5=Michael|last6=Parlange|first6=Marc B.|date=2009-08-01|title=Albedo effect on radiative errors in air temperature measurements|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008WR007600/abstract|journal=Water Resources Research|language=en|volume=45|issue=8|pages=W08431|doi=10.1029/2008wr007600|issn=1944-7973|bibcode=2009WRR....45.8431H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is much greater than the reflectivity of the sea (about 10%) and thus the ice also affects the absorption of sunlight at the surface.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Albert |last1=Buixadé Farré |first2=Scott R. |last2=Stephenson |first3=Linling |last3=Chen |first4=Michael |last4=Czub |first5=Ying |last5=Dai |first6=Denis |last6=Demchev |first7=Yaroslav |last7=Efimov |first8=Piotr |last8=Graczyk |first9=Henrik |last9=Grythe |first10=Kathrin |last10=Keil |first11=Niku |last11=Kivekäs |first12=Naresh |last12=Kumar |first13=Nengye |last13=Liu |first14=Igor |last14=Matelenok |first15=Mari |last15=Myksvoll |first16=Derek |last16=O'Leary |first17=Julia |last17=Olsen |first18=Sachin |last18=Pavithran .A.P. |first19=Edward |last19=Petersen |first20=Andreas |last20=Raspotnik |first21=Ivan |last21=Ryzhov |first22=Jan |last22=Solski |first23=Lingling |last23=Suo |first24=Caroline |last24=Troein |first25=Vilena |last25=Valeeva |first26=Jaap |last26=van Rijckevorsel |first27=Jonathan |last27=Wighting |date=16 October 2014 |title=Commercial Arctic shipping through the Northeast Passage: Routes, resources, governance, technology, and infrastructure |journal=[[Polar Geography]] |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |page=14 |doi=10.1080/1088937X.2014.965769 |doi-access=free |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1088937X.2014.965769 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205092242/http://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/item/escidoc%3A676888%3A6/component/escidoc%3A826920/676888.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=More references need to be cited to support this paragraph|date=December 2015}}

===Hydrological effects===
The sea ice cycle is also an important source of dense (saline) "[[bottom water]]". When sea water freezes it leaves most of its salt content behind. The remaining surface water, made dense by the extra salinity, sinks and produces dense [[water mass]]es such as [[North Atlantic Deep Water]]. This production of dense water is essential in maintaining the [[thermohaline circulation]], and the accurate representation of these processes is important in [[climate model]]ling.

=== Odden ===
In the Arctic, a key area where [[pancake ice]] forms the dominant ice type over an entire region is the so-called [[Greenland Sea#Odden ice tongue|Odden ice tongue]] in the [[Greenland Sea]]. The Odden (the word is [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for ''the headland'') grows eastward from the main East Greenland ice edge in the vicinity of 72–74°N during the winter because of the presence of very cold polar surface water in the [[Jan Mayen Current]], which diverts some water eastward from the [[East Greenland Current]] at that latitude. Most of the old ice continues south, driven by the wind, so a cold open water surface is exposed on which new ice forms as [[Frazil ice|frazil]] and pancake in the rough seas.

Records of Arctic Sea ice from the United Kingdom’s [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]] go back to the turn of the 20th century, although the quality of the data before 1950 is debatable. Reliable [[measurement of sea ice|measurements of sea ice]] edge begin within the satellite era. From the late 1970s, the [[Scanning multichannel microwave radiometer|Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer]] (SMMR) on [[Seasat]] (1978) and [[Nimbus program|Nimbus 7]] (1978–87) satellites provided information that was independent of solar illumination or meteorological conditions. The frequency and accuracy of passive microwave measurements improved with the launch of the DMSP F8 [[Special sensor microwave/imager|Special Sensor Microwave/Imager]] (SSMI) in 1987. Both the [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice area|sea ice area]] and [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] are estimated, with the latter being larger, as it is defined as the area of ocean with at least 15% [[sea ice]].

A modeling study of the 52-year period from 1947 to 1999 found a statistically significant trend in Arctic ice volume of −3% per decade; splitting this into wind-forced and temperature forced components shows it to be essentially all caused by the temperature forcing. A computer-based, time-resolved calculation of sea ice volume, fitted to various measurements, revealed that monitoring the ice volume is much more significant for evaluating sea ice loss than pure area considerations.&lt;ref name="zhangrothrock1" /&gt;

The trends from 1979 to 2002 have been a statistically significant Arctic sea ice decrease of −2.5%&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.9% per decade during those 23 years.&lt;ref name = "Cavalieri"&gt;Cavalieri et al. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Climate models simulated this trend in 2002.&lt;ref name = "Harvard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gregory|first1=J.

New research shows the Arctic Sea ice to be melting faster than predicted by any of the 18 computer models used by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] in preparing its 2007 assessments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucar.edu/news/releases/2007/seaice.shtml NCAR and NSIDC "Arctic Ice Retreating More Quickly Than Computer Models Project"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a new record low of about {{convert|3500000|km²|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/en/home/seaice_extent.htm |title=Arctic Sea Ice Extent, as of September 18, 2012 |publisher=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919191010/http://www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/en/home/seaice_extent.htm |archive-date=September 19, 2012 |access-date=September 18, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/staggering-arctic-ice-loss-smashes-melt-records-20120917-260zu.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title='Staggering' Arctic ice loss smashes melt records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the overall mass balance, the volume of [[sea ice]] depends on the thickness of the ice as well as the areal extent. While the satellite era has enabled better measurement of trends in areal extent, accurate ice thickness measurements remain a challenge. "Nonetheless, the extreme loss of this summer’s sea ice cover and the slow onset of freeze-up portends lower than normal ice extent throughout autumn and winter, and the ice that grows back is likely to be fairly thin". As more and more of the sea ice is thinner [[Sea ice#First-year sea ice|first-year ice]] the greater effect storms have on its stability with turbulence resulting from major [[extratropical cyclone]]s resulting in extensive fractures of sea ice.&lt;ref name=CC031313&gt;{{cite news|title=Large Fractures Spotted in Vulnerable Arctic Sea Ice|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/large-fractures-spotted-in-arctic-sea-ice-15728|accessdate=March 14, 2013|newspaper=Climate Central|date=March 13, 2013|author=Andrew Freedman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toponymy ==
{{Hatnote|See also [[Names of European cities in different languages: B|Other names of Brussels]]}}

=== Etymology ===
The most common theory of the origin of the name ''Brussels'' is that it derives from the [[Old Dutch]] {{lang|odt|Bruocsella}}, ''Broekzele'' or ''Broeksel'', meaning "marsh" (''bruoc'' / ''broek'') and "home" (''sella'' / ''zele'' / ''sel'') or "home in the marsh".&lt;ref&gt;[[Geert van Istendael]] ''Arm Brussel'', uitgeverij Atlas, {{ISBN|90-450-0853-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Vindicianus]], the bishop of [[Cambrai]], made the first recorded reference to the place ''Brosella'' in 695,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nouvelles archives historiques, philosophiques, et littéraires|volume=1 |author1=Jean Baptiste D'Hane |author2=François Huet |author3=P.A. Lenz |author4=H.G. Moke |year= 1837|publisher=C. Annoot- Braeckman |location=Gent |isbn= |page=405 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0c4aAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA405|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was still a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]. The names of all the municipalities in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] are also of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] origin, except for [[Evere]], which is [[Celtic languages|Celtic]].

=== Pronunciation ===
In [[French language|French]], ''Bruxelles'' is pronounced {{IPA-fr|bʁysɛl|}} (the ''x'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|s}}, like in [[English language|English]]) and in Dutch, ''Brussel'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|ˈbrʏsəl|}}. Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as ''Bruxellois'' and in Dutch as ''Brusselaars''. In the [[Brabantian dialect]] of Brussels, they are called ''Brusseleers'' or ''Brusseleirs''.

Originally, the written ''x'' noted the group {{IPAc-en|k|s}}. In the [[Belgian French]] pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the ''k'' eventually disappeared and ''z'' became ''s'', as reflected in the current [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling]], whereas in the more conservative [[French orthography|French form]], the spelling remained. The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|k|s}} in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels' usage. In [[France]], the pronunciations {{IPA-fr|bʁyksɛl|}} and {{IPA-fr|bʁyksɛlwa|}} (for ''bruxellois'') are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium.

The history of Brussels is closely linked to that of [[Western Europe]]. Traces of human settlement go back to the [[Stone Age]], with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of [[megalith]]s, [[dolmen]]s and [[Menhir|standing stones]] (''Plattesteen'', ''Tomberg''). During [[late antiquity]], the region was home to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered near the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/bruxelles/detail_decouverte-majeure-a-bruxelles-des-vestiges-romains-retrouves-sur-le-site-de-tour-et-taxis?id=9048235|title=Bruxelles: des vestiges romains retrouvés sur le site de Tour et Taxis|date=6 August 2015|work=RTBF Info|access-date=28 April 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://patrimoine.brussels/news/les-romains-de-tour-et-taxis|title=Les Romains de Tour &amp; Taxis — Patrimoine – Erfgoed|website=patrimoine.brussels|language=fr|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it was incorporated into the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]].

The origin of the settlement which was to become Brussels lies in [[Gaugericus|Saint Gaugericus]]' construction of a chapel on [[Saint Gaugericus Island|an island]] in the river [[Zenne|Senne]] around 580.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Brussels-History.html |title=Brussels History |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lotharingia|Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia]] transferred the relics of Saint [[Gudula]] from [[Moorsel]] to the Saint Gaugericus chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[Lambert I of Leuven]], Count of [[County of Leuven|Leuven]], gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the Senne, on an important trade route between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], and [[Cologne]], Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (''Treurenberg'', ''[[Coudenberg]]'' and [[Sablon (Brussels)|''Sablon'']] areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] (1225), replacing an older [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became [[Duke of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]]. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In the early 13th century, Brussels got [[Fortifications of Brussels|its first walls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=nl |url=http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |title=Zo ontstond Brussel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120140134/http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |archive-date=20 November 2007 |trans-title=This is how Brussels originated |publisher=Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie [Commission of the Flemish Community in Brussels]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after this, the city grew significantly. To let the city expand, [[second walls of Brussels|a second set of walls]] was erected, between 1356 and 1383. Traces of it can still be seen today, mostly because the ''[[small ring]]'', a series of roadways bounding the historic city centre, follows its former course.

=== Early modern ===
[[File:Brussel.1610.a.jpg|thumb|left|A view of Brussels {{circa}} 1610|alt=]]
In the 15th century, by means of the wedding of heiress [[Margaret III of Flanders]] with [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy]], a new Duke of Brabant emerged from the House of [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] (namely [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine]], their son). In 1477, the Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]] perished in the [[Battle of Nancy]]. Through the marriage of his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] (who was born in Brussels) to Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the [[Low Countries]] fell under [[Habsburg]] sovereignty. Brabant had lost its independence, but Brussels became the Princely Capital of the prosperous [[Burgundian Netherlands]], also known as the [[Seventeen Provinces]], and flourished. After the death of Mary in 1482, her son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] succeeded as Duke of Brabant. In 1506, he became [[Crown of Castile|King of Castile]], and hence the period of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] began.

In 1516, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who had been heir of the Low Countries since 1506, was declared [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] in the [[St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]]. Upon the death of his grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1519, Charles became the new ruler of the [[Habsburg Empire]] and was subsequently elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. It was in [[Coudenberg|the Palace complex at Coudenberg]] that Charles V abdicated in 1555. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731. In the 17th century, the city was a capital of the [[lace]] industry.
[[File:Grand- Place BXL1695 -01.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Place]] after [[Bombardment of Brussels|the 1695 bombardment]] by the French army]]
In 1695, during the [[Nine Years' War]], King [[Louis XIV]] of France sent troops to [[bombardment of Brussels|bombard Brussels with artillery]]. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The [[Grand Place]] was destroyed, along with 4,000 buildings – a third of all the buildings in the city. The reconstruction of [[pentagon (Brussels)|the city centre]], effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed its appearance and left numerous traces still visible today.

Following the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. This event started the era of the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Brussels [[Siege of Brussels|was captured]] by France in 1746, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but was handed back to Austria three years later. It remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands were captured and annexed by France, and became the capital of the [[Dyle (department)|department of the Dyle]]. The French rule ended in 1815, with the defeat of [[Napoleon]] on the [[Battle of Waterloo|battlefield of Waterloo]], located south of today's Brussels-Capital Region. With the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Southern Netherlands joined the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], under [[William I of the Netherlands|William I of Orange]]. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.

=== Late modern ===
[[File:Wappers - Episodes from September Days 1830 on the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville in Brussels.JPG|thumb|left|''Episode of the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830'', [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Wappers]] (1834)]]
In 1830, the [[Belgian revolution]] took place in Brussels, after a performance of [[Daniel-Francois-Esprit Auber|Auber's]] opera ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' at [[La Monnaie]] theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, Sonia. "Opera and Revolution: La Muette de Portici and the Belgian Revolution of 1830 Revisited", Journal of Musicological Research 3 (1979), 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; The city became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], with Brussels as its administrative centre. On 21 July 1831, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], the first [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]], ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings.

Following independence, Brussels underwent many more changes. It became a financial centre, thanks to the dozens of companies put into orbit by the [[Société Générale de Belgique]]. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the building of the [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]] brought prosperity to the city through commerce and manufacturing. The [[Free University of Brussels]] was established in 1834. In 1835, the first passenger railway built outside England linked the municipality of [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek|Molenbeek]] with [[Mechelen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.molenbeek.irisnet.be/fr/je-visite/histoire/Histoire%20en%20quelques%20mots|title=Histoire en quelques mots — Français|website=molenbeek.irisnet.be|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, the population of Brussels grew considerably; from about 80,000 to more than 625,000 people for the city and its surroundings. The [[Senne]] had become a serious [[health hazard]], and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of mayor [[Jules Anspach]], its entire course through the urban area was [[covering of the Senne|completely covered over]]. This allowed [[urban renewal]] and the construction of modern buildings of ''[[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|hausmannien]]'' style along central boulevards, characteristic of downtown Brussels today. Buildings such as the [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] (1873), the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] (1883) and [[Saint Mary's Royal Church]] (1885) date from this period. This development continued throughout the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]. The [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|International Exposition of 1897]] contributed to the promotion of the infrastructure. Among other things, the Colonial Palace (today's [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]]), in the suburb of [[Tervuren]], was connected to the capital by the construction of an [[Avenue de Tervueren|11-km long grand alley]].

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|left|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels was the fifth world physics conference]]
During the 20th century, the city hosted various fairs and conferences, including the [[Solvay Conference]] on Physics and on Chemistry, and three world fairs: the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International Exposition of 1910]], the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|Brussels International Exposition of 1935]] and the [[Expo '58]]. During [[World War I]], Brussels was an [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|occupied]] city, but German troops did not cause much damage. During [[World War II]], it was again [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied by German forces]], and spared major damage, before it was liberated by the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] on 3 September 1944. The [[Brussels Airport]], in the suburb of [[Zaventem]], dates from the occupation.

After the war, Brussels underwent extensive modernisation. The construction of the [[North–South connection]], linking the main railway stations in the city, was completed in 1952, while the first [[Brussels premetro|''premetro'']] was finished in 1969,&lt;ref name="1960s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stib.be/1960-1969.html?l=fr|title=STIB - La STIB de 1960 à 1969|year=2013|publisher=STIB|language=French|trans-title=STIB - STIB from 1960 to 1969|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221053137/http://www.stib.be/1960-1969.html?l=fr|archivedate=2013-12-21|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first line of the [[Brussels Metro|metro]] was opened in 1976.&lt;ref name="1970s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stib.be/1970-1979.html?l=fr|title=STIB - Historique de la STIB de 1970 à 1979|year=2013|publisher=STIB|language=French|trans-title=STIB - History of STIB from 1970 to 1979|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021155415/http://www.stib.be/1970-1979.html?l=fr|archivedate=2013-10-21|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the ''de facto'' capital of what would become the [[European Union]], and many modern buildings were built. Development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and many architectural landmarks were demolished to make way for newer buildings that often clashed with their surroundings, giving name to the process of ''[[Brusselization|Brusselisation]]''.

=== Contemporary ===
The Brussels-Capital Region was formed on 18 June 1989, after a constitutional reform in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/regions/brussels_capital_region|title=The Brussels-Capital Region|date=2012-02-01|work=Belgium.be|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|federal regions of Belgium]], along with [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]], and has bilingual status.&lt;ref name="Belgian Constitution" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIRB-creation" /&gt; The [[yellow iris]] is the emblem of the region (referring to the presence of these flowers on the original site of the city) and a stylised version in shown on its official flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&amp;la=F&amp;nm=1991031159&amp;table_name=titre |language=fr |title=LOI – WET |website=www.ejustice.just.fgov.be |access-date=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Brussels has become an important venue for international events. In 2000, it and eight other European cities were named [[European Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=17 August 2011 |url=http://www.krakow.pl/otwarty_na_swiat_en/international_organisations/8370,artykul,association_of_european_cities_of_culture_of_the_year_2000.html |title=Association of European Cities of Culture of the Year 2000 |website=Krakow the Open City |access-date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the city hosted the [[40th G7 summit]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/international-summit/2014/06/04-05/ |title=Brussels G7 summit, Brussels, 04-05/06/2014 – Consilium |website=European Council |language=en |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[2016 Brussels bombings|On 22 March 2016]], three coordinated [[nail bomb]]ings were detonated by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] in Brussels – two at [[Brussels Airport]] in [[Zaventem]] and one at [[Maalbeek/Maelbeek metro station]] – resulting in 32 victims and three [[Suicide bombing|suicide bombers]] killed, and 330 people were injured. It was the deadliest act of [[terrorism]] in Belgium.

== Geography ==

=== Location and topography ===
[[File:Brussels 4.35995E 50.84400N.jpg|thumb|Satellite picture of the Greater Brussels area]]{{Further|Geography of Belgium}}
Brussels lies in the north-central part of Belgium, about {{convert|110|km|abbr=off}} from the Belgian coast and about {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} from the southern tip of Belgium. It is located in the heartland of the Brabantian Plateau, about {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Antwerp]] ([[Flanders]]), and {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Charleroi]] ([[Wallonia]]). Its average [[elevation]] is {{convert|57|m|abbr=off}} above [[sea level]], varying from a low point in the valley of the almost completely covered [[Zenne|Senne]], which cuts the region from east to west, up to high points in the [[Sonian Forest]], at the southeastern side. In addition to the Senne, tributary streams such as the [[Maalbeek]] and the [[Woluwe]], to the east of the region, account for significant elevation differences. Brussels' central boulevards are {{convert|15|m||abbr=off}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://visit.brussels/en/article/brussels-in-figures |title=Brussels in figures 1 |website=visit.brussels |language=en |access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point lies at a height of about {{convert|108|m|abbr=off}}, near ''Place de l'Altitude Cent''/''Hoogte Honderdplein'', in [[Forest, Belgium|Forest]].

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Brussels experiences an [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb). Proximity to coastal areas influences the area's climate by sending marine air masses from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements over the last 100 years), there are approximately 200 days of rain per year in the Brussels-Capital Region, one of the highest totals for any European capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.be/meteo/view/fr/360361-Parametres.html#ppt_757427|title=Site de l'institut météorologique belge|date=|publisher=Meteo.be|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year. The city also often experiences violent thunderstorms.

==Brussels as a capital==
[[File:Bruxelles 1.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Royal Palace of Brussels]]]]
Despite its name, the Brussels-Capital Region is not the capital of [[Belgium]]. Article 194 of the [[Belgian Constitution]] establishes that the capital of Belgium is the [[City of Brussels]], the municipality in the region that is the city's core.&lt;ref name="article 194" /&gt;

The City of Brussels is the location of many national institutions. The [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]], where the [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of Belgium]] exercises his prerogatives as head of state, is situated alongside the [[Brussels Park]] (not to be confused with the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]], the official home of the Belgian Royal Family). The [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Palace of the Nation]] is located on the opposite side of this park, and is the seat of the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]]. The office of the [[Prime Minister of Belgium]], colloquially called ''Law Street 16'' (Dutch: ''Wetstraat 16'', French: ''16, rue de la Loi''), is located adjacent to this building. It is also where the [[Council of Ministers (Belgium)|Council of Ministers]] holds its meetings. The [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]], Belgium's main court, has its seat in the [[Palace of Justice (Brussels)|Palace of Justice]]. Other important institutions in the City of Brussels are the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium|Constitutional Court]], the [[Council of State (Belgium)|Council of State]], the [[Court of Audit of Belgium|Court of Audit]], the [[Royal Belgian Mint]] and the [[National Bank of Belgium]].

The City of Brussels is also the capital of both the [[French Community of Belgium]]&lt;ref name="décret" /&gt; and the [[Flemish Community]].&lt;ref name="decreet" /&gt; The [[Flemish Parliament]] and [[Flemish Government]] have their seats in Brussels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brussels, the capital of Flanders |url=http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&amp;cid=1166590837731&amp;context=1166590833692--EN&amp;p=1166590837731&amp;pagename=flanders_site%2FView |publisher=Flemish Department of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=6 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610162638/http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&amp;cid=1166590837731&amp;context=1166590833692--EN&amp;p=1166590837731&amp;pagename=flanders_site%2FView |archivedate=10 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so do the [[Parliament of the French Community]] and the [[Government of the French Community]].

The 19 [[Municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]] (communes) of the Brussels-Capital [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium#Regions|Region]] are political subdivisions with individual responsibilities for the handling of local level duties, such as law enforcement and the upkeep of schools and roads within its borders.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brussels-Capital region / Communes |website=Brussels Capital-Region / Région de Bruxelles-Capitale |url=http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/en/region/region_de_bruxelles-capitale/communes.shtml |accessdate=4 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606023552/http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/en/region/region_de_bruxelles-capitale/communes.shtml |archivedate=6 June 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Managing across levels of government |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/10/43/1902434.pdf |year=1997 |publisher=OECD |pages=107, 110 |format=PDF |accessdate=5 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819213027/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/10/43/1902434.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt;

In 1831, Belgium was divided into 2,739 municipalities, including the 19 in the Brussels-Capital Region.&lt;ref name="roots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/_places/bel_places.html|title=Municipalities (1795-now)|last=Picavet|first=Georges|date=29 April 2003|publisher=Georges Picavet|accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975.&lt;ref name="roots" /&gt; However, several municipalities outside the Brussels-Capital Region have been merged with the [[City of Brussels]] throughout its history, including [[Laeken]], [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] and [[Neder-Over-Heembeek]], which were merged into the City of Brussels in 1921.&lt;ref name="Brussels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/2bru/index.html|title=Brussels Capital-Region|date=4 June 2005 |publisher=Georges Picavet |accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest in area and population of the municipalities is the City of Brussels, covering {{convert|32.6|km2|sqmi|1}} and with 145,917 inhabitants. The least populous is [[Koekelberg]] with 18,541 inhabitants; the smallest in area is [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]], which is only {{convert|1.1|km2|sqmi|1}} but still has the highest population density in the region, with {{Convert|20822|PD/km2}}. [[Watermael-Boitsfort]] has the lowest population density in the region, with {{Convert|1928|PD/km2}}.

There is much controversy on the division of 19 municipalities for a highly urbanised region, which is considered as (half of) one city by most people.

==Brussels-Capital Region==
[[File:Regions_of_Belgium.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Regions_of_Belgium.svg|thumb|Regions of Belgium:
{{legend|#fab274|[[Flemish Region]]}}{{legend|#2385d2|Brussels-Capital Region}}{{legend|#f2536b|[[Wallonia|Walloon Region]]}}]]

=== Political status ===
{{see also|Partition of Belgium#Brussels|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium#Brussels}}The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]] and the [[Flemish Region]]. Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual [[enclave]] in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions, the three communities being the other component: Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]] for matters such as culture and education, as well as a [[Common Community Commission|Common Community]] for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and social [[welfare]].

Since the splitting of [[Brabant (province)|Brabant]] in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the [[Provinces of Belgium|provinces]] of Belgium, nor is it subdivided into provinces itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Remaining is only the [[governor of Brussels-Capital]] and some aides, analogously to provinces. Its status is roughly akin to that of a [[federal district]].

===Institutions===
{{Main|Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region}}
[[File:Parlement région Bruxelles-Capitale.JPG|left|thumb|[[Brussels Parliament building]]]]
The Brussels-Capital Region is governed by a [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region|parliament]] of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking – parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region|minister-president]], four ministers and three [[Secretary of state|state secretaries]]. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact [[Ordinance (Belgium)|ordinances]] (French: ''ordonnances'', Dutch: ''ordonnanties''), which have equal status as a national legislative act.

19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the [[Parliament of the French Community of Belgium]], and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the [[Flemish Parliament]]. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.

===Agglomeration of Brussels===
Before the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the ''Brussels Agglomeration''. The ''Brussels Agglomeration'' was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wet houdende organisatie van de agglomeraties en de federaties van gemeenten|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&amp;la=N&amp;cn=1971072630&amp;table_name=wet|website=Belgiëlex.be|publisher=FOD Justitie|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Brussels Agglomeration'' had a separate legislative council, but the by-laws enacted by it did not have the status of a legislative act. The only election of the council took place on 21 November 1971. The working of the council was subject to many difficulties caused by the linguistic and socio-economic tensions between the two communities.

After the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, the ''Brussels Agglomeration'' was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.

==French and Flemish communities==
{{Main|French Community Commission|Flemish Community Commission}}
[[File:Communities_of_Belgium.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Communities_of_Belgium.svg|thumb|Communities of Belgium:
{{legend|#fab274|[[Flemish Community]] / Dutch language area}}{{legend striped|#fab274|#f2536b|Flemish &amp; French Community / bilingual language area|up=yes}}{{legend|#f2536b|[[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] / French language area}}{{legend|#40bb6a|[[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]] / German language area}}]]
The [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Community]] exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the [[French Community Commission]] (French: ''Commission communautaire française'' or ''COCOF'') and the [[Flemish Community Commission]] (Dutch: ''Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie'' or ''VGC''). These two bodies each have an assembly composed of the members of each linguistic group of the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]]. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.

The French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area).&lt;ref&gt;Procedure contained in art. 138 of the Belgian Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community.&lt;ref&gt;Procedure in art. 137 of the Belgian Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical [[federalism]]. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact [[decree]]s, which are legislative acts.

===Common Community Commission===
A bi-communitarian public authority, the [[Common Community Commission]] (French: ''Commission communautaire commune, COCOM'', Dutch: ''Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC'') also exists. Its assembly is composed of the members of the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers – not the secretaries of state – of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact [[by-law]]s. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.

==International institutions==
Brussels has, since [[World War II]], become the administrative centre of many international organisations. The [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the [[World Customs Organization]] and [[EUROCONTROL]], as well as international corporations. Brussels is third in the number of international conferences it hosts,&lt;ref name="ULB Int"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/bxluk.html |title=Brussels, an international city and European capital |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803145343/http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/bxluk.html |archive-date=3 August 2010 |website=L'université Libre de Bruxelles}}&lt;/ref&gt; also becoming one of the largest convention centres in the world.&lt;ref name="diplomatie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.be/EN/belgium/belgiumdetail.asp?TEXTID=1754 |title=Brussels: home to international organisations |website=diplomatie.be |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215172520/http://www.diplomatie.be/EN/belgium/belgiumdetail.asp?TEXTID=1754 |archive-date=15 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the EU and the other international bodies has, for example, led to there being more ambassadors and journalists in Brussels than in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name="E!Sarp"&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=E!Sharp |date=January–February 2007 |title=A tale of two cities |last=Parker |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; International schools have also been established to serve this presence.&lt;ref name="diplomatie"/&gt; The "international community" in Brussels numbers at least 70,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Rettman |url=http://euobserver.com/9/29622 |title=Daylight shooting in EU capital raises alarm |website=euobserver.com |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, there were an estimated 286 [[lobbying]] consultancies known to work in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leigh Phillips |url=http://euobserver.com/9/29658 |title=Majority of Brussels lobby firms avoid registry |website=euobserver.com |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brussels, along with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] and Strasbourg, began to host European institutions in 1957, soon becoming the centre of activities, as the Commission and Council based their activities in what has become the [[Brussels and the European Union|''European Quarter'']], in the east of the city.&lt;ref name="ENA COMM SEAT" /&gt; Early building in Brussels was sporadic and uncontrolled, with little planning. The current major buildings are the [[Berlaymont building]] of the Commission, symbolic of the quarter as a whole, the [[Justus Lipsius building]] of the Council and the [[Espace Léopold]] of the Parliament.&lt;ref name="EC EiB" /&gt; Today, the presence has increased considerably, with the Commission alone occupying 865,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within the ''European Quarter'' (a quarter of the total office space in Brussels&lt;ref name="Demey" /&gt;).

Brussels is located in one of the most [[Blue Banana|urbanised regions of Europe]], between [[Paris]], [[London]], the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] ([[Germany]]), and the [[Randstad]] ([[Netherlands]]). The Brussels-Capital Region has a population of around 1.2 million and has witnessed, in recent years, a remarkable increase in its population. In general, the population of Brussels is younger than the national average, and the gap between rich and poor is wider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/bruxelles/article/616278/tres-riches-et-tres-pauvres.html|title=Très riches et très pauvres|date=|publisher=Lalibre.be|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brussels is home to a large number of immigrants. At the last Belgian census in 1991, 63.7% of inhabitants in Brussels-Capital Region answered that they were Belgian citizens, born as such in Belgium. However, there have been numerous individual or familial migrations towards Brussels since the end of the 18th century, including [[Right of asylum|political refugees]] ([[Karl Marx]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Léon Daudet]], for example), from neighbouring or more distant countries, as well as labour migrants, former foreign students or expatriates, and many Belgian families in Brussels can claim at least one foreign grandparent.

Brussels has a large concentration of immigrants from other countries, and their children, including many of Moroccan ([[Riffian people|Riffian]], [[Berbers|Berber]]) and Turkish ancestry, together with French-speaking black Africans from former [[Belgian overseas colonies|Belgian colonies]], such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]].

About 32% of city residents are of non-Belgian [[Europe]]an origin, and 36% are of another background, mostly from [[Morocco]], [[Turkey]] and Sub-Saharan [[Africa]]. Among all major migrant groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired Belgian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npdata.be/BuG/155-Vreemde-afkomst/Vreemde-afkomst.htm |title=2.738.486 inwoners van vreemde afkomst in België op 01/01/2012 |language=nl |trans-title=2,738,486 inhabitants of foreign origin in Belgium on 01/01/2012 |website=Npdata.be |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the founding of the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] ([[Brabantian]] dialect to be exact), to being a multilingual city with French (specifically [[Belgian French]]) as the majority language and ''[[lingua franca]]''. This language shift, the [[Francization of Brussels|''Francisation'' of Brussels]], is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after [[Belgium]] became [[Belgian revolution|independent]] and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.&lt;ref name="service"&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www2.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105023238/http://www.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm |archivedate=5 January 2007 |title=Wallonie – Bruxelles |publisher=Le Service de la langue française |date=19 May 1997 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laval"&gt;{{cite web|language=French |url=https://www.ulaval.ca/afi/colloques/colloque2001/actes/textes/tourret.htm |title=Villes, identités et médias francophones: regards croisés Belgique, Suisse, Canada |publisher=[[University of Laval]] |location=Quebec |accessdate=22 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619145722/http://www.ulaval.ca/afi/colloques/colloque2001/actes/textes/tourret.htm |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

French-speaking immigration contributed to the ''Frenchification'' of Brussels; both Walloons and expatriates from other countries – mainly France – came to Brussels in great numbers. However, a more important cause for the ''Frenchification'' was the language change over several generations from Dutch to French that was carried out by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] inhabitants themselves. The main reason for this was a political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time; this made French the only language of administration, law, politics and education in Belgium, and thus necessary for [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="nlb"&gt;{{cite book |language=Dutch |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/toor004gesc01_01/toor004gesc01_01_0029.htm |chapter=9.

Halfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers surpassed the number of mostly bilingual Flemish inhabitants.&lt;ref name="brio4"&gt;{{cite journal |language=nl |url=http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/andere%20publicaties/btng-rbhc,%2021,%201990,%203-4,%20pp%20383-412.pdf |title=Thuis in gescheiden werelden – De migratoire en sociale aspecten van verfransing te Brussel in het midden van de 19e eeuw |trans-title=Home in separate worlds – The migratory and social aspects of Frenchification in Brussels in the middle of the 19th century |journal=[[BTNG-RBHC]] |volume=XXI |year=1990 |issue=3–4 |pages=383–412 |author=Machteld de Metsenaere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its Dutch-speaking origins and the role that the [[City of Brussels]] plays as capital in a bilingual country, the administration of the entire Brussels-Capital Region is fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services. Nevertheless, some communautarian issues remain. Flemish political parties demanded, for decades, that the Flemish part of [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] ''arrondissement'' be separated from the Brussels Region (which made Halle-Vilvoorde a monolingual Flemish ''arrondissement''). BHV was divided mid-2012.

[[File:Arrondissement Brussels-Periphery Belgium Map.PNG|thumb|The [[municipalities with language facilities]] (in red) near Brussels]]
The original Dutch dialect of Brussels (''Brussels'') is a form of [[Brabantic]] (the variant of Dutch spoken in the ancient [[Duchy of Brabant]]) with a significant number of loanwords from French, and still survives among a minority of inhabitants called ''Brusseleers'', many of them quite bi- and multilingual, or educated in French and not writing in Dutch. Brussels and its suburbs have evolved from a Dutch-dialect-speaking town to a mainly French-speaking town. The ethnic and national self-identification of the inhabitants is quite different along ethnic lines.

For their French-speaking ''Bruxellois'', it can vary from Belgian, Francophone Belgian, ''Bruxellois'' (like the Memellanders in interwar ethnic censuses in [[Klaipėda|Memel]]), [[Walloons|Walloon]] (for people who migrated from the Wallonia Region at an adult age); for Flemings living in Brussels, it is mainly either Flemish or ''Brusselaar'' (Dutch for an inhabitant), and often both. For the ''Brusseleers'', many simply consider themselves as belonging to Brussels. For the many rather recent immigrants from other countries, the identification also includes all the national origins: people tend to call themselves Moroccans or Turks rather than an American-style hyphenated version.

The two largest foreign groups come from two [[Francophonie|francophone]] countries: France and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/brussels?set_language=en&amp;uri=ff80818115f323cb0115f659b6880039 |title=IS 2007 – Population (Tableaux) |publisher=Bruxelles.irisnet.be |date= |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first language of roughly half of the inhabitants is not an official one of the Capital Region.&lt;ref name="standaard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Van autochtoon naar allochtoon |quote=Meer dan de helft van de Brusselse bevolking is van vreemde afkomst.

In recent decades, owing to migration and the city's international role, Brussels is home to a growing number of foreign language speakers. In 2013, figures cited in the Marnix Plan show that 63.2% of Brussels inhabitants are native speakers of French, while less than 20% are native Dutch speakers. Just 2.5% speak English as their mother tongue, but 29.7% of people living in the city claim to speak English well or very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/culture/flemish-education-minister-engli-news-531233 |title=English should be Brussels' official language, Flemish minister says |publisher=EurActiv |date= 2013-10-23|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though some people want English to be used as an unofficial compromise language between Dutch and French, French remains the ''lingua franca'', and laws still require Dutch and French translations in most cases. The acceptance of English as a language for communication with the city's public servants depends entirely on their knowledge of this language, though they must accept questions in French and Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dutchstudies/an/SP_LINKS_UCL_POPUP/SPs_dutch/brussels/taalgebruik.html |title=Language usage in Brussels (nl)|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The migrant communities, as well as rapidly growing communities of EU-nationals from other member states, speak many languages like French, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic languages|Arabic]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[German language|German]], and (increasingly) [[English language|English]]. The degree of linguistic integration varies widely within each migrant group.

Historically, Brussels has been predominantly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], especially since the expulsion of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in the 16th century. This is clear from the large number of historical churches around the area, particularly in the [[City of Brussels]]. The pre-eminent Catholic [[cathedral]] in Brussels is the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula|Cathedral of Saint Michael and Saint Gudula]], which serves as the [[co-cathedral]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels|Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels]]. On the northwestern side of the city, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|National Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] is the [[List of largest church buildings|14th largest church building]] in the world. The [[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]] holds the tombs of many members of the [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgian royal family]], including all the former [[List of Belgian monarchs|Kings of Belgium]], within the [[Royal Crypt (Belgium)|Royal Crypt]].

In reflection of its multicultural makeup, Brussels hosts a variety of religious communities, as well as large numbers of [[atheism|atheists]] and [[agnosticism|agnostics]]. Minority faiths include [[Islam]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Judaism]], and [[Buddhism]]. According to a 2016 survey, approximately 40% of residents of Brussels declared themselves [[Catholics]] (12% were practising Catholics and 28% were non-practising Catholics), 30% were [[Irreligion|non-religious]], 23% were [[Muslim]] (19% practising, 4% non-practising), 3% were [[Protestant Christian|Protestants]] and 4% were of another religion.&lt;ref name=2016religion&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lesoir.be/1106186/article/actualite/belgique/2016-01-28/75-des-francophones-revendiquent-une-identite-religieuse |title=75% des francophones revendiquent une identité religieuse |language=fr |author=Elodie Blogie |date=28 January 2016 |website=Le Soir.be |access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognised religions and ''[[Laïcité]]'' enjoy public funding and school courses. It was once the case that every pupil in an official school from 6 years old to 18 had to choose 2 hours per week of compulsory religion – or ''Laïcité –'' inspired morals. However, in 2015, the Belgian Constitutional court ruled religious studies could no longer be required in the primary and secondary education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Andy Furniere |date=13 March 2015 |url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/education/lessons-religion-no-longer-obligatory-belgium |title=Lessons in religion no longer obligatory in Belgium |website=Flanders Today |access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
The architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the clashing combination of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], and [[French Baroque architecture|Louis XIV]] styles on the [[Grand Place]] to the [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] buildings of the [[Brussels and the European Union|EU institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Brussels Architecture Sights |url=https://www.brussels.info/architecture/ |website=brussels.info |access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bruxelles Manneken Pis.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Manneken Pis]]'' is a well-known public sculpture in Brussels]]
Very little [[medieval architecture]] is preserved in Brussels. Buildings from that period are mostly found in the historic centre (called ''Îlot Sacré''), [[Saint-Géry Island|''Saint Géry/Sint-Goriks'']] and ''Sainte-Catherine/Sint Katelijne'' neighbourhoods. The [[Brabantine Gothic]] [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] remains a prominent feature in the skyline of downtown Brussels. Isolated portions of the [[First walls of Brussels|first city walls]] were saved from destruction and can be seen to this day. One of the only remains of the [[Second walls of Brussels|second walls]] is the [[Halle Gate]]. The [[Grand Place]] is the main attraction in the city centre and has been a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/857 |title=La Grand-Place, Brussels |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=whc.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The square is dominated by the 15th century [[Flamboyant]] [[Brussels Town Hall|Town Hall]], the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] ''[[Museum of the City of Brussels|Breadhouse]]'' and the Baroque [[guildhall]]s of the [[Guilds of Brussels]]. The ''[[Manneken Pis]]'', a fountain containing a small bronze sculpture of a urinating youth, is a tourist attraction and [[symbol]] of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://be.brussels/culture-tourism-leisure/brussels-folklore/mannekenpis |title=Manneken Pis |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Parterre de fleurs Grand-place de Bruxelles 2016.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.75|The [[Grand Place|Grand Place of Brussels]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]]]
The [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style of the 18th and 19th centuries is represented in the ''Royal Quarter/Coudenberg'' area, around the [[Brussels Park]] and [[Place Royale (Brussels)|Royal Square]]. Examples include the [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]], the [[Church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg]], the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Palace of the Nation]] (Parliament building), the [[Academy Palace]], the [[Palace of Charles of Lorraine]] and the [[Egmont Palace]]. Other uniform neoclassical ensembles can be found around [[Place des Martyrs, Brussels|Martyrs' Square]] and Barricades' Square. Some other landmarks in the centre are the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert]] (1847), one of the oldest covered shopping arcades in Europe, the [[Congress Column]] (1859), the [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] building (1873) and the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palace of Justice]] (1883), designed by [[Joseph Poelaert]], in [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]] style, and reputed to be the largest building constructed in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5357/ |title=Le Palais de Justice de Bruxelles |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=whc.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also particularly striking are the buildings in the [[Art Nouveau]] style, most famously by the Belgian architects [[Victor Horta]], [[Paul Hankar]] and [[Henry Van de Velde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://visit.brussels/en/article/10-must-visit-world-class-art-nouveau-buildings-in-brussels |title=10 must-visit world-class Art Nouveau buildings in Brussels! |website=visit.brussels |language=en |access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/the-most-remarkable-art-nouveau-houses-in-brussels/ |title=The Most Remarkable Art Nouveau Houses In Brussels |last=Stambolic |first=Ana |work=Culture Trip |access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Brussels' municipalities, such as [[Schaerbeek]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Ixelles]], and [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]], were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau and have a large number of buildings in that style.

[[Art Deco]] structures in Brussels include the ''Résidence Palace'' (1927) (now part of the [[Europa building]]), the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Centre for Fine Arts]] (1928), the [[Villa Empain]] (1934), the Town Hall of Forest (1938), and the former House of the Radio building on [[Place Flagey|Flagey Square]] (1935–1938) in Ixelles. Some religious buildings from the [[Interwar period|interwar era]] were also constructed in that style, such as the Church of St John the Baptist (1932) in Molenbeek and the Church of Saint Augustine (1935) in Forest. Completed only in 1969, and combining Art Deco with [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Neo-Byzantine]] elements, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in [[Koekelberg]] is one of the [[List of largest church buildings|largest]] [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] basilicas by area in the world, and its cupola provides a panoramic view of Brussels and its outskirts.

The [[Atomium]] is a symbolic {{convert|103|m|ft|0|adj=on}} tall [[Modern architecture|modernist]] structure, located on the Heysel Plateau, which was originally built for the [[Expo '58|1958 World's Fair]] (Expo '58). It consists of nine steel spheres connected by tubes, and forms a model of an iron crystal (specifically, a [[unit cell]]), magnified 165 billion times. The architect [[André Waterkeyn|A. Waterkeyn]] devoted the building to science. It is now considered a [[landmark]] of Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beneluxguide.com/belgium/atomium-the-iron-landmark-of-brussels/ |title=Atomium – the iron landmark of Brussels |website=beneluxguide.com |access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-atomium-molecular-brussels-landmark-gets-a-polish-a-860096.html |title=The Atomium: How Do You Clean a Massive Molecule? |newspaper=Spiegel Online |date=8 October 2012 |access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to the Atomium, is the ''[[Mini-Europe]]'' park, with 1:25 scale [[maquette]]s of famous buildings from across Europe.
[[File:Atomium w.jpg|thumb|The [[Atomium]], a landmark of Brussels|left]]

Since the second half of the 20th century, modern office towers have been built in Brussels ([[Madou Plaza Tower|Madou Tower]], [[Rogier Tower]], [[Proximus Towers]], [[Finance Tower]], the [[World Trade Center (Brussels)|World Trade Center]], among others). There are some thirty towers, mostly concentrated in the city's main business district: the [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]] (also called ''Little Manhattan''), near [[Brussels-North railway station]]. The [[South Tower (Brussels)|South Tower]], standing adjacent to [[Brussels-South railway station]], is the [[List of tallest structures in Belgium|tallest building in Belgium]], at {{cvt|148|m}}. Along the [[North–South connection|North-South connection]], is the ''State Administrative City'', an administrative complex in the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]]. The postmodern buildings of the [[Espace Leopold|Espace Léopold]] complete the picture.

The city's embrace of modern architecture translated into an ambivalent approach towards historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, most famously the [[Maison du Peuple]] by Victor Horta, a process known as ''[[Brusselization|Brusselisation]]''.

The [[Belgian Comic Strip Center]] combines two artistic leitmotifs of Brussels, being a museum devoted to Belgian comic strips, housed in the former [[Art Nouveau in Brussels|Waucquez]] department store, designed by [[Victor Horta]] in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.

Brussels is well known for its [[performing arts]] scene, with the Kunstenfestivaldesarts (a festival of international contemporary art organised in May), the Kaaitheater and [[La Monnaie]] among the most notable institutions. The [http://www.bifff.net/ International Fantastic Film Festival of Brussels (BIFFF)] is organised during the Easter holidays and the [[Magritte Award]]s in February. The [[King Baudouin Stadium]] is a concert and competition facility with a 50,000 seat capacity, the largest in Belgium. The site was formerly occupied by the [[Heysel Stadium]].

=== Folklore ===
[[File:GeantsMeyboom2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Meyboom]]'' giants in Brussels, a [[UNESCO]] [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage]]]]
Brussels' identity owes much to its rich folklore and traditions, among the liveliest in the country.
* The ''[[Ommegang of Brussels|Ommegang]],'' a folkloric costumed procession, commemorating the [[Joyous Entry]] of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] in the city in 1549, takes place every year in July. The colourful parade includes floats, traditional giant puppets, such as [[Saint Michael]] and [[Saint Gudula]], and scores of folkloric groups, either on foot or on horseback, dressed in medieval garb. The parade ends in a [[Medieval pageant|pageant]] on the [[Grand Place]].
* The ''[[Meyboom]]'', an even older folk tradition of Brussels (1308), celebrating the May tree – in fact, a bad translation of the Dutch ''tree of joy –'' takes place paradoxically on 9 August. After parading a young [[beech]] in the city, it is planted in a joyful spirit involving lots of music, ''Brusseleir'' songs, and giant puppets. It was recognised as an expression of [[intangible cultural heritage]] by [[UNESCO]], as part of the binational inscription '[[Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://be.brussels/culture-tourism-leisure/brussels-folklore/meyboom |title=Meyboom |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/processional-giants-and-dragons-in-belgium-and-france-00153 |title=Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO |website=ich.unesco.org |language=en |access-date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration is reminiscent of the town's long-standing (folkloric) feud with [[Leuven]], which dates back to the [[Middle Ages]].
* Another good introduction to the ''Brusseleir'' local dialect and way of life can be obtained at the [http://www.toone.be/ Théâtre Royal de Toone], a folkloric theatre of [[marionette]]s, located a stone throw away from the Grand Place.
* The [[St V|''Saint-Verhaegen'']] (often shortened to ''St V''), a folkloric student procession, celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], is held on 20 November.

=== Cultural events and festivals ===
[[File:Brussels Summer Festival (4890801736).jpg|thumb|left|Brussels Summer Festival]]
Many events are organised or hosted in Brussels throughout the year. In addition, a large number of festivals animate the Brussels' scene.

The [http://irisfestival.brussels/iris-festival Iris Festival] is the official festival of the Brussels-Capital Region and is held every year in spring. The [[Festival of Europe]], an open day and activities in and around the institutions of the [[European Union]], is celebrated on 9 May. On [[Belgian National Day]], on 21 July, a military parade and celebrations take place on the ''Place des Palais/Paleizenplein'' and in [[Brussels Park]], ending with a display of fireworks in the evening.
[[File:Zinneke-parade-brussel-1350316079.jpg|thumb|''[[Zinneke Parade]]'']]
Some summer festivities include the [[Couleur Café|Couleur Café Festival]], a festival of [[World music|world]] and [[Urban contemporary|urban music]], around the end of June or early July, the [http://bsf.be/ Brussels Summer Festival (BSF)], a music festival in August, the [http://zuidfoor.be/ Brussels Fair], the most important yearly fair in Brussels, lasting more than a month, in July and August, and [http://www.bruxelleslesbains.be/ ''Brussels Beach''], when the banks of the [[Brussels–Charleroi Canal|canal]] are turned into a temporary urban beach. The ''[https://visit.brussels/en/sites/winterwonders/ Winter Wonders]'' animate the heart of Brussels in December; these winter activities were launched in Brussels in 2001.

Other biennial events are the ''[[Zinneke Parade]]'', a colourful, multicultural parade through the city, which has been held since 2000 in May, as well as the popular [[Flower Carpet]] at the [[Grand Place]] in August.

[[European Heritage Days|Heritage Days]] are organised on the third weekend of September (coinciding with the car-free day) and are a good opportunity to discover the wealth of buildings, institutions and real estate in Brussels.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Brussels waffle.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Brussels is known for its local [[Belgian waffle|waffle]]]]
Brussels is known for its local [[Belgian waffle|waffle]], its [[chocolate]], its [[French fries]] and its numerous types of [[beer]]s. The [[Brussels sprout]], which has long been popular in Brussels, and may have originated there, is also named after the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Oliver | first = Lynne |title = Food Timeline: Brussels sprouts | date = 11 April 2011 | url =http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq.html#brussels | accessdate =9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gastronomic offer includes approximately 1,800 [[restaurant]]s, and a number of high quality bars. [[Belgian cuisine]] is known among connoisseurs as one of the best in Europe. In addition to the traditional restaurants, there are a large number of [[Coffeehouse|cafés]], bistros, and the usual range of international [[Fast food restaurant|fast food]] chains. The cafés are similar to bars, and offer beer and light dishes; [[Coffeehouse|coffee houses]] are called ''salons de thé''. Also widespread are ''[[brasserie]]s'', which usually offer a large number of beers and typical national dishes.

Belgian cuisine is characterised by the combination of [[French cuisine]] with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include [[Brussels waffle]]s (gaufres) and [[mussels]] (usually as [[moules frites|''moules-frites'']], served with fries). The city is a stronghold of [[chocolate]] and [[praline]]s manufacturers with renowned companies like [[Côte d'Or (chocolate)|Côte d'Or]], [[Chocolatier Neuhaus|Neuhaus]], [[Leonidas (chocolate maker)|Leonidas]] and [[Godiva Chocolatier|Godiva]]. Pralines were first introduced in 1912, by Jean Neuhaus II, a Belgian [[chocolatier]] of Swiss origin, in the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/travel/brussels-the-chocolate-trail.html|title=Brussels: The Chocolate Trail|last=Thomas|first=Amy M.|date=22 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[friteries]] are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh hot waffles are also sold on the street.

As well as other [[Beer in Belgium|Belgian beer]]s, the [[Spontaneous fermentation|spontaneously fermented]] [[lambic]] style, brewed in and around Brussels, is widely available there and in the nearby [[Zenne|Senne]] valley where the wild yeasts which ferment it have their origin. [[Kriek lambic|Kriek]], a cherry lambic, is available in almost every bar or restaurant in Brussels.

Brussels is known as the birthplace of the [[Chicory|Belgian Endive]]. The technique for growing [[Blanching (horticulture)|blanched]] endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the [[Botanical Garden of Brussels]] in [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729081033/http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 July 2005|title=Food Museum, Belgium Endive|date=29 July 2005|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossing Elewijt|Crossing Club de Schaerbeek]] (born from a merger between RCS de Schaerbeek and Crossing Club Molenbeek), Scup Jette, RUS de Laeken, Racing Jet de Bruxelles, AS Auderghem, KV Wosjot Woluwe and FC Ganshoren.

==Economy==
{{Further|Economy of Belgium}}
Serving as the centre of administration for Belgium and Europe, Brussels' economy is largely [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service]]-oriented. It is dominated by regional and world headquarters of [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]], by European institutions, by various local and federal administrations, and by related services companies, though it does have a number of notable [[craft]] industries, such as the [[Cantillon Brewery]], a [[lambic]] brewery founded in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cantillon.be/musee?lang=en|title=Cantillon – Museum|website=www.cantillon.be|language=en-US|access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:North Galaxy Towers-Schaerbeek-001.JPG|left|thumb|Brussels' [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]] business district]]
Brussels has a robust economy. The region contributes to one fifth of Belgium's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and its 550,000 jobs account for 17.7% of Belgium's employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brussels.info/economy/ |title=Brussels Economy and Business |website=Brussels.info |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[GDP per capita]] is nearly double that of Belgium as a whole,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gross domestic product per resident, at current prices – Ratio in relation to the total of the Kingdom |url=http://www.nbb.be/belgostat/PublicatieSelectieLinker?LinkID=68000011%7c910000082&amp;Lang=E |publisher=[[National Bank of Belgium]] |accessdate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808195454/http://www.nbb.be/belgostat/PublicatieSelectieLinker?LinkID=68000011%7C910000082&amp;Lang=E |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has the highest GDP per capita of any [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS 1]] region in the EU, at ~$80,000 in 2016.&lt;ref name=EUGDP/&gt; That being said, the GDP is boosted by a massive inflow of [[Commuting|commuters]] from neighbouring regions; over half of those who work in Brussels live in Flanders or Wallonia, with 230,000 and 130,000 commuters per day respectively. Conversely, only 16.0% of people from Brussels work outside Brussels (68,827 (68.5%) of them in Flanders and 21,035 (31.5%) in Wallonia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.jsp?catId=7552&amp;acro=lmi&amp;mode=text&amp;recordLang=en&amp;lang=en&amp;parentId=&amp;countryId=BE&amp;regionId=BE0 |title=EURES – Labour market information – Région De Bruxelles-Capitale / Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest – European Commission |website=ec.europa.eu |language=en |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of the wealth generated in Brussels remains in Brussels itself, and as of December 2013, the unemployment among residents of Brussels is 20.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth unemployment in Brussels falls under 30% |url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/Economy/140106_Umeployment |publisher=[[Flandersnews.be]] |date=6 January 2014 |accessdate=23 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140423162149/http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/Economy/140106_Umeployment |archivedate=23 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bourse Bxl 01.JPG|thumb|The [[Brussels Stock Exchange]]]]
There are approximately 50,000 [[business]]es in Brussels, of which around 2,200 are foreign. This number is constantly increasing and can well explain the role of Brussels in Europe. The city's [[infrastructure]] is very favourable in terms of starting up a new business. House prices have also increased in recent years, especially with the increase of young [[professional]]s settling down in Brussels, making it the most expensive city to live in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/country/belgium#all-cities|title=Cost of Living in Belgium.|website=Expatistan, cost of living comparisons|language=en|access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Brussels holds more than 1,000 business conferences annually, making it the ninth most popular conference city in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cvent.com/uk/event-venue-supplier-network/top-25/2015-top-destinations-europe.shtml|title=Cvent's Top 25 Meeting Destinations in the Europe|website=www.cvent.com|access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brussels is rated as the seventh most important financial centre in the world. The [[Brussels Stock Exchange]], abbreviated to BSE, now called ''Euronext Brussels'', is part of the European [[stock exchange]] [[Euronext N.V.]], along with [[Paris Bourse]], [[Lisbon Stock Exchange]] and [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]]. Its benchmark [[stock market index]] is the [[BEL20]].

== Media ==
{{Further|Belgian media}}
Brussels is a centre of both media and communications in Belgium, with many Belgian television stations, radio stations, [[newspaper]]s and telephone companies having their headquarters in the region. The Belgian French-language [[Public broadcasting|public broadcaster]] [[RTBF]], the Belgian Dutch-speaking public broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]], the two regional channels [https://bx1.be/ BX1] (formerly ''Télé Bruxelles'') and [http://www.bruzz.be/en Bruzz] (formerly ''TV Brussel''), the encrypted [[BeTV (Belgium)|BeTV]] channel and private channels [[RTL-TVI]] and [[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]] are headquartered in Brussels. Some national newspapers such as [[Le Soir]], [[La Libre Belgique|La Libre]], [[De Morgen]] and the [[news agency]] [[Belga (news agency)|Belga]] are based in or around Brussels. The Belgian [[Mail|postal]] company [[Bpost]], as well as the telecommunication companies and mobile operators [[Proximus]], [[Orange Belgium]] and [[Telenet (Belgium)|Telenet]] are all located there. The [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] [[Pan-European identity|pan-European]] news channel [[Euronews]] also maintains an office in Brussels.

==Education==

=== Tertiary education ===
[[File:ULB 20050712.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]]]
There are several [[University|universities]] in Brussels. The two main universities are the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Université libre de Bruxelles]], a French-speaking university, with about 20,000 students, in three campuses in the city (and two others outside),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation of the Université libre de Bruxelles |publisher=[[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] |url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/indexuk.html |accessdate=9 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203153418/http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/indexuk.html |archivedate=3 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], a [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] university, with about 10,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the University: Culture and History|publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/about.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both universities originate from a single ancestor university, founded in 1834, namely the [[Free University of Brussels]], which was split in 1970, at about the same time the Flemish and French Communities gained legislative power over the organisation of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/en/about|title=About the University: Culture and History|website=www.vub.ac.be|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other institutions based in Brussels are recognised as universities: the [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels|Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles]], specialised in social and human sciences, with 4,000 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institution: Historique |publisher=Facultés Universitaires Saint Louis |url=http://www.fusl.ac.be/fr/27.html |accessdate=9 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223141339/http://www.fusl.ac.be/fr/27.html |archivedate=23 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], a military college established in 1834 by a French colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes the RMA so special? |publisher=[[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Belgian Royal Military Academy]] |url=http://www.rma.ac.be/RMAdotNet/scsc/infos/default.aspx?Page=1&amp;SubPage=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228233044/http://www.rma.ac.be/RMAdotNet/scsc/infos/default.aspx?Page=1&amp;SubPage=3 |archivedate=28 December 2007 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a dozen of university colleges are located in Brussels, including two drama schools, founded in 1832: the French-speaking [[Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|Conservatoire Royal]] and the [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] [[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petite histoire du Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|publisher=Conservatoire Royal|url=http://www.conservatoire.be/historique.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel |publisher=[[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]] |url=http://www.kcb.be/eng/indexin.asp?pag=bib&amp;nr=1 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013223138/http://www.kcb.be/eng/indexin.asp?pag=bib&amp;nr=1 |archivedate=13 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other universities have campuses in Brussels, such as the [[Université Catholique de Louvain|Université catholique de Louvain]], which has had its medical faculty in the city since 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'histoire de l'UCL à Bruxelles |publisher=[[Université Catholique de Louvain]] |url=http://www.uclouvain.be/47547.html |accessdate=9 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114142407/http://www.uclouvain.be/47547.html |archivedate=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to its faculty of architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uclouvain.be/en/sites/st-gilles|title=UCLouvain Bruxelles Saint-Gilles|last=|first=|date=|website=UCLouvain|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its sister [[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/unit/52230448/@@org|title=KU Leuven organisational chart: KU Leuven, Campus Brussels|publisher=[[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (offering bachelor &amp; master's degrees in economics &amp; business, law, arts, and architecture). In addition, the University of Kent's [[Brussels School of International Studies]] is a specialised postgraduate school offering advanced international studies.

=== Primary and secondary education ===
Most of Brussels pupils between the ages of 3 and 18 go to schools organised by the [[Flemish Community]] or the [[French-speaking Community]], with roughly 20% going to Dutch-speaking schools, and close to 80% to French-speaking schools. Due to the post-war international presence in the city, there are also a number of international schools, including the [[International School of Brussels]], with 1,450 pupils, between the ages of 2½ and 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISB Profile |publisher=[[International School of Brussels]] |url=http://www.isb.be/page.cfm?p=7 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017045221/http://www.isb.be/page.cfm?p=7 |archivedate=17 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British School of Brussels]], and the four [[European School]]s, which provide free education for the children of those working in the [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]]. The combined student population of the four [[European School]]s in Brussels is currently around 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|publisher=[[European Schools|Schola Europaea]]|url=http://www.eursc.eu/index.php?id=133|accessdate=9 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231041405/http://www.eursc.eu/index.php?id=133|archivedate=31 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libraries ===
{{Main|List of libraries in Belgium}}Brussels has a number of public or private-owned [[Library|libraries]] on its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://be.brussels/brussels-for-free/books-and-literature/public-libraries |title=Public libraries |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries in Brussels fall under the competence of the Communities and are usually separated between French-speaking and Dutch-speaking institutions, although some are mixed.{{vn|date=April 2018}}

== Science and technology ==
{{Main|Science and technology in Brussels}}
Science and technology in Brussels is well developed with the presence of several [[List of universities in Belgium|universities]] and research institutes.

The [[Museum of Natural Sciences|Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]] houses the world's largest hall completely dedicated to [[dinosaur]]s, with its collection of 30 [[fossil]]ised ''[[Iguanodon]]'' skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.naturalsciences.be/en/museum/exhibitions-view/239/394/390 |title=Permanent Exhibition » Dinosaur Gallery |website=Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences |access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Planetarium (Belgium)|Planetarium]] of the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]] is one of the largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brusselsmuseums.be/en/museum/102-planetarium-of-brussels |title=Planetarium of Brussels |website=Brussels' Museums |access-date=10 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075316/http://www.brusselsmuseums.be/en/museum/102-planetarium-of-brussels |archive-date=11 February 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
{{Main|List of hospitals in Belgium#Brussels-Capital Region}}
Brussels is home to a thriving [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and [[health care]] industry which includes pioneering [[biotechnology]] research. The health sector employs 70,000 employees in 30,000 companies. There are 3,000 life sciences researchers in the city and two large [[science park]]s: [[Da Vinci Research Park]] and [[Erasmus Research Park]]. There are five [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]], a [[military hospital]] and more than 40 general hospitals and specialist clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hospitals.be/|title=Belgian Association of Hospitals|website=www.hospitals.be|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==

===Air===
[[File:Brussels Airlines Airbus A319 landing at Brussels Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Brussels Airlines]] Airbus A319 landing at [[Brussels Airport]] in [[Zaventem]]]]
The Brussels-Capital Region is served by several airports, all of which are located outside of the administrative territory of the region. The most notable are:
* [[Brussels Airport|Brussels-National Airport]], located in the nearby Flemish municipality of [[Zaventem]], {{convert|12|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} east of the capital;
* [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], located near [[Charleroi]] ([[Wallonia]]), some {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south-west of Brussels;
* [[Melsbroek Air Base]], located in [[Steenokkerzeel]], is mainly a military airport and is used in a minority way for civilian travelers.
The first two are also the main airports of Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brussels.info/airports/|title=Brussels.info - Brussels Airports|website=www.brussels.info|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
[[File:Eugène Boudin 005.jpg|thumb|''The Saint Catherine Dock'', Eugène Boudin (1871)|left]]
Since the 16th century, Brussels has had its own harbour, the [[port of Brussels]]. It has been enlarged throughout the centuries to become the second Belgian inland port. Historically situated near the Sainte-Catherine/Sint-Katelijne square, it lies today in the northwest of the region, on the [[Brussels–Scheldt Maritime Canal]] (commonly called ''Willebroek Canal),'' which connects Brussels to [[Antwerp]] via the [[Scheldt]]. Ships and large barges up to 4,500 tons can penetrate deep into the country, avoiding break-ups and load transfers between Antwerp and the centre of Brussels, hence reducing the cost for companies using the canal, and thus offering a competitive advantage.

Moreover, the connection of the Willebroek Canal with the [[Brussels–Charleroi Canal]], in the very heart of the capital, creates a north-south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] ([[Wallonia]]). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important [[Canal inclined plane|inclined plane]] of [[Ronquières inclined plane|Ronquières]] and the lifts of [[Strépy-Bracquegnies]].

The importance of river traffic in Brussels makes it possible to avoid the road equivalent of 740,000 trucks per year – almost 2,000 per day – which, in addition to easing traffic problems, represents an estimated carbon dioxide saving of 51,545 tonnes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.port.brussels/en|title=Port of Brussels|website=Port of Brussels|language=en|access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Train===
{{Further|List of railway stations in Belgium}}[[File:Gare de Bruxelles-Midi Station Brussel-Zuid.jpg|thumb|left|Main hall of [[Brussels-South railway station]], home to the [[Eurostar]] train service to [[London]]]]
[[File:Ice bruxelles.JPG|thumb|High-speed rail networks connect Brussels with other European cities ''([[Intercity-Express|ICE]] train in the [[Brussels-North railway station|North station]] pictured)'']]
The Brussels-Capital Region has three main train stations: [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]], [[Brussels-Central railway station|Central]] and [[Brussels-North railway station|North]], which are the busiest of the country.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Brussels-South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to [[London]] by [[Eurostar]] trains via the [[Channel Tunnel]] (1hr 51min); to [[Amsterdam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|title=Distance between Brussels, Belgium and Amsterdam, The Netherlands|work=Distances Technology|accessdate=11 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Thalys]] and ''InterCity'' connections; to Amsterdam, [[Paris]] (1hr 50min and 1hr 25min respectively {{as of|lc=y|2015|April|6}}), and [[Cologne]] by [[Thalys]]; and to Cologne (2hr 59min) and [[Frankfurt]] (3hr 16min) by the German [[InterCityExpress|ICE]].

The train rails in Brussels go underground, near the centre, through the [[North–South connection]], with the Brussels-Central station also being largely underground. The tunnel itself is only six tracks wide at its narrowest point, which often causes congestion and delays due to heavy use of the route.

The [[City of Brussels]] has minor railway stations at [[Bockstael railway station|Bockstael]], [[Brussels-Chapel railway station|Brussels-Chapel]], [[Brussels-Congres railway station|Brussels-Congres]], [[Brussels-Luxembourg railway station|Brussels-Luxembourg]], [[Schuman station|Brussels-Schuman]], [[Brussels-West station|Brussels-West]], [[Haren railway station (Brussels)|Haren]], [[Haren-South railway station|Haren-South]] and [[Simonis metro station|Simonis]].

In the Brussels Region, there are also railways stations at [[Berchem-Sainte-Agathe railway station|Berchem-Sainte-Agathe]], [[Boitsfort railway station|Boitsfort]], [[Boondael railway station|Boondael]], [[Bordet railway station|Bordet (Evere)]], [[Etterbeek railway station|Etterbeek]], [[Evere railway station|Evere]], [[Forest-East railway station|Forest-East]], [[Forest-South railway station|Forest-South]], [[Jette railway station|Jette]], [[Meiser railway station|Meiser (Schaerbeek)]], [[Moensberg railway station|Moensberg (Uccle)]], [[Saint-Job railway station|Saint-Job (Uccle)]], [[Schaerbeek railway station|Schaarbeek]], [[Uccle-Calevoet railway station|Uccle-Calevoet]], [[Uccle-Stalle railway station|Uccle-Stalle]], Vivier d'Oie-Diesdelle (Uccle), [[Merode station|Merode]] and [[Watermael railway station|Watermael]].

===City public transport===
The Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company [[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|STIB/MIVB]] is the local [[public transport]] operator in Brussels. It covers the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region and some surface routes extend to the near suburbs in the other regions.

==== Metro ====
[[File:Rame "Boa".jpg|thumb|[[Brussels Metro]] carriage at [[Erasmus metro station]]|left]]
The [[Brussels Metro]] dates back to 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/brussels/|title=Brussels Metro and Tram Network|work=Railway Technology|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but underground lines known as ''premetro'' have been serviced by tramways since 1968. The network consists of four conventional metro lines and three ''[[premetro]]'' lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6, with some shared sections, covering a total of {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="The network and vehicles"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?_guid=8086313c-3883-3410-f894-ec3da5b1280e&amp;l=en|title=The network and vehicles|work=STIB-MIVB|access-date=27 February 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the metro network within the region has a total of 69 metro and ''premetro'' stations. The metro is an important [[Transport in Brussels|means of transport]], connecting with six [[railway station]]s of the [[National Railway Company of Belgium]], and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[De Lijn]] and [[Wallonia|Walloon]] [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] bus stops.

==== Trams and buses ====
A comprehensive [[Brussels buses|bus]] and [[Brussels trams|tram network]] covers the region. {{As of|2017}}, the Brussels tram system consists of 17 tram lines (three of which – lines T3, T4 and T7 – qualify as ''[[premetro]]'' lines). The total route length is {{convert|139|km|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="The network and vehicles"/&gt; making it one of the largest tram networks in Europe. The Brussels bus network is complementary to the rail network. It consists of 50 bus routes and 11 night routes, spanning {{convert|445|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="The network and vehicles"/&gt; Since April 2007, STIB/MIVB has been operating a night bus network called ''Noctis''. On Fridays and Saturdays, 11 bus routes operate from midnight until 3 a.m. They run from the centre of Brussels to the outer reaches of the Brussels-Capital Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.brussels.be/artdet.cfm/4353 |title=Metro, tram and bus in Brussels |website=City of Brussels |language=en |access-date=27 February 2017|date=2016-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ticketing ====
An interticketing system means that a STIB/MIVB ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the region. A single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport. The commuter services operated by [[De Lijn]], [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|NMBS/SNCB]] will, in the next few years,{{when|date=September 2016}} be augmented by the [[Brussels RER|Brussels RER/GEN]] network, which will connect the capital and surrounding towns. Since August 2016, paper tickets have been discontinued in favour of electronic MoBIB cards.

==== Other public transport ====
[[File:VilloStationAlmostFull.jpg|thumb|''[[Villo!]]'' bicycles in Brussels]]Since 2003, Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the [[Bremen]] company ''Cambio,'' in partnership with the STIB/MIVB and local ridesharing company ''Taxi Stop''. In 2006, a [[Community bicycle program|public bicycle-sharing programme]] was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by ''[[Villo!]]''. Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by ''Collecto'', a shared taxi system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the ''Zen Car'' electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.

===Road network===
[[File:Wetstraat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rue de la Loi]]/[[Wetstraat]] is one of the city's main streets]]

In medieval times, Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north-south (the modern Rue Haute/Hoogstraat) and east-west (Chaussée de Gand/Gentsesteenweg-Rue du Marché aux Herbes/Grasmarkt-Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat). The ancient pattern of streets, radiating from the [[Grand Place]], in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built [[covering of the Senne|over the River Senne]], [[small ring (Brussels)|over the city walls]] and over the railway connection between the North and South Stations.

Today, Brussels has the most congested traffic in North America and Europe, according to US traffic information platform [[INRIX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/brussels-and-antwerp-have-worst-traffic|title=Brussels and Antwerp have worst traffic|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=8 December 2013|newspaper=Flanders Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brussels is the hub of a range of old national roads, the main ones being clockwise: the [[N1 road (Belgium)|N1]] (N to [[Breda]]), [[N2 road (Belgium)|N2]] (E to [[Maastricht]]), [[N3 road (Belgium)|N3]] (E to [[Aachen]]), [[N4 road (Belgium)|N4]] (SE to [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]]) [[N5 road (Belgium)|N5]] (S to [[Reims|Rheims]]), N6 (S to [[Maubeuge]]), N7 (SW to [[Lille]]), [[N8 road (Belgium)|N8]] (W to [[Koksijde]]) and N9 (NW to [[Ostend]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autosnelwegen.net/frames.html?/nb.html |title=Belgian N roads |publisher=Autosnelwegen.net |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529013951/http://www.autosnelwegen.net/frames.html?%2Fnb.html |archive-date=29 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually named ''chaussées/steenwegen'', these highways normally run in a straight line, but sometimes lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.

The region is skirted by the [[European route E19]] (N-S) and the [[European route E40|E40]] (E-W), while the [[E411]] leads away to the SE. Brussels has an [[beltway|orbital motorway]], numbered R0 (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the ''Ring''. It is pear-shaped, as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents' objections.

The city centre, sometimes known as the ''pentagon'', is surrounded by an inner ring road, the [[small ring (Brussels)|''Small Ring'']] (French: ''Petite Ceinture'', Dutch: ''Kleine Ring''), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered R20 or N0. These were built upon the site of the [[second walls of Brussels|second set of city walls]] following their demolition. The [[Brussels Metro line 2|metro line 2]] runs under much of these. Since June 2015, a number of central boulevards inside the pentagon have become car-free, limiting transit traffic through the old city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circulatieplan.be/en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514223301/http://circulatieplan.be/en |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 May 2015 |title=Circulation plan |accessdate=26 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eastern side of the region, the R21 or ''[[Greater ring (Brussels)|Greater Ring]]'' (French: ''Grande Ceinture'', Dutch: ''Grote Ring'') is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from [[Laeken]] to [[Uccle]]. Some ''premetro'' stations (see [[Brussels Metro]]) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to [[Uccle|Saint-Job]].

=== Fire department ===
The Brussels Fire and Emergency Medical Care Service, commonly known by its acronym SIAMU (DBDMH), operates in the 19 municipalities of Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://be.brussels/about-the-region/regional-bodies/fire-brigade |title=SIAMU |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a class X fire department and the largest [[Fire department|fire service]] in Belgium in terms of annual operations, equipment, and personnel. It has 9 [[fire station]]s, spread over the entire Brussels-Capital Region, and employs about 1,000 professional [[firefighter]]s. As well as preventing and fighting fires, SIAMU also provides emergency medical care services in Brussels via its centralised 100 number (and the single 112 emergency number for the 27 countries of the European Union). It is bilingual (French–Dutch).

Brussels is one of the greenest capitals in Europe, with over 8,000 hectares of green spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://be.brussels/culture-tourism-leisure/parks-and-green-space |title=Parks and green spaces |website=be.brussels |language=en |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetation cover and natural areas are higher in the outskirts, where they have limited the [[peri-urbanisation]] of the capital, but they decrease sharply towards the centre of Brussels; 10% in the central ''pentagon'', 30% of the municipalities in the first ring, and 71% of the municipalities in the second ring are occupied by green spaces.

A multitude of parks and gardens, both public and privately owned, are scattered throughout the city. In addition to this, the [[Sonian Forest]] is located in its southern part and stretches out over the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium#Regions|Belgian regions]]. As of 2017, it has been inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], the only Belgian component to the multinational inscription '[[Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]]'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">'''Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor''' (1879–1966) was an [[England|English]] geographer and historian of science, the first woman to hold an academic chair of geography in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

Taylor was educated at the [[Camden School for Girls]], the [[North London Collegiate School]], and [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]]. In 1903 she obtained a first class BSc in [[chemistry]] from the [[University of London]]. While teaching chemistry she studied at the [[University of Oxford]] and from 1908 to 1910 acted as research assistant to [[A. J. Herbertson]], head of the Oxford Geography School. She wrote school geography textbooks in collaboration with [[J. F. Unstead]], and lectured at [[Clapham Training College for Teachers]], the [[Froebel Institute]], the East London College (later [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]]), and [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]. Gaining a DSc in geography from the [[University of London]] in 1929, she was appointed professor of geography in 1930, and held the post until 1944.

The '''geology of [[Senegal]]''' formed beginning more than two billion years ago. The [[Archean]] greenschist [[Birimian]] rocks common throughout West Africa are the oldest in the country, intruded by [[Proterozoic]] granites. Basins formed in the interior during the [[Paleozoic]] and filled with sedimentary rocks, including [[tillite]] from a glaciation. With the rifting apart of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] in the [[Mesozoic]], the large [[Senegal Basin]] filled with thick sequences of marine and terrestrial sediments. Sea levels declined in the [[Eocene]] forming large phosphate deposits. Senegal is blanketed in thick layers of terrestrial sediments formed in the [[Quaternary]]. The country has extensive natural resources, including gold, diamonds, and iron. 

==Stratigraphy, tectonics &amp; geologic history==
The oldest rocks in Senegal are [[Archean]] or [[Proterozoic]] [[Birimian]], commonly found throughout much of West Africa. Birimian rock units include the metabasic, meta-andesite, [[breccia]] and [[greywacke]] of the [[Mako Series]], [[Diale Series]] meta-basites, red jasper, [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[schist]] and [[marble]], as well as the schist, greywacke and conglomerates of the [[Dalema Series]]. In the Kedougou inlier, these volcanic and sedimentary rocks were intruded by [[granite]] [[plutons]] in the [[Paleoproterozoic]], during the [[Eburnean orogeny]] between 2 billion and 1.8 billion years ago. In southeastern Senegal, the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[Madina-Kouta Basin]] outcrops along the edge  of the inlier. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=212-214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
The [[Komba Basin]], bounded by the Kedougou inlier, Madina-Kouta Basin and eastern edge of the Bassaris branch contains the horizontal sedimentary rocks of the [[Early Cambrian]] [[Mali Group]]. The basin has a northern extension, known as the [[Faleme Basin]] is filled with [[chert]], [[limestone]] and [[tillite]] potentially related to the glaciations of the Paleozoic. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=212}}

===Mesozoic –Cenozoic (251 million years ago-present)===
The Senegal sedimentary basin, also known as the Senegal-Mauritania Basin, formed as the largest marginal basin in Africa during the rifting apart of the center of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] to form the Atlantic Ocean in the [[Mesozoic]]. The basin is 1400 kilometers from north to south and 500 kilometers at its maximum width at Dakar. This Atlantic-type half-basin has gently dipping sedimentary units that get thicker closer to the coast. Due to overlying sediments from the [[Oligocene]] to modern times, its exact structure and origins are unclear. 

Pre-Mesozoic basement rock slopes gently westward onshore and then drops offshore along a north-south fault. The depth to basement rock is six kilometers off of Dakar and eight kilometers off of Casamance. Two major north-south faults, formed in the [[Cretaceous]] through the late [[Miocene]], break up the basin into horsts and grabens. The southern part of the basin has 10 salt domes (also known as diapirs). There are several disconformities, one offshore from the Senonian and the from the [[Oligocene]], spanning the entire basin. The sedimentary sequence begins with [Triassic]] [[evaporite]], [[gypsum]], [[halite]] and [[anhydrite]], which coincided with a [[tholeiitic magma series]]. 

Two kilometers of carbonates formed in the [[Jurassic]], with large amounts of detrital elements during the [[Aptian]] and clastic sedimentation between the Aptian and the [[Lutetian]]. The [[Albian]] through the [[Turonian]] are represented by [[argillite]] and organic-rich sediments, followed by biochemical precipitation since the [[Paleocene]] epoch of the [[Cenozoic]]. During the [[Maastrichtian]], an alkali [[syenite]] dome near Saint Louis intruded sand deposits. 

By the early Cenozoic, the ocean retreated, except in the [[Casamance Gulf]] and by the [[Eocene]], the region was experiencing intense,  terrestrial weathering. The Cap-Vert experienced two peaks of volcanism, one in the [[Miocene]] and the other in the [[Quaternary]], producing small occurrences of understaturated, alkaline lavas. During the Quaternary, volcanism at the head of the Cap-Vert peninsula built the Mamelles volcano and its associated vents and flows. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=214}}

==Hydrogeology==
The Senegal Superficial aquifer system is formed of unconsolidated Quaternary sediments, covering the entirety of the Senegal Basin. In some cases, groundwater is hosted beneath basalts, and water depths range considerably between a few meters and up to 72 meters below the surface. The Intermediate aquifer is consolidated limestone karst, beneath the Superficial aquifer. It experiences salt water intrusion near the coast and high iron and fluoride in the center of the country. The deep aquifer system is composed of [[Maastrichtian]] calcareous sandstone. This 250 meter thick aquifer is the main water supply for much of Senegal, and experiences comparable salinity and iron contamination issues. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Senegal|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Senegal#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Senegal has extensive natural resources and there is high potential for gold in Paleoproterozoic rocks. Artisanal mines extract gold from the [[Birimian]] greenschist belts in the southeast. The carbonate-hosted Faleme iron deposit contains 800 million tons of ore, in one of the largest Paleoproterozoic deposits in Africa. [[Magnetite]] and [[iron hydroxide]] in the formation is up to 60 percent pure iron. Diamonds are found in the [[Faleme River]] and the [[Gambia River]] and prospecting for titanium-bearing sands began in the 1980s. 
In addition to metals, Senegal has large phosphate reserves, formed in Cenozoic, particularly the [[Eocene]]. The switch from a marine to a continental environment in the Eocene led to the long-running enrichment of lime phosphates to aluminum phosphates. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=215}}

*'''[[developing countries]]''' – development of a country is measured using a mix of economic factors (income per capita, GDP, degree of modern infrastructure (both physical and institutional), degree of industrialisation, proportion of economy devoted to agriculture and natural resource extraction) and social factors (life expectancy, the rate of literacy, poverty). The UN-produced Human Development Index (HDI) is a compound indicator of the above statistics. There is a strong correlation between low income and high population growth, both within and between countries. In developing countries, there is low per capita income, widespread poverty, and low capital formation. In developed countries there is continuous economic growth and a relatively high standard of living. The term is value-laden and prescriptive, as it implies a natural transition from "undeveloped" to "developed" when such transitions can instead be imposed. Although poverty and physical deprivation are clearly undesirable, it does not follow that it is therefore desirable for "undeveloped" economies to move towards affluent Western-style "developed" free market economies. The terms "industrialised" and "non-industrialised" are no different in this assumption.

[[File:Athruzsidewalk.jpg|thumb|Sidewalks are a common form of hardscaping]]
'''Hardscape''' refers to [[hard landscape materials]] in the [[built environment]] structures that are incorporated into a landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hardscape|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hardscape|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can include paved areas, driveways, [[retaining walls]], sleeper walls, stairs, walkways, and any other landscaping made up of hard wearing materials such as wood, stone, concrete etc. as opposed to [[softscape]], the [[horticulture|horticultural]] elements of a [[landscape]].

Hard landscaping involves projects that cover the entirety of the yard and that are necessary before soft landscaping features come into play. Hard landscaping is very much altering the foundation of the yard, the "bricks and mortar", and so only once this is completed can the landscaper begin to focus on the more beautiful features of the yard, hard-soft landscaping such as the floral arrangements, trees and shrubs and perfecting color schemes. One key feature of hard landscaping is to do with the absorption of water – something that is of great importance given the climate. Hard landscaping ensures that worrying about water after heavy rain or snowfall is not an issue. The right water absorption and irrigation system installed through hard landscaping, coupled with hard materials that safely move water away from the property can ensure that soil movement is never a problem and that the yard stays a drier, enjoyable living space, rather than a wet and muddy bog. There are soft landscaping options that can help to achieve this, but the bulk of this is achieved through hard landscaping.

From an [[urban planning]] perspective, hardscapes can include very large features, such as paved roads, driveways or fountains, and even small pools. Most [[water feature]]s are hardscapes because they require a barrier to retain the water, instead of letting it drain into the surrounding soil.

Hardscaping allows the erection of man-made landscaping features that would otherwise be impossible due to [[soil erosion]], including some that compensate for large amounts of human traffic that would cause wear on bare earth or grass. For example, sheer vertical features are possible.

Without nearby bare soil, or natural drainage channels or culverts, hardscape with an [[impervious surface]] requires artificial methods of [[drainage]] or [[surface runoff]] to carry off the water that would normally be absorbed into the ground as [[groundwater]] and prevent premature wear to itself. Lack of capacity, or poorly planned or executed drainage or grading of the surface can cause problems after severe storms or heavy extended periods of rain fall, such as flooding, washout, mud flows, sink holes, accelerated erosion, [[wet rot]] to wood elements, drowning of plants trees and shrubs, and even foundation problems to an adjacent home such as cracking the foundation, basement flooding due to water infiltration, and pest infiltration, such as ants and other insects entering through damaged areas.

==Regulations and licensing==

===Australia===
Hardscape landscaping in Queensland,&lt;ref&gt;Queensland Building and Construction Commission, http://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is a licensed qualification called Structural Landscaping, which is divided into two classes of licenses: Trade Contractor Structural Landscaper, and a Builder restricted to Structural Landscaping, referred to as the "jack of all trades" due to its large scope of works. These Structural Landscaping licenses include the erection and fabrication of decking, fences, carports, pergolas, paving and the construction of retaining walls.

The '''Hoorn Islands''' (also '''Futuna Islands''') are one of the two island groups of which the [[French overseas departments and territories|French overseas collectivity]] (''[[collectivité d'outre-mer]]'', or ''COM'') of [[Wallis and Futuna]] is geographically composed. The aggregate area is 115&amp;nbsp;km², and the population 4,873 ([[census]] of 2003).

==History==
The archipelago was named by the Dutch navigators [[Willem Schouten]] and [[Jacob Le Maire]], first Europeans to visit the islands in 1616. It was named after the Dutch city of [[Hoorn]], from which the expedition started.

==Geography==
Geographically, there are two islands:

*[[Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna|Futuna Island]] (in the northwest) (83&amp;nbsp;km², pop. 4871)
*[[Alofi Island]] (in the southeast) (32&amp;nbsp;km², pop. 2)

Administratively, the Hoorn Islands encompass two of the three royal chiefdoms of Wallis and Futuna:
*[[Tu`a]] (Alo): the eastern part of Futuna Island, and Alofi Island (area 85&amp;nbsp;km², pop. 2993)
*[[Sigave]] (Singave): the western third of Futuna Island (area 30&amp;nbsp;km², pop. 1880)

'''ISO 3166-2:BQ''' is the entry for [[Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, special municipalities of the [[Netherlands]], ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba#Administration|3 special municipalities]].

Most commonly, [[Panama]] is considered to be a part of North America and [[Colombia]] is considered a part of [[South America]].  [[Geology|Geologically]], the boundary between the two continents is defined by the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate]] and the [[South American Plate]].  This places the boundary roughly along the Panama-Colombia border.  Other definitions place the boundary at the lowest natural crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] near the [[Panama Canal]], or along the canal itself.  Another definition places the boundary at the lowest crossing of [[Central America]] near [[Lake Nicaragua]].  This definition splits Central America between the continents of North and South America.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knivskjellodden''' or '''Knivskjelodden''' is a [[peninsula]] located in [[Nordkapp Municipality]] in [[Finnmark]] county, [[Norway]].  It is the northernmost point on the island of [[Magerøya]] in [[Northern Norway]].  It is sometimes considered the [[extreme points of Europe|northernmost point of the entire continent of Europe]].  The nearby [[Kinnarodden]] on the [[Nordkinn Peninsula]] is the northernmost point on the mainland.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Knivskjelodden|title=Knivskjelodden|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northernmost point of the country Norway is in fact [[Rossøya]], in [[Svalbard]], far north.

Knivskjellodden can only be reached on foot, after a {{convert|9|km|adj=on}} long hike from a parking area near the [[European route E69]] highway ({{coord|71.122|25.71}}), {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} south of [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]].

Travel agencies that organize trips for unaware tourists often advertise the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] as the northern extremity of Europe, but this is not true as the Knivskjellodden is {{convert|1450|m}} further north.

'''Leonard Jaczewski''', Леонард Антонович Ячевский, Leonard Yachevsky (1858–1916) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[geologist]], [[geographer]], [[engineer]] and [[explorer]] of [[Siberia]]. He was one of the pioneers in the study of [[permafrost]].

== Biography ==
After graduating from high school in [[Warsaw]] Jaczewski began his studies at the [[Saint Petersburg Mining University|St. Petersburg Mining Institute]], graduating in 1883. Following this, he worked in [[Irkutsk]], taking part in an expedition to the summit of [[Mönkh Saridag]] and acting as an expert in to the [[gold mining]] industry in [[Transbaikal]]. He is credited with discovering and naming several [[glaciers]], as well as making many [[geomorphological]] and [[meteorological]] observations. In addition to this he spent time studying the geology of the shores of [[Lake Khövsgöl]] in [[Mongolia]].

Jaczewski is noted as one of the first researchers in the world to discover the relationship of the thickness of snow cover to the depth of a layer of permafrost. He also clarified the location of the southern boundary of the permafrost in Siberia. Until 1890 he took part in the classification of deposits ([[bituminous]] coals, for example) in the [[Semipalatinsk]] area, the [[Urals]], and [[Kazakhstan]], then moved to the [[Yenisei]], where he was hired by Jenisejskim District Operation Gold.

From 1893 to 1894 Jaczewski worked in a group of geologists and engineers alongside Charles Bohdanowcza, on the Achinsk - Baikal stretch of the Trans-Siberian railway. At the same time he investigated the area for mineral deposits and water. Jaczewski was co-author of a geological map of the areas adjacent to this section of the railway.

In the years 1895 - 1898 Jaczewski set out individually to look for jade, and in 1896 he discovered riverside deposits. In 1905, he was head of a geological expedition in the region of [[Minusinsk]] (Tuva). In 1908, he was requested by the authorities to develop the first Russian Geological Survey in Siberia, which was founded in 1918. In 1913 Jaczewski was elected as a member of the St. Petersburg Committee of Geology.

Towards the end of his life he became professor of [[mineralogy]] at the School of Mining in [[Yekaterinburg]] in the Urals, where he became the chair of mineralogy. He published mainly in Russian, but also in Polish as he liked to strongly emphasize his Polishness, and was known for his criticism of the [[tsarist regime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://robertniedzwiedzki.ing.uni.wroc.pl/Leonard%20Jaczewski.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13092">'''Lester George''' is a internationally renowned [[golf course]] [[architect]] who was born in [[Wiesbaden]], [[Germany]] in 1955 while his father was stationed there by the United States Air Force.

After attending The [[University of Richmond]], where he founded the school’s [[orienteering]] team, George settled in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Following college graduation in 1977, he spent four years in the army as an artillery officer, subsequently received his Master’s Degree from the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]] and remained in the Army Reserves until retiring a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in 2003. This military career coincided with the development of his career as a golf course architect.&lt;ref&gt;http://georgegolfdesign.com/-lester-george&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to opening his own firm in 1991, George studied with other golf course architects at Golf Services International learning all aspects of golf course design and construction. He attended the Harvard Design School, Golf Course Architecture in 1992, which launched his solo career. George's company, George Golf Design, Inc., is located in Midlothian, Virginia, just outside Richmond.  George is a member of the  [[American Society of Golf Course Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asgca.org/members/82?mid=71&lt;/ref&gt;

George has developed a niche in renovating and restoring classic golf courses designed by some of the most revered golden age architects such as MacDonald, Raynor, Tillinghast, Ross, Flynn, Tull and Wilson - and he has worked with many of the most historic and well-regarded golf facilities on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] (see project listings below).

Lester George donated much time and effort to the First Tee Program designing and overseeing construction of The First Tee of Chesterfield, the premiere 18-hole First Tee course in the United States.

Using abandoned [[landfill]]s as a canvas, George successfully transforming two [[brownfield land|brownfields]] into golf courses—converting overgrown hazardous areas into plush, green recreational turf.  One of these courses, Lambert's Point Golf Course in Norfolk, Virginia, won an Affinity Award for Environmental Stewardship from the Golf Course Builders Association of America.

George's renovation of the Raptor course at Langley Air Force Base posed a challenge when thousands of unexploded bombs were discovered on the site once excavation began.

George’s projects have won numerous awards:&lt;ref&gt;http://georgegolfdesign.com/-awards-and-recognition&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born in [[Noëllet]],&lt;ref name="AP-wire" /&gt; Western France on April 25, 1886 to a lumberjack. Her first husband, railroad worker Constant Lemaitre, was killed in [[World War I|the First World War]]. She married again to a taxi driver, Florentin Brémont, who died in 1967. She had no children.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Over the course of her life, she worked as a farmer, as well as in a [[pharmaceutical]] factory, as a nanny and as a [[seamstress]]. At 103, she was hit by a car and broke her arm as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/08/local/me-8038 |title=Marie Bremont, 115; Believed to Be Oldest Person in the World |work=Los Angeles Times |date=8 June 2001 |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died at her retirement home in [[Candé]], [[Maine-et-Loire]].

=== Germaine Haye ===
Germaine Haye (née Germain; 10 October 1888 – 18 April 2002)&lt;ref name=JornalDoBrasil/&gt; was France's oldest living person for about a year, following the death of Marie Brémont on 6 June 2001 until her own death at age 113 years 190 days.&lt;ref name=ShortNews&gt;{{de icon}}[http://www.shortnews.de/start.cfm?id=377083 "113-jährige Französin in Seniorenheim verstorben"], (""113-year-old Frenchwoman dies in retirement home"), ShortNews.de, 2002-04-19.

Haye lived in the town of [[Mortagne-au-Perche]] in [[Orne]], [[Normandy]], western France, since she was 19 years old. She worked as a babysitter and teacher until her three daughters grew up and left home. She then devoted herself to [[literature]], publishing poems under the pseudonym Anne Moranget.&lt;ref name=lacroix-20020422&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.la-croix.com/Archives/2002-04-22/La-doyenne-des-Francais-est-decedee-a-l-age-de-113-ans-_NP_-2002-04-22-156094 |title=La doyenne des Français est décédée à l'âge de 113 ans |lang=fr |trans-title=France's oldest woman died aged 113 |newspaper=[[La Croix]] |date=22 April 2002 |access-date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, following a [[femur|femoral]] fracture, she became a full-time [[wheelchair]] user, and went to live in the Mortagne-au-Perche retirement home  for the last two years of her life.

===Camille Loiseau===
Camille Blanche Loiseau Chadal (13 February 1892 – 12 August 2006) was the [[list of the verified oldest people|oldest living person]] in France until her death aged 114 years 180 days. Loiseau was ranked fifth in the world in the 2007 edition of [[Guinness World Records]]. She achieved the position of France's oldest woman, known in France as the ''[[Wiktionary:doyenne|Doyenne de France]]'', on the death of Anne Primout on 26 March 2005, who also died at age 114.

She was the oldest verified person living in Europe since the death of 114-year-old Italian [[Virginia Dighero]] 28 December 2005, and became the fifth oldest verified living person in the world on the death of 115-year-old American Susie Gibson on 16 February 2006. Madame Loiseau was succeeded as doyenne of France by [[#Marie-Simone Capony|Marie-Simone Capony]], aged 112 at the time, though the title was first given to fellow 112-year-old Marie Mornet Robin who lived in the western town of [[Poitou-Charentes]], but was three weeks younger than Capony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/.../article_1191823.php/Camille_Loiseau_oldest_person_in_France_dies_aged_114 |title=Camille Loiseau, oldest person in France, dies aged 114 |work=monstersandcritics.com}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and [[Japan]]ese supercentenarian Toyo Endo were recognised by Guinness World Records as the oldest people to share a birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-living-people-to-share-a-birthday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born in Paris and did not move out of the city until her hospitalization in 1998 due to a fall. She was the youngest of nine children, four boys and five girls. On 13 August 1910 she married René Frédéric Chadal, although their marriage lasted only 15 days.&lt;ref name="gerontoprevention"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gerontoprevention.free.fr/loiseau.html |title=Camille Loiseau 1892–2006 |work=gerontoprevention.free.fr |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is common in France, Camille Loiseau chose not to use her husband's last name.

She celebrated her last birthday "with a little champagne". She died in the [[Hôpital Paul-Brousse]] in [[Villejuif]].&lt;ref name="gerontoprevention"/&gt;

===Marie-Simone Capony=== 
Marie-Simone Capony (14 March 1894 – 15 September 2007) was, at age 113, the oldest living person in [[France]].&lt;ref name=sputnik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20070919/79534243.html |title=France's oldest woman dies at 113 |work=Sputnik International |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the French [[Wiktionary:doyenne|doyenne]] following the death of 114-year-old [[Camille Loiseau]] in August 2006. At the time of her death, aged 113 years and 185 days, due to heart failure, she ranked as the [[oldest people|fifth-oldest person in the world]]. Capony was born in Charlieu ([[Loire]]), and lived in a retirement facility in [[Cannes]]. She never married (her [[fiancé]] was killed in action at the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914).&lt;ref name=sputnik/&gt; Capony had not been able to walk since she turned 100, after having an operation in order to fix a broken thighbone, but she still remained in fairly good health considering her very advanced age.&lt;ref name=sputnik/&gt;

===Mathilde Aussant===
Mathilde Aussant (27 February 1898 – 23 July 2011) was a [[France|French]] [[supercentenarian]] who was at the time of her death believed to be the oldest verified person in France.&lt;ref name=GRG-Rankings /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connexionfrance.com/france-oldest-woman-mathilde-aussant-dies-113-12902-view-article.html |title=France's oldest woman dies at 113 |work=[[The Connexion]] |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subsequent verification of [[#Marie-Isabelle Diaz|Marie-Isabelle Diaz]] to have been born on 22 February 1898 meant that Aussant was in fact the second oldest.

She was born in [[Donges]], France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://francaiscelebres.com/1898.html |title=Français célèbres nés en 1898 |work=Francaiscelebres.com |date= |accessdate=18 November 2013 |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315213518/http://francaiscelebres.com/1898.html |archivedate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth of eleven children born to François Gaudet and Hélène Halgand. Following the death of her mother, she left Donges for [[Paris]] in 1923. She worked as a housekeeper and babysitter. She married a railroad worker from [[Gare Saint-Lazare]], who died in 1936. In 1946, she married another railroad worker, René Aussant, who died in 1961. Their only daughter died in 2007, leaving Aussant without any immediate family.&lt;ref name="Oldest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blois.maville.com/actu/actudet_-Mathilde-Aussant-vice-doyenne-de-France-_dep-1012969_actu.Htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104113654/http://www.blois.maville.com/actu/actudet_-Mathilde-Aussant-vice-doyenne-de-France-_dep-1012969_actu.Htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 January 2013 |title=Oldest Living French woman |work=blois.maville.com |date=4 November 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, she moved to a retirement home.

=== Marie-Isabelle Diaz {{anchor|Maria Diaz}} ===
Marie-Isabelle Diaz (née Rodriguez, 22 February 1898 – 29 October 2011) was posthumously recognized as the oldest living French person from the death of Eugénie Blanchard on 4 November 2010, until her own death a year later.&lt;ref name=lemauricien-20110814 /&gt; She is also the [[oldest people|oldest person]] ever from the [[overseas departments and territories of France|French possession]] of [[Réunion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5023">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Pitcairn'''. There are 3 mammal species in [[Pitcairn]], all of which are marine mammals of the order Cetacea.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

===Infraclass: [[Eutheria]]===

====Order: [[Cetacea]] (whales)====
----
[[Image:SpinnerDolphinsoffKauai 1999-03-15.jpg|thumb|[[Spinner Dolphin]]]]
The order Cetacea includes [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s. They are the mammals most fully [[aquatic adaptation|adapted to aquatic]] life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.

[[File:Pensthorpe Nature Reserve -near Fakenham -Norfolk-26oct2005.JPG|right|thumb|A view across a lake]]
'''Pensthorpe Natural Park''' is located in [[Kettlestone|Pensthorpe]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]] and is approximately one mile from [[Fakenham]] and close to the [[A1067 road]]. The park covers {{convert|700|acres}}. The [[River Wensum]], which runs through the site, is a designated [[Special Area of Conservation]] (SAC).&lt;ref name="SAC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0012647 | title=SAC | publisher=jncc | accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Pensthorpe Conservation Trust (PCT) was formed in January 2003. It is a charitable trust that works closely with Pensthorpe Natural Park to showcase the importance of species and habitat conservation. The PCT works with partner organisations in national conservation programmes to conserve wetland and farmland bird species. These partnerships include Operation Turtle Dove, The Great Crane Project and re-introduction projects for [[Red squirrel|red squirrels]] and [[Corncrake|corncrakes]]. 

== History ==
The site was created as a nature reserve by Bill Makins in the 1980s, before being bought by Bill and Deb Jordan in 2003, of [[Jordans (company)|Jordans cereals]]. During excavations to create the lakes and wader scrapes, one million tons of aggregates were excavated. The work uncovered  finds including a [[hand axe]] believed to date from 8000 BC. Tusks and the tooth from a [[woolly mammoth]] were also found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2008/06/12/places_wensum_valley_20080612_feature.shtml] BBC Norfolk video tour Retrieved 24 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

The reserve was the location of the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Springwatch]]'' from May 2008 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/norfolk/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8563000/8563186.stm BBC news item] Retrieved 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2008/06/11/springwatch_pensthorpe_return_feature.shtml Springwatch 2009] Retrieved 9 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

First broadcast in December 2013, the first episode of the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great British Garden Revival]]'' was based in the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/41ttbPVvt5kCyhyVfGVKTtq/monty-don Great British Garden Revival] Retrieved 28 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shuttle Radar Topography Mission''' ('''SRTM''') is an international research effort that obtained [[digital elevation model]]s on a near-global scale from [[56th parallel south|56°S]] to [[60th parallel north|60°N]],&lt;ref name=NikP2&gt;{{Harvnb|Nikolakopoulos|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to generate the most complete high-resolution digital topographic database of Earth prior to the release of the [[ASTER GDEM]] in 2009. SRTM consisted of a specially modified [[radar]] system that flew on board the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]] during the 11-day [[STS-99]] mission in February 2000, based on the older ''[[Spaceborne Imaging Radar|Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar]]'' (SIR-C/X-SAR), previously used on the Shuttle in 1994. To acquire [[Topography|topographic]] data, the SRTM payload was outfitted with two radar antennas.&lt;ref name=NikP2/&gt;  One antenna was located in the Shuttle's payload bay, the other – a critical change from the SIR-C/X-SAR, allowing single-pass interferometry – on the end of a 60-meter (200-foot) mast that extended from the payload bay once the Shuttle was in space.&lt;ref name=NikP2/&gt; The technique employed is known as [[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]]. [[Intermap Technologies]] was the prime contractor for processing the [[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] data.  

The elevation models are arranged into tiles, each covering one [[degree (angle)|degree]] of latitude and one degree of longitude, named according to their south western corners. For example, "n45e006" stretches from [[45th parallel north|45°N]] [[6th meridian east|6°E]] to [[46th parallel north|46°N]] [[7th meridian east|7°E]] and "s45w006" from [[45th parallel south|45°S]] [[6th meridian west|6°W]] to [[44th parallel south|44°S]] [[5th meridian west|5°W]]. The resolution of the raw data is one [[arcsecond]] (30 m along the equator) and coverage includes Africa, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Version 3.0 Global 1 arc second Data Released over Asia and Australia Version 1.0|url=https://earthdata.nasa.gov/nasa-shuttle-radar-topography-mission-srtm-version-3-0-global-1-arc-second-data-released-over-asia-and-australia|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513032841/https://earthdata.nasa.gov/nasa-shuttle-radar-topography-mission-srtm-version-3-0-global-1-arc-second-data-released-over-asia-and-australia|archivedate=2017-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A derived one arcsecond dataset with trees and other non-terrain features removed covering Australia was made available in November 2011; the raw data are restricted for government use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SRTM-derived 1 Second Digital Elevation Models Version 1.0|url=https://www.ga.gov.au/products/servlet/controller?event=GEOCAT_DETAILS&amp;catno=72759|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228201506/https://www.ga.gov.au/products/servlet/controller?event=GEOCAT_DETAILS&amp;catno=72759|archivedate=2012-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of the world, only three arcsecond (90 m along the equator) data are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nikolakopoulos|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one arcsecond tile has 3,601 rows, each consisting of 3,601 [[16 bit]] [[bigendian]] cells. The dimensions of the three arcsecond tiles are 1201 x 1201. The original SRTM elevations were calculated relative to the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid and then the [[EGM96]] geoid separation values were added to convert to heights relative to the geoid for all the released products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirt|first1=C.|last2=Filmer|first2=M.S. |last3=Featherstone|first3=W.E.|date=2010|title=Comparison and validation of recent freely-available ASTER-GDEM ver1, SRTM ver4.1 and GEODATA DEM-9S ver3 digital elevation models over Australia|journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=57|issue=3|pages=337–347|url=http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;local_base=gen01-era02&amp;object_id=137777|accessdate=May 5, 2012|bibcode = 2010AuJES..57..337H |doi = 10.1080/08120091003677553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elevation models derived from the SRTM data are used in [[geographic information system]]s. They can be downloaded freely over the Internet, and their file format (.hgt) is widely supported.

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission is an international project spearheaded by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency ([[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|NGA]]) and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]). NASA transferred the SRTM payload to the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]] in 2003; the canister, mast, and antenna are now on display at the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] in [[Chantilly, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannister/Mast, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Payload|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A20040261000|publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== No-data areas ==
[[File:Srtm voidfilling grass gis.png|right|thumb|350px|SRTM void filling with spline interpolation in [[GRASS GIS]].]]
The elevation datasets are affected by mountain and desert no-data areas. These amount to no more than 0.2% of the total area surveyed,&lt;ref&gt;Reuter H.I, A. Nelson, A. Jarvis, 2007, [http://www.cgiar-csi.org/images/stories/docs/Reuteretal2007.pdf An evaluation of void filling interpolation methods for SRTM data]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, International Journal of Geographic Information Science, 21:9, 983–1008 – 'the ‘finished’ grade version of the data (also referred to as Version 2) still contains data voids (some 836,000 km^2)'; 836,000 is 0.164% of the Earth's 5.1×10^8 km^2 surface&lt;/ref&gt; but can be a problem in areas of very high relief. They affect all summits over 8,000 meters, most summits over 7,000 meters, many Alpine and similar summits and ridges, and many gorges and canyons. There are some SRTM data sources which have filled these data voids, but some of these have used only [[interpolation]] from surrounding data, and may therefore be very inaccurate. If the voids are large, or completely cover summit or ridge areas, no interpolation algorithms will give satisfactory results. Other developers, including [[NASA World Wind]] and [[Google Earth]], have improved their results by using 1-[[arc-second]] for the United States and 3-[[arc-second]] for the rest of the world, data in the interpolation process, but, due to the poor resolution of these data, and very poor quality of some of them, they have further improved their earth viewing services by adding data from other sources.

'''Southampton Guildhall''' (branded the '''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Guildhall Southampton''') is a multipurpose venue in the [[Civic Centre, Southampton|Civic Centre]] in [[Southampton]], England. The grade II* [[listed building]] was originally a [[Seat of local government|town hall]]. There are three venues in the Guildhall catering for various event formats: the Guildhall, the Solent Suite and a lecture theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livenation.co.uk/southampton Southampton Guildhall Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
The Guildhall was designed to complement the rest of the Civic Suite and opened on 13 February 1937. It houses a large pipe organ which was built into it from new. The organ has two distinct consoles: a classical concert organ and a theatre organ. The consoles share the same body of approximately 4,000 pipes which are housed in chambers above the proscenium arch. It was the largest organ made by its builder, John Compton. On 7 October 2013, the venue was renamed to the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Guildhall Southampton, due to partnership between Live Nation UK and [[Telefónica Europe|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Telefónica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-24427083 |title=Southampton Guildhall renaming 'cheapens' venue |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=7 October 2013 |website=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta adopted a new [[telephone numbering plan]] in 2001–2002, in which telephone numbers were expanded to eight digits for fixed line and mobile numbers. Previously, fixed line numbers were six digits, while mobile, mailbox and pager services were seven digits long.

==Geographic numbering==
The prefix '''21''' was added to [[Maltacom]] fixed line numbers.

          xx xxxx (before 2002, from within Malta)
       '''21'''xx xxxx (after 2002, from within Malta)
  +356 '''21'''xx xxxx (after 2002, outside Malta)

[[Melita (telecommunication company)|Melita]] fixed line numbers have the prefix '''27'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20061124/local/hello-its-competition-time.34395#.UugjzNJFBkg Hello, it's competition time], ''[[Times of Malta]]'', 24 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Numbers were generally assigned according to locality:
*22: [[Valletta]], [[Ħamrun]], [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]]
*23: [[Floriana]], [[Ħamrun]]
*24: [[Pietà, Malta]]
*25: [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]]

==Non-geographic numbering==

The prefix '''9''' for seven-digit [[Vodafone Malta]] mobile phone numbers was changed to '''99'''.

          9xx xxxx (before 2002, from within Malta)
       '''99'''xx xxxx (after 2002, from within Malta)
  +356 '''99'''xx xxxx (after 2002, outside Malta)
The prefix '''09''' for Vodafone mobile phone numbers was changed to '''99'''.

Mobile phone numbers with the prefix '''09''', which were already eight digits, changed to '''99'''. The digit '''0''' was to be dialled from outside Malta as well as domestically.

          09xx xxxx (before 2002, from within Malta)
       '''99'''xx xxxx (after 2002, from within Malta)
  +356 '''09'''xx xxxx (before 2002, outside Malta)
  +356 '''99'''xx xxxx (after 2002, outside Malta)

Other non-geographic number ranges also changed, with the prefix for seven-digit mailbox numbers changing from '''07''' to '''217'''.

          07x xxxx (before 2002, from within Malta)
       '''217'''x xxxx (after 2002, from within Malta)
     +356 '''07'''x xxxx (before 2002, outside Malta)
     +356 '''217'''x xxxx (after 2002, outside Malta)

Similarly, the prefix for pager numbers changed from '''70''' and '''71''' to '''7117''' 

          70x xxxx (before 2002, from within Malta)
       '''7117''' xxxx (after 2002, from within Malta)
  +356 '''7117''' xxxx (after 2002, outside Malta)
'''The prefix for Go Mobile is 79'''
       79xx xxxx (after 2002, from within Malta)
  +356 79xx xxxx (after 2002, outside Malta)

The '''Amazonia Conference''' is a [[global warming]] [[activist]] organization with a particular focus on [[education]] of the public.

The Conference was established in April 1990, when governments of the world were discussing the dangers of [[global warming]] at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992. The Conference is an educational organisation with the aim of educating people about the realities of the endangered [[Natural environment|environment]] and the inevitable catastrophic consequences if no proactive and preventive steps are taken.

The project has reached many institutions and organisations all over the world, spreading the message ''Education for Preservation''. The organisation has given birth to other initiatives, such as The Amazonia Society, the Amazonia Seminar, the Amazonia Experience, and the Amazonia Files.

The Amazonia Conference is an educational organisation which, unlike other environmental organisations, focuses in education instead of radical campaigning. This does not mean that the organisation does not campaign. The organisation believes that it is effectively easier to 'form the minds of the young instead of attempting to amend adult ones.' Therefore, by educating the young, next generations will be equipped with environmentally aware citizens. The project also has a special division which visits companies and other organisations to educate their employees or members, on the current environmental issues which our planet is suffering due to human activities.

The Amazonia Conference is considered to be the biggest educational project in [[Portugal]] ([[Diario de Noticias]], 2000), and has recently received the [[British Airways]] Best Environmental Project Award 2004.

== History ==
The Amazonia Conference was established in 1990 by Professor [[Valdir Bento]], [[physicist]] and former head of [[NASA]]'s [[Laser]] technology department. The project has developed into the leading educational project in [[Portugal]], and is expanding to become one of the predominant environmental organisations in the [[United Kingdom]]. The 'Conference' has also conquered the [[United States]] and [[France]] and current plans reflect the need to explore the [[Asia-Pacific]].

'''''The Oude Stadhuis in Amsterdam''''' is a 1657 painting by [[Pieter Jansz. Saenredam]], based on a drawing he made of the Old Town Hall on [[Dam Square]] over six days in 1641 before its demolition. It was bought from the painter in 1658 for 300 guilders by the mayor of Amsterdam for his office in the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|New Town Hall]]. It is now in the city's [[Rijksmuseum]].

{{Administrative levels and divisions of China sidebar}}
'''Townships''' ({{zh|s=乡|hp=Xiāng}}), formally '''township-level divisions''' ({{zh|s=乡级行政区|hp=Xiāng Jí Xíngzhèngqū|links=no}}), are the basic level (fourth-level administrative units) of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|political divisions]] in [[China]]. They are similar to municipalities and communes in other countries and in turn may contain village committees and villages. In 1995 there were 29,502 townships and 17,532 towns (a total of 47,034 township-level divisions) in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan002813.pdf |title=China’s Township People's Congress Elections: An Introduction |last1=Yawei |first1=Liu|last2= |first2= |date= |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like other levels of government in mainland China, the township's governance is divided between the Communist Party Township Secretary, and the "[[County magistrate (China)|county magistrate]]" ({{zh|s=乡长|hp=Xiāng zhǎng|links=no}}). The township party secretary, along with the township's party committee, determines policy. The magistrate is in charge of administering the daily affairs of government and executing policies as determined by the party committee. A township official is the lowest-level ranked official in the civil service hierarchy; in practice, however, the township party secretary and magistrate can amass high levels of personal power.

A township government is formally responsible for local economic development, planning, maintenance of local roads, family planning (enforcing [[One-Child Policy]]), sanitation &amp; health, sports, and "other responsibilities as determined by higher level governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=zh:乡政府职能和职责|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/b7a99b67783e0912a2162a86.html|publisher=''Baidu Wenku''}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2033">'''Tropical Green Building''' refers to a style of construction that focuses on energy reduction, reduced use of chemicals, and supporting local labor and community. This requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages, from site selection, scheme formation, material selection and procurement, to project implementation.&lt;ref name="plainiotis"&gt;Ji Yan and Plainiotis Stellios (2006): Design for Sustainability. Beijing: China Architecture and Building Press. {{ISBN|7-112-08390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical [[Green building|Green Building]] has the same basis as green building in more [[temperate climate]]s, but the methods of construction are completely different. In the [[tropics]], the focus is on keeping cool, preventing insect infestations, and reduced mould, damp and maintenance in the home.

Generally, tropical green building also seeks to reduce [[power consumption]] through intelligent architecture, such as by allowing in lots of [[Sunlight|natural light]] so that [[electric light]]s aren't needed during the daytime, and at night, using white-painted roofs, ceilings and low-energy [[Incandescent light bulb|light bulbs]] such as [[Compact fluorescent lamp|compact fluorescent]]s or [[LED lamp]]s.

[[Solar power]], [[wind power]], and/or the use of [[micro hydro]] are often deployed, but not always the focus of tropical green building.

The '''World Geographic Reference System''' ('''GEOREF''') is a grid-based method of specifying locations on the surface of the [[Earth]]. GEOREF is essentially based on the geographic system of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], but using a simpler and more flexible [[notation]]. GEOREF was used primarily for [[air navigation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=DMA |author-link=Defense Mapping Agency |date=20 September 1990 |title=Defense Mapping Agency Technical Manual |series=TM 8358.1 |chapter=Chapter 5: Geographic Coordinate References |chapter-url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tm8358.1/tr83581c.html#ZZ38 |access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in military or inter-service applications, but it is rarely seen today. However, GEOREF can be used with any map or chart that has latitude and longitude printed on it.

== Operation ==

GEOREF is based on the standard system of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], but uses a simpler and more concise notation. GEOREF divides the Earth's surface into successively smaller quadrangles, with a notation system used to identify each quadrangle within its parent. Unlike latitude/longitude, GEOREF runs in one direction horizontally, east from the 180° [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]; and one direction vertically, north from the [[South Pole]]. GEOREF can easily be adapted to give co-ordinates with varying degrees of precision, using a 2–12 character [[geocode]].

GEOREF co-ordinates are defined by successive divisions of the Earth's surface, as follows:

* The first level of GEOREF divides the world into quadrangles each measuring 15 degrees of longitude by 15 degrees of latitude; this results in 24 ''zones'' of longitude and 12 ''bands'' of latitude. A longitude zone is identified by a letter from A to Z (omitting I and O) starting at 180 degrees and progressing eastward through the full 360 degrees of longitude; a latitude band is identified by a letter from A through M (omitting I) northward from the south pole. Hence, any 15 degree quadrangle can be identified by two letters; the easting (longitude) is given first, followed by the northing (latitude). These two letters are the first two characters of a full GEOREF coordinate.
* Each 15-degree quadrangle is further divided into smaller quadrangles, measuring 1 degree of longitude by 1 degree of latitude. These quadrangles are lettered A to Q (omitting I and O), running from west to east for longitude; and A to Q (omitting I and O), running south to north for latitude. These letters form the third and fourth characters of a full GEOREF coordinate. Four letters thus identify any 1-degree quadrangle in the world.
* Each of the 1-degree quadrangles is further subdivided into 60 1-minute longitude zones, numbered 00 through 59 from west to east, and 60 1-minute latitude bands, numbered 00 to 59 from south to north. These numbers are always written as two digits, with a leading zero if necessary, and the easting is always followed by the northing. Thus, 4 letters and 4 digits give the position of any 1-minute quadrangle.
* Each of the 1-minute quadrangles may be further divided into 10 or 100 smaller divisions both north–south and east–west, permitting the identification of 0.1-minute or 0.01-minute quadrangles. The GEOREF coordinate for any 0.1-minute quadrangle consists of four letters and six numbers; the GEOREF coordinate for any 0.01-minute quadrangle consists of four letters and eight numbers.

The initial two letters of a GEOREF reference, designating the 15 degree quadrangle, can be omitted, if it is clear which 15 degree quadrangle the reference applies to (e.g., when working within a restricted geographical area).

=== Example ===

[[Image:georef-local.jpg|thumb|256px|right|The GJ local grid]]
For example, on a GEOREF chart, [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River]] (38°17′10″N   76°24′42″W) / (38.286108, -76.4291704) is located (to the nearest minute) at position GJPJ3716. &lt;!-- Figure needed!  In figure 12-10, the blacked-out square (PJ) within the enlarged 15° square (GJ) indicates the 1° area that contains Patuxent. --&gt;

[[Image:Georef Example Patuxent.png|Breakdown of Georef co-ordinate GJPJ3716 into 15-degree quadrangle (GJ), 1-degree quadrangle (PJ), minutes east (37), and minutes north (16).]]

To locate the position from the coordinates, proceed as follows:

* Right from 180° longitude to longitude zone G
* Up from the South Pole to latitude zone J
* Right in zone GJ to the lettered 1° column P
* Up in zone GJ to the lettered 1° row J
* Right in the 1° horizontal zone to 37 minutes
* Up in the 1° vertical zone to 16 minutes

The same co-ordinate shown in 6-digit (1/10 minute) format is GJPJ370160 and in 8-digit (1/100 minute) format is GJPJ37001600.

== Designation of area ==

Extensions to the above notation allow the GEOREF system to be used to designate an area around a reference point. This is achieved by adding an area designation to a base GEOREF co-ordinate. The area designation can be the letter S, to specify the sides of a rectangle (separated by the letter X); or the letter R, to specify the radius of a circle. In both cases the units are nautical miles. In addition, the letter H can be added, followed by an altitude in thousands of feet.

For example, the reference GJQJ0207S6X8 designates a rectangle centered on Deal Island (GJQJ0207), running {{convert|6|nmi|km|0}} east–west and {{convert|8|nmi|km|0}} north–south. Designation GJPJ4103R5 means a circle around Point Lookout (GJPJ4103) with a radius of {{convert|5|nmi|km|0}}. Designation GJPJ3716H17 means a height of 17,000 feet over GJPJ3716.
