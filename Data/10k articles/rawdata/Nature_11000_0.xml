      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28995">The '''Alabama Champion Tree Program''' is a listing of the largest known specimens of particular tree species, [[native plants|native]] or [[Introduced species|introduced]], in the U.S. state of [[Alabama]].  It was established in 1970 by the [[Alabama Forestry Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forestry.state.al.us/PDFs/ChampionTrees.pdf |title=Champion Trees of Alabama 2012 |work=Alabama Forestry Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Native Trees of the Southeast |last=Kirkman |first=L. Katherine  |first2=Claude L. |last2=Brown |first3=Donald J. |last3=Leopold |year=2007 |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |isbn=978-0-88192-828-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was modeled on the [[National Register of Big Trees]], started by the [[American Forests]] organization in 1940.  The goal of Alabama's program is to record, heighten awareness of, and preserve the largest tree specimens in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forestry.state.al.us/ChampionTreeProgram.aspx |title=Champion Tree Program |work=Alabama Forestry Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses the same formula for recording tree specimens that was developed by American Forests.  Former champions are removed from the list as new, larger, champions are identified and recorded.  Although introduced species that have naturalized are generally eligible for the program, those species that the Alabama Invasive Plant Council considers to be [[Invasive species|invasive]] were removed from the listing in 2011 and are no longer eligible.  With the addition of 20 new specimens in 2011, the program had a total of 159 Champion Trees listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.alabama.gov/pr/pr.aspx?id=5402&amp;t=1 |title=New Champion Trees for 2011 Announced by Alabama Forestry Commission |work=Alabama Media Portal |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=April 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213133858/http://media.alabama.gov/pr/pr.aspx?id=5402&amp;t=1 |archivedate=December 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''alligator snapping turtle''' (''Macrochelys temminckii'') is a [[species]] of [[turtle]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Chelydridae]], native to freshwater habitats in the United States. ''M. temminckii'' is one of the heaviest freshwater [[turtles]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carwardine, Mark|title=Animal Records|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3FEKopUFkUC&amp;pg=PA174|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|page=174|isbn=9781402756238}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with, but not closely related to, the [[common snapping turtle]], which is in the genus ''[[Chelydra]]''. The [[Epithet#Biological nomenclature|specific epithet]] ''temminckii'' is in honor of Dutch [[zoology|zoologist]] [[Coenraad Jacob Temminck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ebeltz.net/herps/biogappx.html | title=Biographies of People Honored in the Herpetological Nomenclature North America | accessdate=July 9, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060710003430/http://ebeltz.net/herps/biogappx.html| archivedate= July 10, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Although it was once believed that only one [[Extant taxon|extant]] species exists in the genus ''[[Macrochelys]]'', recent studies have shown that there are two species, the other being the [[Suwannee snapping turtle]] (''M. suwanniensis'') of the [[Suwannee River]]&lt;ref name=ReptileDatabase&gt;{{cite journal | author=Uetz, P. | author2=J.

The alligator snapping turtle is given its common name because of its immensely powerful jaws and long, spring-like neck, as well as distinct ridges on its shell that are similar in appearance to the rough, ridged skin of an [[alligator]].

==Distribution and habitat==
The alligator snapping turtle is found primarily in southeastern United States waters. They are found from the [[Florida Panhandle]] west to [[East Texas]],  north to southeastern [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], southeastern [[Iowa]], western [[Illinois]], southern [[Indiana]], western [[Kentucky]], and western [[Tennessee]].  They are found on the [[Missouri River]] at least as far north as the [[Gavins Point Dam]], the southernmost dam on the Missouri River at [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]], [[South Dakota]], and are featured in the Gavins Point Dam Aquarium.&lt;ref name="ConantandCollins1991"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conant |first1=Roger |authorlink1=Roger Conant (herpetologist)|last2=Collins |first2=Joseph T. |authorlink2=Joseph T.

==Description==
[[Image:Macrochelys temminckiiHolbrookV1P24A.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration from [[John Edwards Holbrook|Holbrook]]'s ''North American Herpetology'', 1842]]
The alligator snapping turtle is characterized by a large, heavy head, and a long, thick shell with three dorsal ridges of large scales (osteoderms), giving it a primitive appearance reminiscent of some of the plated [[dinosaur]]s, most notably the [[Ankylosauria|ankylosaurs]]. They can be immediately distinguished from the [[common snapping turtle]] by the three distinct rows of spikes and raised plates on the [[carapace]], whereas the common snapping turtle has a smoother carapace. They are a solid gray, brown, black, or olive-green in color, and often covered with [[algae]]. They have radiating yellow patterns around their eyes, serving to break up the outline of the [[eye]]s to keep the turtle [[camouflage]]d. Their eyes are also surrounded by a star-shaped arrangement of fleshy, filamentous "eyelashes".

Though not verified, a {{convert|183|kg|lb|adj=on|abbr=on}} alligator snapping turtle was found in [[Kansas]] in 1937,&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/ReptilesAmphibians/Facts/FactSheets/Alligatorsnappingturtle.cfm | title=Smithsonian National Zoological Park: Alligator Snapping Turtle | accessdate=March 26, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307002004/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/ReptilesAmphibians/Facts/FactSheets/Alligatorsnappingturtle.cfm | archivedate=March 7, 2006 | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the largest verifiable one is debatable. One weighed at the [[Shedd Aquarium]] in [[Chicago]] was a 16-year resident giant alligator snapper weighing {{convert|113|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, sent to the [[Tennessee Aquarium]] as part of a breeding loan in 1999, where it subsequently died. Another weighing {{convert|107|kg|lb|abbr=on}} was housed at the [[Brookfield Zoo]] in suburban Chicago. Another large turtle reportedly weighed {{convert|135|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Telford Jr, S. R., Norton, T. M., Moler, P. E., &amp; Jensen, J. B. (2009).

In "mature" specimens (carapace length over {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}), males and females can be differentiated by the position of the [[cloaca]] from the carapace and the thickness of the tail's base. A mature male's cloaca extends beyond the carapace edge, a female's is placed exactly on the edge if not nearer to the [[plastron]]. The base of the tail of the male is also thicker as compared to females because of the hidden reproductive organs.

The inside of the turtle's mouth is camouflaged, and it possesses a [[Wiktionary:vermiform|vermiform]] (i.e., "worm-shaped") [[appendage]] on the tip of its [[tongue]] used to lure [[fish]], a form of [[Aggressive mimicry#Food as an attractant|Peckhamian mimicry]]. The turtle hunts by lying motionless in the water with its mouth wide open. The vermiform tongue imitates the movements of a worm, luring prey to the turtle's mouth. The mouth is then closed with tremendous speed and force, completing the ambush.

Contrary to claims that alligator snapping turtles possess one of the strongest bite forces of any animal, it has been recorded at {{convert|158|±|18|kgf|N lbf|abbr=on}}, which is lower than several other species of turtles and at about the same level as humans, relative to the turtle's body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://webhost.ua.ac.be/funmorph/publications/Herrel%20et%20al%202002%20J%20Evol%20Biol.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132833/http://webhost.ua.ac.be/funmorph/publications/Herrel%20et%20al%202002%20J%20Evol%20Biol.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-06|title=Evolution of bite performance in turtles|doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00459.x|year=2002|last1=Herrel|first1=A.|last2=O'Reilly|first2=J.

Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|0876669186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No human deaths have been reported to have been caused by alligator snapping turtles.&lt;ref name="Pritchard"/&gt;

==Diet==
Alligator snappers are [[opportunistic feeders]] that are almost entirely [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. They rely on both live food caught by themselves and dead organisms which they scavenge. In general, they will eat almost anything they can catch. Fishermen have glorified the species' ability to catch fish and to deplete fish populations, whereas in fact they largely target any abundant and easily caught prey, and rarely have any extensive deleterious effect on fish populations.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;Ernst, C., R. Barbour, J. Lovich. (1994). ''Turtles of the United States and Canada''. Washington, D.C.: [[Smithsonian Institution Press]]. {{ISBN|1560988231}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their natural diets consist primarily of fish and fish carcasses, [[mollusc]]s, [[carrion]], and [[amphibian]]s, but they are also known to eat [[snake]]s, [[crayfish]], [[worm]]s, [[water bird]]s, [[aquatic plant]]s, and other [[turtle]]s.&lt;ref name="Pritchard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt; In one study conducted in [[Louisiana]], 79.8% of the stomach contents of adult alligator snapping turtles was found to be composed of other turtles, although the resistance of shell and reptile-bone fragments to digestion may have led these fragments to remain longer in the digestive tract than other items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1656/1528-7092(2006)5[443:FHOMTA]2.0.CO;2| title = Food Habits of ''Macrochelys temminckii'' (Alligator Snapping Turtle) from Arkansas and Louisiana| journal = Southeastern Naturalist| volume = 5| issue = 3| pages = 443–452| year = 2006| last1 = Elsey | first1 = R. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This species may also, on occasion, prey on aquatic rodents, including [[Coypu|nutria]]s and [[muskrat]]s or even snatch small to mid-sized other [[mammal]]s, including [[squirrel]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and [[armadillo]]s when they attempt to swim or come to the water's edge.&lt;ref name="Pritchard"/&gt;

Alligator snapping turtles seemingly most often hunt at night. They may also hunt diurnally, however. By day, they may try to attract fish and other prey by sitting quietly at the bottom of murky water and let their jaws hang open to reveal their tongues, which look like small, pink, worm-like lures in the back of their gray mouths, and lure the prey into striking distance.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt; Small fish, such as [[minnow]]s, are often caught in this way by younger alligator snapping turtles, whereas adults must eat a greater quantity per day and must forage more actively.&lt;ref name="Pritchard"/&gt;  Though not a regular food source for them, adult alligator snappers have even been known to kill and eat small [[American alligator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100102164404/http://bronxzoo.com/look-and-learn/animal-profiles/alligator-snapping-turtle.aspx Alligator Snapping Turtle]. [[Bronx Zoo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In captivity, they may consume almost any kind of meat provided, including beef, chicken, and pork.&lt;!--, although these are not always healthy on a day to day basis.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}--&gt; They will refuse to eat if exposed to extreme temperatures.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Reproduction and lifespan==
Maturity is reached around 12 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Macrochelys_temminckii.html | title=Animal Diversity Web: Macrochelys temminickii | accessdate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mating takes place yearly, in early spring in the southern part of their total range, and later spring in the north. The female builds a nest and lays a clutch of 10–50 eggs&lt;ref name="Animal" /&gt; about two months later. The sex of the young depends on the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. Nests are typically excavated at least 50 yards from the water's edge to prevent them from being flooded and drowned. Incubation takes from 100 to 140 days, and hatchlings emerge in the early fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nashvillezoo.org/asturtle.htm | title=Nashville Zoo: Alligator Snapping Turtle | accessdate=March 26, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060221084138/http://www.nashvillezoo.org/asturtle.htm |archivedate = February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though their potential lifespans in the wild are unknown, alligator snapping turtles are believed to be capable of living to 200 years of age, but 80 to 120 is more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibbons|first=J.

==Under human care==
[[Image:Alligator Snapping Turtle2.jpg|thumb|Correct handling of a 45-pound alligator snapping turtle at Austin Reptile Service, in [[Austin, Texas]]]]
Alligator snapping turtles are sometimes captive-bred as pets and are readily available in the exotic animal trade. Due to their potential size and specific needs, they do not make particularly good pets for any but the most experienced aquatic turtle keepers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/cs-allisnapper.htm AST Care Sheet]. Austinsturtlepage.com. Retrieved on August 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

They prefer to feed on live fish which they catch with their special technique, but will readily feed on other types of meat or leafy vegetables if offered. Hand feeding is dangerous. Extreme temperatures are known to affect the turtle's appetite and would result in the turtle refusing to feed until it has been remedied.

Due to their sheer size, handling adult specimens can pose significant problems. Small turtles can be held by the sides of the shell with relative safety, but large individuals must be held by grasping the turtle's shell just behind the head and in front of the tail.

Despite their reputation, alligator snapping turtles are typically not prone to biting. However, if provoked they are quite capable of delivering a powerful bite which can easily [[Amputation|amputate]] fingers or cause other significant injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=1227 | title=NAS&amp;nbsp;— Species FactSheet | accessdate=March 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some U.S states where alligator snapping turtles do not naturally occur (such as [[California]]) prohibit them from being kept as pets by residents.

==Invasive species==
Some alligator snapping turtles were released or escaped into waters of the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Germany]]. In [[Bavaria]], one turtle caused injury to a child, but was not caught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-bavarian-village-of-irsee-is-ramping-up-efforts-to-find-alligator-snapping-turtle-lotti-a-916775.html The Bavarian village of Irsee is ramping up efforts to find alligator snapping turtle "Lotti"].

==Conservation status==

Because of collection for the exotic pet trade, overharvesting for their meat, and habitat destruction, some states have imposed bans on collecting alligator snapping turtles from the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Wildlife-Library/Amphibians-Reptiles-and-Fish/Alligator-Snapping-Turtle.aspx |title=Alligator Snapping Turtle – National Wildlife Federation |publisher=Nwf.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN]] lists it as a [[threatened species]], and as of June 14, 2006, it was afforded some international protection by being listed as a [[CITES]] III species (which will put limits on exportation from the United States and all international trade in this species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greennature.com/article2503.html |title=Alligator Snapping Turtle and Map Turtles Gain International Protection |publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service |date=December 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029150009/http://greennature.com/article2503.html |archivedate=October 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alligator snapping turtle is now endangered in several states, including Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri, where they are protected by state law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in.gov/nrc/files/Item_7_NRC_November_2010.pdf Recommendation for preliminary adoption of amendments to the list of endangered reptiles and amphibians in 312 IAC 9-5-4; Administrative Cause No. 10-170D]. in.gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dnr.state.il.us/education/turtle/conserve.htm |title=Conservation |publisher=Illinois Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106112411/http://dnr.state.il.us/education/turtle/conserve.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are designated as "in need of conservation" in Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;Kan. Admin. Reg. § 115-15-2(a)(7).&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, one was found in the [[Prineville Reservoir]] in Oregon.

A '''Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System''', abbreviated '''BNWAS''', is an automatic system which sounds an alarm if the [[Watchstanding|watch officer]] on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] of a ship falls asleep, becomes otherwise incapacitated, or is absent for too long a time. The BNWAS is automatically engaged when the ship's [[Self-steering gear|autopilot]] is activated.&lt;ref name=Standards2&gt;Maritime Safety Committee, [[International Maritime Organization]], [http://www.imo.org/blast/blastDataHelper.asp?data_id=15498&amp;filename=128%2875%29.pdf Resolution MSC.128(75) (Adopted on 20 May 2002): Performance Standards for a Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System], MSC 75/24/Add.1 (pdf) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum requirement for a BNWAS under [[International Maritime Organization]] standards is to have a dormant stage and three alarm stages, except that on a non-passenger vessel, the second stage may be omitted.&lt;ref name=Standards3&gt;Maritime Safety Committee, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage 1:
When the autopilot is engaged, the bridge officer is required to signal his presence to the BNWAS system every 3 to 12&amp;nbsp;minutes in response to a flashing light,&lt;ref&gt;Maritime Safety Committee, pp. 3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; either by moving an arm in front of a motion sensor, pressing a confirmation button, or directly applying pressure to the BNWAS centre.

Stage 2:
When a confirmation signal fails to occur within 15&amp;nbsp;seconds in Stage 1, an alarm will sound on the bridge, and if there is still no confirmation signal after a further 15&amp;nbsp;seconds, in the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]]'s and the [[Chief Mate|first officer]]'s cabins.&lt;ref name=Standards3/&gt; One of them must then go to the bridge and cancel the alarm.

Stage 3:
If neither the captain nor the first officer cancels the alarm within a specified time period (between 90 seconds and 3 minutes depending on the size of the vessel), an alarm will sound in locations where other personnel are usually available.&lt;ref name=Standards3/&gt;

In addition an emergency call function may be provided, by which bridge personnel can activate a Stage 2 or Stage 3 alarm to call for help.&lt;ref&gt;Maritime Safety Committee, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

July 2011: new vessels in excess of 150 [[tonne]]s

July 2011: all passenger vessels

July 2012: all vessels in excess of 3,000 tonnes

July 2013: all vessels between 500 and 3,000 tonnes

July 2014: all vessels between 150 and 500 tonnes

Specific nations have added further regulations. For example, vessels of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coastal fishery are required to activate a speed sensor connected to the vessel's motor or [[GPS]].

[[File:Cataclysmic variable.svg|thumb|A non-magnetic cataclysmic variable. A white dwarf accretes matter from its [[Roche lobe]]-filling companion.]]

'''Cataclysmic variable stars''' ('''CV''') are stars which irregularly increase in brightness by a large factor, then drop back down to a quiescent state. They were initially called [[nova]]e, from the Latin 'new', since ones with an outburst brightness visible to the [[naked eye]] and an invisible quiescent brightness appeared as new stars in the sky.

Cataclysmic variable stars are [[binary star]]s that consist of two components; a [[white dwarf]] primary, and a [[mass transfer]]ring secondary. The stars are so close to each other that the [[gravity]] of the white dwarf distorts the secondary, and the white dwarf accretes matter from the companion. Therefore, the secondary is often referred to as the ''donor star''. The infalling matter, which is usually rich in [[hydrogen]], forms in most cases an [[accretion disc]] around the white dwarf. Strong [[UV]] and [[X-ray]] emission is often seen from the accretion disc, powered by the loss of gravitational potential energy from the infalling material.

Material at the inner edge of disc falls onto the surface of the white dwarf primary. A classical [[nova]] outburst occurs when the [[density]] and [[temperature]] at the bottom of the accumulated hydrogen layer rise high enough to ignite [[thermal runaway|runaway]] [[nuclear fusion|hydrogen fusion]] reactions, which rapidly convert the hydrogen layer to [[helium]]. If the accretion process continues long enough to bring the white dwarf close to the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], the increasing interior density may ignite [[Carbon detonation|runaway carbon fusion]] and trigger a [[Type Ia supernova]] explosion, which would completely destroy the white dwarf.

The accretion disc may be prone to an [[instability]] leading to [[dwarf nova]] outbursts, when the outer portion of the disc changes from a cool, dull mode to a hotter, brighter mode for a time, before reverting to the cool mode. Dwarf novae can recur on a [[Orders of magnitude (time)|timescale]] of days to decades.

== Classification ==
Cataclysmic variables are subdivided into several smaller groups, often named after a bright prototype star characteristic of the class. In some cases the [[magnetic field]] of the white dwarf is strong enough to disrupt the inner accretion disk or even prevent disk formation altogether. Magnetic systems often show strong and variable [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] in their optical light, and are therefore sometimes called [[polar (cataclysmic variable)|polars]]; these often exhibit small-amplitude brightness fluctuations at what is presumed to be the period of rotation of the white dwarf.

{| class="wikitable"

| These are classed as cataclysmic variables and have extremely large outbursts that destroy the progenitor star.  Some result from white dwarfs in binary systems but others are very massive stars.
|-
| (Classical) [[nova]]e
| These cataclysmic variables have very large outbursts, of 6 to 19 magnitudes, caused by thermonuclear fusion of material accreted onto the white dwarf.

There are over 1600 known CV systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/cvcat/index.html|title=A Catalog and Atlas of Cataclysmic Variables|first1=Ronald|last1=Downes|author2=&lt;!-- cited as such at the URL --&gt; |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalog was frozen as of 1 February 2006 though more are discovered each year.

==Discovery==

Cataclysmic variables are among the classes of astronomical objects most commonly found by amateurs, since a cataclysmic variable in its outburst phase is bright enough to be detectable with very modest instruments, and the only celestial objects easily confused with them are bright [[asteroids]] whose movement from night to night is clear.

Verifying that an object is a cataclysmic variable is also fairly straightforward: they are usually quite blue objects, they exhibit rapid and strong variability, and they tend to have peculiar [[emission line]]s. They emit in the [[ultraviolet]] and [[X-ray]] ranges; they are expected also to emit gamma rays, from annihilation of positrons from proton-rich nuclei produced in the fusion explosion, but this has not yet been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=F|last1=Senziani|first2=G.K.|last2=Skinner|first3=P.|last3=Jean|first4=M.|last4=Hernanz|title=Detectability of gamma-ray emission from classical novae with Swift/BAT|date=2008|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:200809863|journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]|volume=485|pages=223|arxiv=0804.4791|bibcode=2008A&amp;A...485..223S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around six novae are discovered each year, whilst models based on observations in other galaxies suggest that the rate of occurrence ought to be between 20 and 50;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=M. J.|last1=Darnley|first2=M. F.|last2=Bode|first3=E.|last3=Kerins|first4=A. M.|last4=Newsam|first5=J.|last5=An|first6=P.|last6=Baillon|first7=V.|last7=Belokurov|first8=S.|last8=Calchi Novati|first9=B.

==Superhumps==
{{main|Superhump}}
Some cataclysmic variables experience periodic brightenings caused by deformations of the [[accretion disk]] when its rotation is in resonance with the orbital period of the binary.

{{Central America series}}

The '''Central American pine-oak forests''' [[ecoregion]], in the [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]] [[biome]], is found in [[Central America]] and [[Chiapas]] state of southern [[Mexico]].

==Setting==
The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of {{convert|111,400|km2|sqmi}},&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] in Mexico's [[Chiapas]] state through the highlands of [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Honduras]] to central [[Nicaragua]].

The pine-oak forests lie between {{convert|600|-|1800|m|ft}} elevation,&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; and are surrounded at lower elevations by [[tropical moist forests]] and [[tropical dry forests]]. Higher elevations above {{convert|1800|m|ft}} are usually covered with [[Central American montane forests]].

==Flora==
The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate [[North America]] including [[oak]]s (''Quercus'' spp.), [[pine]]s (''Pinus'' spp.), [[fir]] ([[Abies guatemalensis|''Abies'' ''guatemalensis'']]), and [[cypress]] (''Cupressus'' spp.).

A '''chase''' is an electrical application where strings of adjacent light bulbs cycle on and off frequently to give the illusion of lights moving along the string.  With computerized [[lighting console]]s, building chase sequences has become easier, while previously chases used mechanical means, such as a wheel with an electrified spindle which strikes electrical contacts for each circuit.

'''Chase lights''' (or '''chaser lights''') are often associated with the [[marquee (sign)|marquee signs]] of some movie theaters, and have also been used as a common element of television [[game show]] sets.

==Creating a chase effect==
In order to achieve a chase "strip lights" are most often used, especially when used in "theatrical" applications.

Similar design is used in computing, where it is known as "[[marching ants]]".

Several separate circuits of lights (called channels) are needed to create a chase effect which is a simulation of motion achieved by turning these circuits ON and OFF in sequence. 
The standard is 3 or 4 channels. 
For 4 channels the lights are wired with one common and 4 different feeds. 
Light #1 is wired with lights #5 &amp; 9 &amp; 13, etc. (+4); 
Light #2 is wired with lights #6 &amp; 10 &amp; 14, etc. (+4);
Light #3 is wired with lights #7 &amp; 11 &amp; 15, etc. (+4);
Light #4 is wired with lights #8 &amp; 12 &amp; 16, etc. (+4).

[[File:Chase_lighting_SMIL.svg|thumb|none|300px|Marquees with 12 lights grouped into 2, 3 and 4 channels [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Chase_lighting_SMIL.svg (click for SMIL animation)] ]]
[[File:Colortran Cyc Light.jpg|thumb|upright|Floodlights with a chase effect, traditionally known as cyclorama lights]]

The most common 4 channel chase which is seen in a theater Marquee perimeter lighting and other lighting animation applications consists of 4 channel wired light bulbs and an electronic chaser.
The electronic chaser turns channel #1 ON while all the other Channels remain OFF. Then after an adjustable period of time it turns OFF channel #1 while turning ON channel #2, then turn OFF channel #2 while turning ON channel #3, then turn OFF channel #3 while turning ON channel #4, then repeat.
This creates the illusion that the lights are moving in one direction.
Some digital lighting chasers are made to do the above described single light chase pattern along with other combinations of Turning ON and OFF of the light to create different sequences like forward light chase, backward light chase, bouncing, dark chase (1 channel OFF while all 3 others ON), etc...
Also, more than 4 channel chasers are used to create more effects and to animate illuminated objects.

Chase circuits using [[LED]]s are commonly built by electronics hobbyists with timer (such as the [[555 timer IC]]) and counter (such as the [[4017]], which allows up to 10 channels) [[integrated circuits]].&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Marston, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Otpnj6ZHrYC&amp;q=led+chaser Optoelectronics Circuits Manual]'', p.35, CRC Press LLC, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/led-chaser-circuit LED Chaser Circuit Diagram using IC 555 and CD 4017], Circuit Digest&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cherry Springs State Park''' is an {{convert|82|acre|adj=on}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Potter County, Pennsylvania|Potter County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. The park was created from land within the [[Susquehannock State Forest]], and is on [[Pennsylvania Route 44]] in [[West Branch Township, Potter County, Pennsylvania|West Branch Township]]. Cherry Springs, named for a large stand of [[Prunus serotina|Black Cherry]] trees in the park, is atop the [[dissected plateau|dissected]] [[Allegheny Plateau]] at an elevation of {{convert|2300|ft|0}}. It is popular with astronomers and stargazers for having "some of the darkest night skies on the east coast" of the United States, and was chosen by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of "25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks".&lt;ref name =mustsee&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/index.htm | title = Find a Park: 25 Must-see Parks | accessdate = May 26, 2015 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded inhabitants of the area were the [[Susquehannock]]s, followed by the [[Seneca nation]], who hunted there. The first settlement within the park was a log [[tavern]] built in 1818&amp;nbsp;along a trail; the trail became a [[toll road|turnpike]] by 1834&amp;nbsp;and a hotel replaced the tavern in 1874, then burned in 1897. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the [[old-growth forest]]s were [[Clearcutting|clearcut]]; the state forest was established in 1901&amp;nbsp;and contains [[secondary forest|second growth woodlands]]. "Cherry Springs Scenic Drive" was established in 1922, and the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] built much of Cherry Springs State Park during the [[Great Depression]], including a picnic pavilion listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP). An annual "Woodsmen's Show" has been held in the park each August since 1952.

Cherry Springs State Park was named Pennsylvania's first [[Dark-sky preserve|dark sky park]] by the DCNR in 2000. The adjoining [[Cherry Springs Airport]], built in 1935, was closed and its land was added to the park in 2006, to expand its stargazing area. On June&amp;nbsp;11, 2007,&amp;nbsp;the [[International Dark-Sky Association]] named it the second "International Dark Sky Park"; under optimum conditions the [[Milky Way]] casts a discernible shadow. Cherry Springs has received national press coverage and hosts two [[star party|star parties]] a year, which attract hundreds of astronomers. There are regular stargazing and educational programs for the public at the park, and the Woodsmen's Show attracts thousands each summer. Cherry Springs also offers rustic camping, [[picnic]] facilities, and trails for [[mountain biking]], [[hiking]], and [[Snowmobile|snowmobiling]]. The surrounding state forest and park are home to a variety of flora and fauna.

After the departure of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who lived in long houses, primarily in what is now [[upstate New York]], and had a strong [[confederation|confederacy]] which gave them power beyond their numbers.&lt;ref name = "indians"/&gt; The [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], members of the Iroquois Confederacy, hunted in the area of what is now Cherry Springs State Park.

The Seneca allowed very few travelers to pass through the area and kept non-native settlement to a minimum.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763) led to the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin, and more departed after the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783).&lt;ref name = "indians"/&gt; The United States acquired the Last Purchase, including what is now Cherry Springs State Park, from the Iroquois in the second [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)|Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] in October 1784.&lt;ref name="path"/&gt; In the years that followed, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="indians"/&gt;

[[File:Tavern at Cherry Springs State Park.JPG|thumb|The [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] built this replica of the Cherry Springs Hotel, the tavern built by Jonathan Edgcomb in 1818.]]
The area surrounding Cherry Springs State Park has been a wilderness for much of its history. A [[bridle path]] was cut through the woods in 1806–1807, and was widened to accommodate wagons in 1812.&amp;nbsp;(Modern [[Pennsylvania Route 44]], which passes through the park, follows the course of this path between [[Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania|Jersey Shore]] and [[Coudersport, Pennsylvania|Coudersport]].) In 1818&amp;nbsp;the Ceres Land Company, which owned much of the land in Potter County and sought to open the area to settlement, hired an early settler, Jonathan Edgcomb, to build a [[tavern]] or hotel for travelers at the site of the park. The hotel was in a very remote location {{convert|16|mi}} south of Coudersport, and its visitors were few, occasional wandering travelers or Native Americans.&lt;ref name="cssp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Morey|first= Tim|author2=Harrison, Maxine| year= 2002|title= Cherry Springs State Park: Hidden Resource in the Dark (part of the "Emerald Gems" series)|journal= Pennsylvania Recreation &amp; Parks|volume= 33|issue=  2|publisher= Pennsylvania Recreation and Park Society| location= [[State College, Pennsylvania]]|issn= 0742-793X|url= http://www.kwastronomy.com/History_of_Cherry_Springs_Park.htm|accessdate= October 14, 2008}} ''Note'': URL is to an authorized reprint of the article as "History of Cherry Springs State Park" on Kevin Wigell's Astronomy Page&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgcomb and his wife received {{convert|100|acre}} of land in exchange for building the hotel and running it for three years. When the contract expired in 1821, they sold their land and left the area, but the hotel and land that Edgcomb had cleared became known as "Edgcomb's Clearing". The Jersey Shore and Coudersport [[Toll road|Turnpike]] was constructed along the wagon path between 1825&amp;nbsp;and 1834, and tolls were collected for travel on the road until 1860.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The park is in [[West Branch Township, Pennsylvania|West Branch Township]], which was incorporated from [[Eulalia Township, Pennsylvania|Eulalia Township]] in 1856.&lt;ref name = "potter"/&gt; A post office was opened at Edgcomb's Clearing in 1873; the locals petitioned the [[United States Post Office]] to change the name to "Cherryville", for a nearby group of [[Prunus serotina|Black Cherry]] trees. However, since there was already a Cherryville, Pennsylvania, post office in [[Lehigh Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh Township]] in [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]], the name "Cherry Spring" was chosen as a compromise. In time an "s" was added, hence the name "Cherry Springs".&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; There are also at least two [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] in the park.&lt;ref name = "park map"/&gt;

In 1874&amp;nbsp;a new, larger hotel was built on the other side of the road from the original tavern.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; It provided accommodations for wealthy summer visitors from Coudersport. This part of Potter County became known for an abundance of [[game (food)|game]] and fish, and attracted hunters and anglers who also stayed at the Cherry Springs Hotel. This era as a "sportsmen's paradise" was not to last, as the more profitable lumber industry came to West Branch and surrounding townships, which were home to "some of the tallest, straightest timber left standing" along the [[East Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

When lumbermen reached the Cherry Springs area in the late 1880s, eastern white pine and eastern hemlock covered the surrounding mountains. [[Lumberjack]]s harvested the trees and sent them down the creeks to the West Branch Susquehanna River to the [[Susquehanna Boom]] and [[sawmill]]s at [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]. [[Clearcutting]] allowed silt to choke the streams, and nothing was left except the dried-out tree tops, which became a fire hazard. As a result, large swaths of land burned and were left barren,&lt;ref name="cssp"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt; and much of the central part of the state became known as the "Pennsylvania Desert".&lt;ref name="seasons doaf"&gt;{{cite book| last = Owlett| first = Steven E.| title = Seasons Along The Tiadaghton: An Environmental History of the Pine Creek Gorge| year = 1993| chapter = The Death of a Forest| pages = 53–62| edition = 1st| publisher = Interprint| location = Petaluma, California| isbn = 0-9635905-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherry Springs Hotel itself burned in 1897&amp;nbsp;and the property was abandoned.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Like many state parks in north central Pennsylvania, development of the facilities at Cherry Springs was the work of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), a work relief program for young men from unemployed families. Established in 1933&amp;nbsp;as part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D.

In addition to the two CCC camps active at the park, Cherry Springs also was home to Camp Elliott, which was run by the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters (precursor to the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources|Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] (DCNR)) for college students and other unemployed men. In 1935&amp;nbsp;they built an [[Aerodrome|airfield]], [[Cherry Springs Airport|Cherry Springs Intermediate Field]], just north of the park. The {{convert|40|acre|adj=on}} airfield was originally built for emergency landings and later became a small airport.&lt;ref name = "cssp"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt; In 1936&amp;nbsp;it had a [[sod]] [[runway]] of dimensions {{convert|2400|by|500|ft}}, and a hangar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Civil Aeronautics Bulletin| publisher = United States [[Civil Aeronautics Authority|Civil Aeronautics Administration]]| date = 1936| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_OO3AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Cherry+Spring+Airport&amp;q=%22Cherry+Springs%22| page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' entry into the [[World War II|Second World War]] led to the end of the CCC and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942.&lt;ref name="npsccc"/&gt;

In the post-war era, the park was long known chiefly for its isolated location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952&amp;nbsp;it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the [[Secondary forest|second growth forests]] in the area.

Cherry Springs State Park and the surrounding Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era.

===Dark skies===
[[File:M20-Combine1B.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Trifid Nebula]] (M20) in Sagittarius, as seen from the park ]]Astronomers and stargazers appreciate Cherry Springs State Park for the darkness and clarity of its skies, which make it "perhaps the last best refuge of the natural night sky" in the eastern half of the United States.&lt;ref name = "darksky"/&gt; The sky at Cherry Springs has been classified as a 2&amp;nbsp;on the [[Bortle Dark-Sky Scale]], meaning it has almost no [[light pollution]].&lt;ref name = "bortle"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/info/wind/documents/cherry-springs-state-park-light-pollution-analysis-05-29-08.pdf| title = Cherry Springs State Park: Light Pollution Analysis and Recommendations| publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources| date = May 27, 2008| author = Clanton &amp; Associates| accessdate = March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such "truly dark, starry skies are unavailable to two-thirds of the world's population, including 99&amp;nbsp;percent of people in the continental U.S. and Western Europe".&lt;ref name = "fermata"/&gt; With optimum conditions, 10,000&amp;nbsp;stars are visible with the [[naked eye]] at the park, clouds appear only as black holes in the starry sky, and the [[Milky Way]] is so bright that it casts a discernible shadow.&lt;ref name = "bortle"/&gt; In contrast, big city residents can see a few dozen stars at best, and even those in rural areas can typically only see 2,000–3,000&amp;nbsp;stars. The Milky Way cannot be seen by most in the eastern US, even when there is no moonlight to obscure it.&lt;ref name = "fermata"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt;

The quality of the night skies at the park and its growing popularity for stargazing are the result of several factors. Cherry Springs is in the midst of the largely undeveloped {{convert|262000|acre|adj=on}} Susquehannock State Forest, and is on a summit {{convert|2300|ft|0}} above sea level. Because it is on the Allegheny Plateau, there are no mountain peaks to block the sky, and the Astronomy Field offers a 360&amp;nbsp;degree unobstructed view. The closest city is Williamsport, {{convert|60|mi}} to the southeast. Surrounding communities sit in deep valleys, so the intervening terrain screens much of the light they produce; the park has no artificial [[skyglow]] in any direction. Cherry Springs is generally fog-free and its latitude puts it in excellent position to observe the [[Galactic Center]] of the Milky Way. The remote location also means there is little commercial air traffic to interfere with [[astrophotography]], while PA Route 44 still offers relatively easy access to the park from [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]].&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "dark skies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

In addition to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on [[night vision]] and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen [[berm]]s covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid for many of these improvements since 1999.&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "dark skies"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "awesome"&gt;{{cite news| title = 'Awesome': Stargazers revel in Cherry Springs’ dark skies| last = Lamey| first = Jessica| date = June 29, 2008| pages = E1, E3| work = [[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]]| url = http://www.sungazette.com/page/content.detail/id/512360.html?nav=5013| accessdate = March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2006&amp;nbsp;acquisition of the Cherry Springs airport, a new Public Programming field has been established on the former airstrip. This field is northeast of PA Route 44 and is intended for educational programs or stargazing, but not for those who spend the night. Overnight observers and those with large telescopes use the Astronomy Field southwest of the highway. Nighttime visitors may only use flashlights with red filters, and may only point them at the ground. The Astronomy Field has further restrictions on lights, and parts of the park are light-free zones.&lt;ref name = "dark skies"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "awesome"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "sky and telescope"/&gt;

To help preserve the dark skies at Cherry Springs State Park, Tri-County Rural Electric company installs light-shielding caps on outdoor lights at local homes for free.&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt; In 2001&amp;nbsp;the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed the "Outdoor Lighting Control Act", which both established the park as a "Dark Sky Preserve" and required minimal and shielded lighting at all new state facilities to reduce light pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2001&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=0300&amp;pn=2860| title = An Act Providing for management of outdoor night lighting (House Bill No. 300, Session of 2001)| publisher = The General Assembly of Pennsylvania| date = November 13, 2001| accessdate = March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A design guide for the Pennsylvania Wilds region, which includes the park, emphasizes the importance of maintaining dark skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.clintoncountypa.com/PA%20Wilds/PA%20Wilds%20Guide/PA%20Wilds%20Design%20Guide2.pdf| title = Pennsylvania Wilds Design Guide" A Design Guide for Community Character Stewardship| author = The Pennsylvania Wilds Planning Team| publisher = [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania]]| date = February 13, 2009| accessdate = March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DCNR spent $396,000 in June 2007 to buy [[mineral rights]] under {{convert|1980|acre}} of the park and state forest to prevent [[natural gas]] drilling and associated development there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09123/967360-113.stm| title = Goddard State Park's gas wells may be first of hundreds: Where mineral rights are privately owned, Pennsylvania officials can't prevent drilling| date = May 3, 2009| first = Don| last = Hopey| work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| accessdate = May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[wind farm]] has been proposed on a site {{convert|13.7|mi}} from the park. In 2008&amp;nbsp;Potter County passed an ordinance that [[wind turbine]] lights shall not "interfere with the state-designated Dark Skies Preserve at Cherry Springs State Park".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pottercountypa.net/planning/saldo/Article12.doc| title = Potter County Wind Energy Ordinance| date = 2008| publisher = [[Potter County, Pennsylvania]]| accessdate = March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the DCNR commissioned a study on the wind farm's impact, which concluded the red warning lights on the wind turbines would not impact the darkness of the sky and would only be directly visible from the Astronomy Field under rare conditions.&lt;ref name="bortle"/&gt; Others in the astronomy community challenged these conclusions and feared that new lights on "several dozen wind turbines near the park" will degrade observations and astrophotography.&lt;ref name="sky and telescope"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/21914474.html| title = Cherry Springs Earns Dark-Sky Status| author = Beatty, Kelly| work = [[Sky and Telescope]]| date = June 27, 2008| accessdate = March 27, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130202185608/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/21914474.html| archivedate = February 2, 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also recommended that the DCNR shield and redirect lights at the nearby [[Denton Hill State Park]] downhill ski area to make the sky even darker at Cherry Springs.&lt;ref name = "bortle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = State: Proposed wind farm would not affect dark skies at Cherry Springs State Park| date = June 29, 2008| page = E3| work = [[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]]| url =http://www.sungazette.com/page/content.detail/id/512363.html| accessdate = March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomical observing===
[[File:Cherry Springs telescopes.jpg|thumb|Telescopes belonging to amateur astronomers await nightfall.]]
The staff at Cherry Springs State Park did not intend for it to become an attraction for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997&amp;nbsp;or 1998&amp;nbsp;Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a telescope at the park at about 1&amp;nbsp;AM.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/travel/escapes/14dark.html| title = Dark Sky, Bright Lights Over Pennsylvania| first = Dave| last = Caldwell| date = September 14, 2007| accessdate = February 1, 2009| work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "pittsburgh"&gt;{{cite news| title = Pennsylvania peak is heaven for stargazers| last = Nephin| first = Dan| date = September 15, 2006| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06258/721452-37.stm| agency= [[Associated Press]] |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate = March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Harrison asked why the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, one of the best locations east of the [[Mississippi River]] for [[Amateur astronomy|stargazing]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

An increasing number of astronomers began to come to Cherry Springs, most in the 14-day dark sky period around the [[new moon]], between the last quarter and first quarter phases. The park is open year-round and between 60&amp;nbsp;and 85&amp;nbsp;nights each year have ideal conditions,&lt;ref name = "nytimes"/&gt; when the [[apparent magnitude]]s of the faintest stars visible can range from 7.1&amp;nbsp;to 7.5.&lt;ref name = "bortle"/&gt; The park's Astronomy Field has been upgraded to accommodate these astronomers. In 2005&amp;nbsp;a rotating {{convert|15|ft|adj=on}} slotted observatory dome, two {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} clamshell domes, and a {{convert|10|by|12|ft|adj=on}} sky shed were added, as well as a small amphitheater for programs. The four structures protect telescopes from the wind and thermal currents. The next year concrete pads {{convert|4|and|6|ft|}} in diameter were placed at random in the field, and electrical pedestals, each with six outlets, were added to power telescopes and computers.&lt;ref name = "dark skies"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "progress"/&gt; In 2009, [[Wi-Fi]] internet access was added to the Astronomy Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.astrohbg.org/CSSP/Information.html| title = 2009 Cherry Springs Star Party| publisher = The Astronomical Society of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania| accessdate = May 6, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090318095738/http://astrohbg.org/CSSP/Information.html| archivedate = March 18, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodsmen's Show===
[[File:Phot cherryshow2.jpg|thumb|A chainsaw event at the Woodsmen's Show]]
The Woodsmen's Show attracts thousands of visitors to Cherry Springs State Park on the first weekend in August.

[[File:Model "S" Convection Heater - 1924.png|thumb|Illustration of the Model "S" Convection Heater by Sala Heater &amp; Mantel, 1924]]

A '''convection heater''' is a [[heater]] which operates by air [[convection]] currents circulating through the body of the appliance, and across its [[heating element]]. This heats up the air, causing it to increase in volume and so become buoyant and rise. [[Oil heater]]s are an example of this kind of heating appliance. A convection heater may have an electrical heater element, a hot water coil, or a steam coil. Because of the natural ventilation, they are quieter in operation than [[fan heater]]s.

The Model “S”, here as illustrated in 1924, is an example of an early model convection space heater, by the Sala Heater &amp; Mantel Co. in  Dallas, Texas. 
The Model "S" was considered to be highly efficient radiant type of gas heater at the time. The heater utilizes radiant heat, and, by virtue of draft construction, supplements its power by drawing cold air through the facing, heating it and forcing it into the room through the register. This not only forces the circulation that provides an even warmth in every section of the room, but enables the heater to operate at all times with a perfectly cool exterior. Positive circulation provides an even warmth throughout the room, and guarantees a clean, humid, healthful{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} air to occupants. 

The mixing chamber, due to its exclusive construction, utilizes centrifugal force to insure a perfect mixture between the gas and air, which in turn provides complete combustion, thus preventing dangerous fumes. After the gas leaves the mixing chamber it passes into a distribution chamber whose shape is such that an equal amount of gas passes into each jet, giving uniform flame height and also intensity.&lt;ref name='Model "S" Convection Heater'&gt;{{cite web|last=Sala|first=Theodore|title=The Sala Model S|url=http://www.salaair.com/salahistory.htm|work=Sala Heater Catalog 1924|publisher=Sala Heater and Mantel Co.|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the rising warm air from convector heaters, warm air may accumulate at the ceiling of the room. Therefore, convector heaters are often paired with ceiling fans, especially in rooms with tall ceilings. In the winter, setting a fan to turn clockwise will allow for more air circulation and will keep heat from rising completely, making the room feel warmer and allowing one to turn down the thermostat.

==History==

The National Meteorological Institute was established in 1919 shortly after the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Republic]] was established at the end of [[World War I]]. On January 1, 1954, the National Meteorological Institute was united with the hydrology service and the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute was established. Its charter was amended in 1994 and in 1995 by the Ministry of the Environment of the Czech Republic.

==Air pollution dispersion modelling activities==

The Air Quality Protection division has seven departments:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chmi.cz/uoco/struct/structe.html Structure of CHMI's Air Quality Control Division] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002204554/http://www.chmi.cz/uoco/struct/structe.html |date=2006-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Air pollution|Emission]] and Sources
*[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|Modelling]] and Expertise Pool
*National Inventorization System
*Air Quality Monitoring
*Central Air Quality Laboratory

The work of the Modelling and Expertise Pool department is focused upon: the development of [[Air pollution dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion models]]; the application of such models in the preparation of expert reports and opinions; forecasts of air quality control; the processing of operating information on pollutant concentrations obtained by the Airborne Monitoring section. 

The SYMOS97 air pollution dispersion model was developed at the CHMI. It models the dispersion of [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|continuous, neutral or buoyant plumes]] from single or multiple [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|point, area or line sources]]. It can handle complex terrain and it can also be used to simulate the dispersion of [[cooling tower]] plumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.meng.auth.gr/mds/strquery.php?wholedb The Model Documententation System (MDS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102135620/http://pandora.meng.auth.gr/mds/strquery.php?wholedb |date=2007-11-02 }} of the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (part of the European Environment Agency)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DEEP2 Survey''' or '''DEEP2''' was a two-phased [[Redshift survey]] of the [[Redshift]] z=~1 universe (where z= a measure of speed and by extension, the distance from earth).  It used the twin 10 metre [[Keck telescopes]] in Hawaii (the world's second largest optical telescope) to measure the spectra and hence the redshifts of approximately 50,000 galaxies. It was the first project to study galaxies in the distant Universe with the resolution of local surveys like the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and was completed in 2013.

'''Deep Creek Lake State Park''' is a state-operated, public recreation area surrounding [[Deep Creek Lake]] in [[Garrett County, Maryland]], in the United States. The park features water activities, camping facilities, and recreational trails and is located about {{convert|18|mi}} south of [[Interstate 68]] on [[U.S. Route 219]].&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt;

==History==
Although settlers arrived in the area in the 1700s, it was the massive logging operations of the 20th century that stripped the land of its virgin forest.&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt; The park's forest of oaks and hickories was regenerated from the original timber stand.&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt;

The Deep Creek Lake [[reservoir]] was created on a tributary of the [[Youghiogheny River]] with completion of the [[Deep Creek Dam]] by the [[Pennsylvania Electric Company]] in 1925. The state took charge of recreation on the lake in 1980, then purchased the land underlying the lake and buffer zone properties for $17 million in 2000.&lt;ref name=plan/&gt;

In September 2010, the Appalachian Regional Commission $20,000 in funding for a study of potential development at Deep Creek Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardin, Mikulski Announce Grant for Study of Economic Impact of Deep Creek Lake|url=https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-mikulski-announce-grant-for-study-of-economic-impact-of-deep-creek-lake|publisher=Senator Ben Cardin|accessdate=October 9, 2017|language=en|date=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official tourism website promoting Deep Creek Lake was launched soon after by the Garrett County Chamber of Commerce.

==Activities and amenities==
Lake activities include motor boating, water skiing, swimming, fishing, and canoeing. A campground has 112 campsites, 26 with electricity. Trails are used for hiking and mountain biking.&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt; The park's {{convert|6000|sqft|adj=on}} Discovery Center offers exhibits on local plants and wildlife, including the [[American black bears]] occasionally seen in the campground, the lake and its watershed, conservation issues, and local coal and logging activities in addition to the daily educational programs about nature and the environment presented by naturalists, rangers, and volunteers.&lt;ref name=discovery/&gt;

===Johnny's Bait House===
Johnny's Bait House was a business and facility that operated on the shore of Deep Creek Lake from 1955 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mountaindiscoveries.com/stories/pdf/fw2003/lakereflections.pdf|title=Lake Reflections|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=Mountain Discoveries Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-01-23/features/0301230400_1_marple-bait-house-bait-shop|title=Gone Fishin'|newspaper=tribunedigital-baltimoresun|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was owned and operated by Johnny Marple and his wife Elaine.  Johnny promoted and supported the fishing industry at Deep Creek Lake.  In the early years, Johnny's was open year-round, supporting all fishing, including [[ice fishing]], but eventually started closing during the winter months.  Johnny's provided the Deep Creek Lake Fishing Report to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and many publications such as ''The Washington Post'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1993/06/27/the-creek-runs-deep-in-western-maryland/bf5ebad8-0d33-4142-96c0-d65b2c320b42/|title=THE CREEK RUNS DEEP IN WESTERN MARYLAND|last=Phillips|first=Angus|date=June 27, 1993|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baltimore Sun,  [[Field and Stream Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0YHCfcqpHawC&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=johnny's%20bait%20house%20deep%20creek%20lake%20about&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q=johnny's%20bait%20house%20deep%20creek%20lake%20about&amp;f=false|title=Field &amp; Stream|date=January 1, 1981|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EXjB35Lp2_cC&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=johnny's%20bait%20house%20deep%20creek%20lake%20about&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=johnny's%20bait%20house%20deep%20creek%20lake%20about&amp;f=false|title=Field &amp; Stream|date=January 1, 1997|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-7sVsG7u91QC&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=johnny's%20bait%20house%20deep%20creek%20lake%20about&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=johnny's%20bait%20house%20deep%20creek%20lake%20about&amp;f=false|title=Field &amp; Stream|date=October 18, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Star Democrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/93406743/|title=The Star-Democrat from Easton, Maryland &amp;middot; Page 22|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnnys partnered with the Garrett County Promotion Council and founded the Garrett County Fishing Contest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/27775198/|title=The Evening Standard from Uniontown, Pennsylvania &amp;middot; Page 3|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a weekly event that continues to this day.  The establishment also managed the official Deep Creek Lake Fishing records through 2003. During that time, multiple Maryland state freshwater fishing record catches were registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwideawake.com/JOHNNYS/records.html|title=Maryland and Garrett County Fishing Records - Johnny's Bait House|website=www.worldwideawake.com|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnny assisted the State of Maryland Department of Natural Resources in the monitoring of fish population and the registration of fish tagged for population studies. Many of the collection of mounted fish from that time period are still on display in the Discovery Center of the Deep Creek Lake State Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverycenterdcl.com/|title=Deep Creek Lake Discovery Center - Home|website=www.discoverycenterdcl.com|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former location of Johnny's is currently occupied by Bill's Outdoor Center.

[[File:LightLTSEM.jpg|thumb|Depth hoar crystals, imaged with light and with scanning electron microscopy]]
'''Depth hoar''' (also called '''sugar snow''') are large [[crystal]]s occurring at the base of a [[snow]]pack that form when uprising water [[vapor]] [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposits]] or desublimates onto existing snow crystals. Depth hoar crystals are large, sparkly grains with [[facet]]s that can be cup-shaped and that are up to 10 mm in diameter. Depth hoar crystals bond poorly to each other, increasing the risk for [[avalanches]].

The formation of depth hoar in [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctic]] [[firn]] can cause isotopic changes in the accumulating ice. This can influence analysis of ice cores in scientific research.

The '''Desventuradas Islands''' ({{lang-es|Islas Desventuradas}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://palaeoworks.anu.edu.au/pubs/Andersonetal02.pdf An Archaeological Exploration of Robinson Crusoe Island]&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-es|ˈizlaz ðezβentuˈɾaðas|IPA}}, "Unfortunate Islands" or ''Islas de los Desventurados'', "Islands of the Unfortunate Ones"&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11441335 ADM - Records of the Admiralty, Naval Forces, Royal Marines, Coastguard, and related bodies; ''Pacific Ocean: South America, W Coast: Chile: Islas de los Desventurados and Islas Juan Fernandez;'']&lt;/ref&gt;) is a group of four small [[island]]s located {{convert|850|km|mi}} off the coast of [[Chile]], northwest of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0403|name=San Félix-San Ambrosio Islands temperate forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered part of [[Insular Chile]].

Because of their isolation and difficulty of access, there are no human settlements on these islands, but a detachment of the [[Chilean Navy]] is stationed on ''Isla San Félix,'' which also hosts the {{convert|2000|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Isla San Felix Airport]] (ICAO code for the airfield: SCFX).

==History==
The islands were first sighted by [[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernández]] on 6 November 1574 while voyaging from [[Callao]] to [[Valparaíso]], and perhaps earlier by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1520.  [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]] wrote in 1579 that "they are now called after St. Felix and St. Ambor (i.e. [[Nabor and Felix|Felix and Nabor]])".  However, the name of the [[martyr]] Ambor (Nabor) became confused with that of the more famous bishop [[Saint Ambrose]] (San Ambrosio).&lt;ref&gt;B. Glanvill Corney, "The Isles of [[Isla San Félix|San Felix]] and San Nabor," ''The [[Geographical]] Journal'', Vol. 56, No. 3 (September 1920), pp. 196–200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brand, Donald D. ''The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations'' The American Geographical Society, New York, 1967, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is, probably, one of these islands that Captain John Davis struck one night in 1686. He was able to continue his voyage but erroneously reported the position of the incident.&lt;ref name="Labillardière1800"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Julien Houtou de Labillardière|title=Relation du voyage à la recherche de La Pérouse ... 1791, 1792, et pendant la Ière et la 2de année de la République françoise. 2 tom. &amp;#91;and&amp;#93; Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-icAAAAAQAAJ|year=1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Felix played a part in the [[Falklands War]]. In May 1982, the Chilean government allowed RAF [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod MR2s]] to fly maritime reconnaissance sorties from the island, gathering information on the movements of the Argentine Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spyflight.co.uk/chile.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430000000/http://www.spyflight.co.uk/chile.htm |archivedate=2012-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Harriet|title='Without Chile's help, we would have lost the Falklands'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/10947350/Without-Chiles-help-we-would-have-lost-the-Falklands.html|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The [[vegetation]] of the larger islands is a miniature mosaic of [[matorral]], barren rock, various size trees, and shrubs mixed with ferns and perennial herbs. ''[[Thamnoseris lacerata]]'' is an endemic shrub species.

There are no permanent sources of fresh water on any of the islands. Vertebrates inhabiting both of the largest islands are limited to birds. Ten [[species]] of [[marine bird]]s and one land bird species, some of them endangered, make their nests on or visit the islands.

[[File:StateLibQld 1 149327 Discovery (ship).jpg|thumb|400px|The former Antarctic exploration ship [[RRS Discovery|RSS ''Discovery'']] was employed for the Discovery Investigations cruises between 1923 and 1931.]]The '''Discovery Investigations''' were a series of scientific cruises and shore-based investigations into the biology of whales in the [[Southern Ocean]]. They were funded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colonial Office]] and organised by the [[Discovery Committee]] in London, which was formed in 1918. They were intended to provide the scientific background to stock management of the commercial Antarctic whale fishery.
The work of the Investigations contributed hugely to our knowledge of the whales, the krill they fed on, and the oceanography of their habitat, while charting the local topography, including [[Atherton Peak]]. The investigations continued until 1951, with the final report being published in 1980.

==Laboratory ==
Shore-based work on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] took place in the marine laboratory, [[Discovery House]], built in 1925 at [[King Edward Point]] and occupied until 1931. The scientists lived and worked in the building, travelling half a mile or so across [[King Edward Cove]] to the whaling station at [[Grytviken]] to work on whales as they were brought ashore by commercial whaling ships.

==Ships ==
Vessels used were:
*[[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']] from 1924 to 1931
*[[RRS William Scoresby|RRS ''William Scoresby'']] from 1927 to 1945 or later&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |last=Mills |first=William James |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=1576074226 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[RRS Discovery II|RRS ''Discovery II'']] from 1929 to 1951&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt;

==Reports ==
Results of the investigations were printed in the Discovery Reports. This was a series of many small reports, published in 38 volumes by the [[Cambridge University Press]], and latterly the [[Institute of Oceanographic Sciences]]. Many were printed as individual reports rather than in large volumes.

'''Discovery Seamounts''' are a chain of seamounts in the [[Southern Atlantic Ocean]], which include the Discovery Seamount. The seamounts lie {{convert|850|km}} east of [[Gough Island]] and once rose above sea level. Various volcanic rocks as well as glacial [[Dropstone|dropstones]] and sediments have been dredged from the seamounts.

The Discovery Seamounts appear to be a volcanic seamount chain controlled by the '''Discovery hotspot''', which had its starting point either in the ocean, [[Cretaceous]] [[kimberlite]] fields in southern Namibia or the [[Karoo-Ferrar]] [[large igneous province]]. The seamounts formed between 41 and 35 million years ago; presently the hotspot is thought to lie southwest of the seamounts, where there are geological anomalies in the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] that may reflect the presence of a neighbouring hotspot.

== Name and discovery ==

Discovery Seamount was discovered in 1936 by the research ship ''[[RRS Discovery II]]''{{sfn|Kempe|Schilling|1974|p=101}} and was originally named Discovery Bank{{sfn|Buckley|1976|p=937}} by the crew of a German research ship, RV ''Schwabenland''. The seamount received another name, Discovery Tablemount, in 1963. In 1993 the name "Discovery Bank" was transferred by the [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans]] to another seamount at [[Kerguelen]], leaving the name "Discovery Seamounts" for the seamounts.&lt;ref name="SummerhayesLüdecke2012" /&gt;

== Geography and geomorphology ==

The Discovery Seamounts are a group of [[seamount]]s{{sfn|Jokat|Reents|2017|p=77}} {{convert|850|km}} east of [[Gough Island]]{{sfn|Kempe|Schilling|1974|p=101}} and southwest from [[Cape Town]]{{sfn|Werner|Hauff|2011|p=6}} which extend over an east-west region of over {{convert|611|km}} length.{{sfn|Buckley|1976|p=937}} The seamounts rise over {{convert|4|km}}{{sfn|Werner|Hauff|2011|p=4}} to depths of {{convert|400|-|500|m}} and have the shape of [[guyot]]s;{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=169}} this implies that they formerly rose above sea level,{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=170}} guyots form when islands are eroded to a flat plateau that is then submerged through [[thermal subsidence]] of the [[lithosphere]].{{sfn|Werner|Hauff|2011|p=20}} The shallowest peak reached by a seamount from the group is a depth of {{convert|426|m}},&lt;ref name="Richardson2007" /&gt; although a depth of {{convert|389|m}} has been reported for Discovery Seamount also.&lt;ref name="Pushcharovskii2004" /&gt; These seamounts are also referred to as the Discovery Rise and subdivided into a northwestern and a southeastern trend.{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=168}} 

The largest of these seamounts is named Discovery Seamount,{{sfn|Jokat|Reents|2017|p=78}} which given its shape might once have been an island.{{sfn|Kempe|Schilling|1974|p=102}} The seamount is covered with [[fossil]]-containing sediments,{{sfn|Buckley|1976|p=937}} which have been used to infer [[paleoclimate]] conditions in the region during the [[Pleistocene]].{{sfn|Buckley|1976|pp=943-944}} Some of the sediment appears to be [[ice-rafted debris]],{{sfn|Buckley|1976|p=945}} and other evidence has been used to postulate that the seamount subsided by about {{convert|0.5|km}} during the late [[Pleistocene]].{{sfn|Buckley|1976|p=947}} Another member of the Discovery Seamounts has been christened Shannon Seamount.{{sfn|le Roex|Class|O'Connor|Jokat|2010|p=2091}}

The [[crust (geology)|crust]] underneath Discovery Seamount is about 67 million years old, thus of late [[Cretaceous]] age.{{sfn|Kempe|Schilling|1974|p=102}} A [[fracture zone]], thus a site of [[crust (geology)|crust]]al weakness, is located nearby.{{sfn|Jokat|Reents|2017|p=84}} 

== Geology ==

The [[Southern Atlantic Ocean]] contains a number of volcanic systems such as the Discovery Seamounts, the [[Rio Grande Rise]], the [[Shona Ridge]] and the [[Walvis Ridge]] which are commonly attributed to [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]s,{{sfn|Jokat|Reents|2017|p=77}} although this interpretation has been challenged.{{sfn|Jokat|Reents|2017|p=78}} The hotspot origin of Discovery and the Walvis-[[Tristan da Cunha]] seamount chains was first proposed in 1972.{{sfn|Kempe|Schilling|1974|p=101}} In the case of the Shona Ridge and the Discovery Seamounts, the theory postulates that they formed as the [[African Plate]] moved over the [[Shona hotspot]] and the Discovery hotspot.{{sfn|le Roex|Class|O'Connor|Jokat|2010|p=2090}}

It is not clear if a Discovery Hotspot exists, nor whether it is linked in any way to Gough Island.{{sfn|Jokat|Reents|2017|p=78}} The formation of the Discovery Seamounts may instead have been caused by ascent of [[magma]] along a fracture zone or other crustal weakness.{{sfn|Jokat|Reents|2017|p=89}} If the hotspot does exist, it would have to be located southwest of the Discovery Seamounts{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=168}} where low seismic velocity anomalies have been detected in the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].{{sfn|Homrighausen|Hoernle|Hauff|Wartho|2018|p=6}} The Discovery Seamounts almost wane out in that direction although the it has been proposed that the Little Ridge close to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge may be their continuation.{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=171}} The Discovery Ridge close to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge{{sfn|Gibson|Richards|2018|p=209}} may be the product of the hotspot as well; magma flowing from the Discovery hotspot to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge{{sfn|Gibson|Richards|2018|p=205}} may be leading to excessive production of [[Crust (geology)|crust]]al material there.{{sfn|Gibson|Richards|2018|p=216}}

Petrological anomalies at [[spreading ridge]]s have been often attributed to the presence of [[mantle plume]]s close to the ridge and such has been proposed for the Discovery hotspot as well.{{sfn|Douglass|Schilling|Kingsley|Small|1995|p=2893}} There is a region on the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] southwest of the seamounts where there are fewer [[earthquake]]s than elsewhere along the ridge, the central valley of the ridge is absent&lt;ref name="DeAlteriis1998" /&gt; and where dredged rocks share geochemical traits with the Discovery Seamount; that may be the location of the Discovery Hotspot.{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=168}} A position about halfway between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Discovery Seamounts has been inferred.{{sfn|Douglass|Schilling|Kingsley|Small|1995|p=2894}} The Discovery hotspot may be connected to the [[Tristan hotspot]] deep in the mantle.{{sfn|Homrighausen|Hoernle|Hauff|Wartho|2018|p=25}}

The South Atlantic features one of the largest [[transform fault]]s of Earth, the Agulhas-Falkland fracture zone.{{sfn|Uenzelmann-Neben|Gohl|2004|p=305}} This transform fault has an unusual structure on the [[African Plate]], where it displays the [[Agulhas Ridge]], two over {{convert|2|km}} high ridge segments which are parallel to each other.{{sfn|Uenzelmann-Neben|Gohl|2004|p=306}} This unusual structure may be due to magma from the Discovery hotspot, which would have been channelled to the Agulhas Ridge.{{sfn|Uenzelmann-Neben|Gohl|2004|p=316}}

=== Composition ===

Rocks dredged from the seamounts include [[lava]]s, [[pillow lava]]s and [[volcaniclastic]] rocks.{{sfn|Werner|Hauff|2011|p=11}} Geochemically they are classified as [[alkali basalt]], [[basalt]], [[phonolite]], [[tephriphonolite]]{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=169}} [[trachyandesite]], [[trachybasalt]] and [[trachyte]].{{sfn|le Roex|Class|O'Connor|Jokat|2010|p=2094}} Minerals contained in the rocks include [[alkali feldspar]], [[apatite]], [[biotite]], [[clinopyroxene]], iron and titanium oxides, [[olivine]], [[plagioclase]], [[sphene]] and [[spinel]].{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=169}} Continental crust rocks dredged at the seamounts may be glacial [[dropstone]]s,{{sfn|le Roex|Class|O'Connor|Jokat|2010|p=2093}} [[manganese]] have also been found.{{sfn|Werner|Hauff|2011|p=11}}

The Discovery hotspot appears to have erupted two separate sets of [[magma]]s with distinct compositions, similar to the [[Tristan da Cunha]]-[[Gough Island]] hotspot.{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=175}} The composition of the Discovery Seamounts rocks has been compared to [[Gough Island]].{{sfn|Jokat|Reents|2017|p=77}} The more [[felsic]] rocks at Discovery appear to be derived from [[magma chamber]] processes, similar to felsic rocks at other Atlantic Ocean islands.{{sfn|le Roex|Class|O'Connor|Jokat|2010|p=2109}}

== Biology ==

[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fishery during the 1970s and 1980s and others have found {{circa}} 150 fish species at Discovery Seamount.&lt;ref name="BalushkinPrirodina2010" /&gt; Both Japanese and Soviet trawled the seamounts during that time, but there was no commercial exploitation of the resources.&lt;ref name="SeamountsEcology2007" /&gt; The [[Morids|codling]] ''[[Guttigadus nudirostre]]'' is [[endemic]] to Discovery Seamount.&lt;ref name="Melendez1997" /&gt; Fossil [[coral]]s have been recovered in dredges.{{sfn|Werner|Hauff|2011|p=24}}

== Eruption history ==

A number of dates ranging from 41 to 35 million years ago have been obtained on dredged samples from the seamounts on the basis of [[argon-argon dating]],{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=168}} but at Discovery Seamount it may have continued until 7-6.5 million years ago.{{sfn|Buckley|1976|p=947}} The age of the seamounts decreases in southwest direction, similar to the Walvis Ridge, and at a similar rate.{{sfn|Schwindrofska|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2016|p=170}} 

Unlike the Walvis Ridge, which is connected to the [[Etendeka]] [[flood basalt]]s, the Discovery Seamounts do not link with onshore volcanic features.{{sfn|Jokat|Reents|2017|p=77}} However, it has been proposed that the 70-80 million years old Blue Hills, Gibeon and Gross Brukkaros [[kimberlite]] fields in southern [[Namibia]] may have been formed by the Discovery hotspot,&lt;ref name="ReidCooper2009" /&gt; and some plate reconstructions place it underneath the [[Karoo-Ferrar]] [[large igneous province]] at the time at which it was emplaced.&lt;ref name="StoreyLeat2001" /&gt;

'''Energy for All''' is the name of an initiative and partnership, both founded by the [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB), to reduce [[energy poverty]] in Asia and the Pacific. 

The initiative aims to develop approaches for providing access to reliable and affordable energy services, and to scale them up. This includes household access to electricity from renewable energy technologies such as [[micro-hydro]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[biomass]], and small [[wind power|wind]] power, as well as access to clean cooking fuel, such as [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] or [[biogas]] from livestock manure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Energy for All Initiative|url=http://www.adb.org/Clean-Energy/energyforall-initiative.asp|publisher=[[Asian Development Bank]]|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership was created to allow entities from different sectors in the region to cooperate. Its stated goal is to provide access to energy to 100 million people in the region by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Energy for All Partnership |url=http://www.adb.org/Clean-Energy/energyforall-partnership.asp |publisher=Asian Development Bank |accessdate=2011-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810055630/http://www.adb.org/Clean-Energy/energyforall-partnership.asp |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in Afghanistan''' is primarily provided by [[hydropower]]. The decades of [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|war]] have left the country's power grid badly damaged. As of 2012, approximately 33% of the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan population]] had access to electricity and in the capital [[Kabul]], 70% had access to reliable 24-hour electricity. 

According to [[Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat]] (DABS), [[Afghanistan]] generates around 300 megawatts (MW) of electricity mainly from hydropower followed by [[fossil fuel]] and [[solar power|solar]]. About 1,000 MW more is imported from neighboring Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.&lt;ref name="21 hydropower dams in the pipeline"/&gt;

As of 2012, the country currently needs at least 2,000 MW of electricity, and is estimated that it will need around 3,000 MW to meet its needs by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/09/us-afghanistan-power-idUSTRE8080C920120109 Electricity only reaches one in three Afghans]. Reuters Jan. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Afghan National Development Strategy has identified [[alternative energy]], such as wind and solar energy, as a high value power source to develop. As a result, several wind and solar plants have been created, with more currently under development.

==Hydroelectricity==
[[File:1950s Afghanistan - Sarobi hydro-power plant on Kabul River.jpg|thumb|The [[Surobi District (Kabul)|Sarobi]] 
[[hydroelectric]] power plant, built in the 1950s.]]
Hydroelectric plants were built between the 1950s and the mid-1970s, which included the [[Surobi District (Kabul)|Sarobi]] hydroelectric power plant in [[Kabul Province]], the [[Naghlu Dam|Naghlu]] in the eastern [[Nangarhar Province]], the [[Kajaki Dam|Kajaki]] in [[Helmand Province]] and a number of others. Other hydroelectric facilities that were operational as of 2002 included plants at [[Puli Khumri]],  [[Darunta Dam|Darunta]] in Nangarhar Province, [[Dahla Dam|Dahla]] in [[Kandahar Province]], and one in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Also in operation was the [[Breshna-Kot Dam]] in Nangarhar, which had a generating capacity of 11.5 MW. Construction of two more power stations, with a combined capacity of 600&amp;nbsp;kW, was planned in [[Charikar|Charikar City]].

The southern region of Afghanistan has been lacking adequate electricity due to problems with the Kajaki power plant in Helmand, which has been damaged and neglected for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/reengineering-afghanistan "Re-Engineering Afghanistan: The coalition has spent hundreds of millions trying to give Afghanistan electricity. Unfortunately, it made many of the mistakes it made in Iraq,"] by Glenn Zorpette, ''IEEE Spectrum,'' October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A third generating [[turbine]] was recently added with the assistance of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/afghanistan/111007/watershed-waste-afghanistan%E2%80%99s-kajaki-dam-and-u |title=Watershed of Waste: Afghanistan’s Kajaki Dam and USAID |author=Jean MacKenzie |work=GlobalPost |accessdate=22 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528130355/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/afghanistan/111007/watershed-waste-afghanistan%E2%80%99s-kajaki-dam-and-u |archivedate=28 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This added 16.5 MW to its generating capacity and eventually provide the southern Afghan cities of [[Kandahar]] and [[Lashkar Gah]] with around 10-hour electricity per day. A number of other water mega dams are being built in different parts of the country, which are mainly for irrigation purposes.&lt;ref name="21 hydropower dams in the pipeline"&gt;[http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/02/04/21-hydropower-dams-pipeline 21 hydropower dams in the pipeline] (Pajhwok Afghan News, Feb. 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Two new dams are under construction in [[Kunar Province]], one of which has the capacity of 1500 MW in Surtak area of the subjected province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/08/26/joint-dam-kunar-river-being-mulled|title=Joint dam on Kunar River being mulled|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/04/10/energy-master-plan-being-implemented{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural gas and oil==
Natural gas reserves were once estimated at 140 billion cubic metres. Production started in 1967 with 342 million cu m but had risen to 2.6 billion cubic metres by 1995. In 1991, a new gas field was discovered in [[Chekhcha]], [[Jowzjan Province]]. Natural gas was also produced at [[Sheberghan]] and [[Sar-e Pol, Jowzjan|Sar-e Pol]]. Natural gas was Afghanistan's only economically significant export in 1995, going mainly to [[Uzbekistan]] via pipelines from northern Afghanistan, which at the time was controlled by [[Junbish-i-Milli]]. As of 2002, other operational gas fields were located at [[Djarquduk]], [[Khwaja Du Koh District|Khowaja Gogerdak]], and [[Yatimtaq]], all in Jowzjan Province. In 2002, natural gas production was 1.77 billion cubic feet.

In 2012, the leaders of four countries had signed an agreement to build the [[Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India Pipeline|Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2012/07/30/Turkmenistan-takes-TAPI-on-the-road/UPI-15881343651336/|title=Turkmenistan takes TAPI on the road|date=30 July 2012|work=UPI|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; expected for completion in 2019.

A very small amount of crude oil is produced at the Angot field in the northern [[Sar-e Pol Province]]. Another small oilfield at [[Zomrad Sai]] near Sheberghan was reportedly undergoing repairs in mid-2001. Petroleum products such as [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[gasoline]], and [[jet fuel]] are imported, mainly from Pakistan and Central Asia nations. A small storage and distribution facility exists in Jalalabad on the highway between Kabul and [[Peshawar]], Pakistan.

Afghanistan is reported to have oil reserves totaling 2.9 billion barrels.

==Electricity import==

===Uzbekistan===
Discussions on electricity supplies began back in 2006, the Construction of a {{convert|442|km|mi|adj=on}} high voltage transmission line from Uzbekistan to Afghanistan was completed by October 2008. It runs from Kabul through five Afghan provinces towards the country's border with Uzbekistan, and connects to the Uzbek electricity transmission system. It was expected that the project would cost $198 million [USD] the transmission lines were jointly funded by India and the Asian Development Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Electricity_Supply_in_Afghanistan|title=Electricity Supply in Afghanistan|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, by early April 2009, all the capital city of [[Kabul]] had 24-hour electricity, the increase in power has already made a difference to many ordinary Afghans. By 2011, the 220&amp;nbsp;kV line form Uzbekistan had a capacity of nearly 300 MW.&lt;ref&gt;http://centralasiaonline.com/cocoon/caii/xhtml/en_GB/features/caii/features/2008/07/07/feature-02&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan===
The [[CASA-1000]] project, expected to be completed by the ned of 2018, will provide 300 MW of electricity to Afghanistan, with the remaining 1000 MW going towards Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;https://thediplomat.com/2017/12/indian-companies-to-begin-casa-1000-construction-in-afghanistan/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coal ==
Afghanistan is reported to have coal reserves totalling 100-400 million tons. These mines are located from Badakhshan and extend up to Herat Province. Afghanistan has more than 11 coal reserves which include

=== Bamyan province ===
# Ashposhta and Sarasia coal reserves - 150 million tons
# Sarjungel and Sar Asia coal reserves

=== Baghlan province ===
# Karkar coal reserves
# Dodkash coal reserves

=== Samangan province ===
# Dara e sof-Shabashak reserves (Very High Quality) 74 million tons
# Darae e sof- Gola badri - Keshine Mabayen Village and Balkhab District coal reserves

=== Badakhshan province ===
# Kotal khaki - Barf District coal reserves

=== Parwan province ===
# Farakort Gorband Province and Gawoparan Surkhparsa District coal reserves

=== Herat province ===
# Karukh coal reserves - 15 million tons

=== Daikundi province ===
# Lagharjoe - Kacharan District coal reserves

=== Uruzgan province ===
# Kandalan Village Mudakhil District coal reserves

===Paktia province===
# Khost and Paktia coal reserves - 75 million ton

== Solar ==
[[File:Solar power in northern Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[Solar power|Solar]] lights in the northern [[Balkh Province]]]]
In 1991, a new 72-collector solar installation was completed in Kabul at a cost of $364 million. The installation heated 40,000 liters of water to an average temperature of 60&amp;nbsp;°C around the clock. The use of solar power is becoming widespread in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.kuow.org/program.php?id=20031# |title=Seattle Engineer Brings Solar Power To Afghanistan |access-date=2012-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216174257/http://kuow.org/program.php?id=20031# |archive-date=2010-12-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the9billion.com/2011/01/19/us-army-using-solar-in-afghanistan/|title=Solar Just For Greenies?

Many villagers in rural parts of the country are also buying solar panels and using them.

In 2017 a solar power plant was opened in [[Herat Province]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/09/17/first-ever-solar-wind-power-plant-goes-functional-herat&lt;/ref&gt; Plants are also under construction in [[Kandahar Province]] and [[Kabul Province]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1tvnews.af/en/news/afghanistan/28467-kandahar-to-get-30-mw-of-electricity-from-solar-energy&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being financed by the [[Asian Development Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/11/26/adb-provide-4476m-construction-solar-power-plant&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geothermal ==
An area of vast untapped potential lies in the heat energy locked inside the earth in the form of magma or dry, hot rocks. Geothermal energy for electricity generation has been used worldwide for nearly 100 years. The technology currently exists to provide low-cost electricity from Afghanistan’s geothermal resources, which are located in the main axis areas of the Hindu Kush. These run along the Herat fault system, all the way from Herat to the Wakhan corridor in the North.

With efficient use of the natural resources already abundantly available in Afghanistan, alternative energy sources could be directed into industrial use, supply the energy needs of the nation and build economic self-sufficiency.

== Uranium ==
The [[Helmand Province]] in southern [[Afghanistan]] has [[uranium]] reserves, confirmed by [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Mines]].&lt;ref name=afp&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iFrOtnNs42obPsi8ul_AHEXmOGzQ Afghanistan sitting on a gold mine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001752/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iFrOtnNs42obPsi8ul_AHEXmOGzQ |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defpro.com/news/details/38049/?SID=c5ab00993926de7edab1795f82e2415f|title=defpro.com|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121082309/http://www.defpro.com/news/details/38049/?SID=c5ab00993926de7edab1795f82e2415f#|archive-date=2013-01-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biogas ==
Besides wind and sun, potential alternative energy sources for Afghanistan include biogas and geothermal energy. 
Biogas plants are fuelled by animal dung, and produce a clean, odourless and smokeless fuel. The digestion process also creates a high-quality fertilizer which can benefit the family farm.

Family-sized biogas plants require 50 kilograms of manure per day to support the average family. Four to six cows are required to produce this amount of manure, or eight to nine camels, or 50 sheep/goats. Theoretically, Afghanistan has the potential to produce about 1,400 million cubic meters of biogas annually. A quarter of this amount could meet half of Afghanistan’s energy needs, according to a January 2011 report from the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

== Wind ==
[[File:Wind farm in Panjshir Province-2.jpg|thumb|Afghanistan's first [[wind farm]] in the [[Panjshir Province]].]]
The first [[wind farm]] was successfully completed in [[Panjshir Province]] in 2008, which has the potential to produce 100&amp;nbsp;kW of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://aec.army.mil/usaec/newsroom/update/win09/win0908.html# |title='Green' Energy Demonstrates Progress in Afghan Province |access-date=2012-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217051718/http://www.aec.army.mil/usaec/newsroom/update/win09/win0908.html# |archive-date=2013-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  United States Agency for International Development has teamed up with the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop a wind map of Herat province. They have identified approximately 158,000 megawatts of untapped potential wind energy. Installing wind turbine farms in Herat could provide electricity to much of western Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://sada-e-azadi.net/Joomla/index.php/en/topics/features/6714-energy-that-never-run-out{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller projects are wind pumps that already have been attached to water wells in several Herat villages, along with reservoirs for storing up to 15 cubic meters of water. The 300 KW wind farm in Herat was inaugarated in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1tvnews.af/en/news/afghanistan/30859-third-wind-turbine-erected-in-afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2952">The '''Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere''' (CASA) is a [[National Science Foundation]] Engineering Center. The Center brings together a multidisciplinary group of engineers, computer scientists, meteorologists, sociologists, graduate and undergraduate students, as well as industry and government partners to conduct fundamental research, develop enabling technology, and deploy prototype engineering systems based on a new paradigm: ''Distributed Collaborative Adaptive Sensing'' (DCAS) networks.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop;jsessionid=804ZhLCKtXV9XRD3cGCL5TSrW6ppjBGNlJhYJLT4pH7m4BfnMGhw!-991132987!467831480?_nfpb=true&amp;_windowLabel=researchAssets_1_1&amp;_urlType=action&amp;wlpresearchAssets_1_1_id=%2FresearchGov%2FResearchAsset%2FPublicAffairs%2FCollaborativeAdaptiveSensingoftheAtmosphereEngineeringResearchCenter.html&amp;wlpresearchAssets_1_1_action=selectAssetDetail&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
CASA was established in 2003 under the [[National Science Foundation]]. Beginning in FY 2010, the main source of funding and support came from the Jerome M. Paros Fund for Measurement and Environmental Sciences Research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casa.umass.edu/main/research/oklahoma_test_bed/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

CASA is a collaboration among four academic partners: the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (lead institution), the [[University of Oklahoma]], [[Colorado State University]], and the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. Other collaborating academic institutions are: the [[University of Delaware]], the [[University of Virginia]] and [[McGill University]].

== Achievements ==

CASA initially operated a network of low-power, short-range, X- band, dual-polarized Doppler weather radars in southwestern Oklahoma. The system, known as Integrative Project 1 or IP1 for short,	 was installed in January 2006 and began operation April 1 of 2006. IP1 is the first CASA test bed to demonstrate DCAS and the value of low-level sensing, and a number of research opportunities will be made available by the system. Since the construction of IP1, two new testbeds have been built and tested - one in Dallas, and one in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.2766&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3175">An '''exhumed river channel''' is a ridge of [[sandstone]] that remains when the softer flood plain [[mudstone]] is [[erosion|eroded]] away. The process begins with the [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] of sand within a [[river]] channel (typically a [[meander]]ing river) and mud on the adjacent [[floodplain]]. Eventually the channel is abandoned and over time becomes buried by flood deposits from other channels. Because the sand is porous (grain-to-grain contact leaves spaces between), [[groundwater]] flows more easily through the sand than through the mud of the floodplain deposits. [[Image:Exhumedchannel.jpg|thumb|left|An exhumed river channel (red arrow) in the Cedar Mountain Formation near [[Green River, Utah]]]][[Image:MeanderChannel.jpg|thumb|right|Exhumed river channels were once the site of a river system. Sand was deposited in the channel and mud on the adjacent floodplain as seen with this meandering river in western [[South Dakota]].]] 
Minerals (typically [[calcium carbonate]]) can cement the grains together converting the loose sand into sandstone. Meanwhile, pressure from overlying [[sediment]]s compresses the floodplain mud converting it to mudstone. Millions of years later, erosion can remove the softer, less cemented mudstone and leave the more resistant sandstone as a sinuous ridge. Thus, an exhumed river channel is a form of [[inverted relief]]: what was previously low is now high, and vice versa. Exhumed channels are important indicators for ancient stream flow direction.

Some of the best examples of exhumed river channels occur in the Ruby Ranch Member of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Cedar Mountain Formation]] southwest of [[Green River, Utah]]. Within the Cedar Mountain Formation in this part of Utah, fluvial [[sandstone]]s filling paleochannels within it are cemented by [[calcium carbonate]]. Because of this cementation, the sandstone filling these paleochannels are considerably more resistant to erosion than the [[shale]] and [[mudstone]] that enclose them. As a result, differential erosion preferentially removes the shale and mudstone and exposes these paleochannels as ridges.&lt;ref name="WillaimsOthers2007a"&gt;Williams, R.M.E., T.C.

[[File:An example of a fixed-point ocean observatory.svg|thumb|An example of a fixed-point ocean observatory, with several sensors and a communicating buoy.]]
A '''fixed-point ocean observatory''' is an autonomous system of automatic [[sensor]]s and samplers that continuously gathers [[data]] from [[deep sea]], [[water column]] and [[lower atmosphere]], and transmits the [[data]] to [[shore]] in real or [[near real-time]].

==Infrastructure==
Fixed-point ocean observatories are typically composed of a cable anchored to the sea floor to which several automatic sensors and samplers are attached. The cable ends with a buoy at the ocean surface that may have some more sensors attached.&lt;ref&gt;FixO3 Project Factsheet http://www.fixo3.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; Most observatories have communicating buoys that transmit data to shore, and which allow changes to the acquisition method of the sensors, as required.

These unmanned platforms can be linked via a cable to the shore transmitting data via an [[internet]] connection, or they can transmit data to [[relay]] buoys which are able to provide a [[satellite]] link to the shore.

==Instrumentation==
A typical [[multi-disciplinary]] observatory is equipped with sensors and instruments to measure physical and biogeochemical variables along the water column. Additionally the surface buoy can hold several sensors measuring atmospheric parameters at sea level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661111000383 Ruhl et al, Societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in European Seas, Progress in Oceanography, Volume 91, Issue 1, October 2011, Pages 1–33 (doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2011.05.001) ], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Main measured variables:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Sea surface || 
[[Sea surface temperature|Sea-surface temperature]] (SST)
[[Salinity|Sea-surface salinity]] (SSS)
&lt;br /&gt;[[Sea level]]
&lt;br /&gt;[[Sea state]]
&lt;br /&gt;[[Sea ice]]
&lt;br /&gt;[[Ocean current|Current]]
&lt;br /&gt;[[Ocean colour]] (for biological activity)

|}

In order to do so, typically the ocean observatories are equipped with instruments like:
* [[Acoustic Doppler current profiler|ADCP]] – Acoustic Doppler current profiler, to measure [[Ocean current|currents]];
* [[CTD (instrument)|CTD]] (conductivity, temperature and depth) sensors, to measure [[Salinity#Seawater|conductivity]] and thermal variations at a known depth;
* [[Hydrophone]] – to record sounds;
* [[Sediment trap|Sediment Trap]] – to quantify the quantity of sinking material;
* Deep sea [[camera]] – to capture footage on location;
* [[Seismometer]] – to record the earth motion;
* [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] analyser – to measure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;
* [[Dissolved Oxygen]] sensor – to measure dissolved oxygen;
* [[Fluorometer|Fluorometers]] – to measure [[Chlorophyll]];
* [[Turbidity]] sensor – to measure turbidity.

==Purpose==
Ocean observatories can collect data for different purposes from scientific research to environmental monitoring for marine operations or governance for the benefit of economy and society as a whole.
Ocean observatories provide real-time, or near real time data allowing to detect changes as they happen, such as geo-hazards for example. Furthermore continuous time series data allow to investigate interannual-to-decadal changes and to capture episodic events, changes in ocean circulation, water properties, water mass formation and ecosystems, to quantify air-sea fluxes, and to analyse the role of the oceans for the climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intechopen.com/books/earth-observation/ocean-reference-stations Ocean Reference Stations], Meghan F. Cronin, Robert A. Weller, Richard S. Lampitt and Uwe Send (2012). Ocean Reference Stations, Earth Observation, Dr. Rustam Rustamov (Ed.), InTech, DOI: 10.5772/27423. Available from: http://www.intechopen.com/books/earth-observation/ocean-reference-stations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The data collected by the several ocean observatories around the globe on the sub-sea-floor, seafloor, and water column, allows to improve our knowledge&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642113734 Seafloor Observatories], A New Vision of the Earth from the Abyss Favali, Paolo; Beranzoli, Laura; De Santis, Angelo;  Springer, 2015. - 688 p.  (DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-11374-1)&lt;/ref&gt; of the ocean including:
# Ocean physics and climate change
# Biodiversity and ecosystem assessment
# Carbon cycle and ocean acidification
# Geophysics and geodynamics
Moreover  networks of ocean observatories can also be used to input data into global ocean models and to calibrate them thus allowing for the investigation of future changes in ocean circulation and ecosystems.

'''George Foster Emmons''' (August 23, 1811 – July 23, 1884) was a [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] of the [[United States Navy]], who served in the early to mid 19th century.

==Biography==
He was born  in [[Clarendon, Vermont]] on August 23, 1811. Emmons began his distinguished career as a midshipman on April 1, 1828. 

As a lieutenant aboard the {{USS|Peacock|1828|2}} he participated in the [[United States Exploring Expedition|Wilkes Exploring Expedition]] of 1838 to 1842, which discovered the [[Antarctica|Antarctic Continent]], and throughout the [[Southern Ocean|South Seas]].&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=William|title=The Great United States Exploring Expedition|date=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520025571|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was assigned command of the expedition's overland party conducting surveys and exploration from [[Puget Sound]] south to San Francisco. He served with great honor in the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican]] and [[American Civil War|Civil Wars]]. As commander of the {{USS|Ossipee|1861|2}} from 1867 to 1868, he carried to [[Alaska]] the commissioners who took formal possession for the United States. He became [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] in 1868, chief of the [[Naval Oceanographic Office|Hydrographic Office]] in 1870, and [[rear admiral]] in 1872. As a Rear Admiral, he commanded the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] until his retirement in 1873. Rear Admiral Emmons died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] on July 23, 1884 at the age of 82. He is buried in [[Green Mount Cemetery]], Baltimore, Maryland.

==Namesake==
In 1941, the {{sclass-|Gleaves|destroyer}} {{USS|Emmons|DD-457}} was named in his honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25198">An '''intergovernmental organization''' or '''international governmental organisation''' ('''IGO''') is an [[organization]] composed primarily of [[sovereign state]]s (referred to as ''[[member state]]s''), or of other intergovernmental organizations. Intergovernmental organizations are  called [[international organization]]s, although that term may also include [[international non-governmental organization]] such as international [[nonprofit organization]]s or [[multinational corporation]]s.
 
Intergovernmental organizations are an important aspect of [[public international law]]. IGOs are established by a treaty that acts as a [[charter]] creating the group. Treaties are formed when lawful representatives (governments) of several states go through a [[ratification]] process, providing the IGO with an international [[legal personality]].

Intergovernmental organizations in a legal sense should be distinguished from simple groupings or coalitions of states, such as the [[G8]] or the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]]. Such groups or associations have not been founded by a constituent document and exist only as [[task force|task group]]s.

Intergovernmental organizations must also be distinguished from treaties. Many treaties (such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], or the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] before the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]]) do not establish an organization and instead rely purely on the parties for their administration becoming legally recognized as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' commission. Other treaties{{which|date=March 2016}} have established an administrative apparatus which was not deemed to have been granted international legal personality.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

==Types and purpose==
Intergovernmental organizations differ in function, membership, and membership criteria. They have various goals and scopes, often outlined in the treaty or [[charter]]. Some IGOs developed to fulfill a need for a neutral forum for debate or negotiation to resolve disputes. Others developed to carry out mutual interests with unified aims to preserve peace through [[conflict resolution]] and better [[international relations]], promote international cooperation on matters such as [[List of supranational environmental agencies|environmental protection]], to promote [[human rights]], to promote [[Social change|social development]] (education, [[health care]]), to render [[humanitarian aid]], and to [[economic development]]. Some are more general in scope (the United Nations) while others may have subject-specific missions (such as Interpol or the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and other [[standards organization]]s). Common types include:

* Worldwide or global organizations - generally open to nations worldwide as long as certain criteria are met. This category includes the [[United Nations]] (UN) and its specialized agencies, the [[Universal Postal Union]], [[Interpol]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), the [[World Customs Organization]] (WCO), and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). It also includes globally operating intergovernmental organisations that are not an agency of the UN, including for example the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], a globally operating intergovernmental organisation based in [[The Hague]] that pursues the progressive unification of [[Conflict of laws|private international law]].
* Cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical organizations - open to members based on some cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical link. Examples include the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Arab League]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], [[Turkic Council]], [[International Organization of Turkic Culture]],  [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS).
* Economic organizations - based on economic organization. Some are dedicated to [[free trade]] and the reduction of trade barrier, e.g. [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[International Chamber of Commerce]]. Others are focused on [[International Development Research Centre|international development]]. International [[cartel]]s, such as [[OPEC]], also exist. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) was founded as an economics-focused organization. An example of a recently formed economic IGO is the [[Bank of the South]].
* Educational organizations - centered around tertiary level study. [[Academy of European Law]] offers training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics. [[EUCLID (university)]] chartered as a university and umbrella organization dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries and [[United Nations University]] efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are the concern of the United Nations, its Peoples and Member States.
* Health and Population Organizations- based on the common perceived health and population goals and to address those challenges collectively. An example is the intergovernmental partnership for population and development [http://www.partners-popdev.org/ Partners in Population and Development].
* [[Regional organization]]s - open to members from a particular continent region or other specific region of the world. This category includes the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CLACS), [[Council of Europe]] (CoE), [[European Union]] (EU), [[Eurasian Economic Union]] (EAEU), [[Energy Community]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[African Union]] (AU), [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS), [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), Islamic Development Bank, [[Union of South American Nations]], [[Asia Cooperation Dialogue]] (ACD), [[Pacific Islands Forum]], and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS)
[[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD).

Work to launch INBAR as an independent organization started in 1995, and was completed in 1997 when INBAR became an independent organization with its headquarters in Beijing, China – the first intergovernmental organization to be headquartered in the People's Republic.
Membership and structure

Membership

42 member countries make up this organisation.

==History==
While treaties, [[Political alliance|alliances]], and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] conferences had existed for centuries, IGOs only began to be established in the 19th century. Among the first were the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]], initiated in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the International Telegraph Union (the future [[International Telecommunication Union]]), which was founded by the signing of the International Telegraph Convention by 20 countries in May 1865. Of notable significance was the emergence of the [[League of Nations]] following World War One, designed as an institution to foster collective security in order to sustain peace.

==Expansion and growth==
Held and McGrew (2002) counted thousands of IGOs worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Held and McGrew, 2002: Introduction, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt; and this number continues to rise. This increase may be attributed to globalization, which increases and encourages the cooperation among and within states. Globalization has also provided easier means for IGO growth, as a result of increased international relations. This is seen economically, politically, militarily, as well as on the domestic level. Economically, IGOs gain material and non-material resources for economic prosperity. IGOs also provide more political stability within the state and among differing states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Which type of international organizations can settle civil wars?|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=12|issue=4|pages=613–641|doi=10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military alliances are also formed by establishing common standards in order to ensure security of the members to ward off outside threats. Lastly, the formation has encouraged autocratic states to develop into democracies in order to form an effective and internal government.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Megan.

==Participation and involvement==
There are several different reasons a state may choose membership in an intergovernmental organization. But there are also reasons membership may be rejected. These reasons are explored in the sections below.

Reasons for participation:
# Economic rewards: In the case of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), many different countries receive economic benefits from membership in the free trade agreement. For example, Mexican companies are given better access to [[United States|U.S.]] markets due to their membership.
# Political influence: Smaller countries, such as [[Portugal]] and [[Belgium]], who do not carry much political clout on the international stage, are given a substantial increase in influence through membership in IGOs, such as the [[European Union]]. Also for countries with more influence such as [[France]] and [[Germany]] they are beneficial as the nation increases influence in the smaller countries' internal affairs and expanding other nations dependence on themselves, so to preserve allegiance 
# Security: Membership in an IGO such as [[NATO]] gives security benefits to member countries. This provides an arena where political differences can be resolved.
# Improve democracy and the likelihood of democratic survival: It has been noted that member countries experience a greater degree of democracy and those democracies survive longer.
 
Reasons for rejecting membership:
# Loss of [[sovereignty]]: Membership often comes with a loss of state sovereignty as treaties are signed which require cooperation on the part of all member states.
# Insufficient benefits: Often membership does not bring about substantial enough benefits to warrant membership in the organization.

==Privileges and immunities==
Intergovernmental organizations are provided with privileges and immunities that are intended to ensure their independent and effective functioning. They are specified in the treaties that give rise to the organization (such as the [[Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations]] and the [[Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court]]), which are normally supplemented by further multinational agreements and national regulations (for example the [[International Organizations Immunities Act]] in the United States). The organizations are thereby immune from the jurisdiction of national courts.

Rather than by national jurisdiction, legal [[accountability]] is intended to be ensured by legal mechanisms that are internal to the intergovernmental organization itself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parish | first = Matthew | title = An essay on the accountability of international organizations | journal = International Organizations Law Review | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–342 | doi= 10.1163/157237410X543332 | ssrn = 1651784 | date = 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and access to administrative tribunals. In the course of many court cases where private parties tried to pursue claims against international organizations, there has been a gradual realization  that alternate means of dispute settlement are required, as states have [[fundamental human rights]] obligations to provide plaintiffs with access to court in view of their [[right to a fair trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Heitz | first = André | title = UN Special number 645 | url = http://www.unspecial.org/UNS645/t32en.html | quote = The French court said… The right to a day in court prevails over jurisdictional immunity | date = November 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019071051/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS645/t32en.html | archivedate = 2013-10-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadow"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinisch |first1=August |last2=Weber |first2=Ulf Andreas |title=In the shadow of Waite and Kennedy – the jurisdictional immunity of international organizations, the individual's right of access to the courts and administrative tribunals as alternative means of dispute settlement |journal=International Organizations Law Review |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=59–110 |doi=10.1163/1572374043242330 |date=2004 |ref=harv }} [http://zsu-schmelz.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/int_beziehungen/Personal/Publikationen_Reinisch/waite_kennedy_iolr_2004.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019171912/http://zsu-schmelz.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/int_beziehungen/Personal/Publikationen_Reinisch/waite_kennedy_iolr_2004.pdf |date=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}} Otherwise, the organizations' immunities may be put in question in national and international courts.&lt;ref name="Shadow" /&gt;{{rp|72}} Some organizations hold proceedings before tribunals relating to their organization to be confidential, and in some instances have threatened disciplinary action should an employee disclose any of the relevant information. Such confidentiality has been criticized as a lack of [[Transparency (social)|transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brettonwoodslaw.com/the-success-of-which-we-cannot-speak/ The success of which we cannot speak] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019133530/http://www.brettonwoodslaw.com/the-success-of-which-we-cannot-speak/ |date=2013-10-19 }}, brettonwoodlaw.com, 11 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and weaknesses==
{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}
These are some of the strengths and weaknesses of IGOs:

Strengths:
# They hold state authority.
# Their institutions are permanent.
# They provide a forum for discussion.
# They are issue specific.
# They provide information.
# They allow multilateral cooperation.

Weaknesses:
# Membership is limited. Prohibits the membership of private citizens. This makes IGOs undemocratic. In addition, not all IGOs allow universal membership.
# IGOs often overlap resulting in a complex network.
# States have to give up part of their sovereignty, which weakens the state's ability to assert its authority.
# Inequality among state members creates biases and can lead powerful states to misuse these organizations.

They can be deemed unfair as countries with a higher percentage voting power have the right to veto any decision that is not in their favor, leaving the smaller countries powerless.

[[Image:Dryandra sessilis 2 cape Naturaliste email.jpg|thumb|right|Inflorescence of ''[[Banksia sessilis]]'' (Parrotbush), a species in ''B.''&amp;nbsp;ser. ''Dryandra'']]
[[Banksia ser. Dryandra|''B.''&amp;nbsp;ser. ''Dryandra'']] is a large [[series (botany)|series]] in the plant [[genus]] ''[[Banksia]]''. It was treated at [[genus]] rank until 2007, when [[Austin Mast]] and [[Kevin Thiele]] transferred it into ''Banksia'' as a series within [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''B.''&amp;nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'']].&lt;ref name="Mast 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Austin Mast|Mast, Austin R.]] and [[Kevin Thiele]] | year = 2007 | title = The transfer of Dryandra R.Br. to Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 20 | pages = 63–71 | doi = 10.1071/SB06016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2007, 94 ''Dryandra'' species were recognised.&lt;ref name="Cavanagh 2006"&gt;{{cite book | author = Cavanagh, Tony and [[Margaret Pieroni]] | year = 2006 | title = The Dryandras | publisher = Melbourne: Australian Plants Society (SGAP Victoria); Perth: Wildflower Society of Western Australia | isbn = 1-876473-54-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the transfer into ''Banksia'', ''D.&amp;nbsp;prionotes'' was overlooked, and ''[[Banksia subulata|B.&amp;nbsp;subulata]]'' (Awled Honeypot) was transferred ''[[incertae sedis]]'' rather than in ''B.''&amp;nbsp;ser. ''Dryandra''.&lt;ref name="Mast 2007"/&gt; ''D.&amp;nbsp;prionotes'' has since been transferred into ''Banksia'' as ''[[Banksia prionophylla]]'', but it was not explicitly placed in ''B.''&amp;nbsp;ser. ''Dryandra''. The series therefore now consists of 92 species.

There are 167 '''Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in Cornwall''' (including the [[Isles of Scilly]]). [[Cornwall]], in the south-west of England, UK, has a population of {{English district population|GSS=E06000052}} ({{United Kingdom statistics year}}) across an area of {{convert|{{English district area|GSS=E06000052}}|km2|acre|1|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}, making it one of the least densely populated counties within England.&lt;ref&gt;{{English district population citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north coast of Cornwall falls on the [[Celtic Sea]] in the Atlantic Ocean, which also surrounds the Isles of Scilly, the south coast falls on the [[English Channel]] and the county is bounded by the [[River Tamar]], forming the border with [[Devon]], to the east. Cornish geology consists mainly of rocks from the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] geological periods. Granite forms a large part of these, with mineralisations of tin, copper, lead and [[arsenic]] having been [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|mined]] in the area.&lt;ref name=Geodiversity&gt;{{cite web|title=Geodiversity: Cornwall (inc Isles of Scilly) |url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID6.aspx |publisher=[[Natural England]] |accessdate=16 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111200331/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID6.aspx |archivedate=11 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives rise to many distinct habitats, with strong marine influences, including [[sand dune]]s, rocky [[reef]]s, [[Stack (geology)|stack]]s and [[headland]]s as well as [[heath]]land, [[moorland]] and unusual river profiles.&lt;ref name=AONB&gt;{{cite web|title=AONB: Cornwall|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/aonb/cornwall.aspx|publisher=[[Natural England]]|accessdate=16 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828140323/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/aonb/cornwall.aspx|archivedate=28 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England the body responsible for designating [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest|SSSIs]] is [[Natural England]], which chooses a site "because of its [[plant|flora]], [[fauna]], or geological or physiographical features".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Guidelines for selection of biological SSSIs | publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee | url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-2303 | accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]]. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974–96 county system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County search of SSSIs |publisher=[[Natural England]] |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |accessdate=16 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192309/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |archivedate=19 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the same approach is followed here, rather than adopting the current [[Subdivisions of England|local government]] or [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] boundaries.

Of the 167 sites designated in this [[Area of Search]], the greatest number, 81, have been designated due to their [[Flora and fauna of Cornwall|biological interest]], with 54 due to their [[Geology of Cornwall|geological interest]] and 32 for both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SSSIs in Cornwall | publisher=[[Natural England]] | url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1008 | accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data in the table is taken from English Nature in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Natural England]]'' citation sheets for each SSSI (PDF).

==Interior Department memorandum==
In a 2010 "Not for Release" - memorandum by the [[United States Department of the Interior]] 14 areas were listed in the "Prospective Conservation Designation" attachment as "good candidates for National Monument designation under the Antiquities Act".&lt;ref name="memorandum"&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Prospective Conservation Designation: National Monument designation under the Antiquities Act|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/uploadedfiles/states_for_designation.pdf|website=Congressman [[Rob Bishop|Rob Bishop's]] House.gov website|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas are included in the list of proposed National Monuments in the next section and marked with a blue-green background.

In subsequent attachments in the same draft "areas worthy of protection that are ineligible for Monument Designation and unlikely to receive legislative protection in the nearm term" and "cost estimates" of "high priority land-rationalization efforts" were listed.&lt;ref name="memorandum"/&gt;

==Formerly proposed National Monuments==
Some areas have been proposed as a National Monument earlier, but are no longer eligible to be listed above, because they are protected somehow now, e.g. as National Monument, [[National Park]] or [[Wilderness Area]] in the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]]. Some reasons for nevertheless keeping them in the following list might be:
* The proposed area is now included in another, larger area which is protected meanwhile. (Symbol: [[Image:Symbol deferred.svg|16px]])
* A smaller part of the originally proposed area is now protected. (Symbol: [[File:Checkhalf.png|16px]])
* The area was officially proposed for monument designation by a federal or state agency or department, e.g. in the memorandum mentioned above, and is finally protected now. Those entries are marked with a blue-green background. (Symbol: {{checkmark}})

==Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta==
Much of Bangladesh's geography is dominated by the [[Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta]], but the term "Ganges" is not widely used for the larger river's main distributary within Bangladesh. Where it flows out of India, the Ganges' main channel becomes the [[Padma River]]. Similarly, below its confluence with the [[Teesta River]], the main channel of the [[Brahmaputra River]] is known as the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna River]].

==Bogura District==

There are quite a few rivers in the district of [[Bogura]]. Taking the [[Karatoya]] as the central dividing water-channel of the district, the other rivers may be classified into the eastern and the Western systems. The course of all the rivers is, with such allowances as must be made for beds and windings, nearly uniform north and south. The eastern rivers are Monas, Charkadaha and Khamati besides a few other smaller ones. Through the khiar tracts in the western parts of the district flow the Nagar, the Tulshiganga, Nagar and other minor streams. All the western rivers are the tributaries of the [[Atrai River|Atrai]] which itself flows into the Jamuna {{convert|12|mi|km|0|order=flip}} north of the confluence of that river with the [[Ganges]] ([[padma]]) at [[Goalanda|Goalunda]].

Evidences show that the rivers [[Karatoya]] and [[Nagar River (Rajshahi)|Nagar]] have changed their courses in the past, while the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]], lying on the eastern boundary of the district, is in fact a new channel of the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]. A very small river, Tarai used to occupy more or
less the present location of the Jamuna. At that time the Brahmaputra used to flow to the east round the foot of the Garo Hills. The earliest evidence of the Brahmaputra river consists of a group of large Brahmaputra-size river scars which extend into the Sylhet basin flanking the southern edge of the Shillong plateau . The main river apparently extended east beyond this locality and then swung south into the Bay of Bengal. By the time of [[James Rennell|Rennell]]'s mapping, this course had been abandoned in favour of a shorter route down what is still called the old Brahmaputra river past [[Mymensingh]].

By the early 1770s the major diversion of the Brahmaputra into its present channel, west of the Madhupur jungle, had occurred. There is no complete agreement as to when this diversion down the Jenai river of Rennell occurred. Apparently by 1830 the diversion of low-river flow down the new channel was complete.

* [[Kholpetua River]]
* [[Mayur River]], Khulna
* [[Pasur River]]
* [[Rupsha River]]
* [[Shibsa River]]

===Rivers in Kushtia District===
The rivers of the former [[Nadia district]], of which [[Kushtia District]] was a part, were grouped together and known as "[[Nadia Rivers]]" because of the peculiar condition of the Nadia district and special measures taken by the government to keep them flowing. All the rivers of the former Nadia district (and of the present Kushtia District) were offshoots of the Padma (lower Ganges). But at one time when the Ganges found its way to the sea along the course of the Bhagirathi, there must have been some earlier streams to carry the drainage of the Darjeeling-Himalayas to the sea. Bhairab is said to be one of those streams. Later the Ganges drifted to the east and the [[Padma]] grew mighty, taking all the drainage of northern and upper Bengal.

# [[Padma River]]
# [[Bhairab River]]
# [[Bhodra River]]
# [[Mathabhanga River]]
# [[Kobadak River]]
# [[Garai River]]
# [[Kaliganga River]]

==Mymensingh District==

The [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]], nowhere less than 4 miles wide duriug rains, is running in the west and the equally important [[Meghna]] encloses the district on the east. They are connected by the old channel of the [[Brahmaputra]] running through the centre of the district in a south-easterly direction from above [[Bahadurabad]] up to [[Bhairab Bazar]].

===Rivers in Mymensingh District===

# [[Dhanu River]]
# [[Kangsha River]]
# [[Jinai River]]
# [[Brahmaputra River]]
# [[Pakhria]]

==Noakhali District==

The district of Noakhali is not intersected by so many rivers as the other deltaic districts of Bangladesh. On the west and south of the district and between the islands flows the Meghna with all its bifurcations each of which is much bigger than an ordinary river, and on the east the Feni subdivision is drained by the great and little Feni rivers. In the intervening country there are no rivers of any size and the drainage there depends on a few tidal channels or khals, of which the principal are the Noakhali khal, the Mahendra Khal and the Bhowaniganj Khal.

In sharp contrast with the mainland to its south, there is a network of khals in the islands. As one advances from the older formation of chars towards the newer ones, the number of khals gradually increases. The khals gradually silt up, but where diluvion goes on, new khals come into existence and the old ones become wider and wider.

===Rivers in Noakhali District===

# [[Meghna River]]
# [[Dakatia River]] [[Chandpur DISTRITCT]]
# [[Bhawaniganj Khal River]]
# [[Mahendrak Khal River]]
# [[Noakhali Khal River]]
# [[Little Feni River]]
# [[Big Feni River]]
# [[Muhuri River]]
# [[Seloneah River]]

==Pabna District==

The district is intersected by rivers of varying magnitude. But in fact, the river system is constituted by the Padma and the Jamuna with their interlacing offshoots and tributaries. Besides these flowing streams, the interior is visited by the abandoned beds of old rivers, most of which are dry except in the rains.

The general trend of the drainage of the Serajganj subdivision is from north-west to south-east, the rivers entering it from the north-west flow into the Jamuna after a tortuous course. In the Sadar subdivision, however, the general slope of the country is from west to east, and the main rivers fall into the [[Hurasagar River|Hurasagar]], a tributary of the Jamuna.

===Rivers in Pabna District===

# [[Padma River]]
# [[Ichamati River|Ichhamati River]]
# [[Baral River]]
# [[Atrai River]]
# [[Chiknai River]]
# [[Jamuna River]]
# [[Kazipur River]]
# [[Karatoya River]]

==Rajshahi District==

Excepting the [[Ganges]] or the [[Padma]], the [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]] and the [[Atrai River|Atrai]], the rivers of [[Rajshahi]] district are of little hydrographic importance. For, most of the rivers are more or less moribund, that is, they are not active flowing streams except
during the rainy season. During the rainy season these moribund rivers act as excellent drainage channels draining off
a large volume of water and have a considerable current. Most of these rivers are narrow and flow in well-defined channels.

===Principal rivers in Rajshahi District===

# [[Padma River]] 
# [[Mahananda River]]
# [[Atrai River]]
# [[Gur River]]
# [[Jamuna River]]
# [[Baral River]]
# [[Musakhan River]]
# [[Nandakuja River]]
# [[Gumani River]]
# [[Baralai River]]
# [[Narad River]]

==Tangail District==

[[Tangail District]] is flanked on the west by the mighty river [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]], which is nowhere less than 4 miles wide during the [[rainy season]]. The [[Dhaleshwari]], first an old channel of the Ganges and then of the [[Brahmaputra]], cuts across the south-western corner of the district on its powerful sweep to join the [[Meghna]] near [[Narayanganj]]. The old name of Dhaleshwari was "Gajghata". It used to flow afterwards by the [[Salimabad Union|Salimabad]] Channel and then at last by Porabari Channel. A part of the eastern boundary of the district runs close to the [[Banar River]]. The river Bangshi flows almost down the middle of the district, branching out from the old [[Brahmaputta]] to the north from near [[Jamalpur District|Jamalpur]]. Bangshi falls into Dhaleswari near Savar, in [[Dhaka district]]. The Bangshi forms a natural barrier to the [[Madhupur Jungle]] on the [[Tangail]] side, all the way from Madhupur to [[Mirzapur]]. It is fordable at only two or three places near Basail on its my to river Meghna. Dhaleswari itself however takes out from the Jamuna from inside Tangail district.

Among other important rivers of the district, Lohajang is worth mentioning. It flows past the district headquarters of [[Tangail]] and is almost dead at present (in moribund condition). Other rivers are [[Khiru River|Khiru]], [[Nanglai River|Nanglai]], [[Atia River|Atia]], and [[Jhinai River|Jhinai]]. The old Brahmaputra's most important offshoot is the Jhinai; striking off near Jamalpur it rejoins the Jamuna north of Sarishabari, while another branch flows past Gopalpur. Now these sub-systems of rivers, viz, Bangshi and Banar, and the Lohajang, Khiru, Nangtai, Atia and Jhinai are all dying out because of the shift of the old Brahmaputra river from its former channel to the present Jamuna channel.

The most important question in connection with the river system of Tangail vis-a-vis [[Mymensingh district]] is when and why the [[Brahmaputra River]] changed its main old channel. During the last 150 years or so, this diversion of the old Brahmaputra to its present [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] channel has considerably prompted the geographers and geologists to enquire deep into it. Two theories are advanced: As explanation of the diversion, one theory describes the gradua1 uplift of the Madhupur Tract and a final trigger action of the Teesta diversion in 1787 as the chief factor; and the other theory states that the Brahmaputra diversion resulted directly from a major increase in its volume of water due to beheading of the Tsangpo river of Tibet by Dihang, a tributary of the then small Brahmaputral. It has now been proved that the great Tibetan river Tsangpo joined the Brahmaputra about 1780 and this accession was more important than the Teesta floods in deciding the Brahmaputra to try a shorter way to the sea.

With the help of [[James Rennell|Major James Rennell]]'s maps (1764 to 1773) and of the Revenue Survey it is possible to reconstruct the history of the Bengal Delta and its river systems. It was Rennell who carried out the first ever accurate cadestral surveys and laid the basis for the geographical study of Bengal. At the end of the 18th century, probably as a result of the great Tista floods in 1787, the Brahmaputra changed its course and joined the Padma at Goulundo. No piece-meal study of an intricate river system is possible, without distortion and inadequacy.

Even though we assume that the change in the course of the main waters of the old Brahmaputra took place suddenly in 1787, the year of the famous flooding of the Teesta river, the Teesta has been always a wandering river, sometimes joining the Ganges, sometimes being shifted oastwards by the superior strength of the river Ganges and forced to join the Brahmaputra at last.

Whatever might have been the cause, by 1830, the diversion of old Brahmaputra was complete, ushering in a gradual but radical change in the river system of the Tangail district. The old channel of the Brahmaputra had been reduced to its present insignificance.

In 1850 Sir Joseph Hooker wrote "we are surprised to hear that within the last 20 years the main channel of Brahmaputra had shifted its course westwards, its eastern channel silted up so rapidly that the Jamuna eventually became the principal stream.

In the [[geological timescale]], the '''Llandovery epoch''' (from 443.7 ± 1.5 million years ago to 428.2 ± 2.3 million years ago) occurred during the [[Silurian]] period. The epoch follows the massive [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events]]; the second largest extinction event after the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] million of years later.

The epoch was named after [[Llandovery]] in [[Wales]].

==Subdivisions==
The Llandovery epoch is subdivided into three stages: [[Rhuddanian]], [[Aeronian]] and [[Telychian]].

'''''Lone Star Dinosaurs''''' is a book written by [[Louis L. Jacobs]] and published in 1995. It concerns the history of [[dinosaur]]s in [[Texas]] and the people who found their remains. Most of the dinosaurs in the book are from the [[Cretaceous]] age and a few of the dinosaurs include ''[[Pleurocoelus]]'', ''[[Alamosaurus]]'', ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'', ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', and the [[pterosaur]] ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]''. The stories within the book were compiled directly from the people who found the fossils.

==Critical reception==
Judyth Rigler of the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' called it a "visually stunning novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Takeoff trivia includes dinos |author=Judyth Rigler |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&amp;p_theme=saec&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAFE77DF523249F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |newspaper=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |date=October 22, 1995 |accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1179">'''Material flow management''' ('''MFM''') is a method of efficiently managing materials.

''Material flow management is the goal oriented, efficient use of materials, material streams and energy. The goals are given by ecological and economical areas and by observing social aspects.'' (in "Protection of human beings and environment", by an Enquete Commission of the German Bundestag)

This triple jump of environmental, social and economical orientation makes MFM a tool of high importance in the field of [[Sustainable development|sustainable development (SD)]] and [[circular economy]] (CE). 
Seen historically, material flow management is a relatively new tool that can be understood as an implementation-orientated advancement of the methodology of [[Material flow analysis|material flow analysis (MFA)]]. MFM was established as a policy tool after the UN conference in [[Rio de Janeiro]] 1992. The German "Bundestag" outlined the targets and specific goals of MFM in a special report by an Enquete Commission.

'''MOPS''' (short for the '''Mean of Platts Singapore''') is the [[average]] of a set of Singapore-based oil product price assessments published by [[Platts]], a global energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture information provider and a division of [[McGraw Hill Financial]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.platts.com/IM.Platts.Content/MethodologyReferences/MethodologySpecs/Asia-refined-oil-products-methodology.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Platts assessment process determines the value of physical commodities 15–30 days forward for many oil products loading in Singapore.

MOPS is an acronym that stands for the Mean of Platts Singapore, and typically refers to any contract mechanism that derives its value by referencing the average of a set of Singapore-based oil price assessments published by Platts. The time frame can be over a week, a month, or any agreed period of time.

This is a visualization of the motion estimation performed in order to compress an MPEG movie.]]'''Motion estimation''' is the process of determining [[motion vector]]s that describe the transformation from one 2D image to another; usually from adjacent [[video frame|frames]] in a video sequence. It is an [[well-posed problem|ill-posed problem]] as the motion is in three dimensions but the images are a projection of the 3D scene onto a 2D plane. The motion vectors may relate to the whole image (global motion estimation) or specific parts, such as rectangular blocks, arbitrary shaped patches or even per [[pixel]]. The motion vectors may be represented by a translational model or many other models that can approximate the motion of a real video camera, such as rotation and translation in all three dimensions and zoom.

==Related terms==
More often than not, the term motion estimation and the term [[optical flow]] are used interchangeably. It is also related in concept to [[image registration]] and stereo correspondence. In fact all of these terms refer to the process of finding corresponding points between two images or video frames. The points that correspond to each other in two views (images or frames) of a real scene or object are "usually" the same point in that scene or on that object. Before we do motion estimation, we must define our measurement of correspondence, i.e., the matching metric, which is a measurement of how similar two image points are. There is no right or wrong here; the choice of matching metric is usually related to what the final estimated motion is used for as well as the optimisation strategy in the estimation process.

==Algorithms==
The methods for finding motion vectors can be categorised into pixel based methods ("direct") and feature based methods ("indirect"). A famous debate resulted in two papers from the opposing factions being produced to try to establish a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Philip H.S. Torr and Andrew Zisserman: [http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/papers/torr00a.ps.gz Feature Based Methods for Structure and Motion Estimation], ICCV Workshop on Vision Algorithms, pages 278-294, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michal Irani and P. Anandan: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3d18/95f35202c2f421491df10105ff83c851ebd1.pdf About Direct Methods], ICCV Workshop on Vision Algorithms, pages 267-277, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct methods===
* [[Block-matching algorithm]]
* [[Phase correlation]] and frequency domain methods
* Pixel recursive algorithms
* [[Optical flow]]

===Indirect methods===
''Indirect methods'' use features, such as [[corner detection]], and match corresponding features between frames, usually with a statistical function applied over a local or global area. The purpose of the statistical function is to remove matches that do not correspond to the actual motion.

Statistical functions that have been successfully used include [[RANSAC]].

===Additional note on the categorization===
It can be argued that almost all methods require some kind of definition of the matching criteria. The difference is only whether you summarise over a local image region first and then compare the summarisation (such as feature based methods),  or you compare each pixel first (such as squaring the difference) and then summarise over a local image region (block base motion and filter based motion). An emerging type of matching criteria summarises a local image region first for every pixel location (through some feature transform such as Laplacian transform), compares each summarised pixel and summarises over a local image region again.&lt;ref&gt;Rui Xu, David Taubman &amp; Aous Thabit Naman, 'Motion Estimation Based on Mutual Information and Adaptive Multi-scale Thresholding', in Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on , vol.25, no.3, pp.1095-1108, March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Some matching criteria has the ability to exclude points that does not actually correspond to each other albeit producing a good matching score, others does not have this ability, but they are still matching criteria.

==Applications==

===Video coding===

Applying the motion vectors to an image to synthesize the transformation to the next image is called [[motion compensation]]. As a way of exploiting temporal redundancy, motion estimation and compensation are key parts of [[video compression]]. Almost all video coding standards use block-based motion estimation and compensation such as the [[MPEG]] series including the most recent [[HEVC]].

'''''Path of the Puma: The Remarkable Resilience of the Mountain Lion''''', by Jim Williams, is a non-fiction book presenting the research of the author, a [[wildlife biologist]] and supervisor for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks' Region 1 in [[Kalispell, Montana|Kalispell]]. Williams also discusses [[DNA]] research conducted by others on these animals, and makes the case for coexistence with these big, wild cats

== Synopsis ==
[[File:Jim WIlliams author photo.jpg|thumb|left|Author Jim Williams]]
With a foreword by [[Douglas H. Chadwick|Doug Chadwick]], the book chronicles Williams' journey, from his early work at a Florida marine park, to his conversion to "a lifelong devotee of the species".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Williams has fitted [[Puma (genus)|pumas]] (also known as cougars and mountain lions) with [[Tracking collar|radio collars]] and has installed cameras in their caves to track and study them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/reviews/single/9781938340727|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Path of the Puma: The Remarkable Resilience of the Mountain Lion|last=|first=|date=6 August 2018|work=Publishers Weekly|access-date=2 September 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1 September 2018|title=Path of the Puma: the Remarkable Resilience of the Mountain Lion|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jim-williams/path-of-the-puma/|journal=Kirkus Reviews|volume=|pages=|isbn=978-1-938340-72-7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly|''Publishers Weekly'']] wrote, "Montana-based wildlife biologist Jim Williams celebrates wildlife research and conservation of ghost cats from Canada’s [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] to [[Tierra del Fuego]] in Argentina and Chile..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Critical reception ==

''Path of the Puma'' has received positive reviews. ''Publishers Weekly'' said, "Williams writes movingly of the challenges these animals face, many due to human encroachment on their habitats. He makes a strong case for the necessity of preserving—or at least peacefully coexisting with—the puma."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Kirkus Reviews|''Kirkus Reviews'']] noted, "While the book is an undisguised conservationist’s plea ... it is not a harangue. The author’s passion and his firsthand knowledge of his subject make the narrative highly readable. A noteworthy feature of this work is the presence of numerous full-color photographs..."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kirkus concluded, "A handsome book that is well-balanced, instructive, and authoritative."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Natural History Book Service wrote that the puma's story, "...is fascinating for the lessons it can afford the protection of all species in times of dire challenge and decline."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhbs.com/path-of-the-puma-book|title=Path of the Puma: The Remarkable Resilience of the Mountain Lion|website=www.nhbs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Waggoner of [[PressReader]] notes Williams' "...enthusiasm for nature and animals jumps off every page... Williams’s writing is expert, friendly, and interesting. Well organized and clearly presented, information emerges from field work examples, such as the tracking studies that showed that pumas feed almost exclusively on wild prey rather than domestic herds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/foreword-reviews/20180814/282746292607191|title=Path of the Puma|last=Waggoner|first=Susan|date=14 August 2018|website=www.pressreader.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tristan Scott of the Flathead Beacon wrote, "''Path of the Puma'' doesn’t sugarcoat the risks of predators living among humans — mountain lions live at the intersection of human landscapes, livelihoods and lifestyles — but it points out the critical role predatory species play in the natural world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://flatheadbeacon.com/2018/08/31/pursuing-the-puma/|title=Pursuing the Puma - Flathead Beacon|last=Scott|first=Tristan|date=31 August 2018|work=Flathead Beacon|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petrocaribe''' is an oil alliance of many [[Caribbean]] states with [[Venezuela]] to purchase [[oil]] on conditions of preferential payment. The alliance was launched on 29 June 2005 in [[Puerto La Cruz]], Venezuela. In 2013 Petrocaribe agreed links with the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]] (ALBA), to go beyond oil and promote economic cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 6 April 2013, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/9087 Petrocaribe Meets in Venezuela, Links With ALBA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty details==
The agreement was initiated with the aim of having solidarity with other countries in accordance with [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]]. The payment system allows for purchase of oil at [[market value]] for 5%-50% up front with a grace period of one to two years; the remainder can be paid through a 17-25 year financing agreement with 1% interest if oil prices are above US$40 per barrel. The agreement builds on payment terms from the [[San Jose Agreement]] and the [[Caracas Energy Accord]].&lt;ref name="details"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.pdvsa.com/index.php?tpl=interface.sp/design/readmenuprinc.tpl.html&amp;newsid_obj_id=174&amp;newsid_temas=48&amp;prev=/search?q=PDVSA+PetroCaribe&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=G|title=Google Translate|website=Translate.google.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy and Petroleum Minister and President of PDVSA [[Rafael Ramírez (Venezuela)|Rafael Ramírez]] said of the deal that it seeks to cut out the [[reseller|middleman]] in such transactions: "We're not talking about discounts...We're talking about financial facilities, direct deliveries of products, [and] infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/articles.php?artno=1660|title=PetroCaribe: Chávez’s Venturesome Solution to the Caribbean Oil Crisis|date=31 January 2006|website=Venezuelananalysis.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
{{Supranational American Bodies|size=400px|align=right}}
There are a total of 17 members; 12 of the members are from the 15 member [[CARICOM]] (excluding, [[Barbados]], [[Montserrat]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]). At the first summit, 14 countries joined the alliance. These were: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Belize]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Grenada]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[St Lucia]], [[St Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Suriname]] and [[Venezuela]]. At the third summit, [[Haití]] and [[Nicaragua]] joined the union.&lt;ref name="details"/&gt; [[Guatemala]] joined in July 2008 but left the organization in November 2013 stating that Venezuela had not provided them with the ultra-low financing rates that they had been promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/02/venezuela-economic-crisis_n_4373021.html?ref=topbar |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210134350/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/02/venezuela-economic-crisis_n_4373021.html?ref=topbar |archive-date=2013-12-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haiti had not been initially invited to the talks, since Venezuela did not recognize its then post-[[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] government. The country finally joined the alliance in April 2006, once the [[Haitian presidential election, 2006|newly elected president]] [[René Préval]] took office.  [[Honduras]] became the 17th member of the alliance in December 2007, under President [[Manuel Zelaya]] but left the organization after the 2009 coup d'état and later rejoined it on May 2012.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platts.com/Oil/News/6677473.xml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604013703/http://www.platts.com/Oil/News/6677473.xml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 June 2011|title=Oil Industry Professionals, Trading, Risk Management &amp; Treasury, Settlement &amp; Compliance - Platts|date=4 June 2011|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belize set up the [[Belize Petroleum Energy Company]] to coordinate for the project.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

Barbados denied that it had succumbed to pressure from the United States, who had a [[United States-Venezuela relations|strained relationship with Venezuela]], as the reason, but has not ruled out agreeing to Petrocaribe in the future. On August 31, 2005, Energy Minister Anthony Wood said that they are weighing options over signing Petrocaribe.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2005/08/050831_baroil.shtml|title=BBCCaribbean.com - News - Barbados will not sign Petrocaribe|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 Hugo Chávez renewed his offer for Barbados to join PetroCaribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/chavez-wants-barbados-to-sign-petrocaribe/|title=Chavez wants Barbados to sign PetroCaribe|website=Nationnews.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Westbrook Nebula.tif|thumb|right|250px|The [[Westbrook Nebula]], a protoplanetary nebula.]]

A '''protoplanetary nebula''' or '''preplanetary nebula''' {{Harv|Sahai|Sánchez Contreras|Morris|2005}} (PPN) is an [[astronomical object]] which is at the short-lived episode during a [[star]]'s rapid [[stellar evolution|evolution]] between the late [[asymptotic giant branch]] (LAGB){{Ref_label|A|a|none}} phase and the subsequent [[planetary nebula]] (PN) phase.  A PPN emits strongly in [[infrared]] radiation, and is a kind of [[reflection nebula]].  It is the second-from-the-last high-luminosity evolution phase in the life cycle of intermediate-mass stars (1–8 {{Solar mass|link=y}}). {{Harv|Kastner|2005}}

==Naming==
[[File:IRAS 13208-6020.tif|thumb|Protoplanetary nebula [[IRAS 13208-6020]] is formed from material that is shed by a central star.]]

The name '''protoplanetary nebula''' is an unfortunate choice due to the possibility of confusion with the same term being sometimes employed when discussing the unrelated concept of [[protoplanetary disk]]s.  The name '''protoplanetary nebula''' is a consequence of the older term '''planetary nebula''', which was chosen due to early astronomers looking through telescopes and finding a similarity in appearance of planetary nebula to the gas giants such as [[Neptune]] and [[Uranus]].  To avoid any possible confusion, {{Harvnb|Sahai|Sánchez Contreras|Morris|2005}} suggests employing a new term '''preplanetary nebula''' which does not overlap with any other disciplines of astronomy.  They are often referred to as post-AGB stars, although that category also includes stars that will never ionize their ejected matter.

==Evolution==

===Beginning===
During the late [[asymptotic giant branch]] (LAGB){{Ref_label|A|a|none}} phase, when mass loss reduces the hydrogen envelope's mass to around 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass|link=y}} for a core mass of 0.60&amp;nbsp;{{Solar mass}}, a star will begin to evolve towards the blue side of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]].  When the hydrogen envelope has been further reduced to around 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; {{Solar mass}}, the envelope will have been so disrupted that it is believed further significant mass loss is not possible. At this point, the [[effective temperature]] of the star, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, will be around 5,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]] and it is defined to be the end of the LAGB and the beginning of the PPN. {{Harv|Davis|Smith|Gledhill|Varricatt|2005}}

===Protoplanetary nebula phase===

[[File:IRAS 20068+4051.jpg|thumb|Protoplanetary nebula known as [[IRAS 20068+4051]] taken by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble's]] Advanced Camera for Surveys.]]

During the ensuing protoplanetary nebula phase, the central star's [[effective temperature]] will continue rising as a result of the envelope's mass loss as a consequence of the hydrogen shell's burning.  During this phase, the central star is still too cool to ionize the slow-moving circumstellar shell ejected during the preceding AGB phase.  However, the star does appear to drive high-velocity, collimated [[stellar wind|winds]] which shape and shock this shell, and almost certainly entrain slow-moving AGB ejecta to produce a fast molecular wind.  Observations and high-resolution imaging studies from 1998 to 2001, demonstrate that the rapidly evolving PPN phase ultimately shapes the morphology of the subsequent PN.  At a point during or soon after the AGB envelope detachment, the envelope shape changes from roughly spherically symmetric to axially symmetric.  The resultant morphologies are [[bipolar nebula|bipolar]], knotty jets and [[Herbig–Haro object|Herbig–Haro]]-like "bow shocks".  These shapes appear even in relatively "young" PPN. {{Harv|Davis|Smith|Gledhill|Varricatt|2005}}

===End===
The PPN phase continues until the central star reaches around 30,000&amp;nbsp;K and it is hot enough (producing enough [[ultraviolet]] radiation) to ionize the circumstellar nebula (ejected gases) and it becomes a kind of [[emission nebula]] called a PN.  This transition must take place in less than around 10,000 years or else the density of the [[circumstellar envelope]] will fall below the PN formulation density threshold of around 100 per cm³ and no PN will result, such a case is sometimes referred to as a 'lazy planetary nebula'. {{Harv|Volk|Kwok|1989}}

In 2001, Bujarrabal et al. found that the "interacting [[stellar wind]]s" model of Kwok
et al. (1978) of radiatively-driven winds is insufficient to account for their CO observations of PPN fast winds which imply high momentum and energy inconsistent with that model.  This has prompted theorists (Soker &amp; Rappaport 2000; Frank &amp; Blackmann 2004) to investigate whether an [[accretion disk]] scenario, similar to the model used to explain jets from [[active galactic nuclei]] and [[star formation|young star]]s, could account for both the point symmetry and the high degree of collimation seen in many PPN jets.  In such a model, the accretion disk forms through binary interactions.  [[Magneto-centrifugal]] launching from the disk surface is then a way to convert gravitational energy into the kinetic energy of a fast wind.  If this model is correct and [[magneto-hydrodynamics]] (MHD) do determine the energetics and collimation of PPN outflows, then they will also determine physics of the shocks in these flows, and this can be confirmed with high-resolution pictures of the emission regions that go with the shocks. {{Harv|Davis|Smith|Gledhill|Varricatt|2005}}

{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}
'''SOSUS''', an acronym for '''sound surveillance system''', is a chain of underwater listening posts located around the world in places such as the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]—the [[GIUK gap]]—and at various locations in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[United States Navy]]'s initial intent for the system was for tracking [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]] submarines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Di Mento|first1=John Mark|chapter=Environmental Challenges to Post-Cold War Naval Operations: The Browning of the Blue Water Battlespace|title=Beyond the Water's Edge: United States National Security &amp; the Ocean Environment|publisher=[[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], [[Tufts University]]|date=December 2006|degree=Ph.D.|location=Medford, MA|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/304741876|id=Document No. 3262885|pages=255-256|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had to pass through the gap to attack targets further west. It was later supplemented by mobile assets such as the [[Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System]] (SURTASS), and became part of the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS).

==History==
SOSUS history began in 1949 when the US Navy formed the Committee for Undersea Warfare to research [[anti-submarine warfare]]. The panel allocated US$10 million annually to develop systems to counter the Soviet submarine threat consisting primarily of a large fleet of diesel submarines. They decided on a system to monitor low-frequency sound in the [[SOFAR channel]] using multiple listening sites equipped with [[Hydrophone|hydrophones]] and a processing facility that could detect submarine positions by [[triangulation]]{{Dubious|date=July 2015}} over hundreds of miles.

===Research===
At [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1950, the committee sponsored ''Project Hartwell'', named for the Hartwell Farms restaurant in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], where some of the initial steps were planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldstein|first1=Jack S|title=A different sort of time: the life of Jerrold R. Zacharias, scientist, engineer, educator|date=1992|publisher=MIT Press|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1015073870|language=English|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, they selected [[Western Electric]] to build a demonstration system, and the first six-element hydrophone array was installed on the island of [[Eleuthera]] in the [[Bahamas]]. Meanwhile, ''Project Jezebel'' at [[Bell Labs]] and ''Project Michael'' at [[Columbia University]] focused on studying long range [[Underwater acoustics|acoustics in the ocean]].

By 1952, enough progress resulted in top secret plans to deploy six arrays in the North Atlantic basin, and the classified name SOSUS was used. The number of arrays was increased to nine later in the year, and [[Royal Navy]] and US Navy ships, including [[USNS Neptune (ARC-2)|USS ''Neptune'']] and [[USS Peregrine (AM-373)|USS ''Peregrine'']], started laying the cabling under the cover of ''Project Caesar''. In 1953, Jezebel's research had developed an additional high-frequency system for direct plotting of ships passing over the stations, intended to be installed in narrows and straits, called ''Project Colossus''.

===Operations===
{{One source|section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:1st-SOUSE-sensors.png|thumb|240px|First SOSUS sensors]]
SOSUS systems consisted of bottom-mounted [[hydrophone]] arrays connected by underwater cables to facilities ashore. The individual arrays were installed primarily on [[Continental slope|continental slopes]] and [[Seamount|seamounts]] at locations optimized for undistorted long range acoustic propagation. The combination of location within the ocean and the sensitivity of arrays allowed the system to detect acoustic power of less than a single [[watt]] at ranges of several hundred kilometres. SOSUS monitoring stations went by the acronym NAVFAC, (Naval Facility; e.g., [http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/cus/Pages/NAVFAC_Adak.aspx NAVFAC Adak]; not to be confused with the [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] which uses the same acronym). 

When the {{USS|Thresher|SSN-593}} sank in 1963, SOSUS helped determine its location. In 1968, the first detections of [[Victor class submarine|Victor]] and [[Charlie class submarine|Charlie]] class Soviet submarines were made, while in 1974 the first [[Delta class submarine]] was observed. In 1968, SOSUS played a key role in locating the wreckage of a US [[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear Attack]] submarine, the {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589}}, lost near [[the Azores]] in May. Moreover, SOSUS data from March 1968 facilitated the discovery, and clandestine retrieval six years later, of parts of a Soviet [[GOLF II-class ballistic missile submarine]], the [[K-129]], that foundered that month north of [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedmil" /&gt;

Given its criticality to [[Cold War]] operations against the Soviet Navy's submarine fleet, SOSUS/IUSS remained highly classified from its inception and the purposes and activities of the various NAVFACs were not publicly acknowledged nor commonly known outside of the US Navy's submarine fleet, its [[cruiser]]/[[destroyer]]/[[frigate]] fleet, and its anti-submarine warfare aircraft forces until the end of the Cold War. In 1991, the system mission was declassified and in 1993 a program reporting whale detections was started. The Advanced Deployable System became operational as part of IUSS in 1996.

==Espionage==
In 1988, [[Stephen Joseph Ratkai]], a Hungarian-Canadian recruited by [[Soviet intelligence|Soviet Intelligence]], was arrested, charged and convicted in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]] for attempting to obtain information on the SOSUS site at [[Naval Station Argentia]]. [[John Anthony Walker]], a US Navy [[Warrant officer (United States)#Navy|Chief Warrant Officer]] and communications specialist, divulged SOSUS operational information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War which compromised its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keller|first1=Bill|title=Spy Case is Called Threat to Finding Soviet Submarines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/06/us/spy-case-is-called-threat-to-finding-soviet-submarines.html|work=The New York Times|date=1985|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, when the [[USS_Pueblo_(AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'']] was captured by [[North Korea]], it is believed the SOSUS system was compromised and all information obtained was given to the Soviet Union.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Post-Cold War==
SOSUS was gradually condensed into a smaller number of monitoring stations during the 1970s and 1980s. However, the SOSUS arrays themselves were based upon technology that could only be upgraded irregularly. With the ending of the [[Cold War]] in the 1990s, the immediate need for SOSUS decreased, and the focus of the US Navy also turned toward a system that was deployable on a theatre basis.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedmil"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_25/sosus2.htm |title=SOSUS The "Secret Weapon" of Undersea Surveillance |publisher=US Navy |date=Winter 2005 |work=Undersea Warfare |volume=7 |issue=2 |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219020221/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_25/sosus2.htm |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although officially declassified in 1991, by that time IUSS and SOSUS had long been an [[open secret]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedmil" /&gt;

'''Shale gouge ratio''' (typically abbreviated to '''SGR''') is a mathematical [[algorithm]] that aims to predict the fault rock types for simple [[fault (geology)|fault]] zones developed in [[sedimentary]] sequences dominated by [[sandstone]]s and [[shale]]s.

The parameter is widely used in the [[Oil exploration|oil and gas exploration]] and [[petroleum industry|production industries]] to enable quantitative predictions to be made regarding the hydrodynamic behavior of faults.  

==Definition==
At any point on a fault surface, the shale gouge ratio is equal to the net shale/[[clay]] content of the rocks that have slipped past that point.  

The SGR algorithm assumes complete mixing of the wall-rock components in any particular 'throw interval'.  The parameter is a measure of the 'upscaled' composition of the fault zone.

==Application to hydrocarbon exploration==
[[Oil exploration|Hydrocarbon exploration]] involves identifying and defining accumulations of [[hydrocarbon]]s that are trapped in subsurface structures.  These structures are often segmented by faults.  For a thorough trap evaluation, it is necessary to predict whether the fault is sealing or leaking to hydrocarbons and also to provide an estimate of how 'strong' the fault seal might be.  The 'strength' of a fault seal can be quantified in terms of subsurface pressure, arising from the [[buoyancy]] forces within the hydrocarbon column, that the fault can support before it starts to leak.  When acting on a fault zone this subsurface pressure is termed [[capillary threshold pressure]].

For faults developed in sandstone and shale sequences, the first order control on capillary threshold pressure is likely to be the composition, in particular the shale or clay content, of the fault-zone material.  SGR is used to estimate the shale content of the fault zone.

In general, fault zones with higher clay content, equivalent to higher SGR values, can support higher capillary threshold pressures.  On a broader scale, other factors also exert a control on the threshold pressure, such as depth of the rock sequence at the time of faulting, and the maximum burial depth.  As maximum burial depth exceeds 3&amp;nbsp;km, the effective strength of the fault seal will increase for all fault zone compositions.

[[File:Insulincrystals.jpg|thumb|300px|Single crystalline form of solid [[insulin]].]]
{{Continuum mechanics}}

'''Solid''' is one of the [[State of matter|four fundamental states of matter]] (the others being [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]). In solids molecules are closely packed. It is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to changes of shape or volume. Unlike  liquid, a solid object does not flow to take on the shape of its container, nor does it expand to fill the entire volume available to it like a gas does. The atoms in a solid are tightly bound to each other, either in a regular [[geometric lattice]] ([[crystal|crystalline solids]], which include metals and ordinary [[ice]]) or irregularly (an [[amorphous solid]] such as common window glass). Solids cannot be compressed with little pressure whereas gases can be compressed with little pressure because in gases molecules are loosely packed.

The branch of [[physics]] that deals with solids is called [[solid-state physics]], and is the main branch of [[condensed matter physics]] (which also includes liquids). [[Materials science]] is primarily concerned with the [[Physical property|physical]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of solids. [[Solid-state chemistry]] is especially concerned with the [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of novel materials, as well as the science of identification and [[chemical composition]].

== Microscopic description ==

[[File:Fcc lattice 4.jpg|thumb|Model of closely packed atoms within a crystalline solid.]]
The atoms, molecules or ions that make up solids may be arranged in an orderly repeating pattern, or irregularly. Materials whose constituents are arranged in a regular pattern are known as [[crystal]]s. In some cases, the regular ordering can continue unbroken over a large scale, for example diamonds, where each diamond is a [[single crystal]]. Solid objects that are large enough to see and handle are rarely composed of a single crystal, but instead are made of a large number of single crystals, known as [[crystallite]]s, whose size can vary from a few nanometers to several meters. Such materials are called [[polycrystal]]line. Almost all common metals, and many [[ceramic]]s, are polycrystalline.

}}
In other materials, there is no long-range order in the position of the atoms. These solids are known as [[amorphous solid]]s; examples include [[polystyrene]] and glass.

Whether a solid is crystalline or amorphous depends on the material involved, and the conditions in which it was formed. Solids that are formed by slow cooling will tend to be crystalline, while solids that are frozen rapidly are more likely to be amorphous. Likewise, the specific [[crystal structure]] adopted by a crystalline solid depends on the material involved and on how it was formed.

While many common objects, such as an ice cube or a coin, are chemically identical throughout, many other common materials comprise a number of different substances packed together. For example, a typical [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is an [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] of several different minerals and [[mineraloid]]s, with no specific chemical composition. Wood is a natural organic material consisting primarily of [[cellulose]] fibers embedded in a matrix of organic [[lignin]]. In materials science, [[Composite material|composites]] of more than one constituent material can be designed to have desired properties.

== Classes of solids ==
{{further|Bonding in solids}}

The forces between the atoms in a solid can take a variety of forms. For example, a crystal of [[sodium chloride]] (common salt) is made up of [[ion]]ic [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]], which are held together by [[ionic bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_uUlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=sodium+chloride+made+up+of+ionic+sodium+and+chlorine+ionically+bonded+together#v=onepage&amp;q=sodium%20chloride%20made%20up%20of%20ionic%20sodium%20and%20chlorine%20ionically%20bonded%20together&amp;f=false |title=GENERAL BIOLOGY I: Molecules, Cells and Genes |last=Holley |first=Dennis |date=2017-05-31 |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |isbn=9781457552748 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In diamond&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HI9qBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=in+diamond++atoms+share+electrons+forming+covalent+bonds#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20diamond%20%20atoms%20share%20electrons%20forming%20covalent%20bonds&amp;f=false |title=Nanotechnology: Understanding Small Systems, Third Edition |last=Rogers |first=Ben |last2=Adams |first2=Jesse |last3=Pennathur |first3=Sumita |date=2014-10-28 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9781482211726 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or silicon, the atoms share [[electron]]s and form [[covalent bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=on_SBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=in+silicon+atoms+share+electrons+forming+covalent+bonds#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20silicon%20atoms%20share%20electrons%20forming%20covalent%20bonds&amp;f=false |title=Accidental Injury: Biomechanics and Prevention |last=Nahum |first=Alan M. |last2=Melvin |first2=John W. |date=2013-03-09 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9781475722642 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In metals, electrons are shared in [[metallic bond]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oEvTt1ZFo_MC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=in+metal+electrons+shared+through+metallic+bonding#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20metal%20electrons%20shared%20through%20metallic%20bonding&amp;f=false |title=Materials Science |last=Narula |first=G.

The dissimilarities between the types of solid result from the differences between their bonding.

=== Metals ===

{{Main|Metal}}

[[File:Chrysler Building detail.jpg|thumb|right|The pinnacle of New York's [[Chrysler Building]], the world's tallest steel-supported brick building, is clad with stainless steel.]]

Metals typically are strong, dense, and good conductors of both [[Electrical conduction|electricity]] and [[Heat conduction|heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0ID973WaVBoC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=strong,+dense,+and+good+conductors+of+electricity+and+heat+metals#v=onepage&amp;q=strong,%20dense,%20and%20good%20conductors%20of%20electricity%20and%20heat%20metals&amp;f=false |title=Science Foundation |last=Arnold |first=Brian |date=2006-07-01 |publisher=Letts and Lonsdale |isbn=9781843156567 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NH23yrRwbU4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=strong,+dense,+and+good+conductors+of+both+electricity+and+heat+metals#v=onepage&amp;q=strong,%20dense,%20and%20good%20conductors%20of%20both%20electricity%20and%20heat%20metals&amp;f=false |title=The Facts on File Chemistry Handbook |last=Group |first=Diagram |date=2009-01-01 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |isbn=9781438109558 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- There are clearly exceptions to all of these statements (hence the word "typically"), but we don't need to go into them in an introductory article. --&gt;
The bulk of the elements in the [[periodic table]], those to the left of a diagonal line drawn from [[boron]] to [[polonium]], are metals.
Mixtures of two or more elements in which the major component is a metal are known as [[alloy]]s.

People have been using metals for a variety of purposes since prehistoric times.
The [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[:wikt:reliability|reliability]] of metals has led to their widespread use in construction of buildings and other structures, as well as in most vehicles, many appliances and tools, pipes, road signs and railroad tracks. Iron and aluminium are the two most commonly used structural metals, and they are also the most abundant metals in the [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]]. Iron is most commonly used in the form of an alloy, steel, which contains up to 2.1% [[carbon]], making it much harder than pure iron.

Because metals are good conductors of electricity, they are valuable in electrical appliances and for carrying an [[electric current]] over long distances with little energy loss or dissipation. Thus, electrical power grids rely on metal cables to distribute electricity. Home electrical systems, for example, are wired with copper for its good conducting properties and easy machinability. The high [[thermal conductivity]] of most metals also makes them useful for stovetop cooking utensils.

The study of metallic elements and their [[alloy]]s makes up a significant portion of the fields of solid-state chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering.

Metallic solids are held together by a high density of shared, delocalized electrons, known as "[[metallic bond]]ing". In a metal, atoms readily lose their outermost ("valence") [[electron]]s, forming positive [[ion]]s. The free electrons are spread over the entire solid, which is held together firmly by electrostatic interactions between the ions and the electron cloud.&lt;ref name="mortimer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mortimer, Charles E. |title=Chemistry: A Conceptual Approach |location=New York: |publisher=D. Van Nostrad Company |edition=3rd |date=1975 |isbn=0-442-25545-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large number of [[Free electron model|free electrons]] gives metals their high values of electrical and thermal conductivity. The free electrons also prevent transmission of visible light, making metals opaque, shiny and [[lustrous]].

More advanced models of metal properties consider the effect of the positive ions cores on the delocalised electrons. As most metals have crystalline structure, those ions are usually arranged into a periodic lattice. Mathematically, the potential of the ion cores can be treated by various models, the simplest being the [[nearly free electron model]].

=== Minerals ===

[[File:Different minerals.jpg|thumb|A collection of various minerals.]]

{{Main|Minerals}}

Minerals are naturally occurring solids formed through various geological processes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=j9guFwAQZjsC&amp;pg=PA666&amp;dq=Minerals+are+naturally+occurring+solids+formed+through+various+geological+processes+under+high+pressures.#v=onepage&amp;q=Minerals%20are%20naturally%20occurring%20solids%20formed%20through%20various%20geological%20processes%20under%20high%20pressures.&amp;f=false |title=Drilling in Extreme Environments: Penetration and Sampling on Earth and other Planets |last=Bar-Cohen |first=Yoseph |last2=Zacny |first2=Kris |date=2009-08-04 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9783527626632 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; under high pressures. To be classified as a true mineral, a substance must have a [[crystal structure]] with uniform physical properties throughout. Minerals range in composition from pure [[chemical element|elements]] and simple [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s to very complex [[silicate]]s with thousands of known forms. In contrast, a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] sample is a random aggregate of minerals and/or [[mineraloid]]s, and has no specific chemical composition. The vast majority of the rocks of the [[Earth's crust]] consist of quartz (crystalline SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), feldspar, mica, [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[kaolin]], calcite, [[epidote]], [[olivine]], [[augite]], [[hornblende]], [[magnetite]], [[hematite]], [[limonite]] and a few other minerals. Some minerals, like [[quartz]], [[mica]] or [[feldspar]] are common, while others have been found in only a few locations worldwide. The largest group of minerals by far is the [[Silicate minerals|silicates]] (most rocks are ≥95% silicates), which are composed largely of [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]], with the addition of ions of aluminium, [[magnesium]], iron, [[calcium]] and other metals.

=== Ceramics ===

[[File:Si3N4bearings.jpg|thumb|Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ceramic bearing parts]]

{{Main|Ceramic engineering}}

Ceramic solids are composed of inorganic compounds, usually [[oxide]]s of chemical elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://autocww.colorado.edu/~toldy3/E64ContentFiles/Construction/Ceramics.html |title=Ceramics |website=autocww.colorado.edu|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are chemically inert, and often are capable of withstanding chemical erosion that occurs in an acidic or caustic environment. Ceramics generally can withstand high temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1600&amp;nbsp;°C (1800 to 3000&amp;nbsp;°F). Exceptions include non-oxide inorganic materials, such as [[nitride]]s, [[boride]]s and [[carbide]]s.

Traditional ceramic raw materials include [[clay]] minerals such as [[kaolinite]], more recent materials include aluminium oxide ([[alumina]]). The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include [[silicon carbide]] and [[tungsten carbide]]. Both are valued for their abrasion resistance, and hence find use in such applications as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations.

Most ceramic materials, such as alumina and its compounds, are [[Ceramics processing|formed]] from fine powders, yielding a fine grained [[polycrystalline]] [[microstructure]] that is filled with [[light-scattering]] centers comparable to the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]]. Thus, they are generally opaque materials, as opposed to [[transparent materials]]. Recent nanoscale (e.g. [[sol-gel]]) technology has, however, made possible the production of polycrystalline [[transparent ceramics]] such as transparent alumina and alumina compounds for such applications as high-power lasers. Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical and electronics industries.

[[Ceramic engineering]] is the science and technology of creating solid-state ceramic materials, parts and devices. This is done either by the action of heat, or, at lower temperatures, using [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation reactions]] from chemical solutions. The term includes the purification of raw materials, the study and production of the chemical compounds concerned, their formation into components, and the study of their structure, composition and properties.

Mechanically speaking, ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression and weak in shearing and tension. [[Brittle]] materials may exhibit significant [[tensile strength]] by supporting a static load. [[Toughness]] indicates how much energy a material can absorb before mechanical failure, while [[fracture toughness]] (denoted K&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt; ) describes the ability of a material with inherent [[Crystallographic defect|microstructural flaws]] to resist fracture via crack growth and propagation. If a material has a large value of [[fracture toughness]], the basic principles of [[fracture mechanics]] suggest that it will most likely undergo ductile fracture. Brittle fracture is very characteristic of most [[Ceramic Engineering|ceramic]] and [[glass-ceramic]] materials that typically exhibit low (and inconsistent) values of K&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt;.

For an example of applications of ceramics, the extreme hardness of [[Zirconium dioxide|zirconia]] is utilized in the manufacture of knife blades, as well as other industrial cutting tools. Ceramics such as [[alumina]], [[boron carbide]] and [[silicon carbide]] have been used in [[bulletproof vest]]s to repel large-caliber rifle fire. [[Silicon nitride]] parts are used in ceramic ball bearings, where their high hardness makes them wear resistant. In general, ceramics are also chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would be susceptible to oxidation (or rust).

As another example of ceramic applications, in the early 1980s, [[Toyota]] researched production of an [[adiabatic]] ceramic engine with an [[operating temperature]] of over 6000&amp;nbsp;°F (3300&amp;nbsp;°C). Ceramic engines do not require a cooling system and hence allow a major weight reduction and therefore greater fuel efficiency. In a conventional metallic engine, much of the energy released from the fuel must be dissipated as [[waste heat]] in order to prevent a meltdown of the metallic parts. Work is also being done in developing ceramic parts for [[gas turbine]] [[heat engine|engines]]. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel. Such engines are not in production, however, because the manufacturing of ceramic parts in the sufficient precision and durability is difficult and costly. Processing methods often result in a wide distribution of microscopic flaws that frequently play a detrimental role in the sintering process, resulting in the proliferation of cracks, and ultimate mechanical failure.

===Glass ceramics===
{{Main|Glass-ceramic}}
[[File:Glass ceramic cooktop.jpg|thumb|A high strength glass-ceramic cooktop with negligible [[thermal expansion]].]]

Glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both non-crystalline glasses and [[crystalline]] [[ceramic materials|ceramics]]. They are formed as a glass, and then partially crystallized by heat treatment, producing both [[amorphous]] and [[crystalline]] phases so that crystalline grains are embedded within a non-crystalline intergranular phase.

Glass-ceramics are used to make cookware (originally known by the brand name [[CorningWare]]) and stovetops that have both high resistance to [[thermal shock]] and extremely low [[permeability (fluid)|permeability]] to liquids. The negative [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive coefficient of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net coefficient of thermal expansion close to zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.

Glass ceramics may also occur naturally when [[lightning]] strikes the crystalline (e.g. quartz) grains found in most beach [[sand]]. In this case, the extreme and immediate heat of the lightning (~2500&amp;nbsp;°C) creates hollow, branching rootlike structures called [[fulgurite]] via [[melting|fusion]].

=== Organic solids ===

{{Main|Organic chemistry}}

[[File:PaperAutofluorescence.jpg|thumb|250px|The individual wood pulp fibers in this sample are around 10 [[micrometre|µm]] in diameter.]]

Organic chemistry studies the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation by synthesis (or other means) of chemical compounds of [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]], which may contain any number of other elements such as [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]] and the halogens: [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]] and [[iodine]]. Some organic compounds may also contain the elements [[phosphorus]] or [[sulfur]]. Examples of organic solids include wood, [[paraffin wax]], [[naphthalene]] and a wide variety of [[polymer]]s and [[plastic]]s.

==== Wood ====

{{Main|Wood}}

Wood is a natural organic material consisting primarily of [[cellulose]] fibers embedded in a matrix of [[lignin]]. Regarding mechanical properties, the fibers are strong in tension, and the lignin matrix resists compression. Thus wood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters and using boats. Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as ''[[lumber]]'' or ''timber''. In construction, wood is not only a structural material, but is also used to form the mould for concrete.

Wood-based materials are also extensively used for packaging (e.g. cardboard) and paper, which are both created from the refined pulp. The chemical pulping processes use a combination of high temperature and alkaline (kraft) or acidic (sulfite) chemicals to break the chemical bonds of the lignin before burning it out.

==== Polymers ====

[[File:Selfassembly Organic Semiconductor Trixler LMU.jpg|thumb|STM image of self-assembled [[supramolecular]] chains of the organic semiconductor [[quinacridone]] on [[graphite]].]]

{{Main|Polymer}}

One important property of carbon in organic chemistry is that it can form certain compounds, the individual molecules of which are capable of attaching themselves to one another, thereby forming a chain or a network. The process is called polymerization and the chains or networks polymers, while the source compound is a monomer. Two main groups of polymers exist: those artificially manufactured are referred to as industrial polymers or synthetic polymers (plastics) and those naturally occurring as biopolymers.

Monomers can have various chemical substituents, or functional groups, which can affect the chemical properties of organic compounds, such as solubility and chemical reactivity, as well as the physical properties, such as hardness, density, mechanical or tensile strength, abrasion resistance, heat resistance, transparency, color, etc.. In proteins, these differences give the polymer the ability to adopt a biologically active conformation in preference to others (see [[self-assembly]]).

[[File:Plastic household items.jpg|thumb|250px|Household items made of various kinds of plastic.]]

People have been using natural organic polymers for centuries in the form of waxes and [[shellac]], which is classified as a thermoplastic polymer. A plant polymer named [[cellulose]] provided the tensile strength for natural fibers and ropes, and by the early 19th century natural rubber was in widespread use. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics. Plastics are the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Polymers that have been around, and that are in current widespread use, include carbon-based [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polystyrene]], nylons, [[polyester]]s, [[Acrylic resin|acrylics]], [[polyurethane]], and [[polycarbonate]]s, and silicon-based [[silicone]]s. Plastics are generally classified as "commodity", "specialty" and "engineering" plastics.

===Composite materials===
[[File:Stsheat.jpg|thumb|250px|Simulation of the outside of the [[Space Shuttle]] as it heats up to over 1500 °C during re-entry]]
[[File:Kohlenstofffasermatte.jpg|thumb|250px|A cloth of woven [[carbon fiber]] [[Fiber|filament]]s, a common element in [[composite material]]s]]
{{Main|Composite material}}

[[Composite material]]s contain two or more macroscopic phases, one of which is often ceramic. For example, a continuous matrix, and a dispersed phase of ceramic particles or fibers.

Applications of composite materials range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermally insulative tiles that play a key and integral role in NASA's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]], which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is [[Reinforced Carbon-Carbon]] (RCC), the light gray material that withstands reentry temperatures up to 1510&amp;nbsp;°C (2750&amp;nbsp;°F) and protects the nose cap and leading edges of Space Shuttle's wings. RCC is a [[laminated]] composite material made from [[graphite]] [[rayon]] cloth and impregnated with a [[phenolic resin]]. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with [[furfural]] alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured/pyrolized to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. In order to provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to silicon carbide.

Domestic examples of composites can be seen in the "plastic" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a composite made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) in which [[calcium carbonate]] chalk, [[talc]], glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for strength, bulk, or electro-static dispersion. These additions may be referred to as reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.

Thus, the matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative positions. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. A synergism produces material properties unavailable from the individual constituent materials, while the wide variety of matrix and strengthening materials provides the designer with the choice of an optimum combination.

===Semiconductors===
[[File:Siliconchip by shapeshifter.png|thumb|Semiconductor chip on crystalline silicon substrate.]]
{{Main|Semiconductors}}
[[Semiconductor]]s are materials that have an electrical resistivity (and conductivity) between that of metallic conductors and non-metallic insulators. They can be found in the [[periodic table]] moving diagonally downward right from [[boron]]. They separate the electrical conductors (or metals, to the left) from the insulators (to the right).

Devices made from semiconductor materials are the foundation of modern electronics, including radio, computers, telephones, etc. Semiconductor devices include the [[transistor]], [[solar cell]]s, [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s. Solar photovoltaic panels are large semiconductor devices that directly convert light into electrical energy.

In a metallic conductor, current is carried by the flow of electrons", but in semiconductors, current can be carried either by electrons or by the positively charged "[[electron hole|holes]]" in the [[electronic band structure]] of the material. Common semiconductor materials include silicon, [[germanium]] and [[gallium arsenide]].

Many traditional solids exhibit different properties when they shrink to nanometer sizes. For example, [[nanoparticle]]s of usually yellow gold and gray silicon are red in color; gold nanoparticles melt at much lower temperatures (~300&amp;nbsp;°C for 2.5&amp;nbsp;nm size) than the gold slabs (1064&amp;nbsp;°C);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Buffat |first1=Ph. |last2=Borel |first2=J.-P. |title=Size effect on the melting temperature of gold particles |journal=Physical Review A |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=2287 |date=1976 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.13.2287 |bibcode=1976PhRvA..13.2287B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and metallic nanowires are much stronger than the corresponding bulk metals.&lt;ref name=pure&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-Ll6qjWB-RUC&amp;pg=PA164 |pages=164–167 |title=Handbook of materials and techniques for vacuum devices |author=Walter H.

For example, platinum metals may provide improvements as automotive fuel [[Catalysis|catalysts]], as well as [[proton exchange membrane]] (PEM) fuel cells. Also, ceramic oxides (or cermets) of [[lanthanum]], [[cerium]], manganese and nickel are now being developed as [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s (SOFC). Lithium, [[Lithium–titanate battery|lithium–titanate]] and tantalum nanoparticles are being applied in lithium ion batteries. Silicon nanoparticles have been shown to dramatically expand the storage capacity of lithium ion batteries during the expansion/contraction cycle. Silicon nanowires cycle without significant degradation and present the potential for use in batteries with greatly expanded storage times. Silicon nanoparticles are also being used in new forms of solar energy cells. Thin film deposition of silicon [[quantum dot]]s on the polycrystalline silicon substrate of a photovoltaic (solar) cell increases voltage output as much as 60% by fluorescing the incoming light prior to capture. Here again, surface area of the nanoparticles (and thin films) plays a critical role in maximizing the amount of absorbed radiation.

Many natural (or biological) materials are complex composites with remarkable mechanical properties. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring materials scientists in the design of novel materials. Their defining characteristics include structural hierarchy, multifunctionality and self-healing capability. Self-organization is also a fundamental feature of many biological materials and the manner by which the structures are assembled from the molecular level up. Thus, [[self-assembly]] is emerging as a new strategy in the chemical synthesis of high performance biomaterials.

==Physical properties==
Physical properties of elements and compounds that provide conclusive evidence of chemical composition include odor, color, volume, density (mass per unit volume), melting point, boiling point, heat capacity, physical form and shape at room temperature (solid, liquid or gas; cubic, trigonal crystals, etc.), hardness, porosity, index of refraction and many others. This section discusses some physical properties of materials in the solid state.

===Mechanical===

[[File:Torres del Paine, Patagonia (2004).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Granite]] rock formation in the Chilean [[Patagonia]]. Like most [[inorganic]] minerals formed by oxidation in the Earth's atmosphere, granite consists primarily of [[crystalline]] [[silica]] SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[alumina]] Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

The mechanical properties of materials describe characteristics such as their [[Strength of materials|strength]] and resistance to deformation. For example, steel beams are used in construction because of their high strength, meaning that they neither break nor bend significantly under the applied load.

Mechanical properties include [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[tensile strength]], [[compressive strength]], [[shear strength]], [[fracture toughness]], [[ductility]] (low in brittle materials), and [[indentation hardness]].  [[Solid mechanics]] is the study of the behavior of solid matter under external actions such as external forces and temperature changes.

A solid does not exhibit macroscopic flow, as fluids do. Any degree of departure from its original shape is called [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]. The proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] is sufficiently low, almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress ([[Hooke's law]]). The coefficient of the proportion is called the [[modulus of elasticity]] or [[Young's modulus]]. This region of deformation is known as the [[Linear elasticity|linearly elastic]] region. Three models can describe how a solid responds to an applied stress:
*[[Elasticity (physics)|Elasticity]] – When an applied stress is removed, the material returns to its undeformed state.
*[[Viscoelasticity]] – These are materials that behave elastically, but also have [[friction|damping]]. When the applied stress is removed, work has to be done against the damping effects and is converted to heat within the material. This results in a [[hysteresis loop]] in the stress–strain curve. This implies that the mechanical response has a time-dependence.
*[[Plasticity (physics)|Plasticity]] – Materials that behave elastically generally do so when the applied stress is less than a yield value. When the stress is greater than the yield stress, the material behaves plastically and does not return to its previous state. That is, irreversible plastic deformation (or viscous flow) occurs after yield that is permanent.

Many materials become weaker at high temperatures.  Materials that retain their strength at high temperatures, called [[Refractory|refractory materials]], are useful for many purposes. For example, [[glass-ceramic]]s have become extremely useful for countertop cooking, as they exhibit excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.
In the aerospace industry, high performance materials used in the design of aircraft and/or spacecraft exteriors must have a high resistance to thermal shock. Thus, synthetic fibers spun out of organic polymers and polymer/ceramic/metal composite materials and fiber-reinforced polymers are now being designed with this purpose in mind.

=== Thermal ===

[[File:1D normal modes (280 kB).gif|thumb|250px|[[Normal modes]] of [[molecular vibration|atomic vibration]] in a [[crystalline]] solid.]]

Because solids have [[thermal energy]], their atoms vibrate about fixed mean positions within the ordered (or disordered) lattice. The spectrum of lattice vibrations in a crystalline or glassy network provides the foundation for the [[kinetic theory of solids]]. This motion occurs at the atomic level, and thus cannot be observed or detected without highly specialized equipment, such as that used in [[spectroscopy]].

Thermal properties of solids include [[thermal conductivity]], which is the property of a material that indicates its ability to [[Conduction (heat)|conduct heat]]. Solids also have a [[specific heat capacity]], which is the capacity of a material to store energy in the form of heat (or thermal lattice vibrations).

=== Electrical ===

[[File:Flyingsuperconductor.ogg|thumb|250px|Video of superconducting levitation of [[YBCO]]]]

Electrical properties include [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], resistance, [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and [[capacitance]]. Electrical conductors such as metals and alloys are contrasted with electrical insulators such as glasses and ceramics. [[Semiconductors]] behave somewhere in between. Whereas conductivity in metals is caused by electrons, both electrons and holes contribute to current in semiconductors. Alternatively, ions support electric current in [[Fast ion conductor|ionic conductors]].

Many materials also exhibit [[superconductivity]] at low temperatures; they include metallic elements such as tin and aluminium, various metallic alloys, some heavily doped semiconductors, and certain ceramics. The electrical resistivity of most electrical (metallic) conductors generally decreases gradually as the temperature is lowered, but remains finite. In a superconductor, however, the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. An electric current flowing in a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.

A [[dielectric]], or electrical insulator, is a substance that is highly resistant to the flow of electric current. A dielectric, such as plastic, tends to concentrate an applied electric field within itself, which property is used in capacitors. A [[capacitor]] is an electrical device that can store energy in the electric field between a pair of closely spaced conductors (called 'plates'). When voltage is applied to the capacitor, electric charges of equal magnitude, but opposite polarity, build up on each plate. Capacitors are used in electrical circuits as energy-storage devices, as well as in electronic filters to differentiate between high-frequency and low-frequency signals.

==== Electro-mechanical ====
[[Piezoelectricity]] is the ability of crystals to generate a voltage in response to an applied mechanical stress. The piezoelectric effect is reversible in that piezoelectric crystals, when subjected to an externally applied voltage, can change shape by a small amount. Polymer materials like rubber, wool, hair, wood fiber, and silk often behave as [[electret]]s. For example, the polymer [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF) exhibits a piezoelectric response several times larger than the traditional piezoelectric material quartz (crystalline SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The deformation (~0.1%) lends itself to useful technical applications such as high-voltage sources, loudspeakers, lasers, as well as chemical, biological, and acousto-optic sensors and/or transducers.

=== Optical ===
Materials can [[Transparent materials|transmit]] (e.g. glass) or reflect (e.g. metals) visible light.

Many materials will transmit some wavelengths while blocking others. For example, window glass is transparent to [[Visible spectrum|visible light]], but much less so to most of the frequencies of [[ultraviolet]] light that cause [[sunburn]]. This property is used for frequency-selective optical filters, which can alter the color of incident light.

For some purposes, both the optical and mechanical properties of a material can be of interest. For example, the sensors on an [[infrared homing]] ("heat-seeking") missile must be protected by a cover that is transparent to [[Infrared|infrared radiation]]. The current material of choice for high-speed infrared-guided missile domes is single-crystal [[sapphire]]. The optical transmission of sapphire does not actually extend to cover the entire mid-infrared range (3–5&amp;nbsp;µm), but starts to drop off at wavelengths greater than approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;µm at room temperature. While the strength of sapphire is better than that of other available mid-range infrared dome materials at room temperature, it weakens above 600&amp;nbsp;°C. A long-standing trade-off exists between optical bandpass and mechanical durability; new materials such as [[transparent ceramics]] or optical nanocomposites may provide improved performance.

Guided lightwave transmission involves the field of fiber optics and the ability of certain glasses to transmit, simultaneously and with low loss of intensity, a range of frequencies (multi-mode optical waveguides) with little interference between them. Optical waveguides are used as components in integrated optical circuits or as the transmission medium in optical communication systems.

====Opto-electronic====
{{main|Solar cell}}
A solar cell or photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light energy into electrical energy. Fundamentally, the device needs to fulfill only two functions: photo-generation of charge carriers (electrons and holes) in a light-absorbing material, and separation of the charge carriers to a conductive contact that will transmit the electricity (simply put, carrying electrons off through a metal contact into an external circuit). This conversion is called the [[photoelectric effect]], and the field of research related to solar cells is known as photovoltaics.

Solar cells have many applications. They have long been used in situations where electrical power from the grid is unavailable, such as in remote area power systems, Earth-orbiting satellites and space probes, handheld calculators, wrist watches, remote radiotelephones and water pumping applications. More recently, they are starting to be used in assemblies of solar modules (photovoltaic arrays) connected to the electricity grid through an inverter, that is not to act as a sole supply but as an additional electricity source.

All solar cells require a light absorbing material contained within the cell structure to absorb photons and generate electrons via the photovoltaic effect. The materials used in solar cells tend to have the property of preferentially absorbing the wavelengths of solar light that reach the earth surface. Some solar cells are optimized for light absorption beyond Earth's atmosphere, as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3265">The '''Yaéré''', from [[Fula language|Fula]] ''yaayre'', is the name of a vast annually [[flood]]ed flat [[savanna]] [[grassland]] plain, part of the extensive [[floodplain]]s around the shallow and variable [[Lake Chad]] in [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;The annual flooding is described by A. Bouchardeau, ''Monographie hydrologique du Logone'', (Paris:Orstom) 1968; V. Bénech ''et al.'', ''Hydrologie et physico-chimie des eaux d'inondation de la plain d'inondation du Nord-Cameroun (in series: ''Cahiers Orstom: série hydrologique'') 1982 and E. Naah, ''Restauration hydro-technique de la plaine du Yaéré'', (Projet Waza Logone, Yaoundé) 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 

When not inundated by floods the Yaéré is an [[ecoregion]] of the [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[Biome]], and when flooded it is an [[Freshwater ecoregions of Africa|African freshwater ecoregion]] in the [[Flooded grasslands and savannas]] Biome.

==Geography==
The Yaéré covers areas of northeasternmost [[Nigeria]], of [[Niger]], of southern [[Chad]] and of the [[Far North Region (Cameroon)|Far North Region of Cameroon]].  The Yaéré extends from the low hills at the base of the [[Mandara Mountains]] in the southwest to Lake Chad in the north. In the east it merges with the permanent wetlands bordering the Logone.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Sighomnou, Luc Sigha Nkamdjou, and Gaston Liénou,  "La plain du Yaéré dans le Nord-Cameroun: un expérience des restauration des innondations"&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the wet season the clays that compose the soil expand and form an imprmeable pan over which the water collects.&lt;ref&gt;Sighomnou ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is connected to the more permanent [[wetlands]] along the [[Logone River]], which flows into the [[endorheic]] Lake Chad and seasonally overflows into the surrounding Yaéré savanna. Torrential seasonal rains also drain from the Mandara Mountains, bringing a rich sediment to the floodplain. The ecological richness of the Yaéré derives from its particular conditions of wet-season flooding and dry season drought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambafrance-cm.org/Mission-hydrologique-dans-le-Yaere "La France au Cameroun: Mission hydrologique dans leYaéré" ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Conservation==
Drought years when rains fail, such as in the 1970s, are particularly harsh on this delicately balanced ecosystem, and on the local human population that depends on seasonal fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Sighomnou ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Waza National Park]] of Cameroon lies in the southwest part of the Yaéré savanna.
