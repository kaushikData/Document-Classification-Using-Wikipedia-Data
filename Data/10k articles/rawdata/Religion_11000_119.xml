{{italic title}}
'''''{{Lang|de|Also sprach Zarathustra}}''''' ('''''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''''' or '''''Thus Spake Zarathustra''''') is the oil painting cycle by [[Lena Hades]] painted from 1995 to 1997 and inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|philosophical novel of the same name]]. The painter created her first painting on December 1995 in Moscow. The ''Thus Spake Zarathustra'' cycle is a series of twenty-eight oil paintings made by the artist from 1995 to 1997 and thirty graphic works made in 2009. Twenty-four of the paintings depict so-called round-headed little men and their struggles in life. The remaining four depict Zarathustra himself, his eagle and serpent. Six paintings of the series were purchased by the [[Moscow Museum of Modern Art]] and by some important private collectors. The oil painting ''Also Sprach Zarathustra'' series was exhibited several times — including the exhibition at the Institute of Philosophy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1997 and at the First [[Moscow Biennale]] of contemporary art in 2005.

In 2004, a [[bilingual]] edition of Nietzsche's book ''Also sprach Zarathustra'' was published in Russian and German by the Institute of Philosophy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The edition includes 20 Hades paintings from this cycle and the art critical essays written by three art historians Alexander Yakimovich, Olga Yushkowa and [[Jean-Christophe Ammann]], professor at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] in Frankfurt and the director of the [[Museum für Moderne Kunst|Museum of Modern Art]] in 1991-2001.

==Paintings==
All paintings of the cycle the artist herself calls visual metaphors to the book and not illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ru/n20605 |title=Thus didn't speak Zarathustra – The First Moscow Biennale of contemporary art |trans-title=Artists: Lena Hades |publisher=Museums News |language=ru |accessdate=2005-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213040039/http://www.museum.ru/N20605 |archivedate=2005-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first half of Hades' cycle begins addressing the [[Last Man]], "who makes everything small". The last man is sneaky and coward, he takes no risks, but he wants success and comfort. The second half of the cycle is devoted to Zarathustra himself and to his friend — the eagle.

In [[Lena Hades]] interview with Nietzsche.ru portal, she told about the prehistory of the cycle. "To be very brief, in my case, there was the birth of painting from the spirit of the text. An artist was born inside me only due to Nietzsche. Without Nietzsche I would never have decided to become a professional artist, to abandon from all other "callings" in favor of painting. It was a difficult decision, because the artist is easy to die from starvation. Very easy. Prior to Nietzsche I naively believed in many things that I had been imposed on by the surrounding society. I believed, for example, in culture, science, friendship, love, and church. A lot of things were unshakeable for me, and I lived with the ideas about them established without me. But when I first read Zarathustra - this text insulted me in all my best beliefs and convictions. It didn’t leave even the slightest hint of these my naive notions, it denied everything. Everything turned out not so, as I thought. And since it hurt me so, I began to read it more carefully. And gradually I realized that in general it was right that the world is not what it seems to us, not what our parents and social environment tries to teach us, or in other words, social suggestion of the world does not match the reality of the world. And most importantly - the real world has values completely different from the "conventional" values of any taken separately culture. All this led to the inner upheaval and change in attitude. I saw the world with different eyes. With Nietzsche’s eyes! And then his eyes for some reason just became my eyes. Apparently, there is a certain spiritual affinity between us, which allows me now to breathe easy his texts".
"Your works, especially large ones, are dominated by these expressive saturated reds and yellows, creating an atmosphere of condensed semi-insanity, inhuman, demonic tension. Therefore, your paintings crush with their power and heavy energy. Heavy pressing power. You have it anywhere. Is that the feeling you have due to Nietzsche’s texts?" 
[[Lena Hades]] replies "For me, this is what the nakedness of life is, or more precisely, its halkion element. And somehow none of the Nietzsche experts have ever paid any attention to this halkion perception of Nietzsche. And yet, in ECCE HOMO Nietzsche calls himself a halkioner. I think that Nietzsche borrowed the word "halkioner" from Ancient Greek, which he knew brilliantly. In ancient Greek "halkeyo" means "to be a blacksmith, to forge." A halkion element is a kind of a forging element, not just chthonic, underground, but forging, where metal melts and is forged. This is a kind of an inner smithy, where the character is forged, and human will and strength are forged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nietzsche.ru/around/meeting/hades/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103142509/http://www.nietzsche.ru/around/meeting/hades/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 November 2011 |title=Interview with Lena Hades |trans-title=Artists: Lena Hades |publisher=Site Nietzsche.ru |language=ru |accessdate=15 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting perception==
Jean-Christophe Ammann called the painting of the series [[Tablets of Stone|tablets]]. "Figurative language of Lena Hades expresses itself often intentionally as a poster, because we see here some visual tablets which should stir and awaken. At the same time, the language of her images remains faithful to the fundamental task of the artist: every artist should be a dervish, not only in order to conjure the collective memory, being in constant motion, but also to stay in the thought and memory of our times. Lena Hades is a dervish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ru/n20605 |title=Thus didn't speak Zarathustra – The First Moscow Biennale of contemporary art |trans-title=Artists: Lena Hades |publisher=Museums News |language=ru |accessdate=2005-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213040039/http://www.museum.ru/N20605 |archivedate=2005-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-history==
`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to [[Mexico]] and [[South America]] near or before this unveiling in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and [[Hands of the Cause#Appointed posthumously by Shoghi Effendi|Roy C.

===Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades===
Shoghi Effendi wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;  In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal | page = 6 |isbn = 0-87743-145-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.  In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan''  (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America. Dominica was specifically listed as an objective for plans on spreading the religion in 1939.&lt;ref name="hour"/&gt; There is a record of an Elena Marsella, from Boston, in Dominica before June 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Wilmette Letter: 1947; Among the Pioneers |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1947 | issue = 196 | page =8 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=992}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other sources claim no Bahá'í had settled in Dominica through 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = A Major Event |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1966 | issue = 196 | page =10 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=06&amp;page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other references of Marella show her in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America News; Itinerant Teachers |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1946 | issue = 179 | page =4 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11373">The '''Buguns''' (formerly '''Khowa''') are one of the earliest recognized schedule tribe of [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;file:///http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule9a.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920212634/http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule9a.htm# |date=2017-09-20 }} The constitution (schedule Tribes) Order, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribes of India"&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft8r29p2r8&amp;chunk.id=d0e638&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e638&amp;brand=eschol Tribes of India]&lt;/ref&gt; majority of them, inhabiting the Singchung Sub-Division of [[West Kameng]] District of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. Their total population is approximately 3000. The notable features of Buguns are reflected in their simple life and warm hospitality. Buguns live in several exogamous clans. Traditionally, the predominant occupation was agriculture, supported with other allied activities like fishing and hunting, cattle rearing etc. Buguns have their own folklores, songs, dances, music and rituals. A rare bird, the [[Bugun liocichla]], was named after the tribe.

They live mainly in the [[subtropical]] Singchung Administrative Sub-Division of [[West Kameng]] district with its, almost whole, native population under [[Thrizino-Buragaon | 6-Thrizino-Buragaon]] ST Assembly Constituency of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Festivals of Kameng|author=Ram Kumar Deuri|publisher=Directorate of Research, Govt. of Arunachal Pradesh|year=1983|isbn=|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the native legend, they believed that they are the descendants of a single forefather Achinphumphulua.

==Language==
The [[Bugun language]], one of the Bugunish/Kamenic language under [[Kho-Bwa languages]] is listed as an endangered languages of India.&lt;ref&gt;The Kho-Bwa or Bugunish languages are a small family of Tibeto-Burman languages* spoken in India. They are Khowa (Bugun), Sulung (Puroik), Lishpa, and Sherdukpen. Van Driem (2001) suggested the name Kho-Bwa based on their words *kho 'fire' and *bwa 'water'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Livelihood==
Acting as a basis of their livelihood, [[shifting cultivation]] is practiced and domestic animals such as cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, fowl and the [[Gayal|mithun]] are reared. To enrich their diet, wild animals are hunted using simple spears, traps, bows and arrows.

==Culture==
Like [[Miji people|Miji]] and [[Aka (tribe)|Aka]], long hair is kept by some members of both sexes. While the both sexes adorn themselves with silver ornaments, the men wear a very long white garment and a very high hat, resembling a Turkish [[Fez (clothing)|Fez]]. The women wear a skull cap, sometimes decorated with beautiful patterns. White and checkered jackets are worn as well, usually accompanied by another singlet.

===Religion===
The Buguns are traditionally followers of the [[animism|animistic]] religion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribes of Arunachal Pradesh: Identity, Culture, and Languages|author=Dalvindar Singh Grewal|publisher=South Asia Publications|year=1997|isbn=81-7433-019-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early 20th century witnessed the gradual penetration of some dominant religions like Buddhism ([[Mahayana]]), particularly from the neighbouring ethnic group [[Sherdukpen]], and [[Hinduism]]. Some have come under [[Tibetan Buddhist]] influence. Profound Buddhist influence has led to the adoption of many Buddhist rituals and the invitation of Buddhist lamas to participate in their communal rituals.&lt;ref name="Tribes of India"/&gt; As a result, many Buguns declared themselves as Buddhist in censuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer|author=William Carey Library|publisher=South Asia Publications|year=2004|isbn=0-87808-361-8|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life Style, Indian Tribes: Locational Practice|author=Shiva Tosh Das|publisher=Gian Pub. House| year=1987|isbn=81-212-0058-X|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, some Buguns have converted to [[Christianity]]. Nevertheless, a large portion of Bugun (Khowa) population are still following their tradition way of animistic rituals and priesthood.

===Festivals===
'''Pham-Kho'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arunachalipr.gov.in/GH_Local.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110138/http://arunachalipr.gov.in/GH_Local.htm# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a harvesting festival) is a popular festival of the Bugun people which is now celebrated on 10 September every year. [[Pham Kho Sowai]] literally means "mountain" (''pham'') and "river" or "water" (''kho''), which are considered vital component required for human survival. The benevolent gods manifest in the form of the mountain and river, giving life to the people. Therefore, the Pham-Kho festival is a harvesting festival celebrated by Bugun (Khowa) community of Arunachal Pradesh. Other Important festival of Buguns are Kshyat-Sowai and Dihing-Kho.

Especially in Sraiba (a holy place with a ground for worship and related rituals) of every major villages, Kshyatsowai/Dihing Kho and Pham Kho is celebrated by the Bugun, in which the Phabi priest plays an important role in conducting the ceremony and religious rituals. Songs and dances such as Clown and Gasisiu have a close affiliation with their religion. Feasts during these festivals mainly includes their traditional foods and Phua (local brew).

==Government==
Traditionally, Buguns have their own socio-politico-admimistrative decision-making system to regulate their society. The traditional village council of the Bugun (Khowa) is known as '''Nimiyang (Council of Elders)''', which looks after every aspect of village life, may it be decision-making, utilization of local resources, conflict resolution or regulating the society. Each family is represented in the Nimiang sessions by its head male member. The traditional village council of buguns are headed by Thap-Bkhow (Chief). The Thap-Bkhow is an accepted leader and selected unanimously and not hereditary. There is no strict criterion for selection of the Thap-Bakhow, but a person with economic affluence, social stature, knowledge of customary laws, sound mentality, physical strength and generosity are taken into consideration. He presides over the meetings and sittings of the Nimiyang session. It is customary that only male member possessing above qualities can become Thap-Bakhow. Women may witnesses proceedings of the Nimiyang sessions, but can only contribute if its male member is absent.

==Migration==
'''Migration of Buguns''' to its present location are unknown. However, their mythology reveals that they have probably migrated from [[Tibet]] via East Kameng.(Buguns are subdivided into sections according to their specific locality known by different names:-Hakhongdua, Hajidua, Braidua, Khuchundua, Hayindua).

==Bugun Villages==
Some of the '''Bugun Villages are''':-
* Wanghoo,
* Dikhiyang, 
* Singchung,
* Lichini,
* Ramu,
* Namfri,
* Mangopam, 
* Chitu,
* Sachida,
* Diching,
* Kaspi,
* Bichom (a Model Village which partially included people from Lichini, Ramu, Chitu, Sachida,).
* Tenga Market under Singchung and Nag Mandir of Kaspi are main market places for them.

==Buguns relation with neighbouring tribes==
Buguns maintained good relations with their neighbouring tribes since they are surrounded by tribes like [[Sherdukpen]], [[Hruso people|Aka]] (Hrusso), [[Monpa]] (Especially, Bhut Monpa/Sartang)and [[Miji people|Mijis]]. 
* Buguns of Wanghoo and Dikhiyang had very close affinity with Monpa (Especially, Bhut Monpa/Sartang). Even Inter-Marriage among most of the clans of both the tribes are tabooed. Irrespective of their tribes they considered them as their own brothers. 
* Buguns of Singchung village have maintained very good relations with Sherdukpens since from the time immemorial. Like Buguns of Wanghoo/Dikhiyang intermarriages among some of the clans irrespective of their tribes are restricted as they consider them as their brothers and sisters. Even in religious aspects most of the Buguns of Singchung areas are influenced by Sherdukpen's Mahayana cult of Buddhism. 
* Further Buguns of Lichini, Ramu, Chitu and Kaspi area have very close brotherly relations with Akas (Hrusso)during early days. 
* And Buguns bordering Miji (Sajalong) territories have also maintained good rapport with them like Buguns of Ditching and Bichom valley.

==Active organisations working for the community==
*  '''ABS'''- All Bugun (Khowa) Society. An apex (Socio-Cultural) decision making body of Bugun Society. Formerly known as ABYA-All Bugun Youth Association.
* '''ABSU'''- All Bugun (Khowa) Students Union. A community based student's organization.

Besides these, we will find many other NGOs working actively in some specific areas within Bugun territory like:- '''BWS'''- Bugun Welfare Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bugunwelfaresociety.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021024152/http://www.bugunwelfaresociety.org/ |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mt. Siphang Society etc.

The '''International Communion of the Charismatic Episcopal Church''' (also known as the ICCEC) is an international [[Christian]] [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] established as an [[Autocephalous]] [[Patriarch]]ate in 1992 with over 1,000 churches worldwide. The Communion has its [[apostolic succession]] within the [[historical episcopate]] through the Rebiban line via [[Roman Catholic]] Bishop [[Carlos Duarte Costa]], who founded the [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church]].

On 26 June 1992, [[Austin Randolph Adler]] was consecrated the first [[bishop]] and [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of the CEC with Timothy Michael Barker of the International Free Catholic Communion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freecatholiccommunion.org freecatholiccommunion.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (who was consecrated by Archbishop-Patriarch [[Herman Adrian Spruit]]) functioning as the principal consecrator. In 1997, the Charismatic Episcopal Church sought and acquired reconsecration and reordination of all of its clergy by the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, thus strengthening their lines of apostolic succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Article by Archbishop Sly discussing the rationale for seeking reconsecration of bishops from bishops of the Brazilian Church |url=http://www.saintbrendan.net/Apostolic%20Succesion.htm |publisher=Saintbrendan.net |date= |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Worship at an ancestral temple in Hong'an, Hubei, China.jpg|thumb|People forgather for a worship ceremony at an ancestral shrine in [[Hong'an County|Hong'an]], [[Hubei]].]]
'''Chinese lineage associations''', also '''kinship''' or '''ancestral associations''' ({{zh|c=宗族社会|p=zōngzú shèhuì}} or {{zh|c=宗族协会|p=zōngzú xiéhuì}}), are a type of [[society|social]] relationship institutions found in [[Han Chinese]] ethnic groups and the fundamental unit of [[Chinese ancestral religion]]. They gather people who share the same [[Chinese surname|surname]] belonging to the same [[Chinese kin|kin]], who often have the same geographical origin ([[ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral home]]), and therefore the same patron [[deity|deities]]. They aren't seen as distinct from the Chinese kin itself, but rather as its corporate form. These institutions and their corporeal manifestations are also known as '''lineage churches''' or '''kinship churches''' (宗族堂 ''zōngzú táng''), or, mostly on the scholarly level, as '''[[Confucian church]]es''',&lt;ref&gt;Scolar of Chinese traditional religion Liyong Dai uses the term "Confucclesia", "Confucian church".&lt;/ref&gt; although this term has principally other different meanings.

They provide ''[[guanxi]]'' (social network) to members and they build and manage [[ancestral shrine]]s or temples dedicated to the worship of the [[progenitor]]s of the kins as their congregational centers, where they perform [[rite]]s of unity.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 1982. pp. 595-597&lt;/ref&gt;

A lineage is a ''corporation'', in the sense that members feel to belong to the same body, are highly conscious of their group identity, and derive benefits from jointly owned property and shared resources.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 1982. p. 594&lt;/ref&gt; Benefit derives from the surplus income of ancestral shrines and homes, which is reinvested by the managers or shared out in yearly dividends.&lt;ref name=Watson600&gt;Watson, 1982. p. 600&lt;/ref&gt; Benefit of belonging to a lineage can also be measured in terms of protection and patronage.&lt;ref name=Watson600 /&gt; Ancestral temples also support local schools and engage in [[charity (practice)|charitable work]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 1982. pp. 601-602&lt;/ref&gt;

Different lineages may develop through the opposite processes of fusion and segmentation.&lt;ref name=Watson604609&gt;Watson, 1982. pp. 604-609&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be dispersed and fragmented into "multi-lineage areas" or concentrated in one place, or "single-lineage area".&lt;ref name=Watson604609 /&gt;

The '''Congregational Federation''' is a small [[Christian denomination]] in [[Great Britain]] comprising just under 300 congregations.&lt;ref name="churches"&gt;{{cite web|title=Find a Church|url=http://www.congregational.org.uk/find-a-church/church-finder|publisher=The Congregational Federation|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation brings together independent churches characterised by a [[congregationalist polity|congregationalist]] church governance and [[English_Dissenters|Dissenting]] theology. It provides support and guidance to member churches both financially and otherwise. 

The Federation was formed in 1972 from those Congregational churches which did not enter the union of the [[Presbyterian]] Church of England with the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the body that succeeded the Congregational Union of England and Wales in 1966) to form the [[United Reformed Church]]. These were joined in 2000 by member churches of the Congregational Union of Scotland that chose not to join their merger with the [[United Reformed Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.congregational.org.uk/introduction/introduction|publisher=The Congregational Federation|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Curb Your Enthusiasm''''' is an American [[television comedy|comedy television series]] produced and broadcast by [[HBO]] that premiered on October 15, 2000. The series was created by [[Larry David]] starring as a fictionalized version of himself. The series follows Larry in his life as a semi-retired television writer and producer in [[Los Angeles]] and later [[New York City]]. Also starring are [[Cheryl Hines]] as his wife Cheryl, [[Jeff Garlin]] as his manager and best friend Jeff, and [[Susie Essman]] as Jeff's wife Susie. ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' often [[List of Curb Your Enthusiasm guest stars|features guest stars]], and many of these appearances are by celebrities playing versions of themselves fictionalized to varying degrees.

The plots and subplots of the episodes are established in an outline written by David, and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors&lt;ref name="directing_curb"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Richmond |first=Ray |title=Unscripted: Directing HBO's Improv Comedy ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' |newspaper=DGA Magazine |date=July 2003 |accessdate=October 17, 2012 |url=http://www.dga.org/news/v28_2/feat_unscripted.php3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530143948/http://www.dga.org/news/v28_2/feat_unscripted.php3 |archivedate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a technique known as [[retroscripting]]). As with ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which David co-created, the subject matter in ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' often involves the [[minutiae]] of American daily social life, and plots often revolve around Larry David's many faux pas and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, as well as his annoyance with other people's behavior. The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which often leads him into awkward situations. He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe that he has done something morally terrible or disgusting.

The series was developed from a 1999 one-hour special, ''[[List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes#HBO special (1999)|Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', which David and HBO originally envisioned as a one-time project. The special was shot as a [[mockumentary]], where the characters were aware of the presence of cameras and a crew. The series itself is not a mock documentary but is shot in a somewhat similar, [[cinéma vérité]]-like style.&lt;ref name="directing_curb" /&gt; ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' has received high critical acclaim and has grown in popularity since its debut. It has been nominated for 38 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, and [[Robert B. Weide]] received an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]] for the episode "Krazee Eyez Killa". The show won the 2002 [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy|Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy]].&lt;ref name="about_the_show"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/curb-your-enthusiasm/about/index.html |title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: About the Show |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the eighth season concluded in September 2011, ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' went on an indefinite hiatus. The series finally returned for a ninth season in October 2017, while a tenth season is in production as of October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/10/19/curb-your-enthusiasm-season-10-filming-begins |title='Curb Your Enthusiasm' begins filming season 10 |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=October 19, 2018 |website=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The series stars Larry David as an extreme [[Character (arts)|fictionalized version]] of himself. Like the real-life David, the character is well known in the entertainment industry as the co-creator and main co-writer of the highly successful sitcom ''Seinfeld''. For most of the series, the Larry David character is living a married-without-children life in [[Los Angeles]] with his wife, Cheryl (played by [[Cheryl Hines]]). David's main [[confidant]] on the show is his manager, Jeff Greene (played by ''Curb'' executive producer [[Jeff Garlin]]), who has a temperamental and occasionally vulgar wife, Susie ([[Susie Essman]]). A large portion of the show's many [[Guest appearance|guest stars]] are celebrities and public figures, such as actors, comedians, sportspeople, and politicians, who play themselves. These include David's longtime friend [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] as well as [[Ted Danson]] and his wife, [[Mary Steenburgen]], who all have recurring roles as fictionalized versions of themselves.

The show is set and filmed in various affluent [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside]] communities of (and occasionally in downtown) Los Angeles, as well as in the adjacent cities of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], [[Brentwood, California|Brentwood]], and [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]. David's hometown of [[New York City]] is also featured in some episodes, most prominently in the eighth season.

Although David maintains an office, he leads a semiretired life in the series and is rarely shown working regularly, other than in season two, when he tries to create a failed pilot for Jason Alexander and later Julia Louis-Dreyfus, in season four, which centered on his being cast as the lead in the [[Mel Brooks]] musical ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', and in season seven, writing a [[Seinfeld (Curb Your Enthusiasm)|''Seinfeld'' reunion show]]. Most of the series revolves around David's interactions with his friends and acquaintances, with David often at odds with the other characters, usually to his detriment. Despite this, the characters do not seem to harbor ill feelings toward each other for any extended period, and the cast has stayed stable throughout the show.

===Title===
David has explained the show's title in TV interviews as reflecting his perception that many people seem to live their lives projecting false enthusiasm, which he believes is used to imply that "they are better than you". This conflicts with his dry style. The title also urges the audience not to expect too much from the show; at the time of the premiere, David wanted to lower expectations after ''Seinfeld'''s phenomenal success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/16/style/the-great-and-wonderful-wizard-of-odds.html |title=The Great And Wonderful Wizard of Odds|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 16, 2007|accessdate=March 1, 2010 | first=Rick | last=Marin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Larry David ([[Larry David|Himself]]) – Candid, neurotic, but generally disposed to pursue what he perceives to be the right course, Larry often finds himself in awkward situations that arise as a result of his obstinate belief in his own ethical principles and codes of conduct, which he is nevertheless prepared to bend when it suits him. He usually has good intentions but often finds himself a victim of circumstance and social convention, as many of the people around him are also self-centered and stubborn. He often focuses on petty details and stubbornly holds to his opinion to the extent of aggravating everyone around him just to prove an insignificant point. The real-life [[Larry David]] has commented that although he secretly wishes to be more like his fictionalized version on the series, he could never be that way because he is a lot more cautious when it comes to social tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/larry-david-talks-dating-post-divorce-seinfeld-and-wealth-20110720|title=Larry David Talks Dating Post-Divorce, 'Seinfeld' and Wealth|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 20, 2011|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry's trademark behaviors are his probing stare when he doesn't think somebody is telling the truth, fondly saying something is "prett-ay, prett-ay, prett-ay, pretty good" and, when caught up short in a moment of poor or contrary behavior, quizzically and mock-innocently inquiring, often of his wife, Cheryl, or of a close friend, "No good?" Among Larry's characteristics are his love of playing golf and his annoyance at having to engage in small talk, especially with people he deals with in commercial situations, such as waiters and tradesmen. Larry also humorously explores various aspects of Jewish life, history, and culture.
* Jeff Greene ([[Jeff Garlin]]) – One of Larry's closest friends, Jeff is his sympathetic manager, whose marital problems and adulterous misadventures entangle Larry in embarrassing situations. Jeff often helps Larry with his problems, but that usually leads to Jeff getting entangled in the mess. Jeff and his wife, Susie ([[Susie Essman]]), have a daughter named Sammi (Ashly Holloway). While they ultimately love each other, his wife constantly criticizes him on his decisions and weight, while his daughter at times is neutral about her love for her father. Jeff Garlin stated that he truly does not empathize with his character at all&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_qWDlzdrfs&amp;feature=plcp |title=Curb Your Enthusiasm - Jeff Greene a Villain? |publisher = The Paley Center for Media |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described him as a "pretty evil guy" who has "no morals, no scruples".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/curb-your-enthusiasm/exclusive-interview-jeff-garli-10655.aspx|title=Exclusive Interview: Jeff Garlin, from ''Curb Your Enthusiasm''|publisher=[[BuddyTV]]|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cheryl David ([[Cheryl Hines]]) – Cheryl is Larry's long-suffering wife (and later, ex-wife), who often expresses annoyance with his behavior, even in situations beyond his control. She often serves as a voice of reason for him and helps define the social guidelines that he may have overlooked. While her adventures never lead her far off from Larry, she has various activities outside day-to-day married life, including an acting stint, and, more sustainably, being an advocate of environmental issues, including becoming a member of and fundraiser for the [[Natural Resources Defense Council|NRDC]]. Her affection for Larry has been tested, even resulting in her leaving him for a time; upon learning that he had put together the ''Seinfeld'' reunion just to have a chance to get back with her, she sees it as a sign of their "belong[ing] together" but soon decides to file for divorce when Larry concentrates on a coffee stain incident rather than the fact that they are back together, refusing yet again to listen to her. They divorce in the season eight premiere episode.  After being absent for the rest of season eight, Cheryl returns as a regular in season nine, though she and Larry are still divorced and date other people.
* Susie Greene ([[Susie Essman]]) – Jeff's shrill wife, known for her explosive temper and her filthy mouth. Consequently, her reactions to Larry range from near violence via benign grievances to occasionally fonder repartee. Able to put two and two together, she frequently catches Larry and Jeff in plans gone awry or cover-up of  some misbehavior. She routinely berates Larry and Jeff with profanity-laced tirades after uncovering one of their schemes. Susie and Jeff have an "on-again, off-again" relationship. She often uses Larry as a [[scapegoat]] for her marital problems. She is known to refer to Larry as "Larry Fucking David", "Bald Asshole", and "Four-Eyed Fuck," and when he crosses her, she is known to respond "Fuck you, Larry David!" while her common expletive to her husband is "You fat piece of shit!" She often serves to enforce traditional moral standards, such as the sanctity of marital vows and fealty to hearth and home, at times versus her husband, at others versus Larry, and usually versus both. Susie Essman was upgraded from guest star billing to main cast billing beginning with season eight.
*Leon Black ([[J. B. Smoove]]) – the brother of Loretta Black, a single mother whose family was a victim of Hurricane Edna. When Larry and Cheryl take in Loretta and her family, Leon moves in, too, even though he was living in Los Angeles already long before the hurricane. After a while, however, Loretta and her family move out of the house, but Leon simply stays behind. He often displays that he has Larry's back, tending to be a lot more blunt and confrontational than Larry could ever be. This involves him helping out Larry with his various misadventures and giving him reassurance and tips for how to fend for himself. Leon is also quite promiscuous when it comes to women, regardless of their being married. Leon first appears in the season 6 episode, "The Anonymous Donor". Smoove was upgraded from guest star billing to main cast billing beginning with season nine.

=== Recurring roles ===

{{:List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes}}

''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' episodes are typically named after an event, object, or person that figures prominently in the plot, similarly to how ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episodes were named. Many episodes concern breaches of intricate aspects of social conventions, such as the various details of tipping at restaurants,&lt;ref name="1x04" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Episode 4, "The Bracelet" (season one)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="7x07" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Episode 67, "The Black Swan" (season seven)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="7x03" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Episode 63, "The Reunion" (season seven)&lt;/ref&gt; the obligation to "stop and chat" upon meeting an acquaintance,&lt;ref name="2x10" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Episode 20, "The Massage" (season two)&lt;/ref&gt; the allowed amount of caviar one may put on a cracker at a house party,&lt;ref name="7x04" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Episode 64, "The Hot Towel" (season seven)&lt;/ref&gt; and whether a house guest needs the permission of the homeowner before taking a soft drink from the refrigerator.&lt;ref name="7x01" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Episode 61, "Funkhouser's Crazy Sister" (season seven)&lt;/ref&gt; And some involve the etiquette of extremely complex and unique circumstances, such as the occasion when Larry discovered at a wake that the deceased was to be buried with his favorite golf club—borrowed from Larry.&lt;ref name="4x05" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Episode 35, "The 5 Wood" (season four)&lt;/ref&gt; Another involved Larry picking up a prostitute for the sole purpose of using the [[high-occupancy vehicle lane|carpool lane]] on the freeway.&lt;ref name="4x06" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Episode 36, "The Car Pool Lane" (season four)&lt;/ref&gt; In many episodes, ''Curb''—like its predecessor ''Seinfeld''—tied together apparently unrelated events woven throughout a given episode into an unforced climax that resolves the story lines simultaneously, either to Larry's advantage or detriment.

While each episode has a distinct individual plot, most seasons feature a [[story arc]] that extends across several episodes throughout the season and culminates in a [[season finale]] that often features the return of many of the characters that appeared throughout the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/articles/2010/03/15/larry-david-talks-curb-your-enthusiasms-future |title=Larry David Talks Curb Your Enthusiasm's Future |publisher=IGN |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=March 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/articles/2011/09/12/curb-your-enthusiasm-larry-vs-michael-j-fox-review |title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: "Larry vs. Michael J.

==Critical reception==
''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' is one of the most acclaimed television shows of the 2000s, praised particularly for its writing and the actors' improvisational comedy. The show has enjoyed largely positive critical reception since its debut and a steadily growing, dedicated audience that helped it emerge from its early "cult" status.

On [[Metacritic]], the first season of the show scored 80 out of 100 (based on 20 reviews),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/curb-your-enthusiasm|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 93 for season 3 (based on 12 reviews),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/curb-your-enthusiasm/season-3|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 3|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 88 for season 4 (18 reviews),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/curb-your-enthusiasm/season-4|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 4|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 91 for season 5 (five reviews),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/curb-your-enthusiasm/season-5|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 5|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 89 for season 6 (nine reviews),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/curb-your-enthusiasm/season-6|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 6|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 81 for season 7 (18 reviews),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/curb-your-enthusiasm/season-7|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 7|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 86 for season 8 (six reviews)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/curb-your-enthusiasm/season-8|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 8|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 74 for season 9 (10 reviews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/curb-your-enthusiasm/season-9|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 9|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' named the characters of Cheryl David and Susie Greene as two of the best on television and as reasons to look forward to the return of the show in the fall of 2007.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/tv_week/2007/09/oh_how_weve_missed_you.html |title=Oh, How We've Missed You!|accessdate=September 23, 2007|last=Lapidos|first=Juliet|date=September 21, 2007|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' has also received praise from ''Galus Australis'' magazine for being even more unabashedly Jewish than the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Frosh |first=Anthony |title=Jews in Pop-culture: a Critical Examination Part |newspaper=Galus Australis |date=June 28, 2009 |url=http://galusaustralis.com/2009/06/347/jews_in_pop-culture/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the show's depiction of Jewish characters, academic Vincent Brook stated, "''Curb''{{'}}s commitment to Jewish identification greatly enhances its storytelling capacity, as it lends greater realism and dimension to the characters and opens the show up to episodes with meaningful Jewish themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brook|first=Vincent|title=You should see yourself: Jewish identity in postmodern American culture|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=0-8135-3845-9|pages=279–284|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Larry on the show is in many ways reminiscent of the ''[[Schlemiel]]'' character often present in traditional Yiddish folklore. The ''schlemiel'' is usually a comic character whose actions lead to his inevitable downfall, but also stands as a form of resistance to social and cultural values and norms. David Gillota wrote: {{cquote|As a true ''schlemiel'', Larry's failure serves as a direct challenge to the status quo and encourages viewers to question the myriad unwritten rules that we follow in our everyday lives. Whereas the schlemiel of Eastern Europe encountered problems that mostly affected Eastern European Jews (such as anti-Semitism and economic survival), Larry encounters problems that affect contemporary middle- to upper-class American Jews, namely, [[Jewish assimilation]], secularism, intermarriage, and, as all of these suggest, the Jews' precarious ethnic identity in an increasingly multicultural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillota|first=David|title=Negotiating Jewishness: and the Schlemiel Tradition|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|year=2010|volume=38|issue=4|pages=152–161|doi=10.1080/01956051003725244}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2016, [[Rob Sheffield]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' as the 19th greatest television series ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-w439520/curb-your-enthusiasm-w439621 |title=100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time |last=Sheffield |first=Rob |work=Rolling Stone |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist James Andrew Miller made the first chapter of his new podcast "Origins" about ''Curb Your Enthusiasm''. The chapter goes across five episodes and was released on September 6, 2017. It documents the genesis of the series, and uses conversations with people involved in the show.

'''Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee''' or '''DSGMC''' is an autonomous organisation which manages [[Gurudwara]]s in [[Delhi]] state. ''DSGMC'' also manages various educational institutions, hospitals, old age homes, libraries and other charitable institutions in Delhi. It is headquartered in [[Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib]], near [[Parliament of India#Building|Parliament House]].In 1971, the Government of India entrusted the management, through an ordinance, to a five-member Gurdwara Board. The ordinance was replaced by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1971, passed by Parliament, providing for a committee to be elected by Sikh vote.Elections took place under the supervision of government authority and the new body called Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Management Committee (DSGMC) came into existence in 1974. Under the provisions of the Act, the elections must take place every four years.

It is governed by a Chairman and a President as per [[Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Act of 1971]]. The term of DSGMC is four years, formed through elections conducted by [http://gurudwara.delhigovt.nic.in/ Directorate of Gurdwara Elections] of [[Government of Delhi|Delhi Government]]. Of over a million [[Sikhs]] living in Delhi, around 450,000 are registered voters for the DSGMC elections.

'''Drenpa Namkha''' (Tibetan: ''dran pa nam mkha' '') was born in the 8th century near [[Mount Kailash]] in Chunlung Ngul Kha (Khyung lung dngul mkhar) in south-western [[Tibet]].  As a young student he was a blessed with eight principal [[Bon (religion)|Bon]] teachers. Drenpa Namkha became a self-realized supreme master of the three Bon practices, known as [[Sutra]], [[Tantra]] and [[Dzogchen]]. Drenpa Namkha is the primary long-life deity according to Bon.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the foremost Bonpos of the time, Drenpa Namkha (Dran-pa Nam-mkha'), played an important role during the second persecution of Bon. He headed the Bonpo side in a contest against the Buddhists organized by the king to discover which side had the greatest miraculous power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yungdrung-bon.net/page/anglais/A-histoire/A-HISTOIRE2_BON.html (accessed:  Tuesday, 9 January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Drenpa Namkha is a popular personage in the Bon tradition. Drenpa Namkha's biography in eight volumes was published by sPa-tshang Sonam Gyantsan, Delhi in 1983. Drenpa Namkha is said to have had twin sons: Tshe-dbang Rig-'dzin, a Bon teacher, and Pad-ma 'Byung-gnas, the famous Buddhist teacher Padmsambhava.&lt;ref&gt;Karmay, ''The Treasury of Good Sayings'', Oxford University Press, London 1972: xxxii n.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Later masters said to be reincarnations of Drenpa Namkha include Bonpo Traksel (bon po brag tshal, d.u.), Rigdzin Trinle Lhundrub (rig 'dzin phrin las lhun grub, d.u.), and Drenpa Zungi Namtrul (dren pa zung gi rnam 'phrul, d.u.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

== Iconography ==
Drenpa Namkha holds a ''[[Yungdrung]]'' ''[[chakshing]]'' in his right hand to indicate the indestructibility and permanence of the Bon teachings. Victory over heretics is symbolized by the eye on the sole of his foot.

'''Ernesto Ruffini''' (19 January 1888 – 11 June 1967) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] of the [[Catholic Church]] who served as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palermo|Archbishop of Palermo]] from 1945 until his death, and was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in 1946 by Pope Pius XII.

==Biography==
Ruffini was born in [[San Benedetto Po]] in the [[Province of Mantua]], and studied at the [[Diocese|diocesan]] [[seminary]] of Mantua, the Pontifical Theological Faculty of Northern Italy (obtaining his [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|licentiate in theology]]), and the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)]] (licentiate in [[philosophy]]) and [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] (diploma to teach Biblical Science) in [[Rome]]. He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] on 10 July 1910, and finished his studies in 1912.

Ruffini taught at the Major Roman Seminary (1913–1930), and then the [[Pontifical Urbaniana University]] (1917–1929). Raised to the rank of [[Monsignor]] in 1925, he was appointed Secretary of the [[Congregation for Catholic Education|Congregation of Seminaries and Universities]] on 28 October 1928. Ruffini was made a [[Protonotary apostolic|Protonotary Apostolic]] on 15 June 1931. In 1930, Ruffini was made Prefect of Studies at the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], of which he was named [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] ''magnifico'' in the following year. Noted for his interest in [[science]], Ruffini founded the Medical Biological Union of St. Luke, examining the relationships between [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and science, in 1944.

On 11 October 1945, he was named [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palermo|Archbishop of Palermo]] by [[Pope Pius XII]]. Ruffini received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on the following 8 December from [[Giuseppe Cardinal Pizzardo]], with Archbishop Francesco Duca and Bishop Domenico Menna serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]]. Ruffini was created [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[Santa Sabina|S. Sabina]]'' by Pius XII in the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of 18 February 1946. He was the first cardinal-designate to place his wardrobe order to the Gamarelli episcopal [[tailor]]s, which he did the same morning as the announcement of his elevation to the [[College of Cardinals|Sacred College]].&lt;ref name="The Roads to Rome"&gt;''TIME ''Magazine.

He also demanded that the Sicilian bandit [[Salvatore Giuliano]] cease murdering within Palermo,&lt;ref name="The Roads to Rome"/&gt; and was cautious to be tricked into implying that [[the Mafia]] was the main problem of [[Sicily]]. To a journalist's question of "What is the Mafia?" he responded: "So far as I know, it could be a brand of detergent."&lt;ref name=ncr130902&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_39_38/ai_91970756/ Memory of anti-Mafia priest pervades summit], National Catholic Reporter, September 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruffini was also part of the conservative-minded study group [[Coetus Internationalis Patrum]] at the council. He was forced to intervene in a heated discussion between Cardinals [[Alfredo Ottaviani]] and [[Augustin Bea]] in the course of the last [[Central Preparatory Commission|preparatory session of the Council]]. During the discussion on the Council's proposed declaration against [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], Cardinal Ruffini accused the document of being overly kind to the [[Jew]]s, whom he saw as hostile to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;''TIME ''Magazine.

Cardinal Ruffini was one of the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|cardinal electors]] who participated in the [[Papal conclave, 1963|1963 papal conclave]], which selected [[Pope Paul VI]].

He died from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in Palermo, at age 79.&lt;ref name="The Roads to Rome"/&gt; Ruffini is buried in the shrine of ''Madonna dei Rimedi''.

'''François Rabelais''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|æ|b|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rabelais,+françois "Rabelais, François"]. ''The [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage]] New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa ʁablɛ|lang}}; between 1483 and 1494 – 9 April 1553) was a [[French Renaissance]] writer, physician, [[Renaissance humanist]], monk and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] scholar. He has historically been regarded as a writer of fantasy, satire, the grotesque, bawdy jokes and songs. His best known work is ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''. Because of his literary power and historical importance, Western literary critics consider him one of the great writers of world literature and among the creators of modern European writing.&lt;ref name="Bakhtin1984"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mihail Mihajlovič Bakhtin|title=Rabelais and His World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SkswFyhqRIMC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1984|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20341-0|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His literary legacy is such that today, the word ''Rabelaisian'' has been coined as a descriptive inspired by his work and life. [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster]] defines the word as describing someone or something that is "marked by gross robust humor, extravagance of caricature, or bold naturalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabelaisian|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rabelaisian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
No reliable documentation of the place or date of the birth of François Rabelais has survived. While some scholars put the date as early as 1483, he was probably born in November 1494 near [[Chinon]] in the province of [[Touraine]], where his father worked as a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Rabelais Encyclopedia|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = bio&gt;{{cite web |title= Rabelais, François |publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001–07. |url= http://www.bartleby.com/65/ra/Rabelais.html |accessdate=27 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate of ''La Devinière'' in [[Seuilly]] in the modern-day [[Indre-et-Loire]], allegedly the writer's birthplace, houses a Rabelais museum.

Rabelais became a [[Novitiate|novice]] of the [[Franciscan]] [[Religious order|order]], and later a [[friar]] at [[Fontenay-le-Comte]] in [[Poitou]], where he studied [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] as well as science, [[philology]], and law, already becoming known and respected by the humanists of his era, including [[Guillaume Budé]] (1467-1540). Harassed due to the directions of his studies and frustrated with the Franciscan order's ban on the study of Greek (because of [[Erasmus]]' commentary on the Greek version of the ''Gospel of Saint Luke''),&lt;ref name=Boulenger&gt;{{cite book| last=Boulenger| first=Jacques | title=''"Introduction: Vie de Rabelais" in''  Œuvres complètes de François Rabelais| language=French  | year=1978 | publisher=Gallimard (La Bibliothèque de la Pléiade)  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} Rabelais petitioned [[Pope Clement&amp;nbsp;VII]] (in office 1523-1534) and gained permission to leave the Franciscans and to enter the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] order at [[Maillezais]] in [[Poitou]], where he was more warmly received.&lt;ref name=Febvre&gt;{{cite book |last=Febvre|first=Lucien|title=The Problem of Unbelief in the Sixteenth Century, the Religion of Rabelais|year=1982|publisher=Harvard College|isbn= 0-674-70825-3 |pages= 264|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TIanJUOYnAAC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=rabelais+harassed+by+franciscans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gEFLgu3fg8&amp;sig=YkBo5KioyJpogTwGUxLMYgRTFqw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lV2XT7_8KoPI9gT36-25Dg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rabelais%20harassed%20by%20franciscans&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rabelaismaisonmetz.jpg|thumb|The house of François Rabelais in [[Metz]]]]

Later he left the monastery to study medicine at the [[University of Poitiers]] and at the [[University of Montpellier]]. In 1532 he moved to [[Lyon]], one of the intellectual centres of the Renaissance, and in 1534 began working as a doctor at the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Lyon]] (hospital), for which he earned 40 ''livres'' a year.  During his time in Lyon, he edited Latin works for the printer [[Sebastian Gryphius]], became friends with [[Étienne Dolet]], and worked up the nerve to write to Erasmus.  Gryphius published his translations of [[Hippocrates]], [[Galen]] and Giovanni Mainardi. As a physician, he used his spare time to write and publish humorous pamphlets critical of established authority and preoccupied with the educational and monastic mores of the time.&lt;ref name=Boulenger /&gt;{{rp|13-15}}

In 1532, under the pseudonym '''Alcofribas Nasier''' (an [[anagram]] of François Rabelais), he published his first book, ''Pantagruel King of the Dipsodes'', the first of his [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|''Gargantua'' series]].  The idea of basing an allegory on the lives of giants came to Rabelais from the folklore legend of ''les Grandes chroniques du grand et énorme géant Gargantua'', which were sold as popular literature at the time in the form of inexpensive pamphlets by colporters and at the fairs of Lyon.&lt;ref name=Boulenger /&gt;{{rp|13}} Pantagruelisme is an "eat, drink and be merry" philosophy, which led his books into disfavor with the church, simultaneously brought them popular success and the admiration of later critics for their focus on the body.  This first book, critical of the existing monastic and educational system, contains the first known occurrence in French of the words [[Encyclopedia | ''encyclopédie'']], [[Kaballah | ''caballe'']], ''progrès'' and [[Utopia|''utopie'']] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| last=Huchon| first=Mireille | title="Pantagruelistes et mercuriens lyonnais" in'' Lyon et l'illustration de la langue française à la Renaissance''| language=French  | year=2003 | page=405 | publisher=ENS Éditions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original context ([https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Pantagruel/%C3%89dition_Marty-Laveaux,_1868/Chapitre_20 fr] / [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Hl6PtUdIFawC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=THAUMASTE+GOT+UP&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XRES6tWWRv&amp;sig=nmIgIfsPnCN8cn1SboCxQ4i87Y8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiL8LLLodzeAhWwxoUKHSSpAkMQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=THAUMASTE%20GOT%20UP&amp;f=false en])&lt;/ref&gt;   Despite the book's popularity, both it and the subsequent [[prequel]] book (1534) about the life and exploits of Pantagruel's father Gargantua were condemned by the academics at the [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]], in particular [[Guillaume Postel]] in 1543, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucien Febvre|title=Le Problème de l'incroyance au XVIe siècle|date=1942|publisher=Albin Michel}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111-115, 128-132}} for their unorthodox ideas and by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for their derision of certain religious practices.

Rabelais taught medicine at Montpellier in 1534 and again in 1539. In 1537, Rabelais gave an anatomy lesson at Lyon's Hôtel-Dieu using the corpse of a hanged man.&lt;ref name="Boulenger" /&gt;{{rp|xvii}} 

In June 1543 Rabelais became a [[Master of Requests (France)|Master of Requests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marichal|first1=Robert|title=Rabelais fût il Maître des Requêtes?|journal=Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance|date=1948|volume=10|pages=169–178, at p. 169.|jstor=20673434|registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1545 and 1547 François Rabelais lived in [[Metz]], then a [[free imperial city]] and a republic, to escape the condemnation by the [[University of Paris]]. In 1547, he became [[curate]] of [[Saint-Christophe-du-Jambet]] in [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and of [[Meudon]] near Paris, from which he resigned in January 1553 before his death in Paris in April 1553.&lt;ref name=Boulenger /&gt;{{rp|xx-xxi}}

There aren't many speaking roles for women in the Rabelaisian adventures, not even in ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel#The Third Book|Le Tiers Livre]]'' where the recurrent theme is whether Panurge should marry or not.  Pantagruel's mother, for example, dies in childbirth; Gargantua's mother (Gargamelle) fades from the story as soon as the newborn giant has climbed out her ear into life. This book was published under Rabelais'  own name in 1546 and dedicated to King Francis I's sister [[Marguerite of Navarre]], and was also banned by the Sorbonne.  It revisited discussions he had had while working as a secretary to Geoffroy d'Estissac earlier in Poitiers, and with his patron Marguerite de Navarre shortly before she wrote the [[Heptameron]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rabelais and Marguerite de Navarre on Sixteenth-Century Views of Clandestine Marriage | author = Cathleen M. Bauschatz | journal = Sixteenth Century Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | date = 2003| url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/20061415  | doi = 10.2307/20061415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Woman Question|''la querelle des femmes'']] was a lively subject of debate in intellectual circles at the time.&lt;ref name=Boulenger /&gt;{{rp|xix}} 

With support from members of the prominent [[du Bellay family]], Rabelais received approval from [[Francis I of France|King Francis&amp;nbsp;I]] to continue to publish his collection. However, after the king's death in 1547, the academic élite frowned upon Rabelais, and the French [[Parlement]] suspended the sale of his fourth book (''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel#The Fourth Book|Le Quart Livre]]'') published in 1552.&lt;ref name=Boulenger /&gt;{{rp|xx}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lefranc|first=Abel|date=1929|title=Rabelais, la Sorbonne et le Parlement en 1552 (partie 1)|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/crai_0065-0536_1929_num_73_4_75794|journal=Comptes rendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|volume=73|pages=276|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabelais traveled frequently to Rome with his friend Cardinal [[Jean du Bellay]], and lived for a short time in [[Turin]] (1540- ) as part of the household of du Bellay's brother, [[Guillaume du Bellay|Guillaume]], while king [[Francis I of France|François&amp;nbsp;I]] was his patron. Rabelais spent some time in hiding, under periodic threat of being condemned of [[heresy]] depending upon the health of his various protectors. Only the protection of du Bellay saved Rabelais after the condemnation of his novel by the [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name=Boulenger /&gt;{{rp|xix-xx}}

{{Main article|Gargantua and Pantagruel}}
[[File:Gustave Dore X.jpg|thumb|Illustration for ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' by [[Gustave Doré]].]]
[[File:Gustave Dore XII.jpg|thumb|Illustration for ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' by Gustave Doré.]]

''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' relates the adventures Gargantua and his son Pantagruel.  The tales are adventurous and erudite, festive and gross, toxic ecumenical and rarely -- if ever -- solemn for long.  The first book, chronologically, was Pantagruel and the Gargantua mentioned in the Prologue refers not to Rabelais' own work but to storybooks that were being sold at the Lyon fairs in the early 1530s.&lt;ref name=Demerson /&gt;{{rp|297, 300}} In the first chapter of the earliest book, Pantagruel's lineage is listed back 60 generations to a giant named Chalbroth. The narrator dismisses the skeptics of the time&amp;mdash;who would have thought a giant far too large for [[Noah's Ark]]&amp;mdash;stating that Hurtaly (the giant reigning during the flood and a great fan of soup) simply rode the Ark like a kid on a rocking horse, or like a fat Swiss guy on a canon.&lt;ref name=Demerson /&gt;{{rp|508-514}}  In the Prologue to ''Gargantua'' the narrator addresses&amp;nbsp;:  "Most illustrious drinkers, and ''you'' the most precious pox-ridden{{mdash}}for to ''you'' and ''you'' alone are my writings dedicated ..." before turning to Plato's ''[[Symposium_(Plato)|Banquet]]''.&lt;ref name="Demerson"/&gt;{{rp|50}}  An unprecedented syphilis epidemic had raged through Europe for over 30 years when the book was published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = James Marshall | title = Rabelais on Syphilis | journal = Nature | doi= 10.1038/162118a0 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/162118a0.pdf | date = July 7, 1948 | access-date = November 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even the king of France was reputed to have been infected.  Etion was the first giant in Pantagruel's list of ancestors to suffer from the disease.&lt;ref name=Demerson /&gt;{{rp|510}} 

Although most chapters are humorous, wildly fantastic and frequently absurd, a few relatively serious passages have become famous for expressing humanistic ideals of the time. In particular, the chapters on Gargantua's boyhood and Gargantua's paternal letter to Pantagruel&lt;ref name="Cohentrans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabelais|first=François|title=The Histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel|translator=J. M. Cohen|location=Harmondsworth|publisher=Penguin|series=Penguin Classics|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|192-6}} present a quite detailed vision of education.

===''Thélème''===
{{See also|Thelema}}

In the first book, M. Alcofribas narrates the Abbey of Thélème, built by the giant Gargantua. It differs remarkably from the monastic norm, as the abbey is open to both monks and nuns, has a swimming pool, maid service, and no clocks in sight. Only the good-looking are permitted to enter.&lt;ref name=Demerson&gt;{{cite book | author1 = François Rabelais | author2 = Guy Demerson | author3 = Geneviève Demerson | title = Rabelais:  Œuvres complètes | date = 1995 |  publisher = Seuil}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|268-9}}  The inscription on the gate to the abbey first sets out who is unwelcome:  hypocrites, bigots, the pox-ridden, Gothz, Magothz, the straw-chewing law clerks, usurious grinches, old or officious judges, and burners of heretics.&lt;ref name=Demerson/&gt;{{rp|272}}  When the members are defined positively, the text becomes more inviting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
::::Honour, praise, distraction
::::Herein lies subtraction
::::in the tuning up of joy.
::::To healthy bodies so employed
::::Do pass on this reaction:  
::::Honour, praise, distraction&lt;ref name="Demerson"/&gt;{{rp|274}}&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:RabelaisPentagruelTitlepage1571.jpg|thumb|250px|Titlepage of a 1571 edition containing the last three books of Pantagruel: ''Le Tiers Livre des Faits &amp; Dits Heroïques du Bon Pantagruel'' (The Third Book of the True and Reputed Heroic Deeds of the Noble Pantagruel)]]

The Thélèmites in the abbey live according to a single rule:  DO WHAT YOU WANT.

== Use of language ==
The French Renaissance was a time of linguistic contact and debate.  The first book of French, rather than Latin, grammar was published in 1530,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctlf.ens-lyon.fr/n_fiche.asp?num=2202 | title = notice John Palsgrave | author1 = Jacques Julien | author2 = Susan Baddely | date = April 2016 | language = fr |publisher=CTLF|access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed nine years later by the language's first dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k505878 | title = Dictionnaire francois latin contenant les motz et manières de parler francois, tournez en latin | date = 1539 | publisher = Robert Estienne | year = 1539 | location  = Paris | language = fr | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spelling was far less codified back then. Rabelais, as an educated reader of the day, preferred [[etymological]] spelling which preserved words' histories to more phonetic spellings which would wash them away.

Rabelais' use of Latin, Greek, regional and dialectal terms, creative [[claque | calquing]], [[Gloss_(annotation) | gloss]], [[neologism]] and mis-translation was the fruit of the printing press having been invented less than a hundred years earlier.  A doctor by trade, Rabelais was a prolific reader, and wrote a great deal about bodies and all they excrete or ingest. His works are filled with multilingual, often sexual, puns, absurd creatures, bawdy songs and lists. Words and metaphors from Rabelais abound in modern French and some words, as mentioned above, have even found their way into English, through [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s 1693 translation.

==Views on Rabelais==
Most scholars today agree that the French author wrote from a perspective of [[Christian humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowen|1998}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This has not always been the case. [[Abel Lefranc]], in his 1922 introduction to ''Pantagruel'', depicted Rabelais as a militant anti-Christian atheist.&lt;ref name=Davis1&gt;Davis, Natalie Zemon. "Beyond Babel" in Davis &amp; Hampton, "Rabelais and His Critics". ''Occasional Papers Series'', University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[M. A. Screech]], like Lucien Febvre before him,&lt;ref name=Febvre /&gt;{{rp|329-360}} describes Rabelais as an [[Erasmus|Erasmian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Screech|1979|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabelais was Roman Catholic. Timothy Hampton writes that "to a degree unequaled by the case of any other writer from the European Renaissance, the reception of Rabelais's work has involved dispute, critical disagreement, and ... scholarly wrangling ..."&lt;ref name=Hampton&gt;Hampton, Timothy. "Language and Identities" in Davis &amp; Hampton, "Rabelais and His Critics". ''Occasional Papers Series'', University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; But at present, "whatever controversy still surrounds Rabelais studies can be found above all in the application of feminist theories to Rabelais criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Bruno Braunrot |chapter=Critical Theory | title = The Rabelais Encyclopedia | page= 45 | url = https://books.google.fr/books?id=RwjWrTd5la4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Rabelais+seemingly+misogynous&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjftsz83N3eAhULfxoKHTprAKgQ6AEILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rabelais%20seemingly%20misogynous&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing [[Jean de La Bruyère]], the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1911 wrote of Rabelais as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;... a revolutionary who attacked all the past, Scholasticism, the monks; his religion is scarcely more than that of a spiritually-minded pagan. Less bold in political matters, he cared little for liberty; his ideal was a tyrant who loves peace. [...] His vocabulary is rich and picturesque, but licentious and filthy. In short, as La Bruyère says: "His book is a riddle which may be considered inexplicable. Where it is bad, it is beyond the worst; it has the charm of the rabble; where it is good it is excellent and exquisite; it may be the daintiest of dishes." As a whole it exercises a baneful influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Georges Bertrin | title = The Catholic Encyclopedia: François Rabelais | location = New York | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | date = 1911 | access-date = 25 November 2018 |url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12619b.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In literature==
{{French literature sidebar}}

In his novel ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', [[Laurence Sterne]] quotes extensively from Rabelais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saintsbury|first1=George|title=Tristram Shandy|date=1912|publisher=JM Dent|location=London|page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Jarry]] performed, from memory, hymns of Rabelais at [[Symbolist]] [[Rachilde]]'s Tuesday [[salon (gathering)|salons]]. Jarry worked for years on an unfinished [[libretto]] for an opera by Claude Terrasse based on Pantagruel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fisher |first=Ben |title=The Pataphysician's Library: An Exploration of Alfred Jarry's Livres Pairs |publisher=Liverpool University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780853239260 |pages=95–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anatole France]] lectured on him in Argentina. [[John Cowper Powys]], [[D. B. Wyndham-Lewis]], and [[Lucien Febvre]] (one of the founders of the French historical school ''[[Annales School|Annales]]''), all wrote books about him. 

[[Mikhail Bakhtin]], a Russian philosopher and critic, derived his concepts of the [[carnivalesque]] and [[grotesque body]] from the world of Rabelais. He points to the historical loss of communal spirit after the Medieval period and speaks of carnival laughter as an "expression of social consciousness".&lt;ref name="Bakhtin1984" /&gt;{{rp|92}}

[[George Orwell]] was not an admirer of Rabelais. Writing in 1940, he called him "an exceptionally perverse, morbid writer, a case for psychoanalysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review of ''Nailcruncher'' |first= Albert |last= Cohen| work= The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', Vol. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milan Kundera]], in a 2007 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', commented on a list of the most notable works of French literature, noting with surprise and indignation that Rabelais was placed behind [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s war memoirs, and was denied the "aura of a founding figure! Yet in the eyes of nearly every great novelist of our time he is, along with [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], the founder of an entire art, the art of the novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/01/08/die-weltliteratur |title=Die Weltliteratur: European novelists and modernism |first=Milan |last=Kundera |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2017 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabelais is treated as a pivotal figure in [[Kenzaburō Ōe]]'s acceptance speech for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1994/oe-lecture.html Ōe lecture], NobelPrize.org, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The public university in [[Tours, France]] is named [[Université François Rabelais]].
* [[Honoré de Balzac]] was inspired by the works of Rabelais to write [[:fr:Les Cent Contes drolatiques|Les Cent Contes Drolatiques]] (The Hundred Humorous Tales). Balzac also pays homage to Rabelais by quoting him in more than twenty novels and the short stories of [[La Comédie humaine]] (The Human Comedy). Michel Brix wrote of Balzac that he "is obviously a son or grandson of Rabelais... He has never hidden his admiration for the author of [[:fr:Gargantua|Gargantua]] that he cites in [[Le Cousin Pons]] as "the greatest mind of modern humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Bibliothèque de la Pleiade|Bibliothèque de la Pleiade]], 1977, t.VII, p.587&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Brix,''Balzac and the Legacy of Rabelais, PUF, 2002–2005, vol. 102, p.838&lt;/ref&gt; In his story of ''Zéro, Conte Fantastique'' published in [[:fr:La Silhouette|La Silhouette]] on 3 October 1830, Balzac even adopted Rabelais's pseudonym (''Alcofribas'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Litérature fantastique &gt; Honoré de Balzac | publisher = Le Visage Vert | author = Xavier Legrand-Ferronnière | url=http://www.levisagevert.com/bibliographie-auteurs/auteurs-b/auteurs-b/b0027.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Rabelais also left a tradition at the [[University of Montpellier|University of Montpellier's Faculty of Medicine]]: no graduating medic can undergo a convocation without taking an oath under ''Rabelais's robe''. Further tributes are paid to him in other traditions of the university, such as its ''[[faluche]]'', a distinctive student headcap styled in his honour with four bands of colour emanating from its centre.
* [[5666 Rabelais|Asteroid '5666 Rabelais']] was named in honor of François Rabelais in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schmadel |first=Lutz D.|author2=International Astronomical Union |title=Dictionary of minor planet names |year=2003 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin; New York |isbn=978-3-540-00238-3 |page=480 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWrB1jPCa8AC&amp;pg=PA480|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[J. M. G. Le Clézio|Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio's]] 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] [[Nobel Prize#Ceremony|lecture]], Le Clézio referred to Rabelais as "the greatest writer in the French language".
* In France the moment at a restaurant when the waiter presents the bill is still sometimes called ''le quart d'heure de Rabelais'', in memory of a famous trick Rabelais used to get out of paying a tavern bill when he had no money.&lt;ref&gt;Brillat-Savarin, Anthelme, ''La Physiologie du Gout'', Meditiation 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Greek myth (primordial)}}
In [[Greek mythology]], the '''primordial deities''' are the first gods and goddesses born from the void of [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]]. In [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic tradition]], they are born from [[Chronos]] and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]]. [[Hesiod]]'s first (after Chaos) are [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Tartarus]], [[Eros]], [[Erebus]] and [[Nyx]]. The primordial deities [[Gaia]] and [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] give birth to the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], the [[Cyclops|Cyclopses]] and from the castration of Uranus, [[Aphrodite]]. The Titans [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] give birth to [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], [[Hades]], [[Hestia]], [[Hera]] and [[Demeter]] who [[Titanomachy|overthrow]] the Titans. The warring of the gods ends with the reign of [[Zeus]].

==Hesiod's primordial genealogy==
[[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (c. 700 BC) tells the story of the genesis of the gods. After invoking the [[Muse]]s (II.1-116), he tells of the generation of the first four primordial deities: &lt;blockquote&gt;"'''First Chaos''' came to be, but next... '''Earth'''... and dim '''Tartarus''' in the depth of the... Earth, and '''Eros'''..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Theogony of Hesiod|url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm|website = www.sacred-texts.com|access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Hesiod, the next primordial gods that come to be are:
* [[Erebus|Darkness]] and [[Nyx|Night]] (born of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]]);
* [[Aether (mythology)|Light]] and [[Hemera|Day]] (born of [[Nyx|Night]] and [[Erebus|Darkness]]);
* [[Uranus (mythology)|Heaven]] and [[Pontus (mythology)|Ocean]] (virginally born of Earth)

==Non-Hesiodic theogonies ==
The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] entertained different versions of the origin of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|primordial deities]]. Some of these stories were possibly inherited from the pre-Greek Aegean cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 2|title = The Politics of Olympus: Form and Meaning in the Major Homeric Hymns|url = https://www.amazon.com/The-Politics-Olympus-Meaning-BCPaperbacks/dp/1853996920|publisher = Bristol Classical Press|date = 2006-05-26|location = London|isbn = 9781853996924|first = Jenny Strauss|last = Clay|page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeric primordial theogony===
The ''[[Iliad]]'', an [[epic poem]] attributed to [[Homer]] about the [[Trojan War]] (an oral tradition of 700 or 600 BC), states that [[Oceanus]] (and possibly [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]], too) is the parent of all the deities.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' (Book 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Greek theogonies ===
* [[Alcman]] (fl. 7th century BC) made the water-nymph [[Thetis]] the first goddess, producing ''poros'' (path), ''tekmor'' (marker) and ''skotos'' (darkness) on the pathless, featureless void.
* [[Orpheus|Orphic]] poetry (c. 530 BC) made [[Nyx]] the first principle, ''Night'', and her offspring were many. Also, in the Orphic tradition, [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]] (a mystic Orphic deity of light and procreation, sometimes identified with the Elder Eros) is the original ruler of the universe, who hatched from the cosmic egg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Phanes.html Phanes]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aristophanes]] (c. 446 BC – c. 386 BC) wrote in his ''Birds'', that Nyx is the first deity also, and that she produced Eros from an egg.

=== Philosophical theogonies ===
Philosophers of [[Classical Greece]] also constructed their own [[cosmology#Metaphysical cosmology|metaphysical cosmogonies]], with their own primordial deities:

* [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (c. 600 – c. 550 BC) made Chronos (time) the first deity in his ''Heptamychia''.
* [[Empedocles]] (c. 490 – 430 BC) wrote that [[Philotes (mythology)|Philotes]] ("Love") and [[Neikea|Neikos]] ("Hate") were the first principles, who wove the universe out of the [[Classical element|four elements]] with their powers of love and strife.
* [[Plato]] (c. 428/427 – 348/347 BC) introduced (in ''Timaeus'') the concept of the [[demiurge]], who had modeled the universe on the [[Idea]]s.

== Interpretation of primordial deities ==
Scholars dispute the meaning of the primordial deities in the poems of Homer and Hesiod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Greek Mythology and Poetics|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GOO5Z7wqZS0C|publisher = Cornell University Press|date = 1992-01-01|isbn = 0801480485|first = Gregory|last = Nagy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the primordials give birth to the Titans, and the Titans give birth to the Olympians, one way of interpreting the primordial gods is as the deepest and most fundamental nature of the cosmos.

For example, [[Jenny Strauss Clay]] argues that Homer's poetic vision centers on the reign of Zeus, but that Hesiod's vision of the primordials put Zeus and the Olympians in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 2|title = The Politics of Olympus: Form and Meaning in the Major Homeric Hymns|url = https://www.amazon.com/The-Politics-Olympus-Meaning-BCPaperbacks/dp/1853996920|publisher = Bristol Classical Press|date = 2006-05-26|location = London|isbn = 9781853996924|first = Jenny Strauss|last = Clay|page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Vernant argues that the Olympic pantheon is a "system of classification, a particular way of ordering and conceptualizing the universe by distinguishing within it various types of powers and forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Myth and Society in Ancient Greece|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DWIbAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Harvester Press|date = 1980-01-01|isbn = 9780855279837|first = Jean Pierre|last = Vernant}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even before the Olympic pantheon were the Titans and primordial gods. Homer alludes to a more tumultuous past before Zeus was the undisputed King and Father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} The Iliad by Homer|url = http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.html|website = classics.mit.edu|access-date = 2016-01-21|pages = Book I (396–406); Book VIII (477–83)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell Miller argues that the first four primordial deities arise in a highly significant relationship. He argues that Chaos represents ''differentiation'', since Chaos differentiates (separates, divides) Tartarus and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ‘First of all’: On the Semantics and Ethics of Hesiod’s Cosmogony - Mitchell Miller - Ancient Philosophy (Philosophy Documentation Center)|url = https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=ancientphil&amp;id=ancientphil_2001_0021_0002_0251_0276&amp;onlyautologin=true|website = www.pdcnet.org|access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Chaos is "first of all" for Hesiod, Miller argues that Tartarus represents the primacy of the ''undifferentiated,'' or the [[Apeiron (cosmology)|unlimited]]. Since undifferentiation is unthinkable, Chaos is the "first of all" in that he is the first ''thinkable'' being. In this way, Chaos (the principle of division) is the natural opposite of Eros (the principle of unification). Earth (light, day, waking, life) is the natural opposite of Tartarus (darkness, night, sleep, death). These four are the parents of all the other Titans.

From the religious movements of Eastern origin that reached Estonia, beginning from the end of the 1980s, first and foremost were the ones inspired by Hinduism and Buddhism.

Hinduism and Buddhism were registered in the 1990s.

==Estimates==

The number of Hindus in Estonia is negligible. The 2000 census of [[Estonia]] showed 138 Hindus in Estonia.

This includes under the name Hindu 90 people (including 54 Estonians) and under Hare Krishna 48 (including 22 Estonians).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erm.ee/pdf/pro14/plaat.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Seventh-day Adventism}}
'''Historic Adventism''' is an informal designation for conservative individuals and organizations affiliated with the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] who seek to preserve certain traditional beliefs and practices of the church. They feel that the church leadership has shifted or departed from key doctrinal "pillars" ever since the middle of the 20th century. Specifically, they point to the publication in 1957 of a book entitled ''[[Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine]]''; which they feel undermines historic Adventist theology in favor of theology more compatible with [[evangelicalism]].&lt;ref name="Corson"&gt;{{cite journal

Historic Adventism has been erroneously applied by some to any Adventists that adhere to the teachings of the church as reflected in the church's [[28 Fundamental Beliefs|fundamental beliefs]] such as the Sabbath or the Spirit of Prophecy. They misapply those who hold to mainstream traditional Adventist beliefs as synonymous with Historic Adventist.&lt;ref name="Corson"/&gt;

Historic Adventists have tended to promote their message through [[Independent ministries of the Seventh-day Adventist Church|independent ministries]], some of which have had a strained relationship with the official church.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Hope International (Seventh-day Adventist)|Hope International]] and [[Hartland Institute]] are expressions of historic Adventism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopeintreport"/&gt;" [[Last Generation Theology]]" shares some elements with Historic Adventism, yet considers itself to have "expanded" the beliefs of Adventism to their logical conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://progressiveadventism.com/2007/01/08/interlogue-4-larry-kirkpatrick/ Interview with Larry Kirkpatrick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212071656/http://progressiveadventism.com/2007/01/08/interlogue-4-larry-kirkpatrick/ |date=2007-02-12 }} by [[Julius Nam]]&lt;/ref&gt; Historic Adventists are seen as at the opposite end of the Adventist theological spectrum from [[Progressive Adventists]]. Prominent figures supporting some of the historic views include [[M. L. Andreasen]],  and [[Standish brothers|Colin and Russell Standish]].

==History==
{{See also|History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church}}

Teachings on Christian perfection and personal holiness were present in the religious revival of the [[Great Awakening]] in America and were evident in early Adventist movements such as the "[[Holy Flesh movement]]" in [[Indiana]] around the turn of the 19th century which Ellen White quickly rebuked."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdadefend.com/Defend-foundation/counsel-Celebation.htm ''2nd Selected Messages'', p. 36-38., Ellen White]&lt;/ref&gt; They were also evident in some teachings on holiness by medical doctor [[John Harvey Kellogg]], and [[Alonzo T.

[[Joseph Bates (Adventist)|Joseph Bates]] was one of the three primary founders of Seventh-day Adventism (along with James and Ellen White). Like many in the early church he focused more on following the requirements of God's law over salvation by grace.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin McArthur, "Early Adventism's Leon Trotsky." ''Spectrum'' 33:2 (Spring 2005); [http://old.spectrummagazine.org/onlinecommunity/reviews/050706mcarthur.html alternative link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707113547/http://old.spectrummagazine.org/onlinecommunity/reviews/050706mcarthur.html |date=2010-07-07 }}&lt;!-- Preferable will be a link to the new Spectrum website, when it becomes available perhaps c. 2015 --&gt;. A review of [[George R. Knight]], ''Joseph Bates: The Real Founder of Seventh-day Adventism.'' Review and Herald, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[1919 Bible Conference]], in which Ellen White's inspiration was discussed during two days, some defended against what they felt were attacks on her such as Holmes and Washburn, who wrote open letters decrying the alleged "new theology" and the "omega" apostasy of the Adventist church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/1919bc/hal-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Lockhart (journalist)|Keith Lockhart]] has described the "[[Golden Age (metaphor)|Golden Age]]" of Adventism (from a sociological point of view) as the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] era of the 1920s–1950s. It is to this time period the expression "historic Adventism" most accurately applies, not to 19th century Adventism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Malcolm Bull, he says "Adventist fundamentalism" emerged in the 1880s, became dominant in the 1920s, and survives to the present day among conservative groups." They also claim "elements of fundamentalism were re-invoked," becoming discernible in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Seeking a Sanctuary]],'' p104&lt;/ref&gt;
:"But what many authors take to be historic Adventism is in fact a creation of the twentieth century — a synthesis that took place in the 1920s and remained dominant until the 1960s. It was, moreover, a synthesis that in itself represented an accommodation to the newly formed fundamentalist movement."&lt;ref&gt;Bull and Lockhart, ''Seeking a Sanctuary,'' p90–91, as quoted elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adventist-Evangelical dialogues===
{{See also|Questions on Doctrine}}
It is widely accepted that present historic Adventism emerged in response to the Adventist-Evangelical discussions that occurred in the spring of 1955 to the fall of 1957. These dialogues were initiated by evangelicals Donald Barnhouse and [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]], who sought clarification on what Adventists believed and took issue with a number of teachings, which at the time were generally thought to characterize Adventist theology. The most significant of these being: [[Arianism|semi-arian]] views on the GodHead; man's sinful nature taken by Christ in His incarnation; an incomplete atonement at the time of Christ's death on the cross; salvation by obedience to the law; and extreme sectarianism.&lt;ref name="samplesCRI"/&gt; At least one author considers the various streams existed earlier, as some Millerites came from churches holding Arian views, but this event polarized them.&lt;ref&gt;Lowell Tarling claims this&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adventist leaders who met with Walter Martin presented a fuller description of mainstream Adventist theology, and described the more fundamentalist views as merely the beliefs of a few. (Le Roy Edwin Froom described them as the "lunatic fringe.") In addition to showing it had clearly moved from [[Arianism|semi-arian]] views on the GodHead, the Adventists asserted that the belief that Christ took Adam's sinful nature after the fall and an incomplete atonement were not part of mainstream Adventist doctrine. Adventist historian George Knight felt it was not a complete picture as it could be, because a majority of Adventists prior to 1950 had held to these teachings concerning the nature of Christ and the atonement.&lt;ref&gt;''Questions on Doctrine: annotated edition 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin and Barnhouse were satisfied with the responses given by the Adventist delegation, and concluded that the Adventist church was a legitimate Christian body. Meanwhile, Adventist theologian [[M. L. Andreasen]], who was aware of these proceedings, openly opposed what he felt was a change concerning the nature of Christ and the atonement and represented the many Adventists who held that view. (Those Adventists who believed Christ had taken a fallen nature still believed that Jesus was sinless and committed no actual sins, but they held that it included propensity or desire to sin). Some of these Adventists continue to oppose the theological direction taken by the church leadership on these issues and the more fundamentalist elements are known today as "Historic Adventists."

[[Herbert Douglass]] has stated,
:"most, if not all, of the so-called 'dissident' or 'independent' groups of the last 45 years are direct results of the explicit and implicit positions espoused by [''Questions on Doctrine''] on the atonement and the Incarnation."&lt;ref&gt;as quoted on http://qod.andrews.edu/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[George R. Knight|George Knight]],
:"Official Adventism may have gained recognition as being Christian from the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] world, but in the process a breach had been opened which has not healed in the last 50 years and may never heal."&lt;ref&gt;George Knight, 2003 annotated edition of ''Questions on Doctrine''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
[[Desmond Ford]] convinced [[Robert Brinsmead]] his views on perfectionism were incorrect in about 1970.&lt;ref name="Land"/&gt; Robert Brinsmead himself however denies that Ford convinced him to abandon perfectionism and further states that he abandoned perfectionism as a result of his intensive study of the issues of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther, and justification by faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presenttruthmag.com/mailbox/A%20Dialogue%20with%20Bob.htm|title=A Dialogue with a Former Christian Believer|website=www.presenttruthmag.com|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1970s, what is now the ''[[Adventist Review]]'' carried articles by editor [[Kenneth H. Wood|Kenneth Wood]] and associate editor [[Herbert E. Douglass|Herbert Douglass]] rejecting ''Questions on Doctrine'' and arguing for a final perfect generation.&lt;ref name="Land"&gt;"Righteousness by Faith" entry in ''Historical Dictionary of Seventh-day Adventists'' by [[Gary Land]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Conference addressed this controversy over "righteousness by faith" by holding a conference in [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], [[California]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="Land"/&gt; Ford was the "center of attention," and the resulting document known as the "[http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RH/RH1976-22/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=4 Palmdale Statement]"{{DjVulink}}.&lt;ref name="Shaking1"&gt;[http://www.presenttruthmag.com/7dayadventist/shaking/1.html Adventists: Heirs of the Reformation], chapter 1 of ''[http://www.presenttruthmag.com/7dayadventist/shaking/index.html The Shaking of Adventism]'' by Geoffrey J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the controversy continued and critics of the "new theology" of Ford and others formed institutions to respond them.&lt;ref name="Land"/&gt;

[[Julius Nam]] has written,
:"However, the theological heirs of Andreasen have found such developments deeply troubling. Since 1971, several independent ministry groups have arisen within the Adventist church that have self-consciously embraced Andreasen's [[postlapsarian]] views and the accompanying theology of the final generation, which they believe is supported by the writings of Ellen White. Since their inception, these groups have warned against the evangelicalization of Adventism and have issued calls to the church at large to return to the Adventism of the pre-''Questions on Doctrine'' era. Like Andreasen, they have seen the Adventist-evangelical conferences and the publication of ''Questions on Doctrine'' as the beginning of the end-time apostasy. From the perspective of these groups, the prelapsarian view advocated by ''Questions on Doctrine'' and embraced by many Adventists is another sign of the apostasy that continues in the church. They view Adventism as a movement that is to be deliberately separate from other groups such as evangelicals. Their vision of Adventism is a movement that is preparing the final generation of Christians who will ultimately overcome sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 1975 book ''Perfection: The Impossible Possibility'' ([[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]: [[Southern Publishing Association]], 1975) edited by Douglass, contained essays by Douglass and C. Mervyn Maxwell supporting traditional Adventist views, and [[Edward Heppenstall]] and [[Hans LaRondelle]] supporting their view.

==Theology==
Historic Adventist theology tends to differ from mainstream Adventist theology in the areas of [[Christology]], [[hamartiology]] (sin), [[soteriology]] (salvation) and [[eschatology]] (end times). They often use the term "new theology" as a pejorative term for perceived doctrinal shifts in the church.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book|author=Colin D. Standish and Russell R. Standish|title=Deceptions of the New Theology|publisher=Hartland Publications|year=1989|isbn=978-0-923309-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to Christology, according to Adventist historian George Knight, most early Adventists believed that Jesus Christ was born with a human nature that was not only physically frail and subject to temptation, but that he also had the fallen predisposition and inclination to sin.&lt;ref&gt;Questions on Doctrine, annotated edition, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1950, the "historic" wing of the church continues to hold this "fallen" view of Christ's human nature, though it is now a minority position among theologians and mainstream Adventism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Historic Adventists, like mainstream Adventists, believe that [[sin]] is defined in terms of personal transgressions of the commandments, over against an inborn corruption of the human nature inherited from Adam.&lt;ref name="WhiddenQod"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gerhard Pfandl|title=Some Thoughts on Original Sin|publisher=[[Biblical Research Institute]], General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

"Eschatological perfectionism" is the teaching that a final generation of believers must achieve a state of perfection or complete sinlessness in the final period just before the [[second coming]] of Jesus (see [[Last Generation Theology]]) and most Historic Adventists hold to that teaching. This belief in sinlessness arose particularly from [[M. L. Andreasen]]'s interpretation of the [[investigative judgment]] doctrine, which is one of the pillars of Adventism and found in [[The Great Controversy (book)|''The Great Controversy'']] by [[Ellen G. White]].&lt;ref name="samplesCRI"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Samples|title=From Controversy to Crisis: An Updated Assessment of Seventh-day Adventism|publisher=Christian Research Institute|url=http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0005b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Anthony A.

Historic Adventists generally place more emphasis on the writings of Ellen G. White as a doctrinal authority compared to mainstream Adventists, some considering her writings as [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] and having near-equivalent status to the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name="Corson"/&gt;

Historic Adventists have a differing perspective on the [[1888 Minneapolis General Conference]] arguing that Ellen White in addition to have supported Jones and Waggoner, but also perfectionistic theology, which some say came from them.&lt;ref name="Whidden"&gt;{{cite web

Some historic Adventists, like many mainstream Adventists, are advocates of the [[King James Only movement]], which promotes sole use of the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]] of the Bible. (A classic book in this movement, ''[[Our Authorized Bible Vindicated]]'' (1930), was written by an Adventist, [[Benjamin G. Wilkinson]]. One critique is by [[Alden Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;Alden Thompson, [http://www.wallawalla.edu/fileadmin/user_upload/theology/Alden_Thompson/Writings/Unpublished_Papers/B.G._Wilkinson_s_Our_Authorized_Bible_Vindicated_-_a_Critique.rtf critique] ([[Rich Text Format|RTF]]).

=== Last Generation Theology ===
{{Main article|Last Generation Theology}}
'''Last Generation Theology''' (LGT) or "'''final generation'''" '''theology''' is a belief system held by some conservative members of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], which claims that [[Christian perfection|perfection]] like the [[144,000]] will be achieved by some people in the last generation before the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]]. It is closely related to "historic Adventism," but as one supporter claims, it differs in that it forms an extension or development of traditional Adventist beliefs, or takes them to their logical conclusion.

==Criticism==
Mainstream and [[progressive Adventists]] have criticised the use of the term "historic." It is observed that numerous doctrinal positions that were common among the Adventist pioneers are generally not held by those who profess to be "historic Adventists," such as semi-[[Arianism]], what time of day the Sabbath should begin, certain understandings of Systematic Benevolence, the "shut door," and the personhood of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name="Whidden"/&gt;  It is argued that the over-valuing of "historic" beliefs leads to an unhelpful neglect of "new light" and "present truth," which Adventists have always held as defining beliefs.

[[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] labeled most of the historic Adventists he encountered as "legalists," "worshippers of Ellen White" and the "lunatic fringe."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Martin Interview, ''[[Adventist Currents]]'', Vol. 1, No. 1, July, 1983, conducted by Douglas Hackleman.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was earlier used by [[LeRoy Edwin Froom]] when Adventist leaders met with Martin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0005b.html CRI Journal - CRJ0005B&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adventist historian [[Milton Hook]] describes it as "Adventist fundamentalism." He cites the aggressive preaching style of George Burnside who attacked Roman Catholics and "apostate" Protestants. Hook says this turned many away, and some of the remaining merely "loved a religious dogfight," and converts "often generated dust storms of intolerance and became clones of militant dogmatism among their peers." He states this style of evangelism was once the norm among Adventist preachers, and had roots in 19th century Methodism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Andy Nash wrote that while working at the ''Adventist Review,'' he was "often perplexed about how our ability to function at the magazine was disrupted by some folk on the conservative extreme." In response to articles on worship, they would get many critical letters that were based more on tradition than on the Bible. They would airbrush jewelry out of photos to placate some readers.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Nash, "[http://www.adventistreview.org/issue.php?issue=2010-1511&amp;page=18 Meet @ the Text: The Case for a Strong Adventist Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917183844/http://adventistreview.org/issue.php?issue=2010-1511&amp;page=18 |date=2010-09-17 }}." ''Adventist Review'' 187 (April 15, 2010), p18–21. Article featured on magazine cover&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic Adventists look favorably on a past era of the church. Phil Dunham, a fairly conservative author himself, critiqued "nostalgia about the good old days of 'historic Adventism.' In some people's minds it seems to be a time of the most unblemished and unassailable doctrinal positions, the highest possible moral standards, the deepest spiritual maturity, the best snowlike purity, the utmost in readiness to be translated.[…] But the way we often use the expression 'historic Seventh-day Adventism' is built on an idealized and unrealistic notion of what our early church was really like."&lt;ref&gt;Philip W. Dunham with Maylan Schurch, ''Blinded by the Light: The Anatomy of Apostasy.'' Hagerstown, MD: Review and Herald, 2001, p93–94&lt;/ref&gt;
:"These days a lot of well-meaning people yearn for the supposedly purer days of the past. They feel that if they could just retrieve historic Seventh-day Adventism and bathe in its supposedly clearer waters, they'd be better able to resist last-day influences.
:'Back then,' they assert, 'people had a higher level of spirituality — and a lower rate of problems. Back then apostasy was somehow banned, or at least kept at bay.'
:Not true. Not true for historic Seventh-day Adventism. Not true for the historic church of Christ — the New Testament church. Not true for the seventh-day church in the wilderness—historic [[Judaism]]. Not true even for the First Church of Eden, because its entire two-member congregation ran and hid in naked apostasy.
:No, you can't just change your group's name, or meet in a Grange Hall someplace, to escape apostasy. The seeds of apostasy grow not in a name or a place or a time — but in the hearts of every person on this planet since Adam and Eve.[…]"&lt;ref&gt;Dunham, p67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:YellowChurchBillboard.jpg|thumb|right|Historic Adventist roadside [[Billboard (advertising)|billboard]]. Text reads, ''"SATURDAY the True Lord's Day Changed by Antichrist &lt;small&gt;{{bibleverse||Dan.|7:25|KJV}}&lt;/small&gt;'']]

===Responses to criticism===
In response, some historic Adventists have claimed that they are loving in their evangelism and deny that the charge of fanaticism applies to them. They quote statements by Ellen White to support their view. For instance:

: "Men will misrepresent the doctrines we believe and teach as Bible truth, and it is necessary that wise plans should be laid to secure the privilege of inserting articles into the secular papers; for this will be a means of awakening souls to see the truth. God will raise up men who will be qualified to sow beside all waters. God has given great light upon important truths, and it must come to the world."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen G. White, Letter 1, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

: "We must take every justifiable means of bringing the light before the people. Let the press be utilized, and let every advertising agency be employed that will call attention to the work. This should not be regarded as nonessential. On every street corner you may see placards and notices calling attention to various things that are going on, some of them of the most objectionable character; and shall those who have the light of life be satisfied with feeble efforts to call the attention of the masses to the truth?"&lt;ref&gt;Ellen G. White, Evangelism, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodist scholar [[Donald Dayton]] expressed some sympathies for historic Adventists in his paper presented at the [[Questions on Doctrine#50th anniversary conference|''Questions on Doctrine'' 50th anniversary conference]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://qod.andrews.edu/docs/10_donald_dayton.pdf Some Reflections on Adventist Identity by a 'Sympathetic Outsider' on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Publication of ''Questions on Doctrine'']" by Donald Dayton. ''Questions on Doctrine'' 50th anniversary conference, 2007. Accessed 2008-04-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official church reaction==
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] has officially reacted to two organizations that some say have "historic Adventist" theology, Hope International, and the Hartland Institute (USA) and [[Remnant Ministries]] (Australia). In 1998, the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference]] established a committee to evaluate the beliefs and activities and the committee produced a report expressing "serious concerns with respect to the nature and purpose of Hope International and associates."&lt;ref name="Hopeintreport"&gt;[http://www.adventistreview.org/2000-1538/hope-international.html Report on Hope International and Associated Groups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512182701/http://www.adventistreview.org/2000-1538/hope-international.html |date=2006-05-12 }}, Adventist Review, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
		 
The conclusion of the report stated that "by rejecting the authority of the [[General Conference Session|world church in session]] when their interpretation of Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy differs from that of the church, Hope International and associates have set their authority above that of the world church and operate in a manner that is consistent with offshoot movements." The report also contained a significant escalation: "If Hope International and associates cannot bring themselves into harmony with the body of the world church, clearly evidenced within 12 months, the Seventh-day Adventist Church may need to consider whether there exists a "persistent refusal to recognize properly constituted church authority or to submit to the order and discipline of the church" (Church Manual, p.&amp;nbsp;169)."&lt;ref name="Hopeintreport"/&gt; 	

According to one article, the policy of the [[North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists|Adventist church in North America]] is that members of Hartland or Hope International may not hold any church office.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.atoday.com/magazine/1998/07/living-remnant-0 Living with the Remnant]" by Debra Lloyd Foote. ''Adventist Today'' [http://www.atoday.com/magazine/1998/07 6:4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations and people==

===Para-church ministries===
In addition to Hope International (Seventh-day Adventist), and the [[Hartland Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;''Seeking a Sanctuary''&lt;/ref&gt; there are a number of para-church organizations that assist in the articulation and defense of the Historic Adventists' views. Hope International, formerly led by Ron Spear, runs a publishing ministry and a health center. Hartland Institute comprises an educational college and health center associated with Colin Standish (who founded the organization ). It publishes their books and others, as well as ''Last Generation'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Hartland"&gt;"Hartland Institute of Health and Education" in ''Historical Dictionary of Seventh-day Adventists'' by [[Gary Land]]. See [http://www.hartland.edu/ Hartland College, Lifestyle Center, Publications and Natural Farm website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Remnant Ministries''' was founded by Russell Standish&lt;ref name="QOD"&gt;[http://qod.andrews.edu/presenters.html Presenters at the ''Questions on Doctrine'' 50th Anniversary Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; and is based in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventistreview.org/2000-1538/hope-international.html Adventist Review: Hope International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512182701/http://www.adventistreview.org/2000-1538/hope-international.html |date=2006-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arthur Patrick, "Looking back on the painful saga of the 'Concerned Brethren' from 1974 to the present, it is apparent that a better application of essentials for effective pastoral care may have alleviated some of the controversy."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/white/patrick/egw-retrospect.htm Ellen White and South Pacific Adventism: Retrospect and Prospect]" by Arthur Patrick&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "Following the conflicts that gained intensity in the 1950s, during the 1970s the Adventist Church in Australasia made significant progress in better understanding and presenting 'the everlasting gospel;' but it failed to win the support of certain older members.

==== Adventist Laymen's Fellowship ====
The Adventist Laymen's Fellowship (ALF) was founded in 1979 to counter the growing Desmond Ford movement in Australia. They held a series of weekend meetings at Vision Valley, outside Sydney, to which local and overseas conservative Adventist speakers were invited and to which several thousand Adventists attended over several years. Early speakers included Colin Standish, Ralph Larson, George Burnside, Austin Cooke, Mervyn Maxwell, Leroy Moore, Dennis Priebe and others. They also published a magazine for several years named ''Landmarks.'' The ALF succumbed to theological unorthodoxy and disbanded about 1986.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2009}}

'''Alfred Howard Carter''' (3 January 1891 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1971), better known as '''Howard Carter''', was a pioneer in the [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian]] faith.&lt;ref name=pof&gt;{{cite book |last=Sumrall |first=Lester |authorlink=Lester Sumrall |coauthors= |title=Pioneers of Faith |year=1995 |publisher=[[Harrison House (publisher)|Harrison House]] |quote= | url= |isbn=0-89274-742-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Crown Mission==
Carter was born in [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Keith|last=Malcomson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Alfred Howard Carter |url=http://www.pentecostalpioneers.org/subpage11.html |quote=Howard Carter was born in Birmingham into an unsaved but religious Anglican home.

His British father married his mother a descendant of French nobility. Growing up Howard Carter had a speech impediment and suffered much embarrassment in school. Even with speech therapy he still had difficulty throughout his life pronouncing r's. Still, Howard had a passion for study and a love for art. He entered art school where he studied portraiture and life drawing. At twelve his work was displayed in the London Gallery of Art. |publisher=Jonas Clark | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080327064639/http://www.jonasclark.com/news/128/ARTICLE/1113/2008-01-28.html| archivedate= 27 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took over England's first Pentecostal Bible School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harrisonhouse.com/BookDetails.aspx?ISBN=9781577940654 |title=Questions and Answers on Spiritual Gifts |accessdate=8 March 2008 |quote=Howard Carter pioneered a quest for revelation of this supernatural subject and was regarded as an authority on the gifts of the Spirit. He took over England's first Pentecostal Bible School and helped to establish a major denomination in that country. |publisher=Harrison House (publisher }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913 an organization called the Crown Mission began in the city, and shortly afterwards Carter became the leader of this group. By 1916 he became involved in a second Pentecostal work, and had to quit his regular work to maintain leadership of the two churches.

==In prison==
In [[World War I]], Carter was imprisoned in [[Wormwood Scrubs]] as a [[conscientious objector]], and then spent time in Princetown Work Centre in the former [[Dartmoor Prison]].  While in prison he claimed to have received the revelation of the nine [[gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. These teachings, based on the text of 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, are still used today as the primary teaching on the gifts of the Spirit within all major Pentecostal Christian belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brothermel.com/howardcarterariseyoungman.aspx |title=Howard Carter's Story |accessdate=8 March 2008 |quote=Prison was a difficult test and trial, but rather than causing him to lose faith in God, it drove him closer to God. And God honored Carter's convictions, by visiting him in prison. God began revealing to Carter deep truths concerning the Gifts of the Holy Spirit. |publisher=Brother Mel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006074950/http://brothermel.com/howardcarterariseyoungman.aspx |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 4 September 1918 to 11 June 1919 he was a 'brother' on the staff of Wallingford Farm Training Colony, an institution run by the National Union for Christian Social Service for 'difficult' boys mainly referred by Boards of Guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Register of Brothers, Turners Court Youth Trust Archive, Oxon County Record Office&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hampstead Bible School==
In 1921, Carter was handed over leadership of [[Hampstead]] Bible School, originally to be on a temporary basis until a more suitable person was available to fill the opening. That never happened, as he held this position for some 27 years. Under Carter's leadership the school grew so much that they had to purchase a nearby house, and two more Bible schools were opened up.

He took his work so seriously at the school that he did not receive any of the money donated to the school for his own use unless it was marked specifically for him, and he paid his own room and board to the school out of his salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malcomson |first=Keith |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Pentecostal Pioneers Remembered |year= |publisher= |quote= | url= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assemblies of God==
Howard Carter later became a founding member of [[Assemblies of God in Great Britain|Assemblies of God in Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;John Nelson Parr, ''Incredible'' (published by the author, Fleetwood, Lancs., England, 1972), Chapters 6 and 7, and Appendix A. [http://johnedwardcooper.blogspot.com/2009/02/incredible-autobiography-of-john-nelson.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the General Council of these groups as vice-chairman 1929-1934, and as chairman 1934-1945.

==His final days==
Howard Carter left the Hampstead Bible School in 1948&lt;ref name="Pent. Dict."&gt;{{cite book|last=Bundy|first=David D.|title=The new international dictionary of Pentecostal and charismatic movements.|year=2002|publisher=Zondervan Pub.

Burgess|page=456|chapter=Carter, Alfred Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to the [[United States]] where he eventually married Ruth (Fisher) Steelberg.  She was the daughter of Elmer Kirk Fisher, who was the founder of the Upper Room Mission in Los Angeles, California.  She had previously been married to Wesley Rowland Steelberg, who was general superintendent of the Assemblies of God U.S.A. Steelberg had died while on a trip to Wales in 1952. Carter spent the rest of his life in the U.S., and began to travel extensively as a preacher until his death in [[Springfield, Missouri]], in 1971. His final days lasted 23 years.

==Lester Sumrall ==
Howard Carter and [[Lester Sumrall]] first met in [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]] when Carter was in his forties and Sumrall was in his early twenties. They formed an immediate relationship and traveled the world together as missionaries preaching the [[Gospel of Jesus Christ]]. Sumrall wrote about Carter in his books ''Adventuring with Christ'' and ''Pioneers of Faith''. Sumrall also expounded on Carter's teachings of the nine [[gifts of the Spirit]] in his book ''The Gifts and Ministries of the Holy Spirit''.&lt;ref name=pof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although Carter played such a significant part in the expansion of the Pentecostal message throughout the world, few of his recorded sermons exist to today.  One sermon is available for sale through the Flower Pentecostal Heritage Center, of the Assemblies of God, in [[Springfield, Missouri]].  Other rare recordings of Carter are available to listen to, by download for free, at www.brothermel.com.  In these recordings, Howard Carter is preaching at the First Assembly of God in Pasadena, Texas in 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hoysala architecture''' is the building style developed under the rule of the [[Hoysala Empire]] between the 11th and 14th centuries, in the region known today as [[Karnataka]], a [[States and territories of India|state of India]]. Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the [[Deccan Plateau|Southern Deccan]] Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]].&lt;ref name="kdravida"&gt;Hardy (1995), pp243–245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="great"&gt;Foekema (1996), p47, p59, p87&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Hoysala craftsmanship are the temples at [[Veera Narayana Temple, Belavadi|Belavadi]], [[Amrutesvara Temple, Amruthapura|Amruthapura]], [[Lakshminarayana Temple (Hosaholalu)|Hosaholalu]], [[Nageshvara-Chennakeshava Temple complex, Mosale|Mosale]], [[Ishvara Temple (Arasikere)|Arasikere]], [[Mallikarjuna Temple, Basaralu|Basaralu]], [[Brahmeshvara Temple, Kikkeri|Kikkeri]] and [[Lakshmi Narasimha Temple, Nuggehalli|Nuggehalli]].&lt;ref name="hardy_list"&gt;Hardy (1995), p320, p321, p324, p325, p329, p332, p334, p339, p340, p346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foekema_list"&gt;Foekema (1996), p53, p37, p71, p81, p41, p43, p83&lt;/ref&gt; Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] influence while the impact of [[Southern India]]n style is more distinct.&lt;ref name="distinct"&gt;[[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] in Kamath (2001), p134&lt;/ref&gt;

Temples built prior to Hoysala independence in the mid-12th century reflect significant Western Chalukya influences, while later temples retain some features salient to [[Western Chalukya architecture]] but have additional inventive decoration and ornamentation, features unique to Hoysala artisans. Some three hundred temples are known to survive in present-day Karnataka state and many more are mentioned in inscriptions, though only about seventy have been documented. The greatest concentration of these are in the [[Malnad]] (hill) districts, the native home of the Hoysala kings.&lt;ref name="nativehome"&gt;Hardy (1995), p244&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Relief sculpture of the Hindu god Narayana with his consort Lakshmi (Lakshminarayana) in the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Vishnu with Lakshmi (''Lakshminarayana'') at [[Halebidu]]]]

Hoysala architecture is classified by the influential scholar [[Adam Hardy]] as part of the ''Karnata Dravida'' tradition, a trend within [[Dravidian architecture]] in the Deccan that is distinct from the [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] style of further south.  Other terms for the tradition are [[Vesara]], and Chalukya architecture, divided into early [[Badami Chalukya architecture]] and the [[Western Chalukya architecture]] which immediately preceded the Hoysalas. The whole tradition covers a period of about seven centuries began in the 7th century under the patronage of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] of [[Badami]], developed further under the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta]] during the 9th and 10th centuries and the [[Western Chalukya Empire|Western Chalukyas]] (or Later Chalukyas) of [[Basavakalyan]] in the 11th and 12th centuries. Its final development stage and transformation into an independent style was during the rule of the Hoysalas in the 12th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref name="flourish"&gt;Hardy (1995), pp6-7, section ''Introduction-Dynasties and Periods''&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval inscriptions displayed prominently at temple locations give information about donations made toward the maintenance of the temple, details of consecration and on occasion, even architectural details.&lt;ref name="epigraph"&gt;Foekema (2003), p18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple deities==
[[Image:Relief sculpture of the Hindu god Shiva with his consort Parvati riding Nandi the bull in the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Shiva, Parvati, Nandi at [[Halebidu]]]]

Hinduism is a combination of secular and sacred beliefs, rituals, daily practices and traditions that has evolved over the course of over two thousand years and embodies complex symbolism combining the natural world with philosophy.
Hindu temples began as simple shrines housing a deity and by the time of the Hoysalas had evolved into well articulated edifices in which worshippers sought transcendence of the daily world. Hoysala temples were not limited to any specific organised tradition of Hinduism and encouraged pilgrims of different Hindu [[devotional movements]]. The Hoysalas usually dedicated their temples to [[Shiva]] or to [[Vishnu]] (two of the popular Hindu gods), but they occasionally built some temples dedicated to the Jain faith as well. Worshippers of Shiva are called Shaivas and worshippers of Vishnu are called [[Vaishnava]]s.&lt;ref name="worship"&gt;Foekema (1996), pp19-20, chapter-''The dedications and names of temples''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iconography"&gt;Hardy (1995), p245&lt;/ref&gt; While King [[Vishnuvardhana]] and his descendants were Vaishnava by faith,&lt;ref name="vaishnava"&gt;Kamath (2001), p132&lt;/ref&gt; records show that the Hoysalas maintained religious harmony by building as many temples dedicated to Shiva as they did to Vishnu.&lt;ref name="equal"&gt;Foekema (1996), p19&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most of these temples have secular features with broad themes depicted in their sculptures. This can be seen in the famous [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] dedicated to Vishnu and in the [[Hoysaleswara temple]] at [[Halebidu]] dedicated to Shiva. The Kesava temple at [[Somanathapura]] is different in that its ornamentation is strictly Vaishnavan. Generally Vaishnava temples are dedicated to [[Keshava]] (or to Chennakeshava, meaning "Beautiful Vishnu") while a small number are dedicated to Lakshminarayana and Lakshminarasimha (Narayana and Narasimha both being [[Avatar]]s, or physical manifestations, of Vishnu) with [[Lakshmi]], consort of Vishnu, seated at his feet. Temples dedicated to Vishnu are always named after the deity.&lt;ref name="secular"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Hoysala Heritage |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |author=Settar S. |publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu |work=Frontline, Volume 20 – Issue 08, April 12–25, 2003 |accessdate=13 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] temples have a [[Lingam|Shiva linga]], symbol of fertility and the universal symbol of Shiva, in the [[shrine]]. The names of Shiva temples can end with the suffix ''eshwara'' meaning "Lord of". The name "Hoysaleswara", for instance, means "Lord of Hoysala". The temple can also be named after the devotee who commissioned the construction of the temple, an example being the Bucesvara temple at Koravangala, named after the devotee Buci.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;Foekema (1996), p19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The most striking sculptural decorations are the horizontal rows of mouldings with detailed [[relief]], and intricately carved images of gods, goddesses and their attendants on the outer temple wall panels.&lt;ref name="horizontal"&gt;Kamath (2001), p134&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doddagaddavalli]] Lakshmi Devi ("Goddess of Wealth") Temple is an exception as it is dedicated to neither Vishnu nor Shiva. The defeat of the Jain [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] (of present-day south Karnataka) by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of [[Vaishnava|Vaishnava Hinduism]] and [[Virashaivism]] in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="jain"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp 112, 132&lt;/ref&gt; However, two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. The Hoysalas built [[Jain]] temples to satisfy the needs of its Jain population, a few of which have survived in [[Halebidu]] containing icons of Jain [[tirthankaras]]. They constructed stepped wells called ''Pushkarni'' or ''Kalyani'', the ornate [[temple tank|tank]] at Hulikere being an example. The tank has twelve minor shrines containing Hindu deities.&lt;ref name="tank"&gt;Foekema (1996), plate 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main deities found in Hoysala temple sculpture are Shiva and Vishnu in their various forms and avatars (incarnations). Shiva is usually shown with four arms holding a [[trident]] and a small drum among other emblems that symbolise objects worshiped independently of the divine image with which they are associated.&lt;ref name="Shiva"&gt;Foekema (1996), p31, chapter:''Recognizing the most important deities''&lt;/ref&gt; Any male icon portrayed in this way is Shiva although a female icon may sometimes be portrayed with these attributes as Shiva's consort, [[Parvati]]. Various depictions of Lord [[Shiva]] exist: showing him naked (fully or partially), in action such as slaying a demon ([[Andhaka]]) or dancing on the head of a slain elephant ([[Gajasura]]) and holding its skin up behind his back. He is often accompanied by his consort Parvati or shown with [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] the bull. He may be represented as [[Bhairava]], another of [[Shiva]]'s many manifestations.&lt;ref name="Shiva"/&gt;

A male figure depicted holding certain objects such as a [[conch]] (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, [[Lakshmi]]. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] and a [[Kaumodaki]] (mace). These can be held in any of the icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name.&lt;ref name="vishnu"&gt;Foekema (1996), p32, chapter:''Recognizing the most important deities''&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his [[Dashavatara|''ten avataras'']], which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as [[Shesha]]), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on his lap (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on his lap ([[Narasimha|Lakshminarasimha]]), with head of a boar walking over a demon ([[Varaha]]), in the [[Krishna]] avatar (as [[Sree Venugopala|Venugopala]] or the cow herder playing the [[Venu]] (flute), dancing on the head of the snake [[Kaliya]], lifting a hill such as [[Govardhan Hill|Govardhana]]), with his feet over head of a small figure (''[[Vamana]]''), along with [[Indra]] riding an elephant, with [[Lakshmi]] seated on [[Garuda]], and the eagle (stealing the [[Parijata|parijata tree]]).&lt;ref name="vishnu"/&gt;

[[File:View_of_Akkana_Basadi_from_northeastern_side_at_Shravanabelagola.jpg|thumb|[[Akkana Basadi]] at [[Shravanbelgola]]]]

The focus of a temple is the centre or [[sanctum sanctorum]] ([[garbhagriha]]) where the image of the deity resides, so temple architecture is designed to move the devotee from outside to the garbhagriha through ambulatory passageways for [[circumambulation]] and halls or chambers (''[[mantapa]]s'') that become increasingly sacred as the deity is approached.
Hoysala temples have distinct parts that are merged to form a unified organic whole, in contrast to the temples of [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil country]] where different parts of a temple stand independently.&lt;ref name="cross-in-square"&gt;Foekema (1996), p21&lt;/ref&gt; Although superficially unique, Hoysala temples resemble each other structurally. They are characterised by a complex profusion of sculpture decorating all the temple parts chiselled of soft [[soapstone]] (chloritic schist), a good material for intricate [[stone carving|carving]], executed mostly by local craftsmen, and exhibit architectural features that distinguish them from other temple architectures of South India.&lt;ref name="soap"&gt;Kamath (2001), p136&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Hoysala temples have a plain covered entrance [[porch]] supported by [[lathe]] turned (circular or bell-shaped) [[columns|pillars]] which were sometimes further carved with deep fluting and moulded with decorative motifs. The temples may be built upon a platform raised by about a metre called a "[[jagati (temple)|jagati]]". The ''jagati'', apart from giving a raised look to the temple, serves as a ''[[pradakshina]]patha'' or "[[circumambulation]] path" for circumambulation around the temple, as the ''[[Garbhagriha|garbagriha]]'' ([[Sanctum sanctorum|inner sanctum]]) provides no such feature.&lt;ref name="pradakshina"&gt;Kamath (2001), p135&lt;/ref&gt; Such temples will have an additional set of steps leading to an open ''[[mantapa]]'' (open hall) with [[parapet]] walls. A good example of this style is the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]]. The ''jagati'' which is in unity with the rest of the temple&lt;ref name="inaccurate"&gt;Foekema (1996), p25&lt;/ref&gt; follows a star-shaped design and the walls of the temple follow a zig-zag pattern, a Hoysala innovation.&lt;ref name="innovate"&gt;{{Cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Religion, Literature, Art and Architecture in Hoysala Empire |url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm |author=Arthikaje |publisher=1998–2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc |work= |accessdate=13 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104123316/http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka32.htm |archivedate=4 November 2006 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotees can first complete a ritual circumambulation on the ''jagati'' starting from the main entrance by walking in a clockwise direction (towards the left) before entering the ''mantapa'', following the sculptural clockwise-sequenced [[reliefs]] on the outer temple walls depicting a sequence of epic scenes from the Hindu epics. Temples that are not built on a ''jagati'' can have steps flanked by elephant balustrades ([[parapet]]s) that lead to the ''mantapa'' from ground level. An example of a temple that does not exhibit the raised platform is the ''Bucesvara'' temple in Korvangla, [[Hassan District]]. In temples with two shrines (''dvikuta''), the ''[[vimana (shrine)|vimanas]]'' (the shrines or [[cella]]e) may be placed either next to each other or on opposite sides.&lt;ref name="adjacent"&gt;The Hoysaleswara shrine and the Shantaleswara shrine in the Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebidu are examples. (Foekema 1996, p59)&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakshmidevi temple at [[Doddagaddavalli]] is unique to Hoysala architecture as it has four shrines around a common centre and a fifth shrine within the same complex for the deity Bhairava (a form of Shiva).&lt;ref name="panchakuta"&gt;Foekema (1996), p25, p57, section:''Dodda Gadduvalli''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, four minor shrines exist at each corner of the courtyard (''[[prakaram]]'').&lt;ref name="courtyard"&gt;Hardy (1995), p246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural elements==

===Mantapa===
[[Image:Belur2 retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Ornate [[lintel (architecture)|lintel]] over mantapa entrance in Chennakeshava temple, Belur]]
[[File:Domical bay ceiling art in outer mantapa of Veeranarayana temple at Belavadi.JPG|thumb|upright|Ornate bay ceiling in mantapa in the [[Veera Narayana Temple, Belavadi]], a common feature in Hoysala temples]]
The ''[[mantapa]]'' is the hall where groups of people gather during prayers. The entrance to the ''mantapa'' normally has a highly ornate overhead [[lintel]] called a ''makaratorana'' (''makara'' is an imaginary beast and ''torana'' is an overhead decoration).&lt;ref name="pradakshina" /&gt; The open ''mantapa'' which serves the purpose of an outer hall (outer ''mantapa'') is a regular feature in larger Hoysala temples leading to an inner small closed ''mantapa'' and the shrine(s). The open ''mantapas'' which are often spacious have seating areas (''asana'') made of stone with the ''mantapa's'' parapet wall acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the parapet wall.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;Foekema (1996), pp22-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quad"/&gt; The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars that create many bays.&lt;ref name="bay"&gt;A bay is a square or rectangular compartment in the hall (Foekema 1996, p93)&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the open ''mantapa'' is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples.&lt;ref name="stagger"&gt;This is also called "cross-in-square" style and is not a square (Foekema, 1996, p22)&lt;/ref&gt; Even the smallest open ''mantapa'' has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The ''mantapa'' ceiling is generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contains sculptural depictions of banana bud motifs and other such decorations.&lt;ref name="banana"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Here, the past unfolds itself in all its glory &amp; might—Hoyasala architecture in Somanathapura |url=http://www.chitralakshana.com/hoysalas.html |author=Githa U.B. |publisher=Chitralakshana |work=[[Deccan Herald]]|date= 11 May 2004 |accessdate=13 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chikkamagalur Amritheswara navaranga retouched.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Open ''Mantapa'' with shining, lathe-turned pillars at [[Amrutesvara Temple, Amruthapura]]]]

If the temple is small it will consist of only a closed ''mantapa'' (enclosed with walls extending all the way to the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed ''mantapa'', well decorated inside and out, is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the ''mantapa'' and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;The four pillars and nine bays of a closed ''mantapa'' is a norm in Hoysala temples (Foekema 1996, p22)&lt;/ref&gt; Pierced stone screens (''[[Jali]]'' or [[Latticework]]) that serve as windows in the ''navaranga'' (hall) and ''Sabhamantapa'' (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.&lt;ref name="pradakshina"&gt;Kamath (2001), p135&lt;/ref&gt;

A porch adorns the entrance to a closed ''mantapa'', consisting of an awning supported by two half-pillars ([[engaged column]]s) and two parapets, all richly decorated. The closed ''mantapa'' is connected to the shrine(s) by a vestibule, a square area that also connects the shrines. Its outer walls are decorated, but as the size the vestibule is not large, this may not be a conspicuous part of the temple. The vestibule also has a short tower called the ''[[sukanasa|sukanasi]]'' or "nose" upon which is mounted the Hoysala emblem. In [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] and [[Halebidu]], these sculptures are quite large and are placed at all doorways.&lt;ref name="nose"&gt;It is called a "nose" because it projects from the main tower over the entrance to it (Foekema 1996, p22)&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer and inner ''mantapa'' (open and closed) have circular lathe-turned pillars&lt;ref name="lathe"&gt;This is a common feature of Western Chalukya-Hoysala temples: (Kamath 2001, p117)&lt;/ref&gt; having four brackets at the top. Over each bracket stands sculptured figure(s) called ''[[salabhanjika]]'' or ''madanika''. The pillars may also exhibit ornamental carvings on the surface and no two pillars are alike.&lt;ref name="unique"&gt;It is possible that the Hoysalas encouraged different groups of artists to execute pillars and these groups may have been in competition to produce unique pillars, (Sastri 1955, p429)&lt;/ref&gt; This is how Hoysala art differs from the work of their early overlords, the [[Western Chalukyas]], who added sculptural details to the circular pillar base and left the top plain. The lathe-turned pillars are 16, 32, or 64-pointed; some are bell-shaped and have properties that reflect light. The Parsvanatha Basadi at Halebidu is a good example.&lt;ref name="lightreflection"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Architecture in Hoysala Empire |url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm |author=Arthikaje |publisher=1998–2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc |work= |accessdate=28 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104095148/http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, the pillars with four monolithic brackets above them carry images of ''salabhanjikas'' and ''madanikas'' (sculpture of a woman, displaying stylised feminine features). This is a common feature of Chalukya-Hoysala temples. According to Sastri, the shape of the pillar and its capital, the base of which is square and whose shaft is a monolith that is lathe turned to render different shapes, is a "remarkable feature" of Hoysala art.&lt;ref name="madanika"&gt;Brown in Kamath (2001), p135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="capital"&gt;Sastri (1955), p429&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vimana===
[[File:Stellate shrine outer wall with relief in Lakshminarayana temple at Hosaholalu.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Star shaped ''Vimana'' (shrine) at [[Lakshminarayana Temple, Hosaholalu|Hosaholalu]]]]

The ''[[Vimana (shrine)|vimana]]'', also called the [[cella]], contains the most sacred shrine wherein resides the image of the presiding deity. The ''vimana'' is often topped by a tower which is quite different on the outside than on the inside. Inside, the vimana is plain and square, whereas outside it is profusely decorated and can be either stellate ("star-shaped") or shaped as a staggered square, or feature a combination of these designs, giving it many projections and recesses that seem to multiply as the light falls on it.&lt;ref name="cross-in-square" /&gt; Each projection and recess has a complete decorative articulation that is rhythmic and repetitive and composed of blocks and [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], obscuring the tower profile. Depending on the number of shrines (and hence on the number of towers), the temples are classified as ''ekakuta'' (one), ''dvikuta'' (two), ''trikuta'' (three), ''chatushkuta'' (four) and ''panchakuta'' (five). Most Hoysala temples are ''ekakuta'', ''dvikuta'' or ''trikuta'', the Vaishnava ones mostly being ''trikuta''.&lt;ref name="iconography"&gt;Hardy (1995), p245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuta"&gt;Sometimes a ''trikuta'' may not literally mean "three towers", as only the central shrine has a tower (Foekema 1996, p25)&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases where a temple is ''trikuta'' but has only one tower over the main shrine (in the middle). So the terminology ''trikuta'' may not be literally accurate.&lt;ref name="inaccurate"&gt;Foekema (1996), p25&lt;/ref&gt; In temples with multiple disconnected shrines, such as the twin temples at [[Nageshvara-Chennakeshava Temple complex, Mosale|Mosale]], all essential parts are duplicated for symmetry and balance.&lt;ref name="quad"&gt;Sastri (1955), p428&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twintemples"&gt;Foekema (1996), p81, section:''Mosale''&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest point of the temple (''kalasa'') has the shape of a water pot and stands on top of the tower. This portion of the ''vimana'' is often lost due to age and has been replaced with a metallic pinnacle. Below the ''kalasa'' is a large, highly- sculptured structure resembling a dome which is made from large stones and looks like a helmet.&lt;ref name="helmet"&gt;Foekema (1996), p27&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be 2&amp;nbsp;m by 2&amp;nbsp;m in size and follows the shape of the shrine. Below this structure are domed roofs in a square plan, all of them much smaller and crowned with small ''kalasas''. They are mixed with other small roofs of different shapes and are ornately decorated. The tower of the shrine usually has three or four tiers of rows of decorative roofs while the tower on top of the ''sukanasi'' has one less tier, making the tower look like an extension of the main tower (Foekema calls it the "nose"). One decorated roof tier runs on top of the wall of a closed ''mantapa'' above the heavy eaves of an open ''mantapa'' and above the porches.&lt;ref name="nosy"&gt;Foekema (1996), p22, p28, section:''The plan of the temples''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wall sculptures and molding frieze in relief in the Chennakeshava temple at Somanathapura.jpg|thumb|right|Outer wall panel with six horizontal mouldings at [[Somanathapura]]]]

Below the superstructure of the ''[[vimana (tower)|vimana]]'' are temple "[[eave]]s"&lt;ref name="eave"&gt;under the projecting roof overhanging the wall (Foekema 1996, p93)&lt;/ref&gt; projecting half a meter from the wall. Below the eaves two different decorative schemes may be found, depending on whether a temple was built in the early or the later period of the empire. In the early temples built prior to the 13th century, there is one eave and below this are decorative miniature towers. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants are below these towers, followed by a set of five different mouldings forming the base of the wall. In the later temples there is a second eave running about a metre below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers placed between them. The wall images of gods are below the lower eaves, followed by six different mouldings of equal size. This is broadly termed "horizontal treatment".&lt;ref name="horizontal"&gt;Kamath (2001), p134&lt;/ref&gt; The six mouldings at the base are divided in two sections. Going from the very base of the wall, the first horizontal layer contains a procession of elephants, above which are horsemen and then a band of foliage. The second horizontal section has depictions of the Hindu epics and ''[[Puranas|Puranic]]'' scenes executed with detail. Above this are two friezes of ''[[yalli (motif)|yalli]]''s or ''makara''s (imaginary beasts) and ''hamsas'' (swans). The ''vimana'' (tower) is divided into three horizontal sections and is even more ornate than the walls.&lt;ref name="yali"&gt;Art critic [[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] calls this one of the distinguishing features of Hoysala art. (Kamath 2001, p134)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
[[Image:Sthambha buttalika sculpture in Chennakesava temple at Belur.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Sthamba buttalika'', Hoysala art at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]]]]
[[Image:Shilabaalika on pillar bracket in Chennakeshava Temple at Belur1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Madanika'' [[bracket (architecture)|bracket]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]]]]

In Hoysala art Hardy identifies two conspicuous departures from the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, both of which are found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style.&lt;ref name="iconography"&gt;Hardy (1995), p245&lt;/ref&gt; Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the [[Hindu]] epics and deities or in their use of [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s such as ''[[Yalli (motif)|yalli]]'', ''[[kirtimukha]]'' (gargoyles), [[aedicula]] (miniature decorative towers) on [[pilaster]], ''makara'' (aquatic monster), birds (''hamsa''), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.&lt;ref name="attention"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp428-429; Foekema (1996), pp28-29; Kamath (2001), p135&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Salabhanjika]]'', a common form of Hoysala sculpture, is an old Indian tradition going back to Buddhist sculpture. ''Sala'' is the [[Sal tree|sala tree]] and ''bhanjika'' is the chaste maiden. In the Hoysala idiom, ''madanika'' figures are decorative objects put at an angle on the outer walls of the temple near the roof so that worshipers circumambulating the temple can view them.&lt;ref name="ramayana1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Hoysala Heritage |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm|author=Settar S |publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu |work=Frontline, Volume 20 – Issue 08, April 12–25, 2003 |accessdate=13 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sthamba buttalikas'' are pillar images that show traces of [[Chola]] art in the Chalukyan touches. Some of the artists working for the Hoysalas may have been from Chola country, a result of the expansion of the empire into Tamil-speaking regions of Southern India. The image of ''mohini'' on one of the pillars in the ''[[mandapa|mantapa]]'' (closed hall) of the Chennakeshava temple is an example of Chola art.&lt;ref name="ramayana1"/&gt;

General life themes are portrayed on wall panels such as the way horses were reined, the type of stirrup used, the depiction of dancers, musicians, instrumentalists, and rows of animals such as lions and elephants (where no two animals are identical). Perhaps no other temple in the country depicts the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics more effectively than the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.&lt;ref name="ramayana1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramayana"&gt;The epic [[frieze]] is the most exciting feature of their sculptures (Foekema 1996, p29)&lt;/ref&gt;

Erotica was a subject the Hoysala artist handled with discretion. There is no exhibitionism in this, and erotic themes were carved into recesses and niches, generally miniature in form, making them inconspicuous. These erotic representations are associated with the ''Shakta'' practice.&lt;ref name="ramayana1"/&gt;

Apart from these sculptures, entire sequences from the [[Hindu]] epics (commonly the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction starting at the main entrance.&lt;ref name="clockwise"&gt;Foekema (1996), p29&lt;/ref&gt; The right to left sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero [[Arjuna]] shooting fish, the elephant-headed god [[Ganesha]], the Sun god [[Surya]], the weather and war god [[Indra]], and [[Brahma]] with [[Sarasvati]] are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is [[Durga]], with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, in the act of killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and [[Harihara]] (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to Settar, surveys in modern times have indicated that 1000–1500 structures were built by the Hoysalas, of which about a hundred temples have survived to date.&lt;ref name="vaishnava" /&gt;&lt;ref name="records"&gt;1,500 temples in 958 centres were built, according to historical records, between 1000 and 1346 CE. {{Cite web |title=Hoysala Heritage |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm|author=Settar S |publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu |work=Frontline'', Volume 20 – Issue 08, April 12–25, 2003'' |accessdate=13 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoysala style is an offshoot of the [[Western Chalukya architecture|Western Chalukya style]], which was popular in the 10th and 11th centuries.&lt;ref name="horizontal" /&gt; It is distinctively [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]], and according to Brown, owing to its features, Hoysala architecture qualifies as an independent style.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;According to Percy Brown, Hoysala architecture and sculpture have been called a "phenomenal effort of human concentration, skill and religious consciousness" ([[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] in Kamath 2001, p134)&lt;/ref&gt; While the Hoysalas introduced innovative features into their architecture, they also borrowed features from earlier builders of ''Karnata'' like the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]], [[Western Chalukyas]]. These features included the use of chloritic schist or [[soapstone]] as a basic building material.&lt;ref name="schist"&gt;Kamath (2001) p136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schist1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent, 1996 |url=http://www.indoarch.org/ |author=Kamiya Takeo |publisher=Gerard da Cunha |work=Architecture Autonomous , Bardez, Goa, India |accessdate=13 November 2006}} – The [[Western Chalukya]] carvings were done in green schist (soapstone), a technique adopted by the Hoysalas&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other features were the stepped style of ''vimana'' tower called the ''Kadamba shikhara'', which was inherited from the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]].&lt;ref name="kadambashikara"&gt;The most prominent feature of [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] architecture is their ''[[Sikhara|shikhara]]'', called "Kadamba shikhara". The ''shikhara'' is pyramid-shaped and rises in steps without any decoration and has a ''stupika'' or ''kalasha'' on the top (Kamath 2001, p38)&lt;/ref&gt; Hoysala sculptors made use of the effect of light and shade on carved walls, which poses a challenge for photography of the temples.&lt;ref name="ramayana1"/&gt; The artistry of the Hoysalas in stone has been compared to the finesse of an ivory worker or a goldsmith. The abundance of jewellery worn by the sculpted figures and the variety of hairstyles and headdresses depicted give a fair idea of the lifestyles of the Hoysala times.&lt;ref name="capital"&gt;Sastri (1955), p429&lt;/ref&gt;

While medieval Indian artisans preferred to remain anonymous, Hoysala artisans signed their works, which has given researchers details about their lives, families, guilds, etc. Apart from the architects and sculptors, people of other guilds such as goldsmiths, ivory carvers, carpenters, and silversmiths also contributed to the completion of temples. The artisans were from diverse geographical backgrounds and included famous locals.

'''Incubation''' is the religious practice of sleeping in a sacred area with the intention of experiencing a [[Revelation|divinely inspired]] [[dream]] or [[cure]]. Incubation was practised by many ancient cultures.   In perhaps the most well known instance among the [[Hebrew people|Hebrews]], found in [[Books of Kings|1 Kings 3]], [[Solomon]] went to [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]] "because that was the most renowned high place to offer sacrifices." There "the {{smallcaps|Lord}} appeared to Solomon in a dream at night," and Solomon asked God for the gift of an understanding heart.  Among the members of the cult of [[Asclepius]], votive offerings found at ritual centres at [[Epidaurus]], [[Pergamum]], and [[Rome]] detail the perceived effectiveness of the method. Incubation was adopted by certain Christian sects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Averil Cameron|author1-link=Averil Cameron|editor1-last=Webster|editor1-first=Leslie|editor1-link=Leslie E. Webster|title=The Transformation of the Roman World, AD 400-900|date=1997|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still used in a few Greek monasteries. Modern practices for influencing dream content by [[dream incubation]] use more research-driven techniques, but they sometimes incorporate elements reflecting these ancient beliefs.

[[File:J. Reynolds, A discourse upon prodigious abstinence... Wellcome L0022587.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1669 report that claims a woman fasted for 12 months]]
'''Inedia''' (Latin for "[[fasting]]") or '''breatharianism''' {{IPAc-en|b|r|ɛ|θ|ˈ|ɛər|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} is the belief that it is possible for a person to live without consuming [[food]]. Breatharians claim that food, and in some cases [[water]], are not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by ''[[prana]]'', the vital life force in [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Ayurveda]], [[sunlight]] is one of the main sources of ''prana'', and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone. The terms ''breatharianism'' or ''inedia'' may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] in place of the usual [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].

Breatharianism is considered a deadly [[pseudoscience]] by scientists and medical professionals, and several adherents of these practices have died from starvation and dehydration. Though it is common knowledge that biological entities require sustenance to survive, breatharianism continues.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news

==Scientific assessment==
[[Nutrition]]al science proves that [[fasting]] for extended periods leads to [[starvation]], [[dehydration]], and eventual death. In the absence of food intake, the body normally burns its own reserves of glycogen, body fat, and muscle. Breatharians claim that their bodies do not consume these reserves while fasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/breatharian1.htm |title=Can humans survive on air alone? | publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc. |accessdate=2009-07-30 |first=Katie|last=Lambert|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226084504/http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/breatharian1.htm |archivedate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosicrucianism===
The 1670 [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] text ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'' attributed the practice to the physician and occultist [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) who was described as having lived "several years by taking only one half scrupule of Solar Quintessence".

===Prahlad Jani ("Mataji")===
[[Prahlad Jani]] is an Indian [[sadhu]] who says he has lived without food and water for more than 70 years.

The case has attracted criticism, both after the 2003 tests and the 2010 tests. [[Sanal Edamaruku]], president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], criticized the 2010 experiment for allowing Jani to move out of a certain CCTV camera's field of view, meet devotees and leave the sealed test room to sunbathe. Edamaruku stated that the regular gargling and bathing activities were not sufficiently monitored, and accused Jani of having had some "influential protectors" who denied Edamaruku permission to inspect the project during its operation.&lt;ref name="rationalistinternational1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edamaruku |first=Sanal |url=http://www.rationalistinternational.net/article/2010/20100518/en_1.html |title=Prahlad Jani and his powerful protectors |publisher=Rationalistinternational.net |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165946/http://www.rationalistinternational.net/article/2010/20100518/en_1.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jasmuheen===
[[Jasmuheen]] (born Ellen Greve) was a prominent advocate of breatharianism in the 1990s. She said "I can go for months and months without having anything at all other than a cup of tea. My body runs on a different kind of nourishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vegetarian Myth: Food, Justice, and Sustainability,|author=Keith, L.|isbn=9781604861822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=\_KGWcPH41qYC|year=2009|publisher=PM Press}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers found her house stocked with food; Jasmuheen claimed the food was for her husband and daughter. In 1999, she volunteered to be monitored closely by the [[Australia]]n television program ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' for one week without eating to demonstrate her methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|title=Living on air: Breatharian put to the test|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102085047/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp |archivedate=2 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |title = Jasmuheen |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001044/http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen stated that she found it difficult on the third day of the test because the hotel room in which she was confined was located near a busy road, causing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[pollution]] that prevented absorption of required nutrients from the air. "I asked for fresh air. Seventy percent of my nutrients come from fresh air. I couldn’t even breathe," she said. The third day the test was moved to a mountainside retreat where her condition continued to deteriorate. After Jasmuheen had fasted for four days, Berris Wink, president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association, urged her to stop the test.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1999"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.caic.org.au/miscult/breatharians/Fresh-air%20dietician%20fails%20TV%20show%27s%20challenge.htm | title=Fresh-air dietician fails TV show's challenge | publisher=[[Yahoo News]] | date=25 October 1999 | accessdate =7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wink, Jasmuheen’s pupils were dilated, her speech was slow, and she was "quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%". Towards the end of the test, she said, "Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risks if she goes any further are kidney failure. ''60 Minutes'' would be culpable if they encouraged her to continue. She should stop now." The test was stopped. Wink said, "Unfortunately there are a few people who may believe what she says, and I'm sure it's only a few, but I think it's quite irresponsible for somebody to be trying to encourage others to do something that is so detrimental to their health."&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1999"/&gt; Jasmuheen challenged the results of the program, saying, "Look, 6,000 people have done this around the world without any problem."&lt;ref name="Bergman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergman|first=Gregory|title=Isms: From Autoeroticism to Zoroastrianism – an Irreverent Reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUVuSNM5QUQC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2006|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-4405-1788-6|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Harris | first = Gillian | date = 6 April 2000 | title = Starvation guru given hostile reception | work = The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |title = Mysticism |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209101343/http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |archivedate=2012-02-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasmuheen was awarded the [[Bent Spoon Award]] by [[Australian Skeptics]] in 2000 ("presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.skeptics.com.au/spoon/2000winners.htm |title = Bent Spoon 2000 – Winner (Jasmuheen) |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050616014356/http://skeptics.com.au/spoon/2000winners.htm |archivedate= 2005-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also won the 2000 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for Literature for ''Living on Light''. Jasmuheen claims that their beliefs are based on the writings and "more recent [[channelling (mediumistic)|channelled]] material" from [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/454313.stm | date = 22 September 1999 |title = All they need is the air | work = BBC News | accessdate =11 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305092336/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/454313.stm |archivedate=2016-03-05 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that some people's [[DNA]] has expanded from 2 to 12 strands, to "absorb more hydrogen". When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, she said that she didn't understand the relevance as she was not referring to herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |title = Correx Archives&amp;nbsp;– Jasmuheen | work = Corex | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate =7 June 2008  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980423153006/http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |archivedate=1998-04-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary ''[[No Way to Heaven]]'' the Swiss chemist Michael Werner claims to have followed the directions appearing on Jasmuheen's books, living for several years without food.

In 1983 he was reportedly observed leaving a [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] [[7-Eleven]] with a [[Slurpee]], a [[hot dog]], and [[Twinkie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=John Yewell |url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/01.05.00/nuzjunkies-0001.html |title = A Year of Nüz|work=MetroActive News &amp; Issues  |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001003042829/http://metroactive.com/papers/cruz/01.05.00/nuzjunkies-0001.html |archivedate=2000-10-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told ''[[Colors (magazine)|Colors]]'' magazine in 2003 that he periodically breaks his fasting with a [[cheeseburger]] and a [[cola]], explaining that when he's surrounded by junk culture and [[junk food]], consuming them adds balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.13.03/diets-0307.html |title=sonoma papers |publisher=Metroactive.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030306103945/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.13.03/diets-0307.html |archivedate=2003-03-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiley Brooks later claimed that [[Diet Coke]] and [[McDonald's]] cheeseburgers have special "5D" properties.  The idea of separate but interconnected 5D and 3D worlds is a major part of Wiley Brooks' ideology, and Wiley Brooks encourages his followers to only eat these special 5D foods, as well as meditate on a set of magical 5D words.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140522195834/http://www.breatharian.com/5wordsqa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ray Maor===
In a television documentary produced by the Israeli television [[Investigative journalism|investigative show]] ''The Real Face'' (פנים אמיתיות) hosted by [[Amnon Levy]], [[Israel]]i practitioner of Inedia Ray Maor (ריי מאור) who appeared to survive without food or water for eight days and eight nights. According to the documentary, he was restricted to a small villa and placed under constant video surveillance, with medical supervision that included daily blood testing. The documentary claimed Maor was in good spirits throughout the experiment, lost 17&amp;nbsp;lb after eight days, blood tests showed no change before, during or after the experiment, and [[Cardiologist]] Ilan Kitsis from [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]] was "baffled."&lt;ref name="panim.nana10.co.il"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="glz.co.il"/&gt;

==Religious traditions==

===Christianity===
* ''[[Anorexia mirabilis]]''

===Hinduism===
Hindu religious texts contain account of saints and hermits practicing what would be called inedia, breatharianism or Sustenance through Light in modern terms. In Valmiki's [[Ramayana]], Book III, Canto VI, an account of anchorites and holy men is given, who flocked around [[Rama]] when he came to [[Śarabhanga]]'s hermitage. These included, among others, the "...saints who live on rays which moon and daystar give" and "those ... whose food the wave of air supplies". In Canto XI of the same book a hermit named [[Māṇḍakarṇi]] is mentioned: "For he, great votarist, intent – On strictest rule his stern life spent – ... – Ten thousand years on air he fed..."  (English quotations are from Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation).

[[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' details two alleged historical examples of breatharianism, Hari [[Giri Bala]] and [[Therese Neumann]].

There are claims that [[Devraha Baba]] lived without food.

{{nihongo|'''''Inugami'''''|犬神||"dog god/spirit"}}, like [[kitsunetsuki]], is a spiritual possession by the spirit of a [[dog]], widely known about in western Japan. Until recent years, they were often seen in the eastern [[Ōita Prefecture]], [[Shimane Prefecture]], and a part of [[Kōchi Prefecture]] in northern [[Shikoku]], and it is also theorized that Shikoku, where no [[Fox|foxes]] ([[kitsune]]) could be found, is the main base of the inugami. Furthermore, traces of belief in inugami exists in the [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], all of [[Kyushu]], even going past the [[Satsunan Islands]] all the way to the [[Okinawa Prefecture]]. In the [[Miyazaki Prefecture]], the [[Kuma District, Kumamoto|Kuma District]], [[Kumamoto Prefecture]], and [[Yakushima]], the local dialect pronounces it "ingami"&lt;ref name="hino"&gt;{{Harvnb|日野|2006|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sogo"&gt;{{Harvnb|大藤他|1955|pp=108-130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Tanegashima]], they are called "irigami."&lt;ref name="hino" /&gt; It can also be written in kanji as 狗神.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[浅井了意]]|others=藤堂憶斗訳|title=伽婢子・狗張子|year=2001|publisher=[[鈴木出版]]|series=江戸怪談集|isbn=978-4-7902-1101-3|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The phenomenon of inugami spiritual possession was a [[kodoku|kojutsu]] (also called "kodō" or "kodoku", a greatly feared ritual for employing the spirits of certain animals) that was already banned in the Heian period that was thought to have spread throughout the population, and it was known to involve cutting off the head of a starving dog and burying the dog at a crossroads to inflame its grudges as people pass over its head so that its spirit would turn into a curse that could be used.

Another method was to bury the dog alive leaving only its head sticking out or attach the dog to a supporting pole, put some food in front of the dog, cut the dog's neck just when it is about to starve so that the head would fly towards and bite at the food, burn the dog into mere bones, put the remains into a vessel, and deify it. By doing so, it will spiritually possess that person forever, granting their wishes. Another method was to set several dogs to fight against each other, give the one dog remaining alive some fish, cut off that dog's head, and eat the remaining fish.&lt;ref name="ishiduka"&gt;{{Harvnb|石塚|1977|pp=56-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Yamaga, Ōita|Yamaga]], [[Hayami District, Ōita|Hayami District]], [[Ōita Prefecture]] (now [[Kitsuki, Ōita|Kitsuki]]), there were actual cases where a [[miko]] did cut off a dogs' heads this way, dried the maggots that gathered at the heads, and sold them calling it inugami, and there were also people who were thankful for these and bought them.&lt;ref name="ishiduka" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=中村友紀夫他編|title=妖怪の本 異界の闇に蠢く百鬼夜行の伝説|edition=|year=1999|publisher=[[学研ホールディングス|学習研究社]]|series=New sight mook|isbn=978-4-05-602048-9|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kumaomi_Inugami.jpg|upright|thumb|A depiction of an inugami from [[Oka Kumaomi]]'s ''Chiriyahokori'']]
However, in descriptions of an inugami's appearance, it is said that they have a somewhat large patch of color around the size of a mouse, and they have split ends on their tail, and as they were a species of [[talpidae]], their eyes cannot be seen, and moved in single file one after another. Thus, they would seem to be more like [[kuda-gitsune]] or [[osaki]] rather than dogs, so it does not appear as if they were purely following the legends of kodō curses (such as the "dog curse" found in the [[In Search of the Supernatural]]). In fact, it would seem more as if the main focus of these descriptions were imitations of the belief in fox spirits. They also seem similar in appearance to [[house mouse]], and their mouths are said be torn vertically with a pointy end, and in the [[Ōita Prefecture]], they are said to resemble a [[dsinezumi shrew]],&lt;ref name="kyoka"&gt;{{Harvnb|多田|2008|pp=296-298}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Toyooka town, [[Hayami District, Ōita|Hayami District]], Ōita, they are said to be a weasel with black and white spots.&lt;ref name="yoshida"&gt;{{Harvnb|吉田|1978|pp=32-34}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the island of Aishima in the aforementioned Yamaguchi Prefecture, they are called "inugami nezumi" (inugami mice), and like the long-nosed house mouse, they are said to form groups of 75 mice in a single house. On the mountain of Iyayama, [[Miyoshi District, Tokushima|Miyoshi District]], Tokushima Prefecture, the inugami type are called "{{Anchor|suikazura}}suikazura," and they are said to be a bit larger than mice and warm themselves by the fireside.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite book|author=[[大藤時彦]]他|editor=民俗学研究所編|others=[[柳田國男]]監修|title=綜合日本民俗語彙|year=1955|publisher=平凡社|volume=第2巻|page=764|id=NCID BN05729787}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a book titled "Chiriyahokori" by the [[kokugaku]] [[Oka Kumaomi]], it is stated that they have a body length of 1 shaku and 1 sun and looked like bats.&lt;ref name="yoshida" /&gt; Also, in [[Asai Ryōi]]'s ''Otogi Bōko'', the inugami of [[Tosa Province]] was told to have a physical appearance with length similar to that of a rice grain and a body that was colored with patches of black and white, among other colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|小松|2015|pp=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several theories about how inugami came to be, including the tale that the body of the [[nue]] slain by [[Minamoto no Yorimasa]] split into 4 parts and scattered and flew to different lands to become inugami,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=[[喜田貞吉]]編|others=[[山田野理夫]]補|title=憑物|year=1975|publisher=宝文館出版|id=NCID BN02663117|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Furthermore in this case, the nue said to be the origin of the dog god (inugami), snake god (hebigami), and monkey god (sarugami) is told to have the head of a monkey, the body of a dog, and the tail of a snake, which is a little different from the usual depiction.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the tale that it was born from [[Kūkai|Kōbō-Daishi]]'s painting of a dog that was made for the sake of warding off boars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[木村小舟]]他|editor=[[巌谷小波]]編|title=大語園|year=1978|publisher=名著普及会|volume=第1巻|pages=446–447|id=NCID BN02844836}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the legend that when [[Gennō Shinshō]] attempted to calm the curse of a [[sessho-seki]] by splitting the stone, the fragments that flew off to [[Kōzuke Province]] (now [[Gunma Prefecture]]) turned into osaki and the fragments that flew to [[Shikoku]] became inugami.&lt;ref name="kyoka" /&gt;

==Having inugami==
Inugami are explained to be raised in the storage room chests ([[tansu]]), under the floors, and in the water jugs of the families that have inugami. Like other types of spirit possession, inugami become more easily attached to people who are wildly unstable in emotions. Those who get possessed by it (those who get an inugami attached to them) are said to feel pain in their chest, complain about pain in their arms and feet, suddenly sway without warning, and bark like a dog. They would enter and invade the human body from the ears, and it's said that those who get possessed by these would develop a personality full of jealousy.&lt;ref name="kyoka" /&gt; In [[Tokushima Prefecture]], it is said that those that get possessed by an inugami would become voracious big eaters and would have teeth marks on their body when they die.&lt;ref name="yoshida" /&gt; Not limited to just humans, inugami would also possess cows and horses and even inorganic materials, and when they possess a [[saw]], it would become useless.&lt;ref name="ishiduka" /&gt;

The idea there exist bloodlines of families that easily get possessed by an inugami as well as bloodlines of inugami themselves come from the regional tales told by the bloodlines of the sorcerers, [[yamabushi]], priests, and [[Kodoku|fuko]] that engaged in kodoku. In many cases, it shows how those nomadic peoples who engaged in folk sorcery would earn trust and respect and at the same time be treated with discrimination. This is because inugami follows people into their descendants, and it was normal for everyday villagers to consider it taboo to marry into an inugami bloodline, and even associating with them was normally seen with apprehension. In various parts of Shikoku, there is a custom during marriage to check the bloodlines for inugami, and there were none too few cases when it was a problem related to "assimilation issues" ([[burakumin|dōwa mondai]]).

In the legends of [[Komatsu, Ehime|Komatsu]], [[Shūsō District, Ehime|Shūsō District]], [[Ehime Prefecture]] (now part of [[Saijō, Ehime|Saijō]]), there were as many inugami as there were people in families that had inugami, and the number of inugami increased each time the family grew larger. It is said that these inugami would pick up cues and understand what the family is thinking and the inugami would immediately go possess them when the family wanted something.&lt;ref name="ishiduka" /&gt; However, it is said that sometimes they didn't behave in an obedient manner and would bite to death members of the family that have inugami.&lt;ref name="ishiduka" /&gt;

It is said that those afflicted with illnesses that come from inugami were unable to be cured by doctors and needed to have the inugami removed by a sorcerer. In [[Tanegashima]], there is a practice called "inugami-tsure" (meaning "taking along an inugami") that was performed when a family that had inugami was known or even just suspected without confirmation to have transferred an inugami to another family whereby the family that originally had inugami would bring food into the other family's house to take the inugami along with them and then go to live in seclusion in a hut in the outskirts of town until the newly afflicted person was cured, and it is said that their descendants would continue even after that to live alone in the mountains.&lt;ref name="sogo" /&gt;

Families that had inugami were thought to have prospered and grew wealthy. At the same time, there were also cases where they were not treated like fox spirits that brought fortune into families by being deified, but rather detested as curse gods.&lt;ref name="sogo" /&gt;

==In popular culture==

In the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Ishmael'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|ʃ|m|əl|,_|-|m|ɛ|l}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «ĭsh´mul» and «ĭsh´mĕl»&lt;/ref&gt; is the righteous friend of the [[prophet]] [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]] in [[Jerusalem]]. When Lehi takes his family into the wilderness, Lehi brings Ishmael and his family too. The daughters of Ishmael marry the sons of Lehi, but the sons of Ishmael join [[Laman and Lemuel]] in their rebellion against [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]]. Ishmael dies in the wilderness, and is buried at [[Nahom]]. (''See [[Archaeology and the Book of Mormon]]'')   After their arrival in the [[Americas]], the children of Ishmael side with the [[Lamanite]]s, except for those daughters who married [[Sam (Book of Mormon)|Sam]], Nephi, and [[Zoram]]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A second '''Ishmael'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the grandfather of [[Amulek]].

==Name==
Ishmael comes from the {{Hebrew Name|{{Hebrew|יִשְׁמָעֵאל}}|Yi'shma'el|God hears}}. It is a [[theophoric]] name translated literally as "[[El (god)|God]] (El) has hearkened", suggesting that "a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise".&lt;ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/&gt;

According to [[Hugh Nibley]], the proverbial ancestor of the Arabs is Ishmael. His name is one of the few [[Old Testament]] names which is also at home in ancient [[Arabia]]: "[Thus] in Lehi's friend "Ishmael" (1 Nephi 7:2) we surely have a man of the desert. The interesting thing is that Nephi takes Ishmael (unlike Zoram) completely for granted, never explaining who he is or how he fits into the picture--the act of sending for him seems to be the most natural thing in the world, as does the marriage of his daughters with Lehi's sons. Since it has ever been the custom among the desert people for a man to marry the daughter of his paternal uncle (bint 'ammi), it is hard to avoid the impression that Lehi and Ishmael were related. There is a remarkable association between the names of Lehi and Ishmael which ties them both to the southern desert, where the legendary birthplace and central shrine of Ishmael was at a place called Be'er Lehai-ro'i." &lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley]], "Men of the East" in ''[http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1106&amp;index=5 Lehi In The Desert]'', F.A.R.M.S., p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
According to [[John L. Sorenson]], both Ishmael's sons had "families" (1 Nephi 7:6) who accompanied them. The term "families" implies a wife and at least one child each, but there likely were more children.&lt;ref&gt;[[John L. Sorenson]], "The Composition of Lehi's Family," in ''[http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1129&amp;index=7 By Study and Also by Faith]'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book of Mormon Movie==
In ''[[The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey]]'', adapted from First and Second Nephi, Ishmael was portrayed by Ron Frederickson. The portrayals were highly influenced by [[Arnold Friberg]] paintings of the characters.

&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim organizations in the country  include the Bolivian Islamic Center in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]],  [[Sucre]] and  [[Cochabamba]], and the Muslim Group in Sucre. 

The Bolivian Islamic Center ({{lang-es|Centro Islámico Boliviano}}, CIB) was created in August 1986 by Imam Mahmud Amer Abusharar, who arrived from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1974. In 1992 a commission for the construction of the first mosque in Bolivia was approved, and it was completed in September 1994 in the city of Santa Cruz. Abusharar died on 14 May 2011. Presently the CIB does not have branches in Sucre, Cochabamba or [[La Paz]], and its community is mostly immigrant. On the international level, CIB is  not a [[branch]] of the Islamic Organization for [[Latin America]].

In 2004 the first official Sunni mosque, the Yebel An Nur Mosque, was founded in 2004 in [[La  Paz]]. Prior to that Islam was rather unheard of{{weasel words|date=December 2013}} in the city and the Muslim community was composed of a few who frequently meet in their homes. As the Muslim community gradually grew in La Paz difference of personal opinions, egos, and conspiracy for management grew from within causing the community to  break into factions. The Yebel An Nur Mosque remains self-funded with close ties to the Sunni Bolivian Islamic Center of Santa Cruz while the As-Salam Mosque receives both Sunni and Shia followers, connections, and funding.&lt;ref&gt;http://yebelannur.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Islam]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]''' was introduced in 654 when an army sent by the Third [[Caliph]] of Islam, [[Uthman]], conquered [[Eastern Georgia (country)|Eastern Georgia]] and established [[Emirate of Tbilisi|Muslim rule]] in [[Tbilisi]].  Currently, Muslims constitute approximately 9.9%&lt;ref name="Europe pg.67"&gt;Religion and education in Europe: developments, contexts and debates, By Robert Jackson, pg.67&lt;/ref&gt; of the Georgian population. According to other sources, [[Muslim]]s constitute 10-11% of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s population.&lt;ref name="crrc-caucasus.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crrc-caucasus.blogspot.com/2011/07/georgia-adopts-law-on-status-of.html|title=Georgia Adopts Law on the Status of Religious Minorities|first=|last=Robia|date=8 July 2011|website=crrc-caucasus.blogspot.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, [[Parliament of Georgia]] passed new law allowing religious minority groups with “historic ties to Georgia” to register. The draft of the law specifically mentions [[Islam]] and four other religious communities.&lt;ref name="crrc-caucasus.blogspot.com"/&gt;

Mosques in Georgia operate under the supervision of the Georgian Muslim Department, established in May 2011. Until then the affairs of Georgia's Muslims had been governed from abroad by the [[Baku]]-based Caucasus Muslims Department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.islamtoday.net/artshow-229-4063.htm Georgia Establishes New Muslim Affairs Department Independent of Azerbaijan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613031052/http://en.islamtoday.net/artshow-229-4063.htm |date=2011-06-13 }}.

In 2010, [[Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] signed an agreement by which [[Turkey]] will provide funding and expertise to rehabilitate three [[mosque]]s and to rebuild a fourth one in 
Georgia. While Georgia will rehabilitate four Georgian monasteries in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armradio.am/news/?part=soc&amp;id=12902 Georgia to fund restoration of historical monastery in eastern Turkey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929111910/http://www.armradio.am/news/?part=soc&amp;id=12902 |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgia-Turkey agreement will allow the reconstruction of the historical Azize mosque in [[Batumi]], [[Ajaria]] demolished in the middle of the last century. Turkey will rehabilitate the mosques at [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]] and [[Akhaltsikhe]] regions, [[Kobuleti District]], build the Azize mosque burned down in 1940 and restore the [[Turkish bath]]house in Batumi.

==History==
===Emirate of Tbilisi===
{{main|Arab rule in Georgia|Emirate of Tbilisi}}
The [[Arabs]] first appeared in Georgia in 645. It was not, however, [[Marwan ibn Muhammad's invasion of Georgia|until 735]], when they succeeded in establishing their firm control over a large portion of the country. In that year, [[Marwan II]] took hold of Tbilisi and much of the neighbouring lands and installed there an Arab [[emir]], who was to be confirmed by the [[Caliph of Baghdad]] or, occasionally, by the ''[[ostikan]]'' of ''Armīniya''.

During the Arab period, Tbilisi (''al-Tefelis'') grew into a center of trade between the [[Islam]]ic world and [[northern Europe]]. Beyond that, it functioned as a key Arab outpost and a buffer province facing the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] and [[Khazar]] dominions. Over time, Tbilisi became largely [[Muslim]].

===Timurids===
{{main|Timur's invasions of Georgia}}
Between 1386 and 1404, Georgia was subjected to invasions by the armies of [[Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Timur]], whose vast [[Timurid dynasty|empire]] stretched, at its greatest extent, from [[Central Asia]] into [[Anatolia]]. In the first of at least seven invasions, Timur sacked Georgia's capital, [[Tbilisi]], and captured the king [[Bagrat V of Georgia|Bagrat V]] in 1386. In late 1401, Timur invaded the Caucasus once again. The King of Georgia had to sue for peace, and sent his brother with the contributions. Timur was preparing for a major confrontation with the [[Ottoman dynasty]] and apparently wished to freeze the currently prevailing situation in Georgia, until he could return to deal with it more decisively and thoroughly at his leisure. Thus, he made peace with George on condition that the king of Georgia supply him with troops.&lt;ref&gt;Sicker, Martin (2000), ''The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna'', p. 155. Praeger, {{ISBN|0-275-96892-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire and Iranian Period===
[[Image:Rostom of Kartli.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Rostom of Kartli]], a Muslim Georgian ruler of the 17th century appointed by the Iranian Safavids.]]
{{see also|Persia-Georgia relations|Chveneburi|Iranian Georgians}}
The [[Safavid dynasty]] was in constant conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] over full control and influence in the [[Caucasus]]. From the early 16th to the course of the second half of the 18th century, the Safavids had to deal with several independent kingdoms and principalities, as Georgia was not a single state at the time. These entities often followed divergent political courses. Safavid interests were largely directed at Eastern (the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) and Southern (the kingdoms of Samtskhe-Saatabago) Georgia while Western Georgia came under Ottoman influence. These independent kingdoms became vassals of Persia as early as in 1503.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=PxQpmg_JIpwC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=shah+ismail+conquer+georgia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vm2XVKGkHsbKaOSegoAC&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=shah%20ismail%20conquer%20georgia&amp;f=false|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ermakov. Botanical Street and Sunnite Mosque. Middle of 1880.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Botanical Street and Sunnite Mosque. Middle of 1880]]

On May 29, 1555, the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire concluded a [[Peace of Amasya|treaty at Amasya]] following the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–55)]] by which the [[Caucasus]] was divided between the two. Western Georgia and the western part of southern Georgia fell to The Ottomans, while Eastern Georgia (comprising the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]] and [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]]) and the (largest) eastern part of southern Georgia fell to Safavid Iran. The bulk of Georgia and the region which had historically always been the most dominant stayed therefore in the Iranian sphere. This partition of the Caucasus and therefore including Georgia under Islamic rule was again confirmed in [[Treaty of Zuhab|1639]].

In 1703, [[Vakhtang VI]] became the ruler of the [[kingdom of Kartli]]. In 1716, he adopted Islam and the Safavid ruler confirmed him as King of Kartli. However, at a decisive moment Vakhtang was ordered to discontinue military campaigns, leading Vakhtang to adopt a pro-[[Russian empire|Russian]] orientation, though the Russian failed to tender him the promised military aid.

For several centuries, the Georgian kings and aristocrats converted to Islam and served as courtiers to the Iranian [[Safavid]], [[Afsharid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar dynasties]], who ruled them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=6X745rS5Ci8C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=georgians+convert+islam+safavid&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sZVJCS9gdI&amp;sig=ai3MJZJ7UFOZS___mzBiQDNadsY&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1cCZVL78DoOa7gb_qoGYDg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=georgians%20convert%20islam%20safavid&amp;f=false|title=The Caucasus: An Introduction|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The Muslims constitute from 9.9% (463,062)&lt;ref name="Europe pg.67"/&gt; to 10-11%&lt;ref name="crrc-caucasus.blogspot.com"/&gt; of Georgia's population.

There are two major Muslim groups in Georgia. The ethnic Georgian Muslims are [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] and are concentrated in the [[Adjara|Autonomous Republic of Adjara]] of Georgia bordering [[Turkey]]. The ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] Muslims are predominantly [[Shia]] [[Ithna 'ashariyah|Ithna Ashariyah]] and are concentrated along the border with [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]].

The [[Meskhetian Turks]], also a Sunni Hanafi group, are the former inhabitants of the [[Meskheti]] region of Georgia, along the border with Turkey. They were deported to [[Central Asia]] during November 15–25, 1944 by [[Joseph Stalin]] and settled within [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]].  Of the 120,000 forcibly deported in cattle-trucks a total of 10,000 perished.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/apr/05/guardianobituaries.usa as retrieved on 29 April 2008 20:59:44 GMT&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are dispersed over a number of other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]]. There are 500,000 to 700,000 Meskhetian Turks in exile in [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastofcenter.tol.org/2011/03/1196/|title=East of Center  » Blog Archive   » Meskhetian Turks Bouncing From Exile to Exile|author=|date=|website=eastofcenter.tol.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/publications/detail/the-meskhetian-turks-at-a-crossroads-20/|title=ECMI - European Centre for Minority Issues: Publications|author=|date=|website=www.ecmi.de|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also smaller numbers of Muslims in Georgia belonging to other ethnic groups of the [[South Caucasus]], such as [[Ossetians]], [[Armenians]], and [[Pontic Greeks]] (divided between [[Caucasus Greeks]] and Turkish speaking [[Urums]]). These are mainly descended from Ottoman-era Christian Orthodox converts to Turkish Islam. Many of Georgia's Muslims defined as 'Ottoman' following [[Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign]] that led to the Ottoman conquest of Georgia in the 1570s were actually of Armenian or Pontic Greek origin whose ancestors in [[Eastern Anatolia]] had adopted Turkish Islam. One prominent example of an Ottoman Muslim from Georgia of Caucasus Greek origin was [[Resid Mehmed Pasha]], who ironically played an important role in suppressing the 1822-33 [[Greek War of Independence]]  (see also [[Greek Muslims]] and [[Armenian Muslims]]).

'''Eric Reed Boucher''' (born June 17, 1958), better known by his professional name '''Jello Biafra''', is the former lead singer and songwriter for the [[San Francisco]] [[punk rock]] band [[Dead Kennedys]]. He is a musician and [[spoken word]] artist.

Initially active from 1979 to 1986, Dead Kennedys were known for rapid-fire music topped with Biafra's sardonic lyrics and biting social commentary, delivered in his "unique quiver of a voice."&lt;ref&gt;Jon Young, et al [http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=dead_kennedys Dead Kennedys], TrouserPress.com, retrieved 02 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt; When the band broke up in 1986, he took over the influential [[independent record label]] [[Alternative Tentacles]], which he had founded in 1979 with Dead Kennedys bandmate [[East Bay Ray]]. In a 2000 lawsuit, upheld on appeal in 2003 by the California Supreme Court, Biafra was found liable for breach of contract, fraud and malice in withholding a decade's worth of royalties from his former bandmates and ordered to pay over $200,000 in compensation and punitive damages; the band subsequently reformed without Biafra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67364/biafra-drops-suit-against-ex-bandmates Biafra Drops Suit Against Ex-Bandmates], Billboard, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although now focused primarily on spoken word performances, Biafra has continued as a musician in numerous collaborations.

Politically, Biafra is a member of the [[Green Party of the United States]]&lt;ref name = "Green"/&gt; and supports various political causes. He ran for the party's Presidential nomination in the [[2000 United States Presidential Election]], finishing a distant second to [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/history/chronology/2000 |publisher=Global Greens |title=Global Green Party History Chronology - 2000 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ASJH5mvY?url=http://www.globalgreens.org/history/chronology/2000 |archivedate=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |quote=With 295 votes, Nader received 92% of the convention total, followed by ten votes each for Jello Biafra and Stephen Gaskin |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a staunch believer in a free society, and utilizes shock value and advocates [[direct action]] and pranksterism in the name of political causes.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Biafra, Jello. "Platform for 2000 Green Party Presidential Primary." March 7, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biafra is known to use absurdist media tactics, in the leftist tradition of the [[Yippies]], to highlight issues of [[civil rights]] and [[social justice]].

As a child, Boucher developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. An avid news watcher, one of his earliest memories was of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]]. Biafra says he has been a fan of [[rock music]] since first hearing it in 1965, when his parents accidentally tuned in to a rock radio station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php |title=Bands |publisher=Alternative Tentacles |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316144308/http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php |archive-date=March 16, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boucher ignored his high school [[guidance counselor]]'s advice that he spend his adolescence preparing to become a dental hygienist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jello Biafra Talks Politics, Music and The Music Business – Janky Smooth|url = http://www.jankysmooth.com/jello-biafra-interview-politics-music-business-interview-janky-smooth/|accessdate = August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his career in music in January 1977 as a [[roadie]] for the [[punk rock]] band The Ravers (who later changed their name to [[The Nails]]), soon joining his friend John Greenway in a band called The Healers. The Healers became infamous locally for their mainly improvised lyrics and [[avant garde]] music. In the autumn of that year, he began attending the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;Biafra's [[spoken word]] albums. {{Which|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==

===The Dead Kennedys===
In June 1978, he responded to an advertisement placed in a store by guitarist [[East Bay Ray]], stating; "guitarist wants to form punk band,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/congress/2503/interview10.html |title=Interview with Jello Biafra |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=August 3, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knSVfm9x?url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/congress/2503/interview10.html |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and together they formed the Dead Kennedys. He began performing with the band under the stage name Occupant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Dave|title=Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to how Band Names Were Formed|date=2004|publisher=Cidermill Books|isbn=0974848352|page=214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOpB23GGxAIC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=%22jello+biafra%22+occupant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi76eOjyZzUAhWC5IMKHQtDC8YQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jello%20biafra%22%20occupant&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon began to use his current stage name, a combination of the brand name [[Jell-O]] and the short-lived African state [[Biafra]]. The band's lyrics were written by Biafra. The lyrics were mostly political in nature and displayed a sardonic, sometimes absurdist, sense of humor despite their serious subject matter. In the tradition of UK [[anarcho-punk]] bands like [[Crass]], the Dead Kennedys were one of the first US punk bands to write politically themed songs. The lyrics Biafra wrote helped popularize the use of humorous lyrics in punk and other types of hard-core music. Biafra cites [[Joey Ramone]] as the inspiration for his use of humor in his songs (as well as being the musician who made him interested in punk rock), noting in particular songs by [[The Ramones]] such as "[[Beat on the Brat]]" and "[[Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue]]".&lt;ref&gt;Biafra, Jello.

Biafra initially attempted to compose music on guitar, but his lack of experience on the instrument and his own admission of being "a fumbler with my hands" led Dead Kennedys bassist [[Klaus Flouride]] to suggest that Biafra simply sing the parts he envisioned to the band.&lt;ref name="re/search"&gt;V. Vale, ''Incredibly Strange Music, Vol. 2'', RE/Search Publications, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra sang his riffs and melodies into a tape recorder, which he brought to the band's rehearsal and/or recording sessions. This later became a problem when the other members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra over royalties and publishing rights.{{clarify|date=October 2011}} By all accounts, including his own, Biafra is not a conventionally skilled musician,&lt;ref name="re/search"/&gt; though he and his collaborators ([[Joey Shithead]] of D.O.A. in particular) attest that he is a skilled composer&lt;ref name="shithead"&gt;Keithley, Joe. ''I, Shithead''. [[Arsenal Pulp Press]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and his work, particularly with the Dead Kennedys, is highly respected by punk-oriented critics and fans.

[[File:Jello-Biafra.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Biafra performing with the Dead Kennedys]]
Biafra's first popular song was the first single by the Dead Kennedys, "[[California Über Alles]]." The song, which spoofed California governor [[Jerry Brown]], was the first of many political songs by the group and Biafra. The song's popularity resulted in its being covered by other musicians, such as [[The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy]] (who rewrote the lyrics to parody [[Pete Wilson]]), [[John Linnell]] of [[They Might Be Giants]] and [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]] on their ''[[Graveyard Classics]]'' album of cover versions. Not long after, the Dead Kennedys had a second and bigger hit with "[[Holiday in Cambodia]]" from their debut album ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]''. ''[[AllMusic]]'' cites this song as "possibly the most successful single of the American hardcore scene"&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Stewart. "[{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2757927|pure_url=yes}} Holiday In Cambodia: Song Review]". ''Allmusic''. Retrieved January 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and Biafra counts it as his personal favorite Dead Kennedy's song.&lt;ref name="Progressive"/&gt; Minor hits from the album included "[[Kill the Poor]]" (about potential abuse of the then-new [[neutron bomb]]) and a satirical cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]."

The Dead Kennedys received some controversy in the spring of 1981 over the single "[[Too Drunk to Fuck]]." The song became a hit in Britain, and the [[BBC]] feared that it would manage to be a big enough hit to appear among the top 30 songs on the national charts, requiring a mention on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. However, the single peaked at number 31 in the charts.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;"[http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=jello&amp;sd=oJ@Cs0l-mWqsp@enOeg Biography of Jello Biafra] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312165236/http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=jello&amp;sd=oj@cs0l-mwqsp@enoeg |date=March 12, 2016 }}" (2001). ''AlternativeTentacles.com''. Retrieved February 19, 2005.{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later albums also contained memorable songs, but with less popularity than the earlier ones. The EP ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' contained the song "[[Nazi Punks Fuck Off!]]" as well as "We've Got A Bigger Problem Now," a rewritten version of "California Über Alles" about [[Ronald Reagan]]. Punk musician and scholar [[Vic Bondi]] considers the latter song to be the song that "defined the lyrical agenda of much of hardcore music, and represented its break with punk".&lt;ref&gt;Bondi, Vic. "Feeding Noise Back Into the System: Hardcore, Hip Hop, and Heavy Metal" (paper presented at the New England American Studies Association Conference, Brandeis University, Boston, MA, May 1, 1993). page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The band's most controversial album, ''[[Frankenchrist]]'', brought with it the song "MTV Get Off the Air," which accused [[MTV]] of promoting poor quality music and sedating the public. The album also contained a controversial poster by Swiss [[surrealism|surrealist]] artist [[H. R. Giger]] entitled ''[[Penis Landscape]]''.

The Dead Kennedys toured widely during their career, starting in the late 1970s. They began playing at San Francisco's Mabuhay Gardens (their home base) and other Bay Area venues, later branching out to shows in southern Californian clubs (most notably the [[Whisky a Go Go]]), but eventually they moved to major clubs across the country, including [[CBGB]] in New York. Later, they played to larger audiences such as at the 1980 Bay Area Music Awards (where they played the notorious "[[Pull My Strings]]" for the only time), and headlined the 1983 Rock Against Reagan festival.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Spencer. "[https://www.webcitation.org/6ASJZaztg?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040628105334/http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=online&amp;s=ackerman061404 Reagan's Punk Rock. Reagan Youth]". ''[[The New Republic]]''. June 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 1994, punk rock fans who believed Biafra was a "[[Selling out|sell out]]" attacked him at the [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. Biafra claims that he was attacked by a man nicknamed Cretin, who crashed into him while [[moshing]]. The crash injured Biafra's leg, causing an argument between the two men. During the argument, Cretin pushed Biafra to the floor and five or six friends of Cretin assaulted Biafra while he was down, yelling "Sellout rock star, kick him," and attempting to pull out his hair.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"&gt;Goldberg, Michael. "Jello Biafra Attacked". ''Rolling Stone''. July 14, 1994 &amp; July 28, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra was later hospitalized with serious injuries.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3666|pure_url=yes}} ''Allmusic''], having had both his legs broken. However, a July 1994 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' claims that his injuries included "extensive damage to the ligaments of one knee as well as a superficial head wound."&lt;/ref&gt; The attack derailed Biafra's plans for both a Canadian spoken-word tour and an accompanying album, and the production of ''[[Pure Chewing Satisfaction]]'' was halted. However, Biafra returned to the Gilman club a few months after the incident to perform a spoken-word performance as an act of reconciliation with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/title/2928/ |title=924 Gilman St DVD: Let's Talk About Tact and Timing |publisher=Microcosm Publishing |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biafra has been a prominent figure of the Californian punk scene and was one of the third generation members of the San Francisco punk community. Many later hardcore bands have cited the Dead Kennedys as a major influence.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Biafra's spoken word work has been less influential to other artists than his music. However, Biafra's spoken word work is often mentioned by [[Sean Kennedy (author)|Sean Kennedy]] as being a major influence on his work: "Episode 2". ''SKTFMTV''. By Sean Kennedy. Perf. Sean Kennedy, Jello Biafra. [http://sktfmtv.rantmedia.ca/ Rantmedia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203233939/http://sktfmtv.rantmedia.ca/ |date=February 3, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardcore punk author [[Steven Blush]] describes Biafra as hardcore's "biggest star" who was a "powerful presence whose political insurgence and rabid fandom made him the father figure of a burgeoning subculture [and an] inspirational force [who] could also be a real prick ... Biafra was a visionary, incendiary [performer]."&lt;ref&gt;Blush, Steven. ''American Hardcore: A Tribal History''. Los Angeles: Feral House, 2001. p. 102–103 {{ISBN|0-922915-71-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Dead Kennedys disbanded, Biafra's new songs were recorded with other bands, and he released only spoken word albums as solo projects. These collaborations had less popularity than Biafra's earlier work. However, his song "That's Progress", originally recorded with D.O.A. for the album ''Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors'', received considerable exposure when it appeared on the album ''[[Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1]]''.

====Obscenity prosecution====
In April 1986, police officers raided his house in response to complaints by the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC).&lt;ref&gt;Drozdowski, Ted. "[http://www.providencephoenix.com/archive/music/97/07/10/JELLO.html Bullshit detector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304152601/http://www.providencephoenix.com/archive/music/97/07/10/JELLO.html |date=March 4, 2006 }}". ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|Providence Phoenix]]''. Retrieved January 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1986, L.A. deputy city attorney Michael Guarino, working under City Attorney [[James Hahn]], brought Biafra to trial in Los Angeles for distributing "harmful material to minors" in the Dead Kennedys album ''[[Frankenchrist]]''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Guarino alleged that a family claimed that the poster had harmed their children. This was the first instance of a musician on trial for obscenity. Many sources cite the trial of [[2 Live Crew]] as the first, but that trial was three years after Biafra's trial.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dispute was about neither the music nor the lyrics from the album, but rather the print of the H. R. Giger poster ''Landscape XX'' (''[[Penis Landscape]]'') included with the album. Biafra believes the trial was politically motivated; it was often reported that the PMRC took Biafra to court as a cost-effective way of sending a message out to other musicians with content considered offensive in their music.&lt;ref&gt;Biafra, Jello. ''The Far Right and the Censorship of Music: An Attack on Freedom of Expression''. April 17, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music author Reebee Garofalo argued that Biafra and Alternative Tentacles may have been targeted because the label was a "small, self-managed and self-supported company that could ill afford a protracted legal battle."&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, Reebee. ''Rockin' Out: Popular Music in the USA''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1997. p.433–434 {{ISBN|0-205-13703-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing the possible sentence of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine, Biafra, [[Dirk Dirksen]], and Suzanne Stefanac founded the No More Censorship Defense Fund, a benefit featuring several punk rock bands, to help pay for his legal fees, which neither he nor his record label could afford. The jury deadlocked 5 to 7 in favor of acquittal, prompting a mistrial; despite a motion to re-try the case, the judge ordered all charges dropped.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The Dead Kennedys disbanded during the trial, in December 1986, due to the mounting legal costs; in the wake of their disbandment, Biafra made a career of his spoken word performances.

Biafra has a [[cameo role]] in the 1988 film ''[[Tapeheads]]''. He plays an [[FBI]] agent who arrests the two protagonists (played by [[Tim Robbins]] and [[John Cusack]]). While arresting them his character asks "Remember what we did to Jello Biafra?" lampooning the obscenity prosecution.

On March 25, 2005, Biafra appeared on the U.S. radio program ''[[This American Life]]'', [http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/285/Know-Your-Enemy "Episode 285: Know Your Enemy"], which featured a phone call between Jello Biafra and Michael Guarino, the prosecutor in the ''Frankenchrist'' trial.

====Lawsuit and reunion activities====
In October 1998, three former members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for nonpayment of royalties. The other members of Dead Kennedys alleged that Biafra, in his capacity as the head of [[Alternative Tentacles]] records, discovered an accounting error amounting to some $75,000 in unpaid royalties over almost a decade. Rather than informing his bandmates of this mistake, the suit alleged, Biafra knowingly concealed the information until a [[whistleblower]] employee at the record label notified the band.&lt;ref&gt;Dead Kennedys v. Biafra, 46 F.Supp.2d 1028 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Biafra, the suit resulted from his refusal to allow one of the band's most well-known singles, "[[Holiday in Cambodia]]", to be used in a commercial for [[Levi's]] Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's because of his claim that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor.&lt;ref&gt;Chun, Kimberly. "[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2001/05/11/kim.DTL&amp;type=music Everything's Better With Jello]". ''SFGate.com''. May 11, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra maintained that he had never denied them royalties, and that he himself had not even received royalties for re-releases of their albums or "posthumous" live albums which had been licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership. Decay Music denied this charge and have posted what they say are his cashed royalty checks, written to his legal name of Eric Boucher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadkennedys.com/check.htm |title=Welcome To The Official Website For Dead Kennedys |publisher=Deadkennedys.com |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biafra also complained about the songwriting credits in new reissues and archival live albums of songs, alleging that he was the sole composer of songs that were wrongly credited to the entire band.

In May 2000, a jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles "guilty of [[Malice (law)|malice]], [[shareholder oppression|oppression]] and [[fraud]]" by not promptly informing his former bandmates of the accounting error and instead withholding the information during subsequent discussions and contractual negotiations. Biafra was ordered to pay $200,000, including $20,000 in [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=17130 |title=Dead Kennedys Plan New Archival Releases Following Judgement Against Former Lead Singer Jello Biafra |publisher=Mi2N.com |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an appeal by Biafra's lawyers, in June 2003, the California Court of Appeal unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf |title=Westlaw : Dead Kennedys vs. Biafra |publisher=Phillaw.com |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227000532/http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf |archivedate=February 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the plaintiffs were awarded the rights to most of Dead Kennedys recorded works—which accounted for about half the sales for Alternative Tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/jello-biafra-gets-shot-down-by-dead-kennedys/  JELLO BIAFRA Gets Shot Down By DEAD KENNEDYS] Blabbermouth.com, accessed 2017-01-03&lt;/ref&gt; Now in control of the Dead Kennedys name, Biafra's former bandmates went on tour with a new lead vocalist.&lt;ref name=Penalty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/28168 |title=Jeff Penalty leaves the Dead Kennedys |work=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other bands===
[[File:Jello Biafra 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Biafra performing at the 2014 [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]]]]
In the early 1980s, Biafra collaborated with musicians Christian Lunch and [[Adrian Borland]] (of [[The Sound (band)|The Sound]]) for the [[electropunk]] musical project [[The Witch Trials]], releasing one self-titled EP in its lifetime.

In 1988, Biafra, with [[Al Jourgensen]] and [[Paul Barker]] of the band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], and [[Jeff Ward (musician)|Jeff Ward]], formed [[Lard (band)|Lard]]. The band became yet another side project for Ministry, with Biafra providing vocals and lyrics.

&lt;/ref&gt;  While working on the film ''[[Terminal City Ricochet]]'' in 1989, Biafra did a song for the film's soundtrack with D.O.A.. As a result, Biafra worked with D.O.A. on the album ''[[Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors]]''. Biafra also worked with [[Nomeansno]] on the soundtrack, which led to their collaboration on the album ''[[The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy]]'' the following year.  Biafra also provided lyrics for the song "Biotech is Godzilla" for Sepultura's 1993 album ''[[Chaos A.D.]]''.

In 1999, Biafra and other members of the [[anti-globalization]] movement protested the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Meeting of 1999]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. Along with other prominent West Coast musicians, he formed the short-lived band the [[No WTO Combo]] to help promote the movement's cause. The band was originally scheduled to play during the protest, but the performance was canceled due to riots. The band performed a short set the following night at the Showbox in downtown Seattle (outside the designated area), along with the hiphop group [[Michael Franti|Spearhead]]. No WTO Combo later released a CD of recordings from the concert, entitled ''[[Live from the Battle in Seattle]]''.

As of late 2005, Biafra was performing with the band The Melvins under the name "Jello Biafra and the Melvins", though fans sometimes refer to them as "The Jelvins." Together they have released two albums, and have been working on material for a third collaborative release, much of which was premiered live at two concerts at the [[Great American Music Hall]] in San Francisco during an event called Biafra Five-O, commemorating Biafra's 50th birthday, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Dead Kennedys, and the beginning of legalized same-sex marriage in California. Biafra is also working with a new band known as [[Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine]], which includes Ralph Spight of [[Victims Family]] on guitar and Billy Gould of [[Faith No More]] on bass. This group debuted during Biafra Five-O.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 2011, Biafra appeared in a singular concert event with an all-star cast of Southern musicians including members from [[Cowboy Mouth]], [[Dash Rip Rock]], Mojo Nixon and [[Down (band)|Down]] entitled, "Jello Biafra and the New Orleans Raunch &amp; Soul All Stars" who performed an array of classic Soul covers to a packed house at the 12-Bar in New Orleans, Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later reunite with many of the same musicians during the Carnival season 2014 to revisit many of these classics at Siberia, New Orleans. A live album from the 2011 performance, ''[[Walk on Jindal's Splinters]]'', and a companion single, ''Fannie May''/''Just a Little Bit'', were released in 2015.

===Alternative Tentacles===
In June 1979, Biafra co-founded the record label Alternative Tentacles, with which the Dead Kennedys released their first single, "California Über Alles".&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In  [http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf Dead Kennedys v.

Biafra became the sole owner of the label in 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The label was created to allow the band to release albums without having to deal with pressure from [[major label]]s to change their music, although the major labels were not willing to sign the band due to their songs being deemed too controversial.&lt;ref name="Huey"&gt;Huey, Steve. "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3666|pure_url=yes}} Jello Biafra]". ''Allmusic''. Retrieved February 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; After dealing with [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]] in the UK and [[IRS Records]] in the US for their first album ''Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables'', the band released all later albums, and later pressings of ''Fresh Fruit'' on Alternative Tentacles. The exception being live albums released after the band's break-up, which the other band members compiled from recordings in the band partnership's vaults without Biafra's input or endorsement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Biafra has been the owner of the company since its founding, though he does not receive a salary for his position; Biafra has referred to his position in the company as "absentee thoughtlord".&lt;ref name="Progressive"&gt;Vander Molen, Jodi. "[http://www.progressive.org/mag_intvbiafra Jello Biafra Interview]". ''The Progressive''. February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biafra is an ardent collector of unusual [[vinyl records]] of all kinds, from 1950s and 1960s ethno-pop recordings by the likes of [[Les Baxter]] and [[Juan García Esquivel|Esquivel]] to vanity pressings that have circulated regionally, to German crooner [[Heino]] (for whom he would later participate in the documentary ''Heino: Made In Germany''); he cites his always growing collection as one of his biggest musical influences. In 1993 he gave an interview to [[RE/Search|RE/Search Publications]] for their second ''Incredibly Strange Music'' book focusing primarily on these records, and later participated in a two-part episode of [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse TV]]'s program ''Crate Diggers'' on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jeEEwSQZoQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu2_SJcbWNE&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in such recordings, often categorized as [[outsider music]], led to his discovery of the prolific (and schizophrenic) singer/songwriter/artist [[Wesley Willis]], whom he signed to Alternative Tentacles in 1994, preceding Willis' major label deal with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]. His collection grew so large that on October 1, 2005, Biafra donated a portion of his collection to an annual yard sale co-promoted by Alternative Tentacles and held at their warehouse in [[Emeryville, California]].&lt;ref name="yardsale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/news.php?page=3&amp;news_section=MAIN&amp;window_size=15&amp;sd=E206Wu3H9XDt8-nfY3f |title=News |publisher=Alternative Tentacles |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, along with Alternative Tentacles employee and [[The Frisk]] lead singer Jesse Luscious, Biafra began co-hosting ''The Alternative Tentacles Batcast'', a downloadable [[podcast]] hosted by alternativetentacles.com. The show primarily focuses on interviews with artists and bands that are currently signed to the Alternative Tentacles label, although there are also occasional episodes where Biafra devoted the show to answering fan questions.

==Spoken word==
[[File:Jellobiafra.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|Biafra in an appearance in Aarau, Switzerland]]
Biafra became a spoken word artist in January 1986 with a performance at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. In his performance he combined humor with his political beliefs, much in the same way that he did with the lyrics to his songs. Despite his continued spoken word performances, he did not begin recording spoken word albums until after the disbanding of the Dead Kennedys.

His ninth spoken word album, ''[[In the Grip of Official Treason]]'', was released in October 2006.

Biafra was also featured in the British band [[Pitchshifter]]'s song ''[[Deviant (Pitchshifter album)|As Seen on TV]]'' reciting the words of dystopian futuristic radio advertisements.

==Politics==

Biafra was an anarchist in the 1980s, but has shifted away from his former anti-government views. In a 2012 interview, Biafra said "I'm very pro-tax as long as it goes for the right things. I don't mind paying more money as long as it's going to provide shelter for people sleeping in the street or getting the schools fixed back up, getting the infrastructure up to the standards of other countries, including a high speed rail system. I'm totally down with that."&lt;ref name=ghettoblaster&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ghettoblastermagazine.com/2012/interview-civics-101-with-jello-biafra/ |title=Interview: Civics 101 with Jello Biafra |publisher=Ghettoblaster Magazine |date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mayoral campaign===
{{quote box | width = 22em | quote = For those of them who have seen my candidacy as a publicity stunt or a joke, they should keep in mind that it is no more of a joke, and no less of a joke, than anyone else they care to name.|source = —Jello Biafra, ''Dead Kennedys: The Early Years''&lt;ref&gt;''Dead Kennedys: The Early Years'' (DVD). San Francisco, CA/Oaks, PA: Target Video/MVD, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the autumn of 1979, Biafra ran for mayor of San Francisco, using the [[Jell-O]] [[ad campaign]] catchphrase, "There's always room for Jello", as his campaign slogan. Having entered the race before creating a campaign platform, Biafra later wrote his platform on a napkin while attending a [[Pere Ubu (band)|Pere Ubu]] concert where Dead Kennedys drummer Ted told Biafra, "Biafra, you have such a big mouth that you should run for Mayor." As he campaigned, Biafra wore campaign T-shirts from his opponent [[Quentin Kopp]]'s previous campaign and at one point vacuumed leaves off the front lawn of another opponent, current U.S. Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], to mock her publicity stunt of sweeping streets in downtown San Francisco for a few hours. He also made a whistlestop campaign tour along the [[BART]] line. Supporters committed equally odd actions; two well known signs held by supporters said "If he doesn't win I'll kill myself" and "What if he does win?"&lt;ref name="runformayor"&gt;Biafra, Jello. "Running for Mayor". ''I Blow Minds for a Living''. San Francisco: Alternative Tentacles. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Francisco any individual could legally run for mayor if a petition was signed by 1500 people or if $1500 was paid. Biafra paid $900 and got signatures over time and eventually became a legal candidate, meaning he received statements put in voters' pamphlets and equal news coverage.

His [[political platform|platform]] included unconventional points such as forcing businessmen to wear clown suits within city limits, erecting statues of [[Dan White]], who assassinated Mayor [[George Moscone]] and City Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] in 1978, around the city and allowing the parks department to sell eggs and tomatoes with which people could pelt the statues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Silvers |first=Emma |date=4 November 2014 |title=35 Years Ago Today, Jello Biafra Came In Fourth In the S.F.

He finished third out of a field of ten, receiving 3.79% of the vote (6,591 votes);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=130138|title = San Francisco Mayor - Nov 6, 1979|publisher = Our Campaigns}}&lt;/ref&gt; the election ended in a [[Two-round system|runoff]] that did not involve him (Feinstein was declared the winner).

===Presidential campaign===
[[File:Jello Biafra talks about California politicsCC.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|Biafra discussing politics in 2006]]
In 2000, the [[Green Party of New York|New York State Green Party]] drafted Biafra as a candidate for the Green Party [[President of the United States|presidential]] nomination, and a few supporters were elected to the party's nominating [[2000 Green National Convention|convention]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]. Biafra chose death row inmate [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]] as his running mate. The party overwhelmingly chose Ralph Nader as the presidential candidate with 295 of the 319 delegate votes. Biafra received 10 votes.

Biafra, along with a camera crew (dubbed by Biafra as "The Camcorder Truth Jihad"), later reported for the [[Independent Media Center]] at the Republican and Democratic conventions.

===Post-2000===
After losing the 2000 nomination, Jello became highly active in [[Ralph Nader]]'s presidential campaign, as well as in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] and [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]]. During the [[Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2008|2008 campaign]] Jello played at rallies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/blog/2518.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107101529/http://livedaily.com/blog/2518.html |archivedate=January 7, 2009 |title=Tom Morello, Jello Biafra to appear at Ralph Nader rallies}}&lt;/ref&gt; and answered questions for journalists in support of Ralph Nader. When gay rights activists accused Nader of costing [[Al Gore]] the 2000 election, Biafra reminded them that [[Tipper Gore]]'s [[Parents Music Resource Center]] wanted warning stickers on albums with homosexual content.&lt;ref name=ghettoblaster/&gt;

After [[Barack Obama]] won the general election, Jello wrote an open letter making suggestions on how to run his term as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/31618 |title=Jello Biafra writes open letter to Obama |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra criticized Obama during his term, stating that "Obama even won the award for best advertising campaign of 2008."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.spinner.com/2009/10/20/jello-biafra-calls-out-bush-and-obama-on-the-audacity-of-hype/ |title=AOL Radio – Free Internet Radio – Listen to Millions of Songs, Hundreds of Stations Online |publisher=Spinner.com |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra dubbed Obama "Barackstar O'Bummer".&lt;ref name=ghettoblaster/&gt; Biafra refused to support Obama in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://215mag.com/jello-biafra-i-didnt-vote-for-obama-in-2008-and-no-way-am-i-voting-for-him-now/ |title=Jello Biafra: "..Didn't Vote For Obama In '08, No Way I'm Voting For Him Now" |publisher=215mag.com |date=September 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra has stated that he feels that Obama continued many of [[George W. Bush]]'s policies, summarizing Obama's policies as containing "worse and worse laws against human rights and more and more illegal unconstitutional spying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/48637/interviews-jello-biafra |title=Interviews: Jello Biafra |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2015, it was announced that Jello would be supporting [[Bernie Sanders]] in [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|his campaign]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://berniesanders.com/artists/|title=Artists and Cultural Leaders For Bernie Sanders|publisher=berniesanders.com|date= |accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has strongly criticised the political position of [[Donald Trump]], saying "how can people be so fucking stupid" on hearing the election result,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/jello-biafra-on-donald-trump-victory-how-can-people-be-so-fking-stupid/|title=Jello Biafra On Donald Trump : How can people be so fucking stupid|work=Blabbermouth|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later adding "The last person we want with their finger on the nuclear button is somebody connected to this extreme Christianist doomsday cult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/jello-biafra-on-how-to-resist-trump-why-punk-still-matters-w458690|title=Jello Biafra on How to Stand Up to Trump, Why Punk Still Matters|work=Rolling Stone|date=January 3, 2017|accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boycott of Israel ===
In the summer of 2011 Jello Biafra and his band were scheduled to play at the Barby Club in [[Tel Aviv]]. They came under heavy pressure by the pro-Palestinian [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign, and finally decided to cancel the gig – after a debate which according to Biafra  "deeply tore at the fabric of our band [. . .] This whole controversy has been one of the most intense situations of my life – and I thrive on intense situations".
Biafra then decided to travel to Israel and the Palestinian Occupied Territories, at his own expense, and talk with Israeli and Palestinian activists as well as with fans disappointed at his cancellation. In the article stating his conclusions he wrote:
"I will not perform in Israel unless it is a pro-human rights, anti-occupation event, that does not violate the spirit of the boycott. Each musician, artist, etc. must decide this for themselves. I am staying away for now, but am also really creeped out by the attitudes of some of the hardliners and hope some day to find a way to contribute something positive here. I will not march or sign on with anyone who runs around calling people Zionazis and is more interested in making threats than making friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/page.php?page=jello_israel |title=Jello Biafra – Thoughts on Visit to Israel |publisher=Alternative Tentacles |date=May 15, 1948 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Biafra married Theresa Soder, a.k.a. Ninotchka, lead singer of San Francisco-area punk band the Situations, on October 31, 1981.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Soder can be heard singing background vocals on "Forest Fire" and "Winnebago Warrior" from the Dead Kennedys' album ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]'', and playing synthesizer on "Drug Me" from the Dead Kennedys' ''Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables''.&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was conducted by [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] vocalist/bassist Bruce Loose, who became a [[Universal Life Church]] minister just to conduct the ceremony, which took place in a graveyard.&lt;ref name="biafra_marriage"&gt;''New Musical Express'' press clipping reproduced in ''Dead Kennedys: An Unauthorized Biography'', Last Gasp, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This reference done from memory, would someone be able to double-check?--&gt; The wedding reception, which members of Flipper, [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], and [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] attended, was held at director Joe Rees' [[Target Video]] studios.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rollins, ''Get In The Van: On The Road With Black Flag'', 2.13.61 Publications, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The marriage ended in 1986.

Biafra lives in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/jello-biafras-house/ |title=Jello Biafra's House |location=37.75819900;-122.43169600 |publisher=Virtual Globetrotting |date=February 26, 2008 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/adubber/5777176205/ |title=Sunny day outside Jello Biafra's house &amp;#124; Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kimveer Singh Gill''' (July 9, 1981 &amp;ndash; September 13, 2006) was the perpetrator of the [[Dawson College shooting]] at [[Dawson College]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada on September 13, 2006.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/09/14/gunman-shooting.html CBC News: Montreal gunman called himself 'angel of death']&lt;/ref&gt; He killed one student and wounded nineteen others before committing suicide.&lt;ref name="cnnrage"&gt;Associated Press, Allan Chernoff and Katherine Wojtecki [http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/09/14/montreal.shooting/index.html "College shooter showed rage, no motive" ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430192032/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/09/14/montreal.shooting/index.html |date=2008-04-30 }} cnn.com&lt;/ref&gt; Gill had a fascination with [[9/11 conspiracy theories]], [[Iraq War|the Iraq War]], and the [[Columbine High School massacre]].

==Background==
Kimveer Gill was a 25-year-old [[Canadians|Canadian]] born in [[Lachine, Quebec]], Canada. His parents were of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] descent, and moved to [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec]] from India in early 1981.&lt;ref name="who was"&gt;Montreal Gazette, Sue Montgomerey [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=b80740cf-e43e-411d-a131-b07ebaa8335b "Who was Kimveer Gill?" ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034421/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=b80740cf-e43e-411d-a131-b07ebaa8335b |date=2014-08-16 }} /www.Canada.com/montrealgazette&lt;/ref&gt;  The family later settled in the [[Fabreville]] area of Laval, Quebec in 1987. Kimveer attended Twin Oaks Elementary School in Laval from 1988 to 1993.

Gill later attended [[Rosemere High School]], where he was remembered by teachers as quiet and unassuming. Despite early media reports, he performed well academically, and most students remember him as having friends and certainly never being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id%3Dd1933b65-8a0c-454f-bff0-9e072f8918b5%26p%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114120417/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=d1933b65-8a0c-454f-bff0-9e072f8918b5&amp;p=1 |archivedate=2012-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Rosemere High School in June 1998 before enrolling in Vanier College with his friends, Steven Kulczycki, Jason Rust, and Andrew Page. However, he dropped out in January 1999.

Gill briefly received military training from the [[Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School]] in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]], from January 17 to February 16, 1999. He had told his friends he wished to eventually become a [[mercenary]]. He did not complete his basic training; for unknown reasons he was deemed unsuitable for military service and was voluntarily discharged before receiving weapons training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shooter had brief military service |work=theglobeandmail.com|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060915.wxshooting-gill16/BNStory/National/home |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill was a member of a rifle club and visited the Ville Saint-Pierre facility the day prior to the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcn.canoe.com/lcn/infos/regional/archives/2006/09/20060916-071848.html lcn.canoe.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MomN oticed"&gt;[http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/canada_world/story.html?id=b3472ac0-b095-40b6-84f4-8b4e69d0930b Killer's Mom Noticed Change In Son's Mood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117143059/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/canada_world/story.html?id=b3472ac0-b095-40b6-84f4-8b4e69d0930b |date=2016-01-17 }} September 16, 2006 report by CanWest news wire reporter Sue Montgomery, accessed online at [[Leader-Post]] website September 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill's funeral was held on September 19, 2006 in [[Dollard-des-Ormeaux]], [[Quebec]]. There was strict security outside, and only invited guests were allowed to attend the ceremony. The ceremony was held the same day as the funeral for [[Anastasia De Sousa]], the only other fatality of the shooting.

In extensive interviews with friends, family, teachers, and former colleagues, Gill was described as a quiet, nice, sensitive, generous person as well as "the nicest, gentlest person" with "a heart of gold." His friends say that Gill had a fascination with [[9/11 conspiracy theories]], the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], and the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]]. He liked [[Jack Daniel's]] whiskey and was a user of [[MDMA|ecstasy]]. In the last few months of his life, he ceased contact with his friends and parents, and seemed more depressed than ever.&lt;ref name="who was"/&gt;

==Dawson College shooting==
{{Wikinews|20 injured in Montreal college shooting spree}}
{{Main|Dawson College shooting}}
On September 13, 2006, Gill arrived at the [[Dawson College]] campus in Montreal, armed with a [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]] [[carbine]]. Before entering the cafeteria, he began shooting people outside the entrance and continued shooting once he had entered the school, killing 18-year-old Anastasia De Sousa and wounding nineteen other people and holding one student hostage before officer Denis Côté and other police officers shot him in the right arm. Gill then turned his gun on himself and committed suicide.  Authorities concluded the attack was premeditated, after a short [[suicide note]] was found strapped inside Gill's trenchcoat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcn.canoe.com/lcn/infos/regional/archives/2006/09/20060915-165141.html lcn.canoe.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible motives==
In mid-January 2007, the Montreal police department released additional information showing that Gill had planned on committing similar attacks at other institutions across the city of Montreal. Among those were the [[Université de Montréal]], and a secondary school in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]]. Some plans and maps were found in Gill's car near the site of the Dawson College event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Le tireur avait d'autres écoles dans sa mire (Shooter planned similar attacks to other schools)|work=[[Le Canal Nouvelles|LCN]]|date=2007-01-18|url=http://lcn.canoe.com/lcn/infos/regional/archives/2007/01/20070118-073350.html|accessdate= 2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A handwritten [[diary]] was found by police at Gill's home. A police source said, "It was very obvious his state of mind was deteriorating greatly over the last three weeks."&lt;ref name="MomN oticed"/&gt; In a statement made on October 20, 2006, the head of the major crime squad for Montreal police, Richard Dupuis, stated: "We know he was angry against the world, so it was a kind of vengeance... There is no explanation why Dawson. It could be Dawson, it could be another place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Dawson killer's friend charged with uttering threats|date=2006-10-21|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2006/10/20/dawson-threats.html | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VampireFreaks online profile==
An online image gallery on Gill's [[Vampirefreaks]].com blog, under his handle  fatality666 contained more than 50 photos depicting him in various poses. In several images, Gill either points a [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]] semi-automatic [[carbine]] at the camera, or wears a long black trench coat and what he identifies as combat boots. Some of the photos showing Gill with weapons were taken by a friend, according to his mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/topics/news/features/dawsonshooting/story.html?id=689b60e6-7ded-447c-b9b9-3d6ff521107b&amp;k=89135 canada.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010255/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/features/dawsonshooting/story.html?id=689b60e6-7ded-447c-b9b9-3d6ff521107b&amp;k=89135 |date=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his many posted grievances, he stated that he hated school and work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/09/14/montreal.shooting/index.html cnn.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430192032/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/09/14/montreal.shooting/index.html |date=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog was removed sometime prior to September 14, 2006.&lt;ref name="side-line_Gill"&gt;September 14, 2006.

'''Johann Kaspar Schmidt''' (25 October 1806 – 26 June 1856), better known as '''Max Stirner''', was a German philosopher who is often seen as one of the forerunners of [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], [[psychoanalytic theory]], [[postmodernism]] and [[individualist anarchism]].&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=max-stirner|title=Max Stirner|last=Leopold|first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodway, David 2006, p. 99"&gt;Goodway, David.

== Biography ==
[[File:MaxStirner'sbirthplace.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Max Stirner's birthplace in Bayreuth]]
Stirner was born in [[Bayreuth]], [[Bavaria]]. What little is known of his life is mostly due to the Scottish-born German writer [[John Henry Mackay]], who wrote a biography of Stirner (''Max Stirner – sein Leben und sein Werk''), published in German in 1898 (enlarged 1910, 1914) and translated into English in 2005. Stirner was the only child of Albert Christian Heinrich Schmidt (1769–1807) and Sophia Elenora Reinlein (1778–1839). His father died of [[tuberculosis]] on 19 April 1807 at the age of 37.&lt;ref name="seinleben"&gt;[http://www.nonserviam.com/stirner/bio/sein_leben/ "John Henry Mackay: Max Stirner – Sein Leben und sein Werk"]. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809, his mother remarried to Heinrich Ballerstedt (a [[pharmacist]]) and settled in [[West Prussia]]n Kulm (now [[Chełmno]], Poland). When Stirner turned 20, he attended the [[University of Berlin]],&lt;ref name="seinleben"/&gt; where he studied [[philology]], philosophy and theology. He attended the lectures of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], who was to become a source of inspiration for his thinking.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', volume 8, The Macmillan Company and The Free Press, New York 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Hegel's lectures on the history of philosophy, the philosophy of religion and the subjective spirit. Stirner then moved to the [[University of Erlangen]], which he attended at the same time as [[Ludwig Feuerbach]].{{sfn|Stepelevich|1985|p=602}}

Stirner returned to Berlin and obtained a teaching certificate, but he was unable to obtain a full-time teaching post from the Prussian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=[[Demanding the Impossible]]|year=1992|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0002178559|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Berlin in 1841, Stirner participated in discussions with a group of young philosophers called ''[[Die Freien]]'' ("The Free") and whom historians have subsequently categorized as the [[Young Hegelians]]. Some of the best known names in 19th century literature and [[19th century philosophy|philosophy]] were involved with this group, including [[Karl Marx]], [[Frederick Engels|Friedrich Engels]], [[Bruno Bauer]] and [[Arnold Ruge]]. Contrary to popular belief, Feuerbach was not a member of ''Die Freien'', although he was heavily involved in Young Hegelian discourse. While some of the Young Hegelians were eager subscribers to Hegel's [[dialectical]] method and attempted to apply dialectical approaches to Hegel's conclusions, the left-wing members of the group broke with Hegel. Feuerbach and Bauer led this charge.

Frequently the debates would take place at Hippel's, a [[wine bar]] in [[Friedrichstraße]], attended by among others Marx and Engels, who were both adherents of Feuerbach at the time. Stirner met with Engels many times and Engels even recalled that they were "great friends",&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Lawrence L Stepelevich, The revival of Max Stirner&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still unclear whether Marx and Stirner ever met. It does not appear that Stirner contributed much to the discussions, but he was a faithful member of the club and an attentive listener.&lt;ref&gt;Gide, Charles and Rist, Charles. A History of Economic Doctrines from the Time of the Physiocrats to the Present Day. Harrap 1956, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; The most-often reproduced portrait of Stirner is a cartoon by Engels, drawn forty years later from memory at biographer Mackay's request. It is highly likely that this and the group sketch of ''Die Freien'' at Hippel's are the only firsthand images of Stirner. Stirner worked as a teacher in a school for young girls owned by Madame Gropius&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 8, The Macmillan Company and The Free Press, New York 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; when he wrote his major work, ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', which in part is a [[polemic]] against Feuerbach and Bauer, but also against [[communists]] such as [[Wilhelm Weitling]] and the [[anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. He resigned from his teaching position in anticipation of controversy from this work's publication in October 1844.

Stirner married twice. His first wife was Agnes Burtz (1815–1838), the daughter of his landlady, who he married on 12 December 1837. However, she died from complications with pregnancy in 1838. In 1843, he married [[Marie Dähnhardt]], an intellectual associated with ''Die Freien''. They divorced in 1846. ''The Ego and Its Own'' was dedicated "to my sweetheart Marie Dähnhardt". Marie later converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and died in 1902 in London.

After ''The Ego and Its Own'', Stirner wrote ''Stirner's Critics'' and translated [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and [[Jean-Baptiste Say]]'s ''Traite d'Economie Politique'' into German to little financial gain. He also wrote a compilation of texts titled ''History of Reaction'' in 1852. Stirner died in 1856 in Berlin from an infected insect bite and it is said that [[Bruno Bauer]] was the only Young Hegelian present at his funeral, held at the [[Friedhof II der Sophiengemeinde Berlin]].

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Philosophy of Max Stirner}}
{{see also|Egotism|Egoist anarchism}}
The philosophy of Stirner is credited as a major influence in the development of [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]] and [[post-modernism]] as well as [[individualist anarchism]], [[post-anarchism]] and [[post-left anarchy]]. Stirner's main philosophical work was ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', also known as ''The Ego and His Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' in German, which translates literally as ''The Unique One and His Property'').

=== Egoism ===
{{Individualism sidebar|Thinkers}}
Stirner argues that individuals are impossible to fully comprehend. All mere concepts of the self will always be inadequate to fully describe the nature of our experience. Stirner has been broadly understood as a proponent of both [[psychological egoism]] and [[ethical egoism]], although the latter position can be disputed as there is no claim in Stirner's writing in which one ought to pursue one's own interest and further claiming any ought could be seen as a new fixed idea. However, he may be understood as a [[rational egoist]] in the sense that he considered it irrational not to act in one's self-interest. However, how this self-interest is defined is necessarily subjective, allowing both selfish and altruistic normative claims to be included. Individual self-realization rests on each individual's desire to fulfill their [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]]. The difference between an unwilling and a willing egoist is that the former will be possessed by an empty idea and believe that they are fulfilling a higher cause, but usually being unaware that they are only fulfilling their own desires to be happy or secure; and the latter, in contrast, will be a person that is able to freely choose its actions, fully aware that they are only fulfilling individual desires: {{quotation|Sacred things exist only for the egoist who does not acknowledge himself, the ''involuntary egoist'' [...] in short, for the egoist who would like not to be an egoist, and abases himself (combats his egoism), but at the same time abases himself only for the sake of "being exalted", and therefore of gratifying his egoism. Because he would like to cease to be an egoist, he looks about in heaven and earth for higher beings to serve and sacrifice himself to; but, however much he shakes and disciplines himself, in the end he does all for his own sake [...] [on] this account I call him the involuntary egoist. [...] As you are each instant, you are your own creature in this very 'creature' you do not wish to lose yourself, the creator.  You are yourself a higher being than you are, and surpass yourself [...] just this, as an involuntary egoist, you fail to recognize; and therefore the 'higher essence' is to you – an alien essence. [...] Alienness is a criterion of the "sacred".|Max Stirner&lt;ref&gt;Ibidem, Cambridge edition, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The contrast is also expressed in terms of the difference between the voluntary egoist being the possessor of his concepts as opposed to being possessed. Only when one realizes that all sacred truths such as law, [[Rights|right]], [[morality]], religion and so on are nothing other than artificial concepts—and not to be obeyed—can one act freely. For Stirner, to be free is to be both one's own "creature" (in the sense of creation) and one's own "creator" (dislocating the traditional role assigned to the gods). To Stirner, power is the method of egoism—it is the only justified method of gaining [[Property (philosophy)|property]].

=== Anarchism ===
Stirner proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions—including the notion of [[State (polity)|state]], [[Property#Property in philosophy|property as a right]], [[natural rights]] in general and the very notion of society—were mere illusions, "spooks" or ghosts in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike. ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated egoism and a form of [[amoralism]] in which individuals would unite in unions of egoists only when it was in their self-interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property" and "[w]hat I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing". He says: "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref name="Stirner, Max p. 248"&gt;Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner considers the world and everything in it, including other persons, available to one's taking or use without moral constraint&lt;ref name="Moggach, Douglas p. 194"&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and that rights do not exist in regard to objects and people at all. He sees no rationality in taking the interests of others into account unless doing so furthers one's self-interest, which he believes is the only legitimate reason for acting. He denies society as being an actual entity, calling society a "spook" and that "the individuals are its reality" (''The Ego and Its Own'').

==== Union of egoists ====
{{main|Union of egoists}}
Stirner's idea of the [[Union of egoists]] was first expounded in ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]''. The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the [[Sovereign state|state]].&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Paul|title=Karl Marx and the Anarchists|publisher=[[Routledge]]/[[Kegan Paul]]|location=London|year=1985|isbn=0-7102-0685-2|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a "community", in which individuals are obliged to participate, Stirner's suggested Union would be voluntary and instrumental under which individuals would freely associate insofar as others within the Union remain useful to each constituent individual.&lt;ref name=Cohn&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cohn |first1=Jesse |title=What is Postanarchism 'Post'? |journal=[[Postmodern Culture]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |date=September 2002 |url=http://pmc.iath.virginia.edu/issue.902/13.1cohn.html |language=en |doi=10.1353/pmc.2002.0028 |issn=1053-1920 |via=[[Project MUSE]] |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union relation between egoists is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will.&lt;ref name="nonserviam"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13|title=The union of egoists|journal=Non Serviam|volume=1|first=Svein Olav|last=Nyberg|pages=13–14|location=Oslo, Norway|oclc=47758413|accessdate=1 September 2012|publisher=Svein Olav Nyberg|postscript={{inconsistent citations}}|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207042220/http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf|archivedate=7 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union requires that all parties participate out of a [[Selfishness|conscious egoism]]. If one party silently finds themselves to be suffering, but puts up and keeps the appearance, the union has degenerated into something else.&lt;ref name=nonserviam/&gt; This union is not seen as an [[authority]] above a person's own will.

Stirner's hyperindividualism puts him outside mainstream anarchist philosophy, which emphasizes community and [[collective]] organization.{{r|Cohn}}

==== Revolution ====
Stirner criticizes conventional notions of [[revolution]], arguing that [[social movement]]s aimed at overturning the state are tacitly statist because they are implicitly aimed at the establishment of a new state thereafter.

=== Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's possible influence ===
[[File:Stirner02.jpg|thumb|150px|Caricature of Max Stirner taken from a sketch by Friedrich Engels (1820–1895) of the meetings of ''[[Die Freien]]'']]
Scholar Lawrence Stepelevich argues that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was a major influence on ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]''. While the latter has an "un-Hegelian structure and tone" on the whole and is hostile to Hegel's conclusions about the self and the world, Stepelevich argues that Stirner's work is best understood as answering Hegel's question of the role of consciousness after it has contemplated "untrue knowledge" and become "absolute knowledge". Stirner, Stepelevich concludes, presents the consequences of the rediscovering one's self-consciousness after realizing self-determination.{{sfn|Stepelevich|1985}}

Scholars such as [[Douglas Moggach]] and Widukind De Ridder have argued that Stirner was obviously a student of Hegel, like his contemporaries [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]], but this does not necessarily make him an Hegelian. Contrary to the Young Hegelians, Stirner scorned all attempts at an immanent critique of Hegel and the Enlightenment and renounced Bauer and Feuerbach's emancipatory claims as well. Contrary to Hegel, who considered the given as an inadequate embodiment of rationality, Stirner leaves the given intact by considering it a mere object, not of transformation, but of enjoyment and consumption ("His Own").&lt;ref name="Moggach, Douglas &amp; De Ridder, Widukind p. 82–83"&gt;Moggach, Douglas and De Ridder, Widukind.

The self was moreover considered a field of action, a 'never-being I'. The 'I' had no essence to realize and life itself was a process of self-dissolution. Far from accepting, like the humanist Hegelians, a construal of subjectivity endowed with a universal and ethical mission, Stirner's notion of 'the Unique' (''Der Einzige'') distances itself from any conceptualization whatsoever: 'There is no development of the concept of the Unique. No philosophical system can be built out of it, as it can out of Being, or Thinking, or the I. Rather, with it, all development of the concept ceases. The person who views it as a principle thinks that he can treat it philosophically or theoretically and necessarily wastes his breath arguing against it'.|Douglas Moggach and Widukind De Ridder&lt;ref&gt;"Hegelianism in Restoration Prussia,1841–1848: Freedom, Humanism and 'Anti-Humanism' in Young Hegelian Thought.", In: 'Hegel's Thought in Europe: Currents, Crosscurrents and Undercurrents', ed.

== Works ==
=== ''The False Principle of our Education'' ===
{{main|The False Principle of our Education}}
In 1842, ''Das unwahre Prinzip unserer Erziehung'' (''[[The False Principle of our Education]]'') was published in [[Rheinische Zeitung]], which was edited by Marx at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, The Macmillan company Press, New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Written as a reaction to Otto Friedrich Theodor Heinsius' treatise ''Humanism vs. Realism'', Stirner explains that education in either the classical humanist method or the practical realist method still lacks true value. Education is therefore fulfilled in aiding the individual in becoming an individual.

=== ''Art and Religion'' ===
''Kunst und Religion'' (''Art and Religion'') was also published in [[Rheinische Zeitung]] on 14 June 1842. It addresses Bruno Bauer and his publication against Hegel called ''Hegel's doctrine of religion and art judged from the standpoint of faith''. Bauer had inverted Hegel's relation between Art and Religion, by claiming that Art was much more closely related to Philosophy than Religion, based on their shared determinacy and clarity, and a common ethical root. However, Stirner went beyond both Hegel and Bauer's criticism by asserting that "Art" rather created an object for "Religion" and could thus by no means be related to what Stirner considered—in opposition with Hegel and Bauer—to be "Philosophy": {{quotation|It [philosophy] neither stands opposed to an Object, as Religion, nor makes one, as Art, but rather places its pulverizing hand upon all the business of making Objects as well as the whole of objectivity itself, and so breathes the air of freedom. Reason, the spirit of Philosophy, concerns itself only with itself, and troubles itself over no Object.|Max Stirner&lt;ref&gt;''Art and Religion'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stirner deliberately left Philosophy out of the dialectical triad (Art–Religion–Philosophy) by claiming that Philosophy "doesn't bother itself with objects" (Religion), nor does it "make an object" (Art). In Stirner's account, Philosophy was in fact indifferent towards both Art and Religion. Stirner thus mocked and radicalised Bauer's criticism of religion.&lt;ref name="Moggach, Douglas &amp; De Ridder, Widukind p. 82–83"/&gt;

=== ''The Ego and Its Own'' ===
{{main|The Ego and Its Own}}
Stirner's main work is ''Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum'' (in modern German spelling ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum''; in English ''[[The Ego and Its Own]],'' literally ''The Unique and Its Property''), which appeared in [[Leipzig]] in October 1844, with as year of publication mentioned 1845. In ''The Ego And Its Own'', Stirner launches a radical [[anti-authoritarian]] and [[individualist]] critique of contemporary [[Prussia]]n society and modern western society as such. He offers an approach to human existence in which he depicts himself as "the unique one", a "creative nothing," beyond the ability of language to fully express: {{quotation|If I concern myself for myself, the unique one, then my concern rests on its transitory, mortal creator, who consumes himself, and I may say: All things are nothing to me.|Max Stirner&lt;ref&gt;''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book proclaims that all religions and ideologies rest on empty concepts. The same holds true for society's institutions that claim authority over the individual, be it the state, legislation, the church, or the systems of education such as universities.

Stirner's argument explores and extends the limits of criticism, aiming his critique especially at those of his contemporaries, particularly Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer; and at popular ideologies, including religion, [[liberalism]] and [[humanism]] (which he regarded as analogous to religion with the abstract Man or humanity as the supreme being), [[nationalism]], [[statism]], [[capitalism]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]]: {{quotation|In the time of spirits thoughts grew till they overtopped my head, whose offspring they yet were; they hovered about me and convulsed me like fever-phantasies – an awful power. The thoughts had become corporeal on their own account, were ghosts, e. g. God, Emperor, Pope, Fatherland, etc. If I destroy their corporeity, then I take them back into mine, and say: "I alone am corporeal." And now I take the world as what it is to me, as mine, as my property; I refer all to myself.|Max Stirner&lt;ref&gt;''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== ''Stirner's Critics'' ===
''Recensenten Stirners'' (''Stirner's Critics'') was published in September 1845 in ''Wigands Vierteljahrsschrift''. It is a response in which Stirner refers to himself in the third-person to three critical reviews of ''The Ego and its Own'' by [[Moses Hess]] in ''Die letzten Philosophen'' (''The Last Philosophers''), by a certain Szeliga (alias of an adherent of [[Bruno Bauer]]) in an article in the journal ''Norddeutsche Blätter'' and by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] anonymously in an article called ''Über 'Das Wesen des Christentums' in Beziehung auf Stirners 'Der Einzige und sein Eigentum' '' (''On 'The Essence of Christianity' in Relation to Stirner's 'The Ego and its Own''') in ''Wigands Vierteljahrsschrift''.

=== ''The Philosophical Reactionaries'' ===
''Die Philosophischen Reactionäre'' (''The Philosophical Reactionaries'') was published in 1847 in ''Die Epigonen'', a journal edited by Otto Wigand from Leipzig. At the time, Wigand had already published ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' and was about to finish the publication of Stirner's translations of Adam Smith and Jean-Baptiste Say. As the subtitle indicates, ''Die Philosophischen Reactionäre'' was written in response to an article by Kuno Fischer (1824–1907) entitled ''Die Moderne Sophisten'' (1847). The article was signed G. Edward and its authorship has been disputed ever since John Henry Mackay "cautiously" attributed it to Stirner and included it in his collection of Stirner's lesser writings. It was first translated into English in 2011 and the introductory note explains: {{quotation|Mackay based his attribution of this text to Stirner on Kuno Fischer's subsequent reply to it, in which the latter, 'with such determination', identified G. Edward as Max Stirner. The article was entitled 'Ein Apologet der Sophistik und "ein Philosophischer Reactionäre"' and was published alongside 'Die Philosophischen Reactionäre'. Moreover, it seems rather odd that Otto Wigand would have published 'Edward's' piece back- to-back with an article that falsely attributed it to one of his personal associates at the time. And, indeed, as Mackay went on to argue, Stirner never refuted this attribution. This remains, however, a slim basis on which to firmly identify Stirner as the author. This circumstantial evidence has led some scholars to cast doubts over Stirner's authorship, based on both the style and content of 'Die Philosophischen Reactionäre'. One should, however, bear in mind that it was written almost three years after ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'', at a time when Young Hegelianism had withered away.|Max Stirner&lt;ref&gt;"The Philosophical Reactionaries: 'The Modern Sophists' by Kuno Fischer", Newman, Saul (ed.), Max Stirner (Critical Explorations in Contemporary Political Thought), Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 90 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The majority of the text deals with Kuno Fischer's definition of sophism. With much wit, the self-contradictory nature of Fischer's criticism of Sophism is exposed. Fischer had made a sharp distinction between Sophism and philosophy, while at the same time considering Sophism as the "mirror image of philosophy". The Sophists breathe "philosophical air" and were "dialectically inspired to a formal volubility". Stirner's answer is striking: {{quotation|Have you philosophers really no clue that you have been beaten with your own weapons? Only one clue. What can your common sense reply when I dissolve dialectically what you have merely posited dialectically? You have showed me with what kind of 'volubility' one can turn everything to nothing and nothing to everything, black into white and white into black. What do you have against me, when I return to you your pure art?|Max Stirner&lt;ref&gt;"The Philosophical Reactionaries: 'The Modern Sophists' by Kuno Fischer", ''Newman, Saul (ed.), Max Stirner (Critical Explorations in Contemporary Political Thought), Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 99 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Looking back on ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'', Stirner claims: {{quotation|Stirner himself has described his book as, in part, a clumsy expression of what he wanted to say. It is the arduous work of the best years of his life, and yet he calls it, in part, 'clumsy'. That is how hard he struggled with a language that was ruined by philosophers, abused by state-, religious- and other believers, and enabled a boundless confusion of ideas.|Max Stirner&lt;ref&gt;"The Philosophical Reactionaries: 'The Modern Sophists' by Kuno Fischer", ''Newman, Saul (ed.), Max Stirner (Critical Explorations in Contemporary Political Thought), Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 104 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== ''History of Reaction'' ===
''Geschichte der Reaktion'' (''History of Reaction'') was published in two volumes in 1851 by Allgemeine Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt and immediately banned in Austria.&lt;ref name="seinleben"/&gt; It was written in the context of the recent [[revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 revolutions in German states]] and is mainly a collection of the works of others selected and translated by Stirner. The introduction and some additional passages were Stirner's work. [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Auguste Comte]] are quoted to show two opposing views of [[revolution]].

== Critical reception ==
Stirner's work did not go unnoticed among his contemporaries. Stirner's attacks on ideology—in particular Feuerbach's [[humanism]]—forced Feuerbach into print. [[Moses Hess]] (at that time close to Marx) and Szeliga (pseudonym of [[Franz Zychlin von Zychlinski]], an adherent of Bruno Bauer) also replied to Stirner. Stirner answered the criticism in a German periodical in the article ''Stirner's Critics'' (original title ''Recensenten Stirners'', September 1845), which clarifies several points of interest to readers of the book—especially in relation to Feuerbach.

While Marx's ''Sankt Max'' (large part of ''Die Deutsche Ideologie''/''[[The German Ideology]]''), not published until 1932, so assured ''The Ego and Its Own'' a place of curious interest among [[Marxist]] readers, Marx's ridicule of Stirner has played a significant role in the preservation of Stirner's work in popular and academic discourse despite lacking mainstream popularity.

== Comments by contemporaries ==
Twenty years after the appearance of Stirner's book, the author [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] wrote the following: {{quotation|Stirner went so far in his notorious work, 'Der Einzige und Sein Eigenthum' (1845), as to reject all moral ideas. Everything that in any way, whether it be external force, belief, or mere idea, places itself above the individual and his caprice, Stirner rejects as a hateful limitation of himself. What a pity that to this book – the extremest that we know anywhere – a second positive part was not added. It would have been easier than in the case of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]'s philosophy; for out of the unlimited Ego I can again beget every kind of [[Idealism]] as ''my'' [[Will (philosophy)|will]] and ''my'' [[idea]]. Stirner lays so much stress upon the will, in fact, that it appears as the root force of human nature. It may remind us of [[Schopenhauer]].|Friedrich Albert Lange&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Materialism]]'', ii. 256 (1865).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some people believe that in a sense a "second positive part" was soon to be added, though not by Stirner, but by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. [[Relationship between Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner|The relationship between Nietzsche and Stirner]] seems to be much more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/ennietzsche.html Bernd A. Laska: Nietzsche's initial crisis]. In: Germanic Notes and Reviews, vol. 33, n. 2, fall/Herbst 2002, pp. 109–133.&lt;/ref&gt; According to George J. Stack's ''Lange and Nietzsche'',&lt;ref&gt;George J. Stack, ''Lange and Nietzsche'', Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York, 1983, p. 12, {{ISBN|978-3-11-008866-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche read Lange's ''History of Materialism'' "again and again" and was therefore very familiar with the passage regarding Stirner.

== Influence ==
While ''Der Einzige'' was a critical success and attracted much reaction from famous philosophers after publication, it was out of print and the notoriety that it had provoked had faded many years before Stirner's death.&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=max-stirner |title=Max Stirner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner had a destructive impact on [[left-Hegelianism]], but [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|his philosophy]] was a significant influence on Marx and his magnum opus became a founding text of [[individualist anarchism]].&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; [[Edmund Husserl]] once warned a small audience about the "seducing power" of ''Der Einzige'', but he never mentioned it in his writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/eninnuce.html "Max Stirner, a durable dissident – in a nutshell"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; As the art critic and Stirner admirer [[Herbert Read]] observed, the book has remained "stuck in the gizzard" of Western culture since it first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Read's book, "The Contrary Experience", Faber and Faber, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thinkers have read and been affected by ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' in their youth including [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Victor Serge]],&lt;ref&gt;See Memoirs of a revolutionary, 1901–1941 by Victor Serge.

Nürnberg: LSR-Verlag 1997 ([http://www.lsr-projekt.de/msstudien.html#ss3 online]).&lt;/ref&gt; Several other authors, philosophers and artists have cited, quoted or otherwise referred to Max Stirner.

Since its appearance in 1844, ''The Ego and Its Own'' has seen periodic revivals of popular, political and academic interest based around widely divergent translations and interpretations—some psychological, others political in their emphasis. Today, many ideas associated with [[post-left anarchy]]'s criticism of ideology and uncompromising [[individualism]] are clearly related to Stirner's. His ideas were also adopted by [[post-anarchism]], with [[Saul Newman]] largely in agreement with many of Stirner's criticisms of [[classical anarchism]], including his rejection of revolution and [[essentialism]].

=== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ===
[[File:Skiz-hegel.png|thumb|Caricature by Engels of the meetings of ''Die Freien'']]
[[Friedrich Engels]] commented on Stirner in poetry at the time of ''[[Die Freien]]'': {{quotation|
Look at Stirner, look at him, the peaceful enemy of all constraint.&lt;br&gt;
For the moment, he is still drinking beer,&lt;br&gt;
Soon he will be drinking blood as though it were water.&lt;br&gt;
When others cry savagely "down with the kings"&lt;br&gt;
Stirner immediately supplements "down with the laws also."&lt;br&gt;
Stirner full of dignity proclaims;&lt;br&gt;
You bend your willpower and you dare to call yourselves free.&lt;br&gt;
You become accustomed to slavery&lt;br&gt;
Down with [[dogmatism]], down with law.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Arvon, Aux sources de 1'existentialisme Max Stirner (Paris, 1954), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He once even recalled at how they were "great friends (Duzbrüder)".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; In November 1844, Engels wrote a letter to [[Karl Marx]]. He reported first on a visit to Moses Hess in [[Cologne]] and then went on to note that during this visit Hess had given him a press copy of a new book by Max Stirner, ''Der Einzige und Sein Eigenthum''. In his letter to Marx, Engels promised to send a copy of ''Der Einzige'' to him, for it certainly deserved their attention as Stirner "had obviously, among the 'Free Ones', the most talent, independence and diligence".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; To begin with, Engels was enthusiastic about the book and expressed his opinions freely in letters to Marx: {{quotation|But what is true in his principle, we, too, must accept. And what is true is that before we can be active in any cause we must make it our own, [[Egoist anarchism|egoistic]] cause-and that in this sense, quite aside from any material expectations, we are communists in virtue of our egoism, that out of egoism we want to be human beings and not merely individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Zwischen 18 and 25, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, Marx and Engels wrote a major criticism of Stirner's work. The number of pages Marx and Engels devote to attacking Stirner in (the unexpurgated text of) ''[[The German Ideology]]'', in which they derided him as ''Sankt Max'' ("Saint Max"), exceeds the total of Stirner's written works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Marx,+Karl/Die+deutsche+Ideologie/I.+Band%3A+%5BKritik+der+neuesten+deutschen+Philosophie+in+ihren+Repr%C3%A4sentanten+Feuerbach,+B.+Bauer+und+Stirner%5D/III.+Sankt+Max "Chapter ''Sankt Max'' in ''Die deutsche Ideologie''].&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Isaiah Berlin]] has described it, Stirner "is pursued through five hundred pages of heavy-handed mockery and insult".&lt;ref&gt;I. Berlin, Karl Marx (New York, 1963), 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was written in 1845–1846, but it was not published until 1932. Marx's lengthy, ferocious [[polemic]] against Stirner has since been considered an important turning point in Marx's intellectual development from [[idealism]] to [[materialism]]. It has been argued that [[historical materialism]] was Marx's method of reconciling communism with a Stirnerite rejection of morality.&lt;ref&gt;G. Stedman-Jones, 'Introduction' in K. Marx and F. Engels, The Communist Manifesto (London, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stirner and post-structuralism ===
{{see also|Post-anarchism}}
The influential French [[Poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] thinker [[Jacques Derrida]] in his book ''[[Specters of Marx]]'' dealt with Stirner and his relationship with Marx while also analysing Stirner's concept of "specters" or "spooks".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]]. ''[[Specters of Marx]]''. Routledge. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilles Deleuze]], another key thinker associated with post-structuralism mentions Stirner briefly in his book ''[[The Logic of Sense]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Human or divine, as Stirner said, the predicates are the same whether they belong analytically to the divine being, or whether they are synthetically bound to the human form" (Gilles Deleuze. ''[[The Logic of Sense]]''. Continuum. 2004). p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Newman]] calls Stirner a proto-[[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] who on the one hand had essentially anticipated modern post-structuralists such as [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], [[Deleuze]] and [[Derrida]], but on the other had already transcended them, thus providing what they were unable to—i.e. a ground for a [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]] critique of present liberal capitalist society. This is particularly evident in Stirner's identification of the self with a "creative nothing", a thing that cannot be bound by ideology (like leftist or Marxists ideology of French post-structuralists), inaccessible to representation in language.

=== Possible influence on Friedrich Nietzsche ===
{{main|Relationship between Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner}}
The ideas of Max Stirner and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] have often been compared and many authors have discussed apparent similarities in their writings, sometimes raising the question of influence.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Levy, ''Stirner and Nietzsche'', Paris, 1904; Robert Schellwien, ''Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche'', 1892; H.L. Mencken, ''The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche'', 1908; K. Löwith, From Hegel To Nietzsche New York, 1964, p. 187; R. A. Nicholls, "Beginnings of the Nietzsche Vogue in Germany", in ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 56, No. 1, August 1958, pp. 24–37; T. A. Riley, "Anti-Statism in German Literature, as Exemplified by the Work of John Henry Mackay", in ''PMLA'', Vol. 62, No. 3, September 1947, pp. 828–843; Seth Taylor, ''Left Wing Nietzscheans, The Politics of German Expressionism 1910–1920'', p. 144, 1990, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York; Gilles Deleuze, ''Nietzsche et la Philosophy'', Presses Universitaires de France, 1962; R. C. Solomon and K. M. Higgins, ''The Age of German Idealism'', p. 300, Routledge, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, during the early years of Nietzsche's emergence as a well-known figure the only thinker discussed in connection with his ideas more often than Stirner was [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;While discussion of possible influence has never ceased entirely, the period of most intense discussion occurred between 1892 and 1900 in the German-speaking world. During this time, the most comprehensive account of Nietzsche's reception in the German language, the 4-volume work of Richard Frank Krummel called ''Nietzsche und der deutsche Geist'', indicates 83 entries discussing Stirner and Nietzsche. The only thinker more frequently discussed in connection with Nietzsche during this time is Schopenhauer, with about twice the number of entries. Discussion steadily declines thereafter, but it is still significant. Nietzsche and Stirner show 58 entries between 1901 and 1918. From 1919 to 1945, there are 28 entries regarding Nietzsche and Stirner.&lt;/ref&gt; It is certain that Nietzsche read about ''The Ego and Its Own'', which was mentioned in [[Friedrich Albert Lange|Friedrich Albert Lange's]] ''History of Materialism'' and [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]]'s ''Philosophy of the Unconscious'', both of which Nietzsche knew well.&lt;ref&gt;"Apart from the information which can be gained from the annotations, the library (and the books Nietzsche read) shows us the extent, and the bias, of Nietzsche's knowledge of many fields, such as evolution and cosmology. Still more obvious, the library shows us the extent and the bias of Nietzsche's knowledge about many persons to whom he so often refers with ad hominem statements in his works. This includes not only such important figures as Mill, Kant, and Pascal but also such minor ones (for Nietzsche) as Max Stirner and William James who are both discussed in books Nietzsche read". T. H. Brobjer, "Nietzsche's Reading and Private Library", 1885–1889, in ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 58, No. 4, October 1997, pp. 663–693; Stack believes it is doubtful that Nietzsche read Stirner, but notes "he was familiar with the summary of his theory he found in Lange's history." George J. Stack, ''Lange and Nietzsche'', Walter de Gruyter, 1983, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no indication that he actually read it as no mention of Stirner is known to exist anywhere in Nietzsche's publications, papers or correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Levy, ''Stirner and Nietzsche'', Paris, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a biographical discovery revealed it is probable that Nietzsche had encountered Stirner's ideas before he read Hartmann and Lange in October 1865, when he met with Eduard Mushacke, an old friend of Stirner's during the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/ennietzsche.html Bernd A. Laska: Nietzsche's initial crisis]. In: Germanic Notes and Reviews, vol. 33, n. 2, fall/Herbst 2002, pp. 109–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet as soon as Nietzsche's work began to reach a wider audience, the question of whether he owed a debt of influence to Stirner was raised. As early as 1891 (while Nietzsche was still alive, though incapacitated by mental illness), von Hartmann went so far as to suggest that he had plagiarized Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard von Hartmann, Nietzsches "neue Moral", in ''Preussische Jahrbücher'', 67. Jg., Heft 5, May 1891, S. 501–521; augmented version with more express reproach of plagiarism in: ''Ethische Studien'', Leipzig, Haacke 1898, pp. 34–69.&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, the belief that Nietzsche had been influenced by Stirner was so widespread that it became something of a commonplace, at least in Germany, prompting one observer to note in 1907 that "Stirner's influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;This author believes that one should be careful in comparing the two men. However, he notes: "It is this intensive nuance of individualism that appeared to point from Nietzsche to Max Stirner, the author of the remarkable work ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum''. Stirner's influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy." O. Ewald, "German Philosophy in 1907", in ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 17, No. 4, July 1908, pp. 400–426.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, from the beginning of what was characterized as "great debate"&lt;ref&gt;[in the last years of the nineteenth century] "The question of whether Nietzsche had read Stirner was the subject of great debate" R.A. Nicholls, "Beginnings of the Nietzsche Vogue in Germany", in ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 56, No. 1, August 1958, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding Stirner's possible positive influence on Nietzsche, serious problems with the idea were noted.&lt;ref&gt;Levy pointed out in 1904 that the similarities in the writing of the two men appeared superficial. Albert Levy, ''Stirner and Nietzsche'', Paris, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 20th century, if Stirner was mentioned at all in works on Nietzsche, the idea of influence was often dismissed outright or abandoned as unanswerable.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Nicholls, "Beginnings of the Nietzsche Vogue in Germany", in ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 56, No. 1, August 1958, pp. 24–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the idea that Nietzsche was influenced in some way by Stirner continues to attract a significant minority, perhaps because it seems necessary to explain the oft-noted (though arguably superficial) similarities in their writings.&lt;ref&gt;"Stirner, like Nietzsche, who was clearly influenced by him, has been interpreted in many different ways", [[Saul Newman]], ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan: Anti-authoritarianism and the Dislocation of Power]]'', Lexington Books, 2001, p. 56; "We do not even know for sure that Nietzsche had read Stirner. Yet, the similarities are too striking to be explained away". R. A. Samek, ''The Meta Phenomenon'', p. 70, New York, 1981; Tom Goyens, (referring to Stirner's book The Ego and His Own) "The book influenced Friedrich Nietzsche, and even Marx and Engels devoted some attention to it". T. Goyens, ''Beer and Revolution: The German Anarchist Movement In New York City'', p. 197, Illinois, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the most significant problems with the theory of possible Stirner influence on Nietzsche are not limited to the difficulty in establishing whether the one man knew of or read the other. They also consist in determining if Stirner in particular might have been a meaningful influence on a man as widely read as Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;"We have every reason to suppose that Nietzsche had a profound knowledge of the Hegelian movement, from Hegel to Stirner himself. The philosophical learning of an author is not assessed by the number of quotations, nor by the always fanciful and conjectural check lists of libraries, but by the apologetic or polemical directions of his work itself". Gilles Deleuze (translated by Hugh Tomlinson), ''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]'', 1962 (2006 reprint, pp. 153–154).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rudolf Steiner ===
The individualist-anarchist orientation of [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s early philosophy—before he turned to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] around 1900—has strong parallels to and was admittedly influenced by Stirner's conception of the ego, for which Steiner claimed to have provided a philosophical foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Giacomo Preparata, "Perishable Money in a Threefold Commonwealth: Rudolf Steiner and the Social Economics of an Anarchist Utopia". ''Review of Radical Economics'' 38/4 (Fall 2006). pp. 619–648.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anarchism ===
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
{{main|Egoist anarchism|Individualist anarchism}}
Stirner's philosophy was important in the development of modern anarchist thought, particularly [[individualist anarchism]] and [[egoist anarchism]]. Although Stirner is usually associated with [[individualist anarchism]], he was influential to many [[social anarchism|social anarchists]] such as [[anarcha-feminist]]s [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Federica Montseny]]. In [[European individualist anarchism]], he influenced its main proponents after him such as [[Émile Armand]], [[Han Ryner]], [[Renzo Novatore]], [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]] and [[Lev Chernyi]].

In [[American individualist anarchism]], he found adherence in [[Benjamin Tucker]] and his magazine ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' while these abandoned [[natural right]]s positions for egoism.&lt;ref name="mcelroy"&gt;"Only the influence of the German philosopher of egoism, Max Stirner (né Johann Kaspar Schmidt, 1806–1856), as expressed through The Ego and His Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum) compared with that of Proudhon. In adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of Liberty in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly". Wendy Mcelroy. [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&amp;layout=html#chapter_100896 "Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order"].&lt;/ref&gt; Several periodicals "were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism". They included ''I'', published by [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] and edited by [[William Walstein Gordak]] and [[J. William Lloyd]] (all associates of ''Liberty''); and ''The Ego and The Egoist'', both of which were edited by [[Edward H. Fulton]]. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed, there were the German ''[[Der Eigene]]'', edited by [[Adolf Brand]]; and ''The Eagle and The Serpent'', issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle "A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology".&lt;ref name="mcelroy"/&gt; Other American egoist anarchists around the early 20th century include [[James L. Walker]], [[George Schumm]], [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]], [[Steven T. Byington]] and Edward H. Fulton.&lt;ref name="mcelroy"/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[Herbert Read]] was influenced by Stirner and noted the closeness of Stirner's egoism to [[existentialism]] (see [[existentialist anarchism]]). Later in the 1960s, [[Daniel Guérin]] says in ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' that Stirner "rehabilitated the individual at a time when the philosophical field was dominated by Hegelian anti-individualism and most reformers in the social field had been led by the misdeeds of bourgeois egotism to stress its opposite" and pointed to "the boldness and scope of his thought".&lt;ref name="Guerin"&gt;[[Daniel Guérin]],''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, an American [[Situationist International|Situationist]] collective called For Ourselves published a book called ''[[The Right To Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything]]'' in which they advocate a "communist egoism" basing themselves on Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/right-be-greedy-theses-practical-necessity-demanding-everything "Four Ourselves, The Right To Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622062115/http://libcom.org/library/right-be-greedy-theses-practical-necessity-demanding-everything|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the United States, it emerged the tendency of [[post-left anarchy]] which was influenced profoundly by Stirner in aspects such as the critique of ideology. [[Jason McQuinn]] says that "when I (and other anti-ideological anarchists) criticize ideology, it is always from a specifically critical, anarchist perspective rooted in both the skeptical, individualist-anarchist philosophy of Max Stirner".&lt;ref name="Cuchuflito"&gt;"What is Ideology?" by [[Jason McQuinn]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Black]] and Feral Faun/Wolfi Landstreicher strongly adhere to Stirnerist egoism. In the hybrid of [[post-structuralism]] and anarchism called [[post-anarchism]], [[Saul Newman]] has written on Stirner and his similarities to post-structuralism. [[Insurrectionary anarchism]] also has an important relationship with Stirner as can be seen in the work of Wolfi Landstreicher and [[Alfredo Bonanno]] who has also written on him in works such as ''Max Stirner'' and "Max Stirner und der Anarchismus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article330&amp;lang=fr|title=BONANNO, Alfredo Maria|accessdate=10 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710093815/http://raforum.info/spip.php?article330&amp;lang=fr|archivedate=10 July 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free love, homosexuals and feminists ===
The German stirnerist [[Adolf Brand]] produced the homosexual periodical ''[[Der Eigene]]'' in 1896. This was the first ongoing homosexual publication in the world&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] had begun a journal called ''Prometheus'' in 1870, but only one issue was published. Kennedy, Hubert, ''Karl Heinrich Ulrichs: First Theorist of Homosexuality'', In: 'Science and Homosexualities', ed. Vernon Rosario. New York: Routledge, 1997, pp. 26–45.&lt;/ref&gt; and ran until 1931. The name was taken from the writings of Stirner (who had greatly influenced the young Brand) and refers to Stirner's concept of "[[self-ownership]]" of the individual. Another early homosexual activist influenced by Stirner was [[John Henry Mackay]]. Feminists influenced by Stirner include [[Dora Marsden]] who edited the journals ''[[The Freewoman]]'' and ''[[The New Freewoman]]'' and anarchist [[Emma Goldman]]. Stirner also influenced [[free love]] and [[polyamory]] propagandist [[Émile Armand]] in the context of [[Individualist anarchism in Europe#France|French individualist anarchism]] of the early 20th century which is known for "[t]he call of nudist [[naturism]], the strong defense of birth control methods, the idea of "[[union of egoists|unions of egoists]]" with the sole justification of sexual practices".&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"&gt;Xavier Diez.

'''Mount Wutai''',&lt;!--Don't repeat Chinese in infobox; see WP:MOS-ZH--&gt; also known by its Chinese name '''Wutaishan''' and as {{nowrap|'''Mount Qingliang''',}} is a sacred [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist]] site at the headwaters of the [[Qingshui (Shanxi)|Qingshui]] in [[Shanxi Province]], [[China]]. Its central area is surrounded by a cluster of flat-topped peaks roughly corresponding to the [[cardinal direction]]s. The north peak (Beitai Ding or Yedou Feng) is the highest ({{convert|3061|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and is also the highest point in northern China.

As host to over 53 sacred monasteries, Mount Wutai is home to many of China's most important monasteries and temples.  It was inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/523 China’s sacred Buddhist Mount Wutai inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; and named a [[AAAAA Tourist Attractions of China|AAAAA tourist attraction]] by China's [[China National Tourism Administration|National Tourism Administration]] in 2007.

==Significance==
Mount Wutai is one of the [[Sacred Mountains of China#The Four Sacred Mountains of Buddhism in China|Four Sacred Mountains]] in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. Each of the mountains is viewed as the [[bodhimaṇḍa]] (dàocháng; 道場) of one of the four great [[bodhisattva]]s. Wǔtái is the home of the [[Bodhisattva]] of wisdom, [[Mañjuśrī]] or ''Wénshū'' (文殊) in Chinese. Mañjuśrī has been associated with Mount Wutai since ancient times. Paul Williams writes:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2000. p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Apparently the association of Mañjuśrī with Wutai (Wu-t'ai) Shan in north China was known in classical times in India itself, identified by Chinese scholars with the mountain in the 'north-east' (when seen from [[India]] or [[Central Asia]]) referred to as the abode of Mañjuśrī in the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]''. There are said to have been pilgrimages from India and other Asian countries to Wutai Shan by the seventh century.}}

Wutai was the first of the mountains to be identified and is often referred to as "first among the four great mountains".{{cn|date=April 2016}} It was identified on the basis of a passage in the ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'', which describes the abodes of many bodhisattvas. In this chapter, Mañjuśrī is said to reside on a "clear cold mountain" in the northeast. This served as charter for the mountain's identity and its alternate name "Clear Cool Mountain" (Ch: Qīngliáng Shān; 清涼山).

The bodhisattva is believed to frequently appear on the mountain, taking the form of ordinary pilgrims, monks, or most often unusual five-colored clouds.

Mount Wutai has an enduring relationship with [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuttle, Gray (2006). 'Tibetan Buddhism at Ri bo rtse lnga/Wutai shan in Modern Times.' ''Journal of the International Association of Tibetan Studies'', no. 2 (August 2006): 1-35.

Mount Wutai is home to some of the [[Ancient Chinese wooden architecture|oldest wooden buildings in China]] that have survived since the era of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). This includes the main hall of [[Nanchan Temple (Wutai)|Nanchan Temple]] and the East Hall of [[Foguang Temple]], built in 782 and 857, respectively. They were discovered in 1937 and 1938 by a team of architectural historians including the prominent early 20th-century historian [[Liang Sicheng]]. The architectural designs of these buildings have since been studied by leading [[Sinology|sinologists]] and experts in traditional Chinese architecture, such as Nancy Steinhardt. Steinhardt classified these buildings according to the hall types featured in the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' Chinese building manual written in the 12th century.

In 2008, there were complaints from local residents that, in preparation for Mount Wutai's bid to become a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], they were forced from their homes and relocated away from their livelihoods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/mar/13/wutai.shan][https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/13/china1]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''Mãe-de-santo''''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈmɐ̃ȷ̃ dʒi ˈsɐ̃tu}}) is a priestess of [[Umbanda]], [[Candomblé]] and [[Quimbanda]], the [[Afro-Brazilian religions]].  In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] those words translate as "mother of [the] saint[s]", which is an adaption of the [[Yoruba language]] word ''iyalorishá'', a title given to priest women in African religions. ''Iyá'' means mother, and the contraction ''l'Orishá'' means "''of [[Orisha|Orishá]]''". As a product of the syncretism, the word [[Orisha|Orishá]] (elevated or ancestral spirit) was adapted into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as [[saint]]. 

The priestesses ''mães-de-santo'' are more venerated in [[Afro-Brazilian#Religion|African-Brazilian religions]] than the male priests, the ''[[Pai-de-santo|pais-de-santo]]''.

In the [[Afro-American religions|Afro-Brazilian religions]] the priests are the owners of the tradition, knowledge and culture and the ones responsible to pass it on to the new generations because there are no sacred written books.

'''Our Lady of the Rosary''', also known as '''Our Lady of the Holy Rosary''', is a [[Titles of Mary|title]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] in relation to the [[Rosary]].

The '''Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary''', formerly known as  '''Our Lady of Victory''' and '''Feast of the Holy Rosary''',  is a feast day of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], celebrated  on 7 October, the anniversary of the decisive victory of the combined   fleet of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League of 1571]] over the [[Ottoman navy]] at the [[Battle of Lepanto]].

==Our Lady of the Rosary==
  
According to Dominican tradition, in 1206, [[St. Dominic]] was in [[Prouille]], France, attempting to convert the [[Catharism|Albigensians]] back to the Catholic faith. The young priest had little success until one day he received a vision of the Blessed Virgin, who gave him the Rosary as a tool against heretics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nashvilledominican.org/Prayer/Our_Lady/Promoters_of_the_Rosary "Promoters of the Rosary", Dominican Sisters of St. Cecelia]&lt;/ref&gt; While Mary's giving the rosary to St. Dominic is generally acknowledged as a legend, the development of this prayer form owes much to the followers of St. Dominic, including the 15th-century priest and teacher, [[Alanus de Rupe]].&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1161 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast'', Franciscan Media, ISBN 978-0-86716-887-7]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Our Lady of Victory==
In 1571, [[Pope Pius V|Pope St. Pius V]] organized a coalition of forces from [[Spain]] and smaller Christian kingdoms, republics and military orders, to rescue Christian outposts in Cyprus, particularly the Venetian outpost at [[Famagusta]] which, however, surrendered after a long siege on August 1 before the Christian forces set sail. On October 7, 1571, the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], a coalition of southern European Catholic maritime states, sailed from [[Messina]], [[Sicily]], and met a powerful Ottoman fleet in the [[Battle of Lepanto]]. Knowing that the Christian forces were at a distinct materiel disadvantage, the holy pontiff, Pope Pius V, called for all of Europe to pray the Rosary for victory,&lt;ref&gt;Chesterton, Gilbert.''Lepanto'', Ignatius Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-58617-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler222 &gt;''Butler's Lives Of The Saints'' (April) by Alban Butler (1999) {{ISBN|0-86012-253-0}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt; and led a rosary procession in Rome.&lt;ref name=thurston/&gt;

After about five hours of fighting on the northern edge of the Gulf of Corinth, off western Greece, the combined navies of the Papal States, Venice and Spain managed to stop the Ottoman navy, slowing the Ottoman advance to the west and denying them access to the Atlantic Ocean and the Americas.&lt;ref name=ahmed/&gt; If the Ottomans had won then there was a real possibility that an invasion of Italy could have followed so that the Ottoman sultan, already claiming to be emperor of the Romans, would have been in possession of both New and Old Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-179159319.html Melleuish, Gregory. "The significance of Lepanto", ''Quadrant'', April 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  Combined with the unfolding events in Morocco where the Sa’adids successfully spurned the Ottoman advances, it confined Turkish naval power to the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;[http://historyofislam.com/contents/the-land-empires-of-asia/lepanto-the-battle-of/ Ahmed PhD., Prof. Nazeer. "Lepanto, the Battle of", ''History of Islam'']&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ottoman Empire was able to build more ships, it never fully recovered from the loss of trained sailors and marines, and was never again the Mediterranean naval power it had become the century before when Constantinople fell.

==Feast day==
[[File:Van Dyck - Madonna del Rosario - Palermo.jpg|thumb|''The Madonna of the Rosary'' by [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]

Pius V  instituted "Our Lady of Victory" as an annual feast to commemorate the victory at Lepanto, which he attributed to the Blessed Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name=thurston/&gt;

Dedications to Our Lady of Victory had preceded this papal declaration. In particular, [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester]] built the first shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Victory in thanks for the Catholic victory over the Albigensians at the [[Battle of Muret]] on September 12, 1213.&lt;ref name=thurston&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13189a.htm Thurston, Herbert. "Feast of the Holy Rosary." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 2 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In thanksgiving for victory at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in July 1214, [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] of France founded the Abbey of Notre Dame de la Victoire, between Senlis and Mont l'Evêque.&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Morel, [https://books.google.fr/books?id=7iMjRpkY1o4C&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=%22abbaye+de+la+Victoire%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=W0ruS6OSG5qGnQOztLH0Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=false ''De Paris à Cologne, à Bruxelles, à Senlis, à Laon... itinéraire descriptif et historique''], Libr. de L. Hachette et Cie., 1864, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1573, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] changed the title of the "Feast of Our Lady of Victory" to "Feast of the Holy Rosary", to be celebrated on the first Sunday of October.&lt;ref&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-victory.php Roten S.M., Johann. "Our Lady of Victory", International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt; Dominican friar Juan Lopez in his 1584 book on the rosary states that the feast of the rosary was offered "in memory and in perpetual gratitude of the miraculous victory that the Lord gave to his Christian people that day against the Turkish armada".&lt;ref&gt;''Libro en que se tratea de la importancia y exercicio del santo rosario'', Zaragoza: Domingo Portonariis y Ursino (1584),  cited after Lorenzo F. Candelaria, ''The Rosary Cantoral: Ritual and Social Design in a Chantbook from Early Renaissance Toledo'', University Rochester Press (2008), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=O73QaLuBuHkC&amp;pg=PA109  p. 109].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1671 the observance of this festival was extended by [[Clement X]] to the whole of Spain, and somewhat later [[Clement XI]], after the  victory over the Turks gained by Prince Eugene in the  [[Battle of Petrovaradin]] on 5 August 1716 (the feast of [[Dedication of the Basilica of St Mary Major|Our Lady of the Snows]]), commanded the feast of the Rosary to be celebrated by the [[General Roman Calendar|universal Church]].&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;

[[Leo XIII]] raised the feast to the rank of a double of the second class and  added to the [[Litany of Loreto]] the invocation "Queen of the Most Holy Rosary". On this feast, in every church in which the Rosary confraternity has been duly erected, a plenary [[indulgence]] ''toties quoties'' is granted upon certain conditions to all who visit therein the Rosary chapel or statue of Our Lady. This has been called the "Portiuncula" of the Rosary.

[[File:Bernardo Cavallino - La Visione di San Domenico (anni 1640).jpg|thumb|''The vision of Saint Dominic'' by [[Bernardo Cavallino]], 1640]]
[[Pope Pius X|Pius X]] in 1913 changed the date to 7 October, as part of his effort to restore celebration of the liturgy of the Sundays. 
In 1960 [[Pope John XXIII]] changed the title to "Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary".

==Patronage==
Our Lady of the Rosary is the patron saint of several places around the world. The [[diocese of Malaga]], Spain (which, however celebrates her patronage on September 8), and the Spanish cities of [[Melilla]] and [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]] celebrate Our Lady of Victories as their patroness. Furthermore, ''María del Rosario'' is a common female Spanish name (colloquially abbreviated to ''Rosario'' or ''Charo''). ''Rosario'' can also be used as a male first name, particularly in Italian. The cathedral for the Diocese of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio is named after Our Lady Of the Rosary.

'''Owen Davies''' (1840 – 30 May 1929) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister and writer. He was born at Cae Plan, a farm near [[Pwllheli]], and attended local schools in [[Llanystumdwy]] and Yoke House, Pwllheli. Upon completing his education he worked for a period as a draper's apprentice in Pwllheli, and at the age of 18 he started working in a draper's shop in [[St Asaph]]. While living in St Asaph he began attending a local Baptist church, becoming a preacher. In 1862 he entered the new Baptist College at [[Llangollen]]. Upon completing his training, he was appointed pastor at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] (1865), before moving to Llangollen (1867), and [[Caernarfon]] (1876). He was also (from 1892 to 1895) a secretary to the North Wales Baptist College, [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], and (from 1895 to 1915) a lecturer on Homiletics and Pastoral Theology on the college staff.

His written works include several books, including a number of Welsh biographies, of ''John Pritchard'' (1880), ''Christmas Evans'' (1898), ''Robert Jones, Llanllyfni'' (1903), and a history of the Welsh Baptists (1905). He was also for a time editor of ''Yr Athraw'', and of ''[[Greal (Llangollen)|Y Greal]]'' (from 1871 to 1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owen Davies|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAVI-OWE-1840.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|last=Williams|first=Griffith John|accessdate= 1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{astrology}}

'''Planets in [[astrology]]''' have a meaning different from the modern [[astronomy|astronomical]] understanding of [[definition of planet|what a planet is]]. Before the [[scientific revolution|age]] of [[telescope]]s, the [[night sky]] was thought to consist of two very similar components: [[fixed stars]], which remained motionless in relation to each other, and "wandering stars" ({{lang-grc|ἀστέρες πλανῆται}} ''asteres planetai''), which moved relative to the fixed stars over the course of the year.

To the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and the other earliest astronomers, this group consisted of the five [[planet]]s visible to the [[naked eye]] and excluded [[Earth]]. Although strictly, the term ''planet'' applied only to those five [[astronomical object|objects]], the term was latterly broadened, particularly in the [[Middle Ages]], to include the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] (sometimes referred to as "Lights"&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978), p.22&lt;/ref&gt;), making a total of seven planets. Astrologers retain this definition today.

To ancient astrologers, the planets represented the will of the [[gods]] and their direct influence upon human affairs. To modern astrologers, the planets represent basic drives or urges in the unconscious,&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; or energy flow regulators representing dimensions of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo (1989) pp. 7, 27&lt;/ref&gt; They express themselves with different qualities in the twelve [[astrological sign|signs]] of the [[zodiac]] and in the twelve [[astrological house|houses]]. The planets are also related to each other in the form of [[astrological aspect|aspects]].

Modern astrologers differ on the source of the planets' influence. Hone writes that the planets exert it directly through [[gravitation]] or another, unknown influence.&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978), p.19 8th paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; Others hold that the planets have no direct influence in themselves, but are mirrors of basic organizing principles in the [[universe]]. In other words, the basic patterns of the universe repeat themselves everywhere, in [[fractal]]-like fashion, and "as above, so below".&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver, Brian P. (1992) Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation with Notes and Introduction, Cambridge University Press: New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the patterns that the planets make in the sky reflect the ebb and flow of basic human impulses. The planets are also associated, especially in the Chinese tradition, with the basic forces of nature.

Listed below are the specific meanings and domains associated with the astrological planets since ancient times, with the main focus on the Western astrological tradition. The planets in [[Hindu astrology]] are known as the [[Navagraha]] or "nine realms". In [[Chinese astrology]], the planets are associated with the life forces of yin and yang and the five [[Wu xing|elements]], which play an important role in the Chinese form of geomancy known as [[Feng Shui]]. Astrologers differ on the signs associated with each planet's exaltation.

==Planetary symbolism==
{{main article|Astrological symbol}}
This table shows the astrological planets (as distinct from the astronomical) and the Greek and Roman deities associated with them. In most cases, the English name for planets derives from the name of a Roman god or goddess. Also of interest is the conflation of the Roman god with a similar Greek god. In some cases, it is the same deity with two different names.

==History==
[[File:Cellarius ptolemaic system.jpg|thumb|The geocentric [[Ptolemaic system]] of the universe depicted by [[Andreas Cellarius]], 1660–61]]
Treatises on the Ptolemaic planets and their influence on people born "under their reign" appear in [[block book]] form, so-called "planet books" or ''Planetenbücher''. This genre is atteted in numerous manuscripts beginning in the mid 15th century in the Alemannic German areal;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Darmstadt Hs. 266,  Blockbuch Basel AN V 37a, [[Hans Talhoffer|Thott 290.2]] (1459), Wolfegg [[Hausbuch]] (c. 1470), [[CGM 558]] (c. 1490), etc.)&lt;/ref&gt; it remains popular throughout the [[German Renaissance]], exerting great iconographical influence far into the 17th century.

These books usually list a male and a female [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] with each planet, [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] with Saturn, [[Eurymedon (mythology)|Eurymedon]] and [[Themis]] with Jupiter, probably [[Crius]] and [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]] with Mars, [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Theia]] with Sun, [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]] with Moon, [[Coeus]] and [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] with Mercury, and [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] with Venus.&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Fuchs, ''Die Ikonographie der sieben Planeten in der Kunst Italiens bis zum Ausgang des Mittelalters'', Diss. Munich 1909; E. Panofsky, F. Saxl, ''Saturn und Melancholie'', Frankfurt 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualities inherited from the planets by their children are as follows:
* Saturn: industrious, melancholy, and tranquility
* Jupiter: charming and hunting
* Mars: soldiering and warfare
* Sun: music and athleticism
* Moon: shy and tenderness
* Mercury: prudent, crafty, and commerce
* Venus: amorousness and passion.&lt;ref&gt;
A. Hauber, ''Planetenkinderbilder und Sternbilder'', Straßburg 1916; E. Baer, ''Representations of "planet-children" in Turkish manuscripts'', in: Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 31, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical planets==

The seven [[classical planets]] are those easily seen with the naked eye, and were thus known to ancient astrologers. They are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Sometimes, the Sun and Moon were referred to as "the lights" or the "[[luminary (astrology)|luminaries]]". [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] and [[Uranus]] can also just be seen with the naked eye, though no ancient culture appears to have taken note of them. The astrological descriptions attached to the seven classical planets have been preserved since ancient times. Astrologers call the seven classical planets "the seven personal and social planets", because they are said to represent the basic human drives of every individual. The personal planets are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. The social or transpersonal planets are Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter and Saturn are often called the first of the "transpersonal" or "transcendent" planets as they represent a transition from the inner personal planets to the outer modern, impersonal planets. The outer modern planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are often called the collective or transcendental planets.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer at khaldea.com, Rob Hand "Horoscope Symbols"&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list of the planets and their associated characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Mayo, ''Teach Yourself Astrology'', pp17 – 28, Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1964; Sasha Fenton ''Understanding Astrology'', pp106 – 112, The Aquarian Press (Harper Collins), London, 1991; Derek and Julia Parker, ''The New Compleat Astrologer'', pp86 – 99, Crescent Books, New York, 1971; Maritha Pottinger ''Astro Essentials'', pp11 -14, 17–18, ACS Publications, San Diego, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sun===
{{Redirect|Sun sign|the such restricted astrology|Sun sign astrology}}
[[File:Ilion---metopa.jpg|thumb|Helios on a relief from Ilion, early 4th-century BC]]
The Sun ([[File:Sun symbol.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] and is exalted in [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]. In classical Greek mythology, the Sun was represented by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Helios]] (Roman [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], and later by [[Apollo (mythology)|Apollo]], the god of light). The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, around which the Earth and other planets revolve and provides us with heat and light. The arc that the Sun travels in every year, rising and setting in a slightly different place each day, is therefore in reality a reflection of the Earth's own orbit around the Sun. This arc is larger the farther north or south from the equator latitude, giving a more extreme difference between day and night and between seasons during the year. The Sun travels through the twelve signs of the zodiac on its annual journey, spending about a month in each. The Sun's position on a person's birthday therefore determines what is usually called his or her "sun" sign. However, the sun sign allotment varies between Western (sign change around 22-23 of every month) and Hindu astrology (sign change around 14-15 of every month) due the different systems of planetary calculations, following the [[Tropical zodiac|tropical]] and [[Sidereal zodiac|sidereal]] definitions respectively.
[[File:Sun920607.jpg|100px|thumb|left|The [[Sun]], the star at the center of the [[Solar System]]]]
Astrologically speaking, the Sun is usually thought to represent the conscious [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]], the [[self (psychology)|self]] and its expression, personal power, pride and authority, leadership qualities and the principles of creativity, spontaneity, health and vitality, the sum of which is named the "life force". One of the first recorded references to Sun worship is from the [[Mesopotamian Religion]] and described in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. The 1st-century poet [[Marcus Manilius]] in his epic, 8000-verse poem, ''Astronomica'', described the [[Sun]], or ''[[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]'', as benign and favorable. In medicine, the Sun is associated with the heart, circulatory system,&lt;ref&gt;Back de Surany, Géza. Manual de Astrología Médica. Índigo.1988. 214 páginas, pag. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and the thymus. Additionally, humans depend on the sun to produce and obtain [[vitamin D]]; an important supplement aiding the body's immune system and bone health. In [[Ayurveda]], it rules over life-force ('''praan-shakti'''), governs bile temperament ('''pitta'''), stomach, bones and eyes. In modern astrology, the Sun is the primary native ruler of the fifth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the ninth house.

The Sun is associated with Sunday. [[Dante Alighieri]] associated the Sun with the [[liberal arts|liberal art]] of music. In [[Chinese astrology]], the Sun represents [[Feng Shui#Yin and Yang|Yang]], the active, assertive masculine life principle.

===Moon===
[[File:Patera di Parabiago - MI - Museo archeologico - Diana - Luna - 25-7-2003 - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 25-7-2003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Luna or Diana, wearing a crescent-moon crown and driving her ox-drawn chariot ''([[biga (chariot)|biga]])'', on the [[Parabiago plate]] (2nd–5th centuries AD)]]

The [[Moon]] ([[File:Moon symbol crescent.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] and is exalted in [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]]. In classical Roman mythology, the Moon was [[Luna (mythology)|Luna]], at times identified with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. The Moon is large enough for its gravity to affect the Earth, stabilizing its orbit and producing the regular ebb and flow of the tides. The [[lunar day]] syncs up with its orbit around Earth in such a manner that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth and the other side, known as the "[[far side of the Moon]]" faces towards space.
[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Full Moon]]

Astrologically speaking, the Moon is associated with a person's emotional make-up, [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] habits, rhythms, memories, moods and their ability to react and adapt to those around them. It is also associated with the mother, maternal instincts or the urge to nurture, the home, the need for security and the past, especially early experiences and childhood. The 1st-century poet Manilius described the Moon, or ''Luna'', as melancholic. In medicine, the Moon is associated with the digestive system, stomach, breasts, the ovaries and menstruation (which does occur on a monthly cycle)&lt;ref&gt;Back de Sarany, Géza Ibid., 37.&lt;/ref&gt; and the pancreas. Despite Manilius's assignation, the Moon is commonly associated with the [[phlegmatic]] humor; it ruled the [[animal spirit]]s. In modern astrology, the Moon is the primary native ruler of the fourth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the third house.

The Moon or ''Luna'' is associated with Monday, the word Monday comes from the Old English word for Moon day or Moon's day, and in Romance languages, the name for Monday comes from ''luna'' (e.g., ''luni'' in Romanian, ''lundi'' in French, ''lunes'' in Spanish and ''lunedi'' in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated the Moon with the liberal art of [[grammar]].

In [[Chinese astrology]], the Moon represents [[Feng Shui#Yin and Yang|Yin]], the passive and receptive feminine life principle. In [[Indian astrology]], the Moon is called [[Chandra]] or [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] and represents the mind, queenship and mother. The north [[lunar node]] (called [[Rahu]]) and the south [[lunar node]] (called [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]) are considered to be of particular importance and are given an equal place alongside the seven classical planets as part of the nine [[navagraha]].

===Mercury===
[[File:Giambologna-mercurio6.jpg|thumb|upright|''Flying Mercury'' (late 16th-century) by [[Giambologna]]]]
[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] ([[File:Mercury symbol.svg|15px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] and is exalted in [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] and/or [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]. In classical Roman mythology, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] is the messenger of the gods, noted for his speed and swiftness. Echoing this, the scorching, airless world Mercury circles the Sun on the fastest orbit of any planet. Mercury takes only 88 days to orbit the Sun, spending about 7.33 days in each sign of the zodiac. Mercury is so close to the Sun that only a brief period exists after the Sun has set where it can be seen with the naked eye, before following the Sun beyond the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;https://theastrocodex.com/2017/07/20/mercury-rulership-exaltation-detriment-fall/&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrologically speaking, Mercury represents the principles of communication, mentality, thinking patterns, rationality and reasoning, and adaptability and variability. Mercury governs schooling and education, the immediate environment of neighbors, siblings and cousins, transport over short distances, messages and forms of communication such as post, email and telephone, newspapers, journalism and writing, information gathering skills and physical dexterity. The 1st-century poet [[Marcus Manilius]] described Mercury as an inconstant, vivacious and curious planet.

[[File:Mercury in color - Prockter07 centered.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]]]
In medicine, Mercury is associated with the nervous system, the brain, the respiratory system, the thyroid and the sense organs. It is traditionally held to be essentially cold and dry, according to its placement in the zodiac and in any aspects to other planets.

In modern astrology, Mercury is regarded as the ruler of the third house; traditionally, it had the joy in the first house. Mercury is the messenger of the gods in mythology. It is the planet of day-to-day expression and relationships. Mercury's action is to take things apart and put them back together again. It is an opportunistic planet, decidedly unemotional and curious.

Mercury rules over Wednesday. In Romance languages, the word for Wednesday is often similar to Mercury (''miercuri'' in Romanian, ''mercredi'' in French, ''miercoles'' in Spanish and ''mercoledì'' in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated Mercury with the liberal art of [[dialectic]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In Chinese astrology Mercury represents [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]], the fourth element, therefore symbolizing communication, intelligence, and elegance.

===Venus===
[[File:Cardiff castle - Turm 3 Venus.jpg|thumb|upright|Venus, wearing the sign of Libra on her midsection, and Taurus at her feet, at [[Cardiff Castle]], [[Wales]]]]
[[Venus]] ([[File:Venus symbol.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] and is exalted in [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. In classical Roman mythology, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] is the goddess of love and beauty, famous for the passions she could stir among the gods. Her cults may represent the religiously legitimate charm and seduction of the divine by mortals, in contrast to the formal, contractual relations between most members of Rome's official pantheon and the state, and the unofficial, illicit manipulation of divine forces through magic. The ambivalence of her function is suggested in the etymological relationship of the root *venes- with Latin venenum (poison, venom), in the sense of "a charm, magic philtre".

Venus orbits the Sun in 225 days, spending about 18.75 days in each sign of the zodiac. Venus is the second-brightest object in the night sky, the Moon being the brightest. It is usually beheld as a twin planet to Earth.

Astrologically speaking, Venus is associated with the principles of harmony, resilience, beauty, refinement, solidarity, affections, equality, and the urge to sympathize and unite with others. It is involved with the desire for pleasure, comfort and ease. It governs romantic relations, marriage and business partnerships, sex (the origin of the words 'venery' and 'venereal'), the arts, fashion and social life. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described Venus as generous and fecund and the lesser [[Benefic planet|benefic]].

[[File:Venus-real color.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Venus]]]]
The planet [[Venus]] in medicine is associated with the lumbar region, the veins, parathyroids, throat and kidneys. Venus was thought to be moderately warm and moist and was associated with the [[phlegmatic]] humor. In modern astrology, Venus is the ruler of the seventh house; traditionally, it had the joy in the fifth house.

Venus is the planet of Friday. In languages deriving from Latin, such as Romanian, Spanish, French, and Italian, the word for Friday often resembles the word Venus (''vineri'', ''viernes'', ''vendredi'' and ''venerdì'' respectively). Dante Alighieri associated Venus with the liberal art of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;New Yorker, 20 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Chinese astrology]], Venus is associated with the element [[metal (classical element)|metal]], which is unyielding, strong and persistent. In [[Indian astrology]], Venus is known as [[Shukra]] and represents wealth, pleasure and reproduction. In [[Norse Paganism]], the planet is associated to [[Freyja]], the goddess of love, beauty and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;https://theastrocodex.com/2017/08/01/venus-rulership-exaltation-detriment-fall/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mars===
[[File:Muhammad ibn Muhammad Shakir Ruzmah-'i Nathani - Symbol of Mars - Walters W65914B - Full Page.jpg|thumb|upright|Early 18th-century illustration of Mars ''(al-mirrikh)'' for the Bestiary of [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] ''([[Walters Art Museum]])'']]
[[Mars]] ([[File:Mars symbol.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] and is exalted in [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]. [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] is the Roman god of war and bloodshed, whose symbol is a spear and shield. Both the soil of Mars and the hemoglobin of human blood are rich in iron and because of this they share its distinct deep red color.&lt;ref name="Henbestibid"&gt;Henbest, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; He was second in importance only to Jupiter and Saturn, due to Mars being the most prominent of the military gods worshipped by the Roman legions. 

Mars orbits the Sun in 687 days, spending about 57.25 days in each sign of the zodiac. It is also the first planet that orbits outside of Earth's orbit, making it the first planet that does not set along with the Sun. Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25–30% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ice (dry ice).

Astrologically speaking, Mars is associated with confidence and self-assertion, aggression, sexuality, energy, strength, ambition and impulsiveness. Mars governs sports, competitions and physical activities in general. The 1st-century poet Manilius, described the planet as ardent and as the lesser [[Malefic planet|malefic]]. In medicine, Mars presides over the [[sex organ|genitals]], the muscular system, the gonads and adrenal glands. It was traditionally held to be hot and excessively dry and ruled the [[choleric]] humor. It was associated with fever, accidents, trauma, pain and surgery.

[[File:Mars Hubble.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Mars]]]]
In modern astrology, Mars is the primary native ruler of the first house. Traditionally however, Mars ruled both the third and tenth houses, and had its joy in the sixth house. While Venus tends to the overall relationship atmosphere, Mars is the passionate impulse and action, the masculine aspect, discipline, willpower and stamina.

Mars is associated with Tuesday and in Romance languages the word for Tuesday often resembles Mars (in Romanian, ''marţi'', in Spanish, ''martes'', in French, ''mardi'' and in Italian "martedì").  The English "Tuesday" is a modernised form of "Tyr's Day", Tyr being the Germanic analogue to Mars.  Dante Alighieri associated Mars with the liberal art of [[arithmetic]]. In Chinese astrology, Mars is ruled by the element [[fire (classical element)|fire]], which is passionate, energetic and adventurous. In [[Indian astrology]], Mars is called [[Mangala]] and represents energy, confidence and ego. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

[[Jupiter]] ([[File:Jupiter symbol.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] and it is exalted in [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]. In classical Roman mythology, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] is the ruler of the gods and their guardian and protector, and his symbol is the thunderbolt. The Romans believed that Jupiter granted them supremacy because they had honored him more than any other people had. Jupiter was "the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested." He personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization, and external relations. His image in the Republican and Imperial Capitol bore regalia associated with Rome's ancient kings and the highest consular and Imperial honours.

In the same way, the planet Jupiter is the king of the other planets, a giant in size with spectacular, brightly colored clouds and intense storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |display-authors=4 |author=Ingersoll, A.

Furthermore, Jupiter is usually the fourth-brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon and Venus).

Astrologically speaking, Jupiter is associated with the principles of growth, expansion, prosperity, and good fortune. Jupiter governs long distance and foreign travel, big business and wealth, higher education, religion, and the law. It is also associated with the urge for freedom and exploration, as well with gambling and merrymaking.

[[File:Jupiter.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Jupiter]] ]]
The 1st-century poet Manilius described Jupiter as temperate and benign, and the greater [[Benefic planet|benefic]]. It was regarded as warm and moist in nature, and therefore favorable to life. In medicine, Jupiter is associated with the liver, pituitary gland, and the disposition of fats; it governed the [[Humorism|sanguine]] humor. In modern astrology, Jupiter is the primary native ruler of the ninth house, but traditionally, Jupiter was assigned to both the second and ninth houses: the house of values and the house of beliefs, respectively, and had its joy in the eleventh house of good luck.

Jupiter is associated with Thursday, and in Romance languages, the name for Thursday often comes from Jupiter (e.g., ''joi'' in Romanian, ''jeudi'' in French, ''jueves'' in Spanish, and ''giovedì'' in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated Jupiter with the liberal art of [[geometry]]. In Chinese astrology, Jupiter is ruled by the element [[wood (classical element)|wood]], which is patient, hard-working, and reliable. In [[Indian astrology]], Jupiter is known as [[Guru]] or [[Brihaspati]] and is known as the 'great teacher'. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Saturn===
[[File:The Seven Planets - Saturn.jpg|thumb|upright|Saturn, with Capricorn and Aquarius at his feet and the New Year in his arms, from ''The Seven Planets with the Signs of the Zodiac'' (1539) by [[Hans Sebald Beham]]]]

[[Saturn]] ([[File:Saturn symbol.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] and is exalted in [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]. In classical Roman mythology, [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] is the god of seeds, crops, and the harvest (agriculture), leader of the titans, father and founder of civilizations, social order, and conformity. The glyph is shaped like a scythe, but it is known as the "crescent below the cross", whereas Jupiter's glyph is the "crescent above the cross". Famous rings of the planet Saturn that enclose and surround it, reflect the idea of human limits. Saturn takes 29.5 years to orbit the Sun, spending about 2.46 years in each sign of the zodiac. During ancient Roman society, the Romans worshipped [[Saturn]] as the highest ranking and most important god among their pantheon of deities, sharing that same prestige with Jupiter.

Astrologically speaking, [[Saturn]] is associated with focus, precision, nobility, ethics, civility, lofty goals, career, great achievements, dedication, authority figures, ordered hierarchy, stability, virtues, productiveness, valuable hard lessons learned, destiny, traditions, structures, protective roles, balance, and karma  (reaping what you have sowed or divine cosmic justice) but with limitations, restrictions, boundaries, anxiety, tests, practicality, reality, and time. It concerns a person's sense of duty, commitment, responsibility, including their physical and emotional endurance in times of hardships. Saturn also represents the part of a person's concern with long-term planning or foresight. [[Saturn return|The Return of Saturn]] is said to mark significant events in each person's life. According to the 1st-century poet Manilius, Saturn is sad, morose, and cold, and is the greater [[Malefic planet|malefic]]. According to Claudius Ptolemy, "Saturn is lord of the right ear, the spleen, the bladder, the phlegm, and the bones."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3C* .html ''Tetrabiblos by Claudius Ptolemy''] published in the Loeb Classical Library, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; Saturn symbolized processes and things that were dry and cold, which are necessary balancing aspects to maintain life. It governed the [[melancholia|melancholic]] humor.

According to Sefer Yetzirah – GRA Version – Kaplan 4:13&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sefer ha-Yetzirah (The Book of Formation)|url=http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/Sefer_Yetzirah_Kaplan.pdf|work=Gra Version Translated by Aryeh Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"He made the letter Resh king over Peace
And He bound a crown to it
And He combined one with another
And with them He formed
'''Saturn''' in the Universe
Friday in the Year
The left nostril in the Soul,
male and female."

[[File:Saturn during Equinox.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The planet [[Saturn]] ]] 
Before the discovery of Uranus, [[Saturn]] was regarded as the ruling planet of Aquarius alongside [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] of course, which is the preceding sign. Many traditional types of astrologers refer [[Saturn]] as the planetary ruler for both [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]. In modern astrology, it is the primary native ruler of the tenth house. Traditionally however, Saturn ruled both the first and eighth houses, and had its joy in the twelfth house of mischief and bad luck.

Saturn is associated with Saturday, which was named after the deity Saturn. Dante Alighieri associated Saturn with the liberal art of ''astronomia'' ([[astronomy and astrology]]).

In Chinese astrology, Saturn is ruled by the element [[earth (classical element)|earth]], which is warm, generous, and co-operative. In [[Indian astrology]], Saturn is called [[Shani]] or "Sani", representing a noteworthy career and longevity. He is also the bringer of obstacles and hardship.&lt;ref&gt;https://theastrocodex.com/2017/08/02/saturn-rulership-exaltation-detriment-fall/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern planets==
Since the invention of the telescope, Western astrology has incorporated Uranus, Neptune, Ceres, Pluto, and other bodies into its methodology. The Indian and Chinese astrologies have tended to retain the ancient seven-planet system. Meanings have had to be assigned to them by modern astrologers, usually according to the major events that occurred in the world at the time of their discovery. As these astrologers are usually Western, the social and historical events they describe have an inevitable Western emphasis. Astrologers consider the "extra-Saturnian" planets to be "impersonal" or [[generational planet|generational]] planets, meaning their effects are felt more across whole generations of society. Their effects in individuals depend upon how strongly they feature in that individual's birth-chart.  The following are their characteristics as accepted by most astrologers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Mayo, ''Ibid'', pp 28 – 33, 1964; Sasha Fenton ''Ibid'', pp 112 – 115, 1991; Derek and Julia Parker, ''Ibid'', pp 100 – 105, 1971; Maritha Pottinger ''Ibid'', pp 15–19, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uranus===
[[File:Aion mosaic Glyptothek Munich W504.jpg|thumb|[[Syncretism|Syncretic]] figure of [[Aion (deity)|Aion]]-[[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] standing within a zodiac wheel, with a reclining [[Tellus (goddess)|Earth goddess]] and four children representing the [[Horae|Seasons]] ([[Roman mosaic|Roman-era mosaic]] from [[Sentinum]], AD 200-250)]]
[[Uranus]] ([[File:Uranus's astrological symbol.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and is exalted in [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]. In classical Greek mythology, Uranus is the personification of the sky. The planet Uranus is very unusual among the planets in that it rotates on its side, so that it presents each of its poles to the Sun in turn during its orbit; causing both hemispheres to alternate between being bathed in light and lying in total darkness over the course of the orbit.

Uranus takes 84 years to orbit the Sun, spending about 7 years in each sign of the zodiac. Uranus was discovered to be a planet only in 1781 by [[Sir William Herschel]].

Astrological interpretations associate Uranus with the principles of ingenuity, new or unconventional ideas, individuality, discoveries, electricity, inventions, democracy, and revolutions. Uranus, among all planets, most governs genius.

[[File:Uranus2.jpg|100px|thumb|left|The planet [[Uranus]]]]
Uranus governs societies, clubs, and any group based on humanitarian or progressive ideals. Uranus, the planet of sudden and unexpected changes, rules freedom and originality. In society, it rules radical ideas and people, as well as revolutionary events that upset established structures. Uranus is also associated with Wednesday, alongside Mercury (since Uranus is in the higher octave of Mercury).

In art and literature, the discovery of Uranus coincided with the Romantic movement, which emphasized individuality and freedom of creative expression. Additionally, it is often linked to an individual's animal spirit. When it comes to medicine, Uranus is believed to be particularly associated with the sympathetic nervous system, mental disorders, breakdowns and hysteria, spasms, and cramps. Uranus is considered by modern astrologers to be the primary native ruler of the eleventh house.&lt;ref&gt;https://theastrocodex.com/2017/08/02/uranus-astrology/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neptune===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Neptune]] --&gt;
[[Neptune]] ([[File:Neptune symbol.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] and is exalted in [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]. In classical Roman mythology, [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] is the god of the sea, and the deep, ocean blue color of the planet Neptune reflects this.&lt;ref name="Rational Astrology, Julian Ting - Amazon.com"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZIMDQY#nav-subnav | title=Rational Astrology, Julian Ting - Amazon.com | author=Julian Ting | year=2014 | pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its glyph is taken directly from Neptune's trident, symbolizing the curve of spirit being pierced by the cross of matter. Neptune takes 165 years to orbit the Sun, spending approximately 14 years (13.75) in each sign of the zodiac.&lt;ref name="classical mechanics: Julian J.-L.

[[File:Neptune.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The planet [[Neptune]]]]
Astrologically speaking, Neptune is associated with idealism, dreams, dissolution, artistry, and empathy, but with illusion and vagueness too.&lt;ref name="Neptune: Planet Of Illusion"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astrology.com/article/planets-neptune.html | title=Neptune: Planet Of Illusion | publisher=ASTROLOGY.COM | date=24 November 2009 | accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its appearance coincided with the discovery of [[anesthesia|anesthetics]] and [[hypnotism]]. In political terms, Neptune was linked to the rise of nationalist movements throughout Europe in countries like Germany, Italy, Hungary, Ireland, and Serbia, seeking independence for their nations inspired by an idealized past of legend. It was also linked to the rise of socialism and the beginnings of the welfare state. Neptune coincided with the utopian ideals of Communism, when Marx and Engels first published '[[The Communist Manifesto]]' in 1848.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Neptune also represents the day of Friday, alongside Venus.

[[File:Caravaggio Jupiter Neptune Pluto vertical.jpg|thumb|upright|''Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto'', [[mural|ceiling mural]](''ca.'' 1597) created by [[Caravaggio]] for a room adjacent to the [[alchemy|alchemical distillery]] of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Maria Del Monte]]: hovering around a translucent globe that represents the world are Jupiter with his eagle, Neptune holding a bident, and Pluto with a horse and [[Cerberus]]&lt;ref&gt;Creighton Gilbert, ''Caravaggio and His Two Cardinals'' (Penn State University Press, 1995), pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In art, the impressionist movement began a trend away from literal representation, to one based on the subtle, changing moods of light and color. In medicine, Neptune is seen to be particularly associated with the thalamus, the spinal canal, and uncertain illnesses or neuroses. Neptune is considered by modern astrologers to be the primary ruler of the twelfth [[Astrological house|house]].

===Pluto===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pluto]] --&gt;
[[Pluto]] ([[File:Pluto's astrological symbol.svg|22px]]) is the ruling planet of [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] and is exalted in [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]. In classical Roman mythology, Pluto is the god of the underworld who is extremely wealthy. The [[alchemy|alchemical]] symbol was given to Pluto on its discovery, three centuries after alchemical practices had all but disappeared. The alchemical symbol can therefore be read as spirit over mind, transcending matter. 

Pluto takes 248 years to make a full circuit of the zodiac, but its progress is highly variable: it spends between 15 and 26 years in each sign.

[[File:Nh-pluto-in-true-color 2x JPEG.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|Pluto as captured by the New Horizons craft on July 14, 2015, in near true color.]]

Astrologically speaking, Pluto is called "the great renewer", and is considered to represent the part of a person that destroys in order to renew, through bringing buried, but intense needs and drives to the surface, and expressing them, even at the expense of the existing order. A commonly used keyword for Pluto is "transformation".&lt;ref name="theastrocodex.com"&gt;https://theastrocodex.com/2017/08/02/pluto-astrology/&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with power and personal mastery, and the need to cooperate and share with another, if each is not to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;http://astrologyclub.org/pluto-control-vs-empowerment/&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto governs major business and enormous wealth, mining, surgery and detective work, and any enterprise that involves digging under the surface to bring the truth to light. Pluto is also associated with Tuesday, alongside Mars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Its entry in Cancer in 1913, the sign in which it was later discovered, coincided with World War I. It is also associated with [[nuclear armament]] due to such weapons using [[plutonium]], which was named after the dwarf planet. Nuclear research had its genesis in the 1930s and 40s and later gave rise to the polarized nuclear standoff of the Cold War, with the mass consumer societies of the United States and other democracies facing the totalitarian state of the USSR. The discovery of Pluto also occurred just after the birth of modern psychoanalysis, when Freud and Jung began to explore the depths of the unconscious.

In real life events and culture, Pluto has been a major astrological aspect. When it comes to art, movements like [[Cubism]] and [[Surrealism]] began to de-construct the "normal" view of the world. In medicine, Pluto is seen to be associated with regenerative forces in the body involving cell formation and the reproductive system.&lt;ref name="theastrocodex.com"/&gt; The majority of traditional astrologers do not use Pluto as a ruling planet, but do use the planet for interpretation and predictive work, obliquely making reference to projections of influences from higher to lower dimensional spaces.&lt;ref name="theastrocodex.com"/&gt; Pluto is considered by modern astrologers to be the primary native ruler of the eighth house.

===Ceres===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] --&gt;
[[File:Martial Reymond - Ceres with torch.jpg|thumb|upright|Ceres with torch in search of Proserpina (medallion by [[Martial Reymond]], early 17th century)]]
[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] ([[File:Ceres symbol.svg|19px]]) is the smallest identified [[dwarf planet]] in the Solar System, but is significantly the largest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. It was discovered on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, and is named after Ceres, the Roman goddess of growing plants, the harvest, and of motherly love. It was the first asteroid discovered, taking up about one-third of the entire mass of its asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;E. V. Pitjeva, "Precise determination of the motion of planets and some astronomical constants from modern observations", 2004 International Astronomical Union, http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=303499&lt;/ref&gt; The classification of Ceres has changed more than once and has been the subject of some disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://astrologyclub.org/asteroid-ceres/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Elert Bode]] believed Ceres to be the "missing planet" he had proposed to exist between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], at a distance of 419 million&amp;nbsp;km (2.8&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]]) from the Sun. Ceres was assigned a planetary symbol, and [[List of Solar System bodies formerly regarded as planets|remained listed as a planet]] in astronomy books and tables for about half a century. The 2006 debate surrounding Pluto and what constitutes a [[planet]] led to Ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet, but in the end Ceres and Pluto were classified as the first members of the new [[dwarf planet]] category.

Ceres passes through the zodiac every 4&amp;nbsp;years and 7&amp;nbsp;months, passing through a little more than 2½&amp;nbsp;signs every year.

In mythology, Ceres is the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess [[Demeter]], and is the goddess of agriculture. The goddess (and metaphorically the planet) is also associated with the reproductive issues of an adult woman, as well as pregnancy and other major transitions in a woman's life, including the nine months of gestation time, family bonds and relationships. In old opinion, Ceres is the ruling planet of [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} but as more knowledge about the planet's character has been revealed, majority of modern astrologers opinion, denote Ceres being the ruler for [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], however, Ceres is exalted in [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pandoraastrology.com/blog/ceres-rules-taurus&lt;/ref&gt; In an updated revision, Virgo is ruled by [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]] and exalted in [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]].&lt;ref&gt;http://astrodynamics.net/tag/chiron-ruler-of-virgo/&lt;/ref&gt; Although a mother, Ceres is also the archetype of a virgin goddess. Ceres epitomizes independent women who are often unmarried (since, according to myth, Ceres is an unmarried goddess who chose to become a mother without a husband or partner.) While the moon represents our ideal of "motherhood", Ceres would represent how our real and nature motherhood should be.&lt;ref name="Martin, Helena p333-334"&gt;Martin, Helena ''Planets in the astrological universe (los planetas en el universo astrológico)'', p333-334, Ed. Indigo, Barcelona, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PIA19547-Ceres-DwarfPlanet-Dawn-RC3-AnimationFrame25-20150504.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]]]
Ceres, as the Goddess who has control over nature's resources and cycles, may astrologically be considered the planet of the Environment. Returning to mythology, an early environmental villain is the figure of [[Erysichthon of Thessaly|Erysichthon]], the tearer up of the earth, who cut down trees in a grove sacred to Ceres-Demeter, for which he was punished by the goddess with fearful hunger. In this sense Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of recent [[climate change]], and is entering our collective consciousness as a need to take care of our natural and irreplaceable resources in the 21st century. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge. As an indicator for environmental or community activism, Ceres would represent for some astrologers the wave of the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astrostar.com/articles/Ceres.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other solar system bodies==
{{see also|Asteroids in astrology}}
Some [[asteroid]]s such as [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] ([[File:Pallas symbol.svg|x22px]]) and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] ([[File:Vesta symbol.svg|x22px]]), as well as dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], can sometimes be seen with binoculars (Vesta even with the naked eye), but these were not recognized as planetary, and perhaps not even noticed, until the early 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In the early 19th century, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] ([[File:Juno symbol.svg|x22px]]), and the other two aforementioned asteroids were for a time regarded as planets. Although asteroids have been known to both astronomers and astrologers for more than 200 years, they are often ignored by astrologers. The tradition of some astrologers casting charts with minor planets originates with these asteroids. Since the discovery of [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]] ([[File:Chiron symbol.svg|x22px]]) in the 1970s, some astrologers have been casting the new "planet", although astronomers consider it a [[centaur (astronomy)|centaur]] (a kind of intermediate object between comet and asteroid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrology-numerology.com/chiron.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119141800/http://astrology-numerology.com/chiron.html |archivedate=19 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, several new planet-sized bodies, including [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], have been discovered, but not yet incorporated into mainstream astrological predictions, although some more avant-garde groups have attempted to incorporate them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://astrology.richardbrown.com/NewPlanets/ Richard Brown: New Planets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrotransits.blogspot.com AstroTransits.blogspot.com New dwarf planets in Astrology (Sedna, Eris, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, 2002 TC302, Orcus, and others]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comet]]s and [[nova]]e have been observed and discussed for several thousand years. Comets in particular were portents of great interest to ancient people and given various astrological interpretations. Both phenomena are rarely visible to the naked-eye, and are ignored by most modern astrologers.}

The near-earth asteroid [[3753 Cruithne|Cruithne]] is thought to influence the zodiac and some personal horoscopes. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Hypothetical planets==
Some astrologers have hypothesized about the existence of unseen or undiscovered planets. In 1918, astrologer [[Sepharial]] proposed the existence of Earth's "Dark Moon" [[Lilith (hypothetical moon)|Lilith]], and since then, some astrologers have been using it in their charts; though the same name is also (and now, more commonly) used in astrology to refer to the axis of the actual Moon's orbit. The 20th-century German school of astrology known as Uranian astrology also claimed that many undiscovered planets existed beyond the orbit of Neptune, giving them names such as Cupido, Hades, Zeus, Kronos, Apollon, Admetos, Vulcanus, and Poseidon, and charting their supposed orbits. These orbits have not coincided, however, with more recent discoveries by astronomers of objects beyond Neptune.

Other astrologers have focused on the theory that in time, all twelve signs of the zodiac will each have their own ruler, so that another two planets have yet to be discovered; namely the "true" rulers of Taurus and Virgo. The names of the planets mentioned in this regard by some are Vulcan (ruler of Virgo) and [[Apollo]], the Roman god of the Sun (ruler of Taurus).&lt;ref&gt;Linda Goodman, ''Sun Signs'', p226, Pan Books, London, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of this theory states that the modern planets discovered so far correspond to the elements known to the ancients—air (Uranus, god of the heavens), water (Neptune, god of the sea), and fire (Pluto, god of the underworld)—which leaves the elements earth and [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] (the fifth element of the fiery upper air). In other words, it is claimed that the two planets to be discovered will be named after an [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] god or goddess (such as the [[Horae]]), and after [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]], the Roman and Greek god of the upper air and stars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Ruling planets of the astrological signs and houses==
{{main article|Domicile (astrology)}}
In Western astrology, the symbolism associated with the planets also relates to the zodiac signs and houses of the horoscope in their various [[Ruling planet|rulerships]]. For instance, the description of Mars is masculine, impulsive, and active. Aries is ruled by Mars and has a similar description, representing an active, masculine [[archetype]]. Similarly, the first house is also ruled by Mars, and deals with a person's physical health and strength, and the manner in which they project themselves.

[[File:West Window, Hook Church - geograph.org.uk - 685266.jpg|thumb|right|Ps104:24 in West Window, Hook Church]]

'''Psalm 104''' ([[Septuagint|Greek]] numbering: '''Psalm 103''') is one of the psalms from the [[Book of Psalms]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Eckhard von Nordheim, Die Selbstbehauptung Israels in der Welt des Alten Orients: religionsgeschichtlicher Vergleich anhand von Gen 15/22/28, dem Aufenthalt Israels in Ägypten, 2 Sam 7, 1 Kön 19 und Psalm 104, Vandenhoeck&amp;Ruprecht Göttingen, 1992,&lt;/ref&gt;
It is notable among the psalms for describing [[YHWH]] ([[Elohim]]) explicitly as the [[creator deity]].  German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] remarked, "It is worth studying the Hebrew language for ten years in order to read Psalm 104 in the original".

==Content==
The subject matter and its presentation is closely related both to the first [[Genesis creation narrative]] (Genesis 1, chronologically younger than the second version in Genesis 2) where likewise the waters are separated before the creation of Sun and Moon, and to older accounts of creation from the [[Ancient Near East]], both Mesopotamian and Egyptian. In particular, the Egyptian [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] (14th century BC) is frequently cited as a predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. James B. Pritchard,  "The Ancient Near East, An anthology of Texts and Pictures", Princeton University Press, 1958, p. 227.  Eckhard von Nordheim, ''Die Selbstbehauptung Israels in der Welt des Alten Orients'' (1992), p.  155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;vgl. das Kapitel Der Große Hymnus des Echnaton und Psalm 104 in Eckhard von Nordheim, Die Selbstbehauptung Israels in der Welt des Alten Orients (1992), 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scholar [[Mark S. Smith]] has commented that "Despite enduring support for the comparison of the two texts, enthusiasm for even indirect influence has been tempered in recent decades. In some quarters, the argument for any form of influence is simply rejected outright. Still some Egyptologists, such as Jan Assmann and Donald Redford, argue for Egyptian influence on both the Amarna correspondence (especially in EA 147) and on Psalm 104."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Mark S.|title=God in Translation: Deities in Cross-Cultural Discourse in the Biblical World|date=2010|publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0802864338|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yvWlC0kUlkYC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=great+hymn+to+the+aten+psalm+104#v=onepage&amp;q=great%20hymn%20to%20the%20aten%20psalm%20104&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the longer psalms, it is traditionally divided into 35 verses.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Gunkel, Die Psalmen (1986), 442f.&lt;/ref&gt;  begins by describing the [[glory of God]] ("Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment" v. 2).
Verse 5 asserts that God has "laid the foundations [מכון] of the Earth".
Verses 6 to 13 concern the ordering of the waters, verses 14-18 vegetation and animal life, 19-24 Sun and Moon and the cycle of day and night.
:v. 24 (KJV): "O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches."
Verse 26 mentions the [[Leviathan]] (sea monster).

Verses 27-30  emphasises how all creature still depend on the ongoing attention and provision by the creator, and perish if he averts his attention. 
:v. 30 (KJV): "Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth."
The concluding verses 31-35 reiterate the power and glory of YHWH, and the composer expresses his adoration, and, in the final verse, his wish that the sinners (חטא) and wicked (רשע) be "consumed out of the earth"). 
In the Masoretic text, the phrase [[Hallelujah]] is placed at the end of the final verse. This is lacking in the [[Septuagint]] and the [[Vulgate]], but it is rendered by the KJV as "Praise ye the LORD".

==Liturgical uses==
===Judaism===
*[[Orthodox Judaism|Observant Jews]] recite Psalm 104 in its entirety every day during [[Shacharit|morning services]], and on certain occasions, such as the New Moon ([[Rosh Chodesh]]), though customs vary.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Prayer Book, Philip Birnbaum, 1949, p.&amp;nbsp;465&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is recited following the Shabbat [[Mincha]] between [[Sukkot]] and [[Shabbat Hagadol]].&lt;ref&gt;Scherman (1985:530)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Verses 1-2 are recited upon donning the [[tallit]] during [[Shacharit|morning services]].&lt;ref&gt;Scherman (1985:2)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Verse 24 is part of [[Hameir La'aretz]] in the [[Blessings of the Shema (Shacharit)|Blessings before the Shema]] during [[Shacharit]]&lt;ref&gt;Scherman (1985:87)&lt;/ref&gt; and is found in [[Pirkei Avot]] Chapter 6, no. 10.&lt;ref&gt;Scherman (1985:587)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Verse 31 is the first verse of [[Yehi Kivod]] in [[Pesukei Dezimra]],&lt;ref&gt;Scherman (1985:64)&lt;/ref&gt; is part of [[Baruch Hashem L'Olam (Maariv)|Baruch Hashem L'Olam]] during [[Maariv]],&lt;ref&gt;Scherman (1985:265)&lt;/ref&gt; and is recited when opening the [[Hakafah|Hakafot]] on [[Simchat Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;Scherman (1985:759)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodox===
Its main liturgical usage in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] is at the beginning of [[vespers]] (evening prayers) and the [[all-night vigil]]. While it is technically one of the elements of the vespers service prescribed for the senior reader (that is, the elder or abbot of a monastery, or in a parish the seniormost reader at the kliros), it is customarily read or [[chant]]ed by a reader after the opening prayers of the service.

The psalm is meant to be read or chanted in a plain style at services of vespers which are not part of a vigil. When vespers is served as part of a vigil, an abbreviated musical version is usually sung by the choir. Several such musical arrangements of the psalm have been composed over the years; perhaps the most familiar is that found in the [[Obikhod]], or common setting.

In the context of its vespers/vigil setting, this psalm is understood to be a hymn of creation, in all the fulness wherein God has created it - it speaks of animals, plants, waters, skies, etc. In the scope of the liturgical act, it is often taken to be [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]'s song, sung outside the closed gates of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] from which he has been expelled (cf. Genesis 3). While the reader chants the psalm, the priest stands outside the closed [[Royal Doors]] wearing only his [[epitrachilion]], making this symbolism more evident.

===Roman Catholicism===
This psalm is used during the [[Easter Vigil]] on [[Holy Saturday]] night (the Vigil being the inauguration of the fifty-day Easter season, the end of [[Holy Week]]- and by extension [[Lent]]- and the ending of the three-day [[Easter Triduum]] of [[Holy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], and Easter). In the Liturgy of the Word, the first reading is the [[Creation story]] of the [[Book of Genesis]], and Psalm 104, which deals with the same material, is the responsorial psalm. It is used again during Pentecost, at the end of the Easter season, as the responsorial psalm for the Vigil and the Sunday Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usccb.org/bible/readings/051913.cfm|title=Pentecost Sunday|work=usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usccb.org/bible/readings/033013.cfm |title=Holy Saturday – Vigil in the Holy Night of Easter |publisher=Usccb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rastafari===

[[Bob Marley]] believed that [[cannabis]] use was prevalent in the Bible, reading passages such as Psalm 104 as showing approval of its usage.&lt;ref name="Bob Marley: Musician"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bob Marley: Musician|authors=Sherry Paprocki, Sean Dolan|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{essay|date=April 2018}}
During his exile in Dapitan in 1892, the National Hero of the Philippines Dr. Jose Rizal, who was also a Mason, had the opportunity to engage Fr. Pastells through correspondence. They argued about many things including the concept of God.


&lt;gallery&gt;
Jose_rizal_01.jpg|Dr. Jose Rizal
Nietzsche1882.jpg|Friedrich Nietzsche
&lt;/gallery&gt;


Based on the letters Dr. Rizal wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palma|first1=Rafael|title=The Pride of the Malay Race: Jose Rizal|date=1949|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|pages=239-247}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be said that his concept of God could be summarized into three (3) notions. First, he believed that God existed. Second, he believed that God was ''Plus Supra''. Lastly, he believed that God was the origin of nature; that is, nature was the expression of God.


As regards the first notion, Dr. Rizal made explicit that he believed that God existed. He was convinced that a supernatural power behind all of creation had to exist. He says to Fr. Pastells, "We are entirely in accord in admitting the existence of God: how can I doubt it when I am convinced of my own existence? Who recognizes the effect recognizes the cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palma|first1=Rafael|title=The Pride of the Malay Race: Jose Rizal|date=1949|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was clear that Dr. Rizal subscribed to the idea of "necessary-contingent beings"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lizzini|first1=Olga|title=Ibn Sina's Metaphysics|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-sina-metaphysics/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford: Center for the Study of Language and Information|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the contingent being needed other beings for it to exist while the necessary being existed on its own. As such, the necessary being becomes the origin of contingent beings. This necessary being has been labelled by many as "God."


Dr. Rizal considered himself as a contingent being that needed other beings to sustain his existence. Such other beings included the origin of all; the necessary being, God. He accepted that he was part of the whole of creation. He could not deny himself. Hence, he could not deny creation. As such, he could not deny God.


As regards the second notion, Dr. Rizal argued that his God was not like the God of the Catholics, as his God was far above such things. He says to Fr. Pastells, "In the conviction that I find myself before the Supreme Problem, which confused voices desire to explain to me, I cannot but answer: 'That may be so; but the God that I surmise is much greater, much better: ''Plus Supra''!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palma|first1=Rafael|title=The Pride of the Malay Race: Jose Rizal|date=1949|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that a requirement to the Godliness of God was His being above all things, which meant His being incomprehensible. 


Dr. Rizal was clearly not convinced that a sufficient understanding of God that was as powerful and metaphysical as the Supreme Being could be contained in the consciousness of little mortals who have no capacity to understand beyond what was in the words of Nietzsche "divined"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cifra|first1=Vincent|title=Understanding Creativity in Nietzsche's Philosophy|date=May 2017|publisher=A Master's thesis submitted to the University of Santo Tomas Graduate School}}&lt;/ref&gt; to them. Mortals who were so limited could not have possibly comprehended a limitless being. As such, Dr. Rizal articulated that the only genuine faith was "blind faith." In short, the more people tried to explain to him what and who God was, the more he got convinced that they did not know what they were talking about.


What Dr. Rizal meant by "blind faith" was, since it was impossible to comprehend God as He was ''Plus Supra'', he could have only hinged his belief on the fact that "God was God." As such, he did not deny nor did he accept the religious explanations of the mortals around him. Blind faith was more of a disposition of philosophy than of religion. It was a disposition where one did not accept and deny despite having a personal conviction.


As regards the third notion, Dr. Rizal believed that if one was to "understand" God, he was going to do well to note that books which others claimed were tools of revelation were not reliable. The reason was books were too removed from actual reality as these were written by people, interpreted by others, rewritten by people, obscured by others, etc. The best way to have an idea of God was through connecting with Him personally, directly and physically through His extensions. These extensions were nature.


Dr. Rizal says to Fr. Pastells, "I believe in revelation, yes, but in that living revelation of nature which surrounds us everywhere, in that potent voice, eternal, incessant, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal like the Being from which it originates, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can reveal to us better the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palma|first1=Rafael|title=The Pride of the Malay Race: Jose Rizal|date=1949|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Clearly, Dr. Rizal's philosophico-religious view on God was well-reflected on. It was a product of competent ratiocination by an "Indio" whom the Spaniards then undermined. He did not content himself with the teachings he grew up with as a student of Catholic institutions. He explored, rationalized, and argued. He asked questions about faith and the fundamental teachings of the Church. He was however careful not to offend the religious sensibilities of his countrymen. To him, ratiocination was simply a gift from God. To not use it would thus have been offensive to the Giver.

'''SAT-7''' is a [[Christian]] [[satellite television]] network broadcasting in Arabic, Persian and Turkish across 25 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, along with about 50 countries in Europe. SAT-7 was founded as a nonprofit organization in 1995 with support from Middle Eastern churches.  SAT-7 is the first, oldest and largest Christian satellite organization operating in the Middle East and North Africa.  Founder Terence Ascott has served as International CEO since 1995. The not-for-profit organization is governed by an international volunteer board.

==Network and channels==

The network consists of five channels:  SAT-7 ARABIC, SAT-7 KIDS (Arabic language), SAT-7 PARS (Persian language), SAT-7 TÜRK (Turkish language) and SAT-7 ACADEMY (Arabic). More than 80% of programming is produced in the Middle East by Middle Easterners.  A wide variety of [[genre]]s are employed, including dramas, music videos, films, cartoons, game shows, teaching programs, documentaries, talk shows and current events programs.

SAT-7 programming is available "free to air" to any viewer with access to a television and satellite connection within satellite coverage areas. Estimates indicate about 90% of households in the region have access to a television and an average of 55-60% have access to satellite. In countries such as Iraq, satellite access is approaching 90% of the population.  An independent survey indicated 1 in 3 Iraqi children and 1 in 4 Saudi Arabian children watch SAT-7 KIDS.  In 2017, the overall viewing audience of its channels is estimated at over 21 million.

SAT-7 is financially supported by interested individuals, churches, corporations and foundations from the Middle East and North Africa and around the world.  The organization's mission is advanced by four support offices: SAT-7 Canada, SAT-7 Europe, SAT-7 UK, and [http://www.sat7usa.org SAT-7 USA] [[Rex M. Rogers]]. SAT-7 USA is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] organization at [http://www.sat7usa.org SAT-7 USA English language home page]. Two additional support offices are being developed, SAT-7 South Africa and SAT-7 Brazil.

SAT-7 international headquarters is located in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]].

===SAT-7 ARABIC===

SAT-7 ARABIC launched May 31, 1996 to provide Arab language Christian programming with blocks of programming specifically for children, youth, and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sat7.com|title=Sat 7|website=www.sat7.com|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SAT-7 KIDS===

SAT-7 KIDS launched on December 10, 2007.  It aims to make Christian programming available to an entire generation of Arab children.

===SAT-7 PARS===

SAT-7 PARS launched on December 18, 2006, although [[Persian language|Persian]] broadcasts began on September 12, 2002 on SAT-7 ARABIC.

===SAT-7 TÜRK===
SAT-7 has been broadcasting Turkish-language programs from its sister channel, TURK-7, for several years beginning in January 2006.

In January 2010 the Turkish ministry merged with SAT-7 to become its fourth channel – SAT-7 TÜRK.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===SAT-7 ACADEMY===
SAT-7 ACADEMY, an Arabic language education channel, was launched on September 1, 2017. It features instructional programming in Arabic, English, mathematics, and the sciences for children, parents, and teachers. SAT-7 plans to introduce additional subjects in the future.

The SAT-7 website states that "SAT-7 has always been committed to holistic programming, with the aim of ministering to people in all areas of their life: spiritual, emotional, psychological and physical."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sat7.org/our-channels/channel-overview/sat-7-academy|title=SAT-7 ACADEMY {{!}} SAT-7|website=sat7.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming has included dramas promoting the rights of children and women, documentaries about microenterprise development, and game shows and music clips that have fostered a better understanding of the needs and potential of the disabled.

The SAT-7 website states that the SAT-7 Academy channel was developed out of concerns of "losing a generation" of Arab children who miss school due to conflict. In response, SAT-7 began on-air classroom-style programming for displaced and refugee children in the Levant.

In the decade before the [[Arab Spring]], the UNDP [http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr/arab_human_developmentreport2009.html report on Arab Human Development (2003 – 2009)] cited three causes for what it called the severe “backwardness” in the Arab World. One of these principle causes was the widespread lack of opportunity for a good education. Not just having the chance to go to school and learning how to read, but children need to be taught to think for themselves, be equipped and encouraged to question, to be creative and to learn essential life skills.

And, while SAT-7 is always seeking to build such ideas into our on-air programming for children, the network also wishes to address the needs and attitudes of poorly trained teachers and parents. Many have not experienced a form of education that goes beyond rote learning, where violence has been a standard way of maintaining class and home discipline and where an obsession with coming up with “the right” answers has stunted any free thought…or the concept that there might actually be no right answers to some questions.

The idea of an educational channel, with the name SAT-7 ACADEMY, is in fact much more than just the delivery of instruction modules for children and youth hungry to learn the basics of literacy and mathematics. The concept is much more holistic and concerned about the values, attitudes, and character of the next generation in the Arab World; to see Arab children grow up well and to shape a much more inclusive, creative, and democratic society.

The '''Saint Germain Movement''' is a religious organization, headquartered in [[Schaumburg, Illinois]], a suburb of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], with a major facility just north of [[Dunsmuir, California]], in the buildings and property of the [[Shasta Springs]] retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James R.

The doctrines of the organization are based on teachings and wisdom received by [[Guy Ballard]] in 1930.  Ballard was hiking on the slopes of [[Mount Shasta]] in [[California]], and claimed Saint Germain appeared to him and began training him to be a "Messenger".&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray.

'''Satraps''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|t|r|ə|p}}) were the governors of the [[province]]s of the ancient [[Medes|Median]] and [[Achaemenid Empire]]s and in several of their successors, such as in the [[Sasanian Empire]] and the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] empires.

The word "satrap" is also often used metaphorically in modern literature to refer to world leaders or governors who are heavily influenced by larger world [[superpower]]s or [[Hegemony|hegemonies]] and act as their surrogates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/satrap |title=Satrap – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word {{lang|en|[[wikt:satrap|satrap]]}} is derived via Latin {{lang|la|satrapes}} from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''satrápēs'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:σατράπης|σατράπης]]}}), itself borrowed from an [[Old Iranian languages|Old Iranian]] ''*xšaθra-pā/ă-''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/greece-xi-xii |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517054137/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/greece-xi-xii# |archive-date=2017-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In  [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]], which was the native language of the Achaemenids, it is recorded as ''xšaçapāvan'' ({{lang|peo|[[wikt:𐎧𐏁𐏂𐎱𐎠𐎺𐎠|𐎧𐏁𐏂𐎱𐎠𐎺𐎠]]}}, literally "protector of the province"). The [[Median language|Median]] form is reconstructed as ''*xšaθrapāwan-''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6560686/_Towards_the_Discusion_on_the_Language_of_the_Scythians_The_Transition_of_OIr_x%C5%A1-_s-_and_its_Reflection_in_the_Ancient_Greek_%D0%9A_%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%BE_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%B4%D1%80.%D0%B8%D1%80._x%C5%A1-_s-_%D0%B8_%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%B2_%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC|title=[Towards the Discusion on the Language of the Scythians: The Transition of OIr *xš- &amp;gt; *s- and its Reflection in the Ancient Greek] К дискуссии о языке скифов: переход др.ир. *xš- &amp;gt; *s- и его отражение в древнегреческом|first=Mikhail|last=Bukharin|publisher=|journal=Проблемы Истории, Филологии, Культуры. 2013. 2.

In the [[Parthian language|Parthian]] (language of the [[Arsacid Empire]]) and [[Middle Persian]] (the language of the [[Sassanian Empire]]), it is recorded in the forms ''šahrab'' and ''šasab'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"šasab" in [[David Neil MacKenzie]], ''A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Persian language|modern Persian]] the descendant of ''xšaθrapāvan'' is ''shahrbān'' ({{lang|fa|شهربان|rtl=yes}}), but the components have undergone [[semantic shift]] so the word now means "town keeper" (''shahr'' [{{lang|fa|شهر|rtl=yes}}] meaning "town" + ''bān'' [{{lang|fa|بان|rtl=yes}}] meaning "keeper").

==Medo-Persian satraps==
[[File:Karaburun Elmali dignitary 470 BCE.jpg|thumb|A dignitary of [[Asia Minor]] in Achaemenid style, circa 475 BC. Karaburun tomb near [[Elmalı]], [[Lycia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=André-Salvini |first1=Béatrice |title=Forgotten Empire: The World of Ancient Persia |date=2005 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520247314 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJnaKu9DdNEC&amp;pg=PA46 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although the first large-scale use of satrapies, or provinces, originates from the inception of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] under [[Cyrus the Great]], beginning at around 530{{nbsp}}BCE, provincial organization actually originated during the [[Medes|Median]] era from at least 648{{nbsp}}BCE.

Up to the time of the conquest of [[Medes|Media]] by Cyrus the Great, emperors ruled the lands they conquered through [[client king]]s and governors. The main difference was that in Persian culture the concept of kingship was indivisible from divinity: divine authority validated the [[divine right of kings]]. The twenty-six satraps established by Cyrus were never kings, but [[viceroy]]s ruling in the king's name, although in political reality many took advantage of any opportunity to carve themselves an independent power base. [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] gave the satrapies a definitive organization, increased their number to thirty-six, and fixed their annual tribute ([[Behistun inscription]]).

[[File:IONIA, Magnesia ad Maeandrum. Themistokles. Circa 465-459 BC.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Themistocles]], a former Athenian general, as [[Achaemenid Empire]] Satrap of [[Magnesia on the Meander|Magnesia]], circa 465-459 BC]]
The satrap was in charge of the land that he owned as an administrator, and found himself surrounded by an all-but-royal court; he collected the taxes, controlled the local officials and the subject tribes and cities, and was the supreme judge of the province before whose "chair" (''Nehemiah''{{nbsp}}3:7) every civil and criminal case could be brought. He was responsible for the safety of the roads (cf.{{nbsp}}Xenophon), and had to put down brigands and rebels.

He was assisted by a council of Persians, to which also provincials were admitted and which was controlled by a royal secretary and emissaries of the king, especially the "eye of the king", who made an annual inspection and exercised permanent control.

[[File:CILICIA, Mallos. Tiribazos. Satrap of Lydia, 388-380 BC.jpg|thumb|Coinage of [[Tiribazos]], Satrap of [[Lydia (satrapy)|Achaemenid Lydia]], 388-380 BC]]
There were further checks on the power of each satrap: besides his secretarial scribe, his chief financial official (Old Persian ''ganzabara'') and the general in charge of the regular army of his province and of the fortresses were independent of him and periodically ported directly to the ''shah'', in person. The satrap was allowed to have troops in his own service.

The great satrapies (provinces) were often divided into smaller districts, the governors of which were also called satraps and (by Greco-Roman authors) also called ''hyparchs'' (actually ''Hyparkhos'' in Greek, 'vice-regents'). The distribution of the great satrapies was changed repeatedly, and often two of them were given to the same man.
[[File:Achaemenid Satrap Autophradates with visitors Payava tomb.jpg|thumb|Achaemenid Satrap [[Autophradates]] receiving visitors, on the [[Tomb of Payava]], circa 380 BC.]]

As the provinces were the result of consecutive conquests (the homeland had a special status, exempt from provincial tribute), both primary and sub-satrapies were often defined by former states and/or ethno-religious identity. One of the keys to the Achaemenid success (as with most enduring great empires) was their open attitude to the culture and religion of the conquered people, so the Persian culture was the one most affected as the Great King endeavoured to meld elements from all his subjects into a new imperial style, especially at his capital, [[Persepolis]].

[[File:Satrap sarcophagus banquet scene.jpg|thumb|left|Banquet scene of a Satrap, on the "Sarcophagus of the Satrap", [[Sidon]], 4th century BC.]]
Whenever central authority in the empire weakened, the satrap often enjoyed practical independence, especially as it became customary to appoint him also as general-in-chief of the army district, contrary to the original rule. "When his office became hereditary, the threat to the central authority could not be ignored" (Olmstead). Rebellions of satraps became frequent from the middle of the 5th{{nbsp}}century BCE. [[Darius I]] struggled with widespread rebellions in the satrapies, and under [[Artaxerxes II]] occasionally the greater parts of [[Asia Minor]] and Syria were in open rebellion ([[Revolt of the Satraps]]).

The last great rebellions were put down by [[Artaxerxes III]].

==Hellenistic satraps==
{{see|Partition of Babylon|Partition of Triparadisus}}
[[File:Diadochi satraps babylon.png|thumb|right|The satraps appointed by Alexander the Great during his campaign]]
[[Image:Baydad.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bagadates I]] (Minted 290–280 BC), the first indigenous satrap to be appointed by the [[Seleucid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Mørkholm, ''Early Hellenistic Coinage: From the Accession of Alexander to the Peace of Apamea'' (Cambridge University Press) 1991:73f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Curtis, Nigel Tallis and Béatrice André-Salvini, ''Forgotten Empire: The World of Ancient Persia'' 2005:258-9, fig. 454, Silver tetradrachm of Bagadates.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The satrapic administration and title were retained—even for Greco-Macedonian incumbents—by [[Alexander the Great]], who conquered the Achaemenid Empire, and by his successors, the [[Diadochi]] (and their dynasties) who carved it up, especially in the [[Seleucid Empire]], where the satrap generally was designated as ''[[strategos]]''; but their provinces were much smaller than under the Persians. They would ultimately be replaced by conquering empires, especially the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].

==Parthian and Sassanian satraps==
In the [[Parthian Empire]], the king's power rested on the support of noble families who ruled large estates, and supplied soldiers and tribute to the king. City-states within the empire enjoyed a degree of self-government, and paid tribute to the king. Administration of the [[Sassanid Empire]] was considerably more centralized than that of the Parthian Empire; the semi-independent kingdoms and self-governing city states of the Parthian Empire were replaced with a system of "royal cities" which served as the seats of centrally appointed governors called ''shahrabs'' as well as the location of military garrisons. ''Shahrabs'' ruled both the city and the surrounding rural districts. Exceptionally, the [[Byzantine Empire]] also adopted the title "satrap" for the semi-autonomous princes that governed one of its [[Roman Armenia|Armenian provinces]], the ''Satrapiae''.

==Western satraps==
{{Main|Western satraps}}
[[File:Nahapana.jpg|thumb|Coin of "[[Western satraps|Western Satrap]]" [[Nahapana]], circa 120 CE.]]
The Western Satraps or Kshatrapas (35–405 CE) were [[Indo-Scythian|Saka]] rulers in the western and central part of the [[Sindh]] region of [[Pakistan]], and the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] and [[Malwa]] regions of western [[India]]. They were contemporaneous with the [[Kushan]]s who ruled the northern part of the subcontinent from the area of [[Peshawar]] and were possibly their overlords, and with the [[Satavahana]] ([[Andhra in Indian epic literature|Andhra]]) who ruled in central India to their south and east and the [[Kushan]] state to their immediate west.

==Satraps today and in fiction==
*It is also used in modern times to refer (usually derogatorily) to the loyal subservient lieutenants or clients of some powerful figure (with equal imprecision also styled ''[[Business magnate|mogul]]'', ''[[tycoon]]'', or the like), in politics or business.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
*In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], the word ''sátrapa/satrápēs (σατράπης)'' not only carries the aforementioned ancient historical meaning, but in modern usage also applies to people who abuse power or authority. It can refer as well to those living in luxurious and ostentatious conditions or to individuals who act astutely and even disloyally.
*The College of [['Pataphysics]] used the title ''Transcendent Satrap'' for certain of its members, including [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jean Baudrillard]] and the [[Marx brothers]].
*In the Serbian language, ''satrap'' is used to mock a person who displays servile tendencies to an authority figure.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''Tae Eul Ju''' is a sacred [[mantra]] used throughout the world by practitioners of [[Jeung san do|Jeung San Do]]. This mantra consists of twenty-three holy sounds. Jeung San Sangjenim, on whose teachings and spiritual work Jeung San Do is based, shared a meditative and spiritual practice aimed at transforming ourselves and society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeungsando.org Jeung San Do - Renewing Heaven and Earth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The cornerstone of this practice is Tae Eul Mantra (太乙呪) meditation. Chanting the Tae Eul Mantra (Tae-eul-ju) allows the practitioner to tap into the healing and enlightening energy coming from the life-giving womb of the universe, awakens the practitioner to the spirit world and attracts protective energy and spirits that can protect the practitioner from misfortune.

A mantra is a series of sacred sounds. Any mantra chanted with proper breathing, posture of body and mind, and a degree of faith in both the mantra and one's own ability will produce positive effects. Each mantra has its own purpose and power. Some mantras can be translated into simple words, but invariably the deeper meaning can only be understood through regular practice.

The sacred sounds of the Tae Eul Mantra are:
:''Hum (Hoom) Chi (Chee) Hum (Hoom) Chi (Chee)'' 
:''Tae Eul Cheon Sang Wun Gun Hum (Hoom) Ri (Ni) Chi Ya Do Re Hum (Hoom) Ri (Ni) Ham Ri (Ni) Sa Pa Ha''

== Meaning==
Ahn Gyung-jun, the ''sabunim'' of Jeung San Do, explains some of the sounds of the mantra as follows:

=== What is the sound hum? ===
According to Buddhism, ''hum (hoom)'' is "The mind of the Buddha." Hum (hoom) is the mind of all enlightened beings. When you are immersed in the peaceful hum (hoom) sound, you can attain Buddha-mind.

=== Sound of chi (chee) ===
In Sanskrit, ''chi (chee)'' means "To become one with all brilliant spirits existing in the whole universe." Sangjenim was the first to join the sounds hum (hoom) and chi (chee) together. Once they were joined, a new more fantastic meaning took shape. Sangjenim said, "Hum (Hoom) Chi (Chee) is the sound calling the parents of all things in heaven and earth."

=== How to chant?===
Whenever you chant Hum (Hoom) - chi (chee) - hum (hoom) - chi (chee), you should chant with the mind of calling out to your original parents. Some people mistakenly chant it with a sad and depressing voice, as if crying, causing such sad and depressive energy to respond. You should call out to your parents with bright energy.

===Tae-eul Heaven===
The next part of Tae-eul-ju is Tae-eul-cheon-sang-wun-gun. Tae-eul-cheon means "Tae-eul Heaven." All the mysteries in the universe are contained in these three syllables. ''Tae'' means "ultimate." ''Eul'' signifies the womb of the universe, which gives birth to all things including humanity. Tae Eul Cheon is the ultimate place from which all humans are born. ''Sang'' means "heavenly" or "supreme." ''Wun'' means "fundamental" or "ultimate." ''Gun'' (pronounce ''Goon'') means "king." Sang Wun Gun is the entity in charge of Tae Eul Heaven, the place in the universe from which life-giving energy comes. What does sa-pa-ha, the last three syllables, mean? It is a beautiful prayer asking that all of our wishes and desires be fulfilled.

== Method of Tae Eul Ju meditation ==
Whenever Jeung San Do practitioners do Tae Eul Ju meditation, there are three steps before meditation, offering, bowing and prayer. After above three steps, they start to meditate. During meditation, your body should be relaxed with good posture and set your focal point and breathe from the lower abdomen.

=== Offering, bowing, and prayer ===
To get the optimal spiritual experience from meditation, prepare a bowl of water and perform four bows and a prayer. The bowl of water symbolizes the purification of body, mind, and spirit and is an offering of life essence (jeong : 精) to the spirits. [[Sangjenim]] taught that when we meditate we should direct our gaze upon the bowl of water with our "inner eyes open and outer eyes closed." By bowing we show respect to Sangjenim, Taemonim, and other spirits as we unite our human virtue with the virtue of heaven and earth. By doing a personal prayer before meditation, we can reflect upon and ask forgiveness for shortcomings and express intentions to heaven and earth. Personal prayer is a time of self-reflection and clearing the mind.

=== Body posture ===
It does not have to be a lotus posture and relaxing posture is the most important. Kneeling or sitting cross-legged, keep your back straight (most important), your chin slightly tucked in, and your shoulders slightly back. If your legs get tired, change from a kneeling to sitting position or vice versa, but try to keep your back straight while doing so. The spine is the main channel for the flow of [[qi]] within the body, and is a [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for receiving the ''qi'' of heaven and earth. If the back is crooked, this ''qi'' does not flow well. Also, because the body and mind are one, there is a direct relationship between mental and physical posture. If you find that your mind is wandering during meditation, check your posture. When the back is not straight, the mind tends to lose focus.

=== Focal point ===
Different schools of meditation advocate various focal points. In Jeung San Do it is recommended that you direct your consciousness inward toward the lower ''danjeon'' ([[Dantian|dantien]]), a central energy point located below the navel. While doing this imagine the sound of the mantra permeating your entire body.

=== Breathing ===
Breathe from the lower abdomen. As you exhale, the lower abdomen goes in; as you inhale the lower abdomen goes out. This breathing technique is almost the same throughout all different meditations with few exceptions. It is important to do this in a natural way, not tensing or forcing the stomach muscles. Before long, you will feel any stress-related tension in your chest fall away as the fire energy descends and the water energy rises. This process is called ''suseunghwagang'' (水昇火降).

=== Chanting ===
There are three basic methods of chanting: chanting aloud with a resonating voice, chanting softly such that only you can hear, and chanting silently within your mind. Chanting aloud is the most effective way to experience the vibration of the mantra's sound, but it may be necessary to practice soft or silent chanting when the sound may disturb those around you. In daily practice you can use all three methods.

=== Sound and mindset ===
While chanting, keep your mind positive and sound bright. Your mindset and the manner in which you chant determine the kind of energy and spirit that responds to you. ''Taesabunim'' (Supreme Dao Master) teaches that when meditating, "Do not think of goodness. Do not think of badness." This is the nondiscriminating mind that allows a practitioner to become one with the universe. Do not think of yourself as good or bad, do not think of others as good or bad, do not think of any phenomena as good or bad. Just be natural.

=== When to meditate? ===
Anytime is a good time to meditate, but the best times for meditation are in the early morning and late evening. In the morning, you receive the activating yang energy of a new day, and in the evening, you receive the yin energy that allows for perfect rest. To carry the peacefulness and energy of meditation in to the entire day, continuously chant in your mind while doing any of your daily activities. While you are walking, driving, eating, relaxing, etc.

== Purpose of Tae Eul Ju meditation==
Jeung San Do's meditation combines the chanting style of Buddhism with the inner alchemy of Taoism. When meditators immerse themselves in the peaceful sound of mantra, they feel a sense of oneness with the universe. Through the internal process of circulating the fire and water energies, the practitioner improves the condition of the body and cultivates spirit.

== Four different powers ==
Tae Eul Ju has four different powers:

; H (Healing)
: By chanting Tae Eul Mantra, you can heal yourself as well as healing others.

; E (Enlightenment)
: By chanting Tae Eul Mantra, you can reach enlightenment faster than other mantra.

; P (Protection)
: By chanting Tae Eul Mantra, you are protected from evil spirit and bad energy.

; S (Salvation)
: When the time comes, GaeByeok, Tae Eul Ju Mantra will be used to save the world.

'''Tas-Silġ''' is a rounded hilltop overlooking [[Marsaxlokk]] Bay, [[Malta]], close to the city of [[Żejtun]].&lt;ref name=MPT&gt;{{cite book |title= Malta: Prehistory and Temples|last= Trump|first= David H. |year= 2004 |publisher= Misdea Book Ltd| pages= 138, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tas-Silġ is a multi-period sanctuary site covering all eras from [[Neolithic]] to the fourth century AD, and due to this it indicates to archaeologists several different layers of excavation.&lt;ref name=MU&gt;{{cite web|title=Tas-Silġ Excavation Project (1996–2005)|url=http://www.um.edu.mt/arts/classics-archaeo/projects/tassilg|website=[[University of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035715/http://www.um.edu.mt/arts/classics-archaeo/projects/tassilg|archivedate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site takes its name from the nearby Church of [[Dedication of the Basilica of St Mary Major|Our Lady of the Snows]] (Maltese: ''Knisja tal-Madonna tas-Silġ'').&lt;ref name=oneweek&gt;{{cite web|title=Tas-Silg Sanctuary|url=http://www.oneweekholiday.com/malta/marsascala-zejtun-marsaxlokk-birzebbugia/tas-silg-sanctuary/|website=oneweekholiday.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606084133/http://www.oneweekholiday.com/malta/marsascala-zejtun-marsaxlokk-birzebbugia/tas-silg-sanctuary/|archivedate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Megalithic Temple and Bronze Age settlement==
The area was first inhabited when a temple was built in the [[Tarxien phase]] of Maltese prehistory, sometime around 3000 to 2500 BC. Few remains from the original temple can be seen, but the scatter of megaliths over the hill suggests that there was a large complex with at least 3 temples and possibly a village surrounding it. A D-shaped setting of large blocks that was part of the four-apsed temple still exists as it was later incorporated into the other buildings on the site. In the [[Bronze Age]], the temple was probably converted into a settlement, as had been done in other sites such as [[Borġ in-Nadur]].

In the deepest layer of deposits, archaeologists found various artifacts including pottery, lithics, and a standing ''fat lady''.&lt;ref name="MPT"/&gt; From the Bronze Age layer, some [[sherds]], stone tools and pottery were found. Other evidence from the Bronze Age consists of the large amount of handiwork.&lt;ref name=MU /&gt;

==Punic, Hellenistic and Roman temple==
After the Phoenicians took over Malta in around 700 BC, they built a [[Punics|Punic]] temple to [[Astarte]] incorporating upstanding remains of the earlier temple. A forward extension was added to the curved facade, and a monumental doorway flanked with two pilasters and topped by a huge stone slab was built. The sanctuary's importance eventually grew and a portico was added around 300 BC. Some parts of the temple, including a tower, might have been designed as a fortification to help defend it from possible invaders.

A threshold slab pierced by three [[libation]] holes that divided the eastern part of the temple and the western side, as well as a series of ashlar foundation walls for a platform built to the south of the main sanctuary still exist. Around this area, various remains were found including pottery, ash, animal bones, coins and shreds. Some of these shreds have votive inscriptions. It is claimed that the [[Cippi of Melqart]] might have originally been at the Tas-Silġ temple, but their origin is disputed.

In the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]], the Punic temple was converted into a sanctuary of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], which was the Roman equivalent to Astarte. In 70 BC, [[Cicero]] mentioned the temple in his ''[[In Verrem]]'', in which he said that the temple was revered by everyone including pirates and Numidian princes, but the Roman Governor of Sicily had stolen some of its treasures. Some Roman material was discovered in various deposits around a well in the lower terrace of Tas-Silġ.&lt;ref name=MU /&gt;&lt;ref name=oneweek/&gt;

Large water storage areas under Tas-Silġ were recently found and mapped, and they probably date to the Punic or Roman eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exploring the deep|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120624/technology/Exploring-the-deep.426062|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=24 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111234714/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120624/technology/Exploring-the-deep.426062|archivedate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byzantine monastery==
Later on, in the 4th or 5th centuries AD, a Byzantine monastery were built over the remains of the previous temples. The church had a central nave separated from the aisles by two rows of columns, and a small baptismal font was constructed in what was originally the megalithic temple. Some remains of sculpture were found, including a worn female marble head and an ivory capital with a hanging palmette. Pottery from this period was also found, including amphorae and locally made plates and other items.&lt;ref name=oneweek/&gt;

During the Byzantine period, it may be that the ''fat lady'' was deliberately defaced and buried in a hollow.&lt;ref name=MPT /&gt;

In the 8th century, defensive walls were hastily built around the monastery at Tas-Silġ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri |first1=Stephen C. |title=The 'Castellu di la Chitati' the medieval castle of the walled town of Mdina |journal=Arx – Online Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification |date=2004–2007 |issue=1–4 |page=4 |url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/Arx/arx1_4_2008.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115113200/http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/Arx/arx1_4_2008.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastery was abandoned soon after the Arabs occupied Malta in 870 AD. The site was turned into a quarry and stones from the original structure were removed. In the medieval period farms were built on the area, and rubble walls from this era still exist. The whole site was buried under a metre of soil before being excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tas-Silg – A Living Memory Of Cultures which  effected Maltese And European History|url=http://www.maltainfoguide.com/tas-silg.html|website=Malta Info Guide|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712095646/http://www.maltainfoguide.com/tas-silg.html|archivedate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern history==
[[File:Malta - Marsaxlokk - Triq Xrobb l-Ghagin - Tas-Silg 03 ies.jpg|thumb|Tas-Silġ may only be visited by prior appointment.]]
In the 17th century writers began to speculate the location of Juno's temple that was referred to in ancient texts, however the site was only discovered in the 20th century. It was included on the Antiquities List of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Antiquities Regulations 21st November, 1932 Government Notice 402 of 1932, as Amended by Government Notices 127 of 1935 and 338 of 1939.|url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627|website=[[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6guMwmZDW?url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627|archivedate=20 April 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A remain of a column from the temple at tas-Silg, built in the Phoenician period, is today found at the 17th-century [[Palazzo Marnisi]] in [[Marsaxlokk]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonello, Vincenzo (1964). [https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=bk7jAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=palazzo+Marnisi&amp;dq=palazzo+Marnisi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE3aTou-7MAhVGtRQKHT65Be8Q6AEITDAJ Missione archeologica italiana a Malta: Rapporto preliminare della campagna 1963]. Missione archeologica italiana a Malta. Centro di studi semitici, Istituto di studi del Vicino Oriente, Università. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Italian Mission led the first excavations in between 1963 and 1972 and identified the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=MPT /&gt; From 1996 to 2005 the [[University of Malta]] and an Italian team started another excavation project to clean other layers of sediments. The site is shielded by a cover to protect it from further erosion.&lt;ref name=MU /&gt;

[[Heritage Malta]] runs the conservation of Tas-Silġ but has unfortunately been closed to public up to now, although it may be visited by appointment. Despite this, efforts to conserve the site so one day it will be open to the public began to be made as of September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carabott|first1=Sarah|title=Tas-Silġ... uncovered|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130924/local/Tas-Sil-uncovered.487456|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=24 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111235001/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130924/local/Tas-Sil-uncovered.487456|archivedate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thatha''' or '''Thathi''' (English - Beard Band) is a type of [[cloth]] used by some [[Sikh]]s to fix their [[beard]]s after spraying them with hair spray such as Taft, Fixo, Swift or with water or oil. Many [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] Sikhs prefer to keep an open beard as a sign of respect, but some [[Western culture|Western-minded]] and modern Sikhs prefer tying beards for [[fashion]] and appearance. This consists of spraying the beard with [[hair spray]] or beard spray, then tying it with rubber or beard pin. A thathi is tied on the chin This process takes 30 minutes to an hour. 

The question of open versus fixed beard is not seen as worthy of debate, according to some Sikhs; they contend that [[Guru Gobind Singh Ji]] told Sikhs to keep uncut [[hair]].

The '''Third Buddhist council''' was convened in about 250 BCE at Asokarama in [[Pataliputra]], supposedly under the patronage of Emperor [[Ashoka]]. This is however disputed, as mention of the council never appears in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].

The traditional reason for convening the Third Buddhist Council is reported to have been to rid the [[Sangha]] of corruption and bogus monks who held heretical views. It was presided over by the elder monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] and one thousand monks participated in the Council. The council is recognized and known to both the [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] schools, though its importance is central only to the Theravada.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed account in Chinese of the 3rd Buddhist Council is found starting at line T24n1462_p0678b01(00) of the 善見律毘婆沙.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==

The account of the background to the Third Council is as follows: Emperor [[Ashoka]] was crowned in the two hundred and eighteenth year after the Buddha's [[Parinirvana|parinibbāna]]. At first he paid only token homage to the [[Dhamma]] and the Sangha and also supported members of other religious sects as his father had done before him. However, all this changed when he met the pious novice-monk [[Nigrodha]] who preached him Appamada-vagga verses from the [[Dhammapada]]. Thereafter he ceased supporting other religious groups and his interest in and devotion to the Dhamma deepened. He used his enormous wealth to build, it is said, eighty-four thousand pagodas and viharas and to lavishly support the [[bhikkhus]] (monks) with the [[four requisites]]. His son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] and his daughter [[Sanghamitta]] were ordained and admitted to the Sangha.

Eventually, his generosity was to cause serious problems within the Sangha. In time the order was infiltrated by many unworthy men, holding heretical views and who were attracted to the order because of the Emperor's generous support and costly offerings of food, clothing, shelter and medicine. Large numbers of faithless, greedy men espousing wrong views tried to join the order but were deemed unfit for ordination.

[[File:Mauryan ruins of pillared hall at Kumrahar site of Pataliputra ASIEC 1912-13.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of pillared hall at the [[Kumrahar]] site of [[Pataliputra]].]] 
Despite this they seized the chance to exploit the Emperor's generosity for their own ends and donned robes and joined the order without having been ordained properly. Consequently, respect for the Sangha diminished. When this came to light some of the genuine monks refused to hold the prescribed purification or [[Uposatha#Monastic practice|Uposatha ceremony]] in the company of the corrupt, heretical monks.

When the Emperor heard about this he sought to rectify the situation and dispatched one of his ministers to the monks with the command that they perform the ceremony. However, the Emperor had given the minister no specific orders as to what means were to be used to carry out his command. The monks refused to obey and hold the ceremony in the company of their false and 'thieving' companions ([[Pali]]: ''theyya-sinivāsaka'').

In desperation the angry minister advanced down the line of seated monks and drawing his sword, beheaded all of them one after the other until he came to the King's brother, Tissa who had been ordained. The horrified minister stopped the slaughter and fled the hall and reported back to the Emperor. Asoka was deeply grieved and upset by what had happened and blamed himself for the killings. He sought Thera Moggaliputta Tissa's counsel. He proposed that the heretical monks be expelled from the order and a third Council be convened immediately.

So it was that in the seventeenth year of the Emperor's reign the Third Council was called. Thera Moggaliputta Tissa headed the proceedings and chose one thousand monks from the sixty thousand participants for the traditional recitation of the Dhamma and the Vinaya, which went on for nine months. The Emperor himself questioned monks from a number of monasteries about the teachings of the Buddha. Those who held wrong views were exposed and expelled from the Sangha immediately. In this way the Bhikkhu Sangha was purged of heretics and bogus bhikkhus.

According to the Pali and Chinese accounts, the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa, in order to refute a number of heresies and ensure the Dhamma was kept pure, compiled a book during the council called the [[Kathavatthu]]. This book consists of twenty-three chapters, and is a collection of discussions on the points of controversy. It gives refutations of the 'heretical' views held by various Buddhist sects on matters philosophical. The Kathavatthu is the fifth of the seven books of the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]. However, the historicity of this has been questioned, as the account preserved in the San Jian Lu Pi Po Sho (Sudassanavinayavibhasha), although otherwise almost identical, does not mention the Kathavatthu.

Moggaliputtatissa told Ashoka that the doctrine taught by the Buddha was the [[Vibhajjavada]], the Doctrine of Analysis. This term is used in various senses, and it is not clear exactly what it meant in this context. Traditionally, however, the Sri Lankan Theravadins and other mainland schools of Early Buddhism identified themselves as Vibhajjavada.

One of the most significant achievements ascribed by Theravada tradition to this Dhamma assembly and one which was to bear fruit for centuries to come, was the Emperor's sending forth of monks, well versed in the Buddha's Dhamma and Vinaya who could recite all of it by heart, to teach it in nine different countries. According to the [[Mahavamsa]] (XII, 1st paragraph),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mahavamsa |title=Chapter XII |url=http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap012.html |website=lakdiva.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; he sent the following missionaries:&lt;ref name="PJ"&gt;Thai Art with Indian Influences, Promsak Jermsawatdi, Abhinav Publications, 1979 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0O9je9dECH8C&amp;pg=PA10 p.10ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results of missions===
{{TheravadaBuddhism}}
The Dhamma missions to [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Kashmir]] and [[Gandhara]] were very successful, leading to a long-term presence and dominance of Buddhism in those areas. 

It is not clear exactly how influential the interactions to Egypt and Greece may have been, but some authors have commented that some level of [[syncretism]] between Hellenist thought and Buddhism may have started in Hellenic lands at that time. They have pointed to the presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world around that period, in particular in [[Alexandria]] (mentioned by [[Clement of Alexandria]]), and to the pre-Christian monastic order of the [[Therapeutae]] (possibly a deformation of the Pali word "[[Theravada]]"), who may have "almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism" ([[Robert Linssen]]).

Possibly Buddhist gravestones from the [[Ptolemaic period]] have also been found in [[Alexandria]], decorated with what may be depictions of the Dharma wheel (W. W. Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India''). Commenting on the presence of Buddhists in Alexandria, some scholars have even pointed out that “It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established” (Robert Linssen "Zen living").

In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria recognized Bactrian Buddhists ([[Sramana]]s) and Indian [[Gymnosophist]]s for their influence on Greek thought:

:''"Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light over the nations. And afterwards it came to [[Greece]]. First in its ranks were the prophets of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]; and the [[Chaldea]]ns among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]; and the [[Druids]] among the [[Gauls]]; and the '''[[Sramana]]s''' among the [[Bactrians]] ("Σαρμαναίοι Βάκτρων"); and the philosophers of the [[Celts]]; and the [[Magi]] of the [[Persia]]ns, who foretold the Saviour's birth, and came into the land of [[Judea|Judaea]] guided by a star. The Indian [[gymnosophist]]s are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called '''[[Sramana]]s''' ("Σαρμάναι"), and others [[Brahmins]] ("Βραφμαναι")."'' Clement of Alexandria ''The Stromata, or Miscellanies'' Book I, Chapter XV &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book1.html Clement of Alexandria ''The Stromata, or Miscellanies'' Book I, Chapter XV]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, at the age of 21, he became the first honorary secretary of the Jain Association of India.&lt;ref name=Desai /&gt; During his term, he fought against a tax being levied by the ruler of [[Palitana State|Princely State of Palitana]] on pilgrims visiting [[Mount Shatrunjaya]], [[Palitana]].&lt;ref name="Shah2004" /&gt; During the course of this fight Gandhi met [[Donald Mackay, 11th Lord Reay|Lord Reay]], the British colonial governor of [[Bombay]], and Colonel John Watson of the [[Kathiawar Agency]]. With the help of these two individuals, he ultimately negotiated an annual fixed payment of Rs. 15000, rather than an individual tax on each pilgrim.&lt;ref name="Virachand Gandhi"/&gt; Gandhi also fought to close a pig slaughterhouse that had been started in 1891 close to Mount [[Shikharji]], a holy place of Jain pilgrimage. Gandhi spent six months in [[Calcutta]] learning [[Bengali Language|Bengali]] and preparing his case against the slaughterhouse. He was eventually successful in getting the slaughterhouse closed.&lt;ref name="Shah2004" /&gt;

==Trip to the World Parliament of Religions==
{{See also|Jainism in America}}
Gandhi represented [[Jainism]] at the first [[World Parliament of Religions]], held in Chicago in 1893.&lt;ref name="Shah2004" /&gt;
Jain monk Acharya [[Vijayanandsuri]], also known as Acharya Atmaram, had initially been invited to represent [[Jainism]] at the Parliament, but as Jain monks do not travel overseas, he could not attend. Atmaram recommended Gandhi to go in his stead and serve as the emissary for the religion. Atmaram and his disciple [[Vallabhsuri]] trained Gandhi for six months.&lt;ref name="Shah2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Virachand Gandhi"/&gt;

[[Image:Virchand Gandhi US.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Poster calling Gandhi 'a most eloquent scholar and linguist']]
Gandhi received a positive response at the Parliament&lt;ref name="Shah2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Virachand Gandhi"/&gt; and was asked to deliver more lectures. He ultimately stayed two years in the US and one year in the UK&lt;ref name="Shah2004" /&gt; He went outside India to promote Jain values on two other occasions,&lt;ref name="Shah2004" /&gt; and is known for giving about 535 lectures on Jainism and having attracted followers from outside India to Jainism.&lt;ref name="Shah2004" /&gt; He was awarded various medals for his lectures.&lt;ref name="Shah2004" /&gt;

He was a contemporary to [[Swami Vivekanand]], who deeply admired him. He faced criticism over his sea voyage, which was at the time considered unholy. Vivekanand, impressed with Gandhi's adherence to [[vegetarianism]] in the face of the cold Chicago climate, came to his defence: in an 1894 letter to [[Haridas Viharidas Desai]], Diwan of Junagadh, he wrote "Now here is Virchand Gandhi, the Jain whom you knew well in Bombay. This man never takes anything but mere vegetables even in this terribly cold climate and tooth and nail tries to defend his countrymen and the religion. The people of this country like him very well. But what are they doing who sent him over? They are trying to outcast him.”

Herbert Warren, who studied Jainism under Gandhi and adopted the Jain religion, published a book on Gandhi's lectures titled ''Herbert Warren's Jainism''.

The American newspaper, the ''Buffalo Courier'', wrote regarding Gandhi, "of all Eastern scholars, it was this youth whose lectures on Jain Faith and Conduct was listened to with the greatest interest and attention". Later, in Kasadova, he delivered a lecture on 'Some Mistakes Corrected' on 8 August 1894, which prompted the citizens of the city to award him a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JAINA, VRG Scholarship Brochure|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.jaina.org/resource/resmgr/VRG_Documents/VRG_Scholarship_Brochure_10J.pdf|publisher=JAINA, VRG Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi had studied [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]] Philosophy, Christianity, and western philosophy. He praised Mogul [[Emperor Akbar]] for his equal treatment of all religions.

[[Image:V.A.Gandhi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|From Left to Right – Narasima Charya, Lakshmi Narain, Swami Vivekananda, Hewivitarne Dharmapala, Virachand Raghav Gandhi]]

Gandhi propagated the relevance of Jain tenets and [[Mahavira]]'s message of [[nonviolence]]. He delivered about 535 speeches on Jainism, other religions, and social and cultural lives in India, all of which received wide publication. He was invited two more times, first in 1897, and then in 1899 to the West.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

'''Western Chalukya architecture''' ({{lang-kn|ಪಶ್ಚಿಮ ಚಾಲುಕ್ಯ ವಾಸ್ತುಶಿಲ್ಪ}}), also known as '''Kalyani Chalukya''' or '''Later Chalukya''' architecture, is the distinctive style of ornamented architecture that evolved during the rule of the [[Western Chalukya Empire]] in the [[Tungabhadra]] region of modern central [[Karnataka]], India, during the 11th and 12th centuries. Western Chalukyan political influence was at its peak in the [[Deccan Plateau]] during this period. The centre of cultural and temple-building activity lay in the Tungabhadra region, where large medieval workshops built numerous monuments.&lt;ref name="workshop"&gt;Hardy (1995), p 156&lt;/ref&gt; These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing [[Dravidian architecture|dravida]] (South Indian) temples, form a climax to the wider regional temple architecture tradition called [[Vesara]] or ''Karnata dravida''.&lt;ref name="local"&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Indian Temple Architecture: Form and Transformation, the Karṇāṭa Drāviḍa Tradition, 7th to 13th Centuries'' by Adam Hardy|jstor=3250027|author=Sinha, Ajay J.|journal=Artibus Asiae|volume=58|issue=3/4|date=1999|pages=358–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temples of all sizes built by the Chalukyan architects during this era remain today as examples of the architectural style.&lt;ref name="kardra"&gt;Hardy (1995), pp 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notable of the many buildings dating from this period are the [[Mahadeva Temple (Itagi)|Mahadeva Temple]] at Itagi in the [[Koppal district]], the [[Kasivisvesvara Temple]] at [[Lakkundi]] in the [[Gadag district]], the [[Mallikarjuna Temple, Kuruvatti|Mallikarjuna Temple]] at Kuruvatti in the [[Bellary district]] and the [[Kalleshvara Temple, Bagali|Kallesvara Temple]] at Bagali in the [[Davangere district]].&lt;ref name="hardy_list1"&gt;Hardy (1995), p323, p333, p335, p336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kal"&gt;The [[Mahadeva Temple (Itagi)|Mahadeva Temple]] at Itagi has been called the finest in Kannada country after the [[Hoysaleswara temple]] at Halebidu (Cousens in Kamath (2001), p 117)&lt;/ref&gt; Other monuments notable for their craftsmanship include the [[Kaitabheshvara Temple, Kubatur|Kaitabheshvara Temple]] in Kubatur and [[Kedareshvara Temple, Balligavi|Kedareshvara Temple]] in Balligavi, both in the [[Shimoga district]], the [[Siddhesvara Temple]] at [[Haveri]] in the [[Haveri district]], the Amrtesvara Temple at [[Annigeri]] in the [[Dharwad district]], the Sarasvati Temple in [[Gadag]], and the [[Dodda Basappa Temple]] at [[Dambal]], both in the [[Gadag district]].&lt;ref name="hardy_list2"&gt;Hardy (1995), p321, p326, p327, p330, p335&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving Western Chalukya monuments are temples built in the [[Shaiva]], [[Vaishnava]], and [[Jain]] religious traditions. None of the military, civil, or courtly architecture has survived; being built of mud, brick and wood, such structures may not have withstood repeated invasions.&lt;ref name="mud"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 27&lt;/ref&gt;
The centre of these architectural developments was the region encompassing the present-day [[Dharwad district]]; it included areas of present-day [[Haveri district|Haveri]] and [[Gadag district|Gadag]] districts.&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;Cousens (1926, p 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gad"&gt;Foekema (1996), p 14&lt;/ref&gt; In these districts, about fifty monuments have survived as evidence of the widespread temple building of the Western Chalukyan workshops. The influence of this style extended beyond the [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]] region in the northeast to the [[Bellary]] region in the east and to the [[Mysore]] region in the south. In the [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]]–[[Belgaum]] region to the north, the style was mixed with that of the ''Hemadpanti'' temples. Although a few Western Chalukyan temples can be found in the [[Konkan]] region, the presence of the [[Western Ghats]] probably prevented the style from spreading westwards.&lt;ref name="heart"/&gt;

==Evolution==
[[Image:Siddhesvara Temple Haveri.JPG|right|thumb|Siddhesvara Temple at [[Haveri]], a staggered square plan with ''dravida'' articulation and superstructure, 11th century CE]]

Though the basic plan of the [[Western Chalukya]] style originated from the older ''dravida style'', many of its features were unique and peculiar to it.&lt;ref name="trace"&gt;The original ''dravida'' temple plans had evolved during the 6th and 7th centuries in Karnataka and [[Tamil Nadu]] under the [[Badami Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava]] empires. (Foekema 1996, p 11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trace1"&gt;The development of pure ''dravida'' art was a result of parallel, interrelated developments in the modern [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] regions, within a broader context of South Indian art (Hardy 1995, p 12)&lt;/ref&gt; One of these distinguishing features of the Western Chalukyan architectural style was an [[articulation (architecture)|articulation]] that can still be found throughout modern Karnataka. The only exceptions to this motif can be found in the area around [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]], where the temples exhibit a ''nagara'' (North Indian) articulation which has its own unique character.&lt;ref name="outlook"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the buildings of the early [[Badami Chalukyas]], whose monuments were clustered around the [[metropolis|metropoleis]] of [[Pattadakal]], [[Aihole]], and [[Badami]], these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation.&lt;ref name="workshop"/&gt; The Western Chalukya temples were smaller than those of the early Chalukyas, a fact discernible in the reduced height of the superstructures which tower over the shrines.&lt;ref name="workshop"/&gt;

[[File:View of Vesara tower over shrine in the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mahadeva Temple (Itagi)]] in the [[Koppal district]], 1112 CE, an example of ''dravida'' articulation with a ''nagara'' superstructure]]

The Western Chalukya art evolved in two phases, the first lasting approximately a quarter of a century and the second from the beginning of 11th century until the end of Western Chalukya rule in 1186 [[Common Era|CE]]. During the first phase, temples were built in the [[Aihole]]-[[Banashankari, Bangalore|Banashankari]]-[[Mahakuta]] region (situated in the early [[Chalukya]] heartland) and [[Ron, Karnataka|Ron]] in the [[Gadag district]]. A few provisional workshops built them in Sirval in the [[Gulbarga district]] and [[Gokak]] in the [[Belgaum district]]. The structures at Ron bear similarities to the [[Rashtrakuta]] temples in [[Kuknur]] in the [[Koppal district]] and [[Mudhol]] in the [[Bijapur district, Chhattisgarh|Bijapur district]], evidence that the same workshops continued their activity under the new Karnata dynasty.&lt;ref name="mudhol"&gt;Hardy (1995), p 157&lt;/ref&gt; The mature and latter phase reached its peak at [[Lakkundi]] (Lokigundi), a principal seat of the imperial court.&lt;ref name="jodi"&gt;Hardy (1995), p 158&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-11th century, the artisans from the Lakkundi school moved south of the [[Tungabhadra River]]. Thus the influence of the Lakkundi school can be seen in some of the temples of the [[Davangere district]], and in the temples at Hirehadagalli and Huvinahadgalli in the [[Bellary district]].&lt;ref name="huv"&gt;Hardy (1995), p 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Influences of Western Chalukya architecture can be discerned in the geographically distant schools of architecture of the [[Hoysala Empire]] in southern Karnataka, and the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] in present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="mainstream"&gt;Hardy (1995), p 215&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes called the ''[[Gadag]] style'' of architecture, Western Chalukya architecture is considered a precursor to the [[Hoysala architecture]] of southern Karnataka.&lt;ref name="pre"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 115&lt;/ref&gt; This influence occurred because the early builders employed by the Hoysalas came from pronounced centres of medieval [[Chalukya]] art.&lt;ref name="org"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="build"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage |url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |author=Settar S |publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu |work=Frontline, Volume 20, Issue 08, April 12–25, 2003 |accessdate=2007-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701065442/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |archivedate=1 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further monuments in this style were built not only by the Western Chalukya kings but, also by their feudal vassals.

==Temple complexes==

===Basic layout===
[[File:Amritesvara temple at Annigeri, Dharwad district, Karnataka.jpg|thumb|right|Amrtesvara Temple in Annigeri was built in the [[Dharwad district]] in 1050 CE with ''dravida'' articulation. This was the first temple made of [[soapstone]]]]

A typical Western Chalukya temple may be examined from three aspects – the basic floor plan, the [[Articulation (architecture)|architectural articulation]], and the figure sculptures.

'''The basic floor plan''' is defined by the size of the shrine, the size of the sanctum, the distribution of the building mass, and by the ''[[pradakshina]]'' (path for circumambulation), if there is one.&lt;ref name="decor"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Architectural articulation'''  refers to the ornamental components that give shape to the outer wall of the shrine. These include projections, recesses, and representations that can produce a variety of patterns and outlines, either stepped, stellate (star-shaped), or square.&lt;ref name="wall2"&gt;Foekema (2003), pp 35, 47&lt;/ref&gt; If stepped (also called "stepped diamond of projecting corners"), these components form five or seven projections on each side of the shrine, where all but the central one are projecting corners (projections with two full faces created by two recesses, left and right, that are at right angles with each other). If square (also called "square with simple projections"), these components form three or five projections on a side, only two of which are projecting corners. Stellate patterns form star points which are normally 8-, 16-, or 32-pointed and are sub-divided into interrupted and uninterrupted stellate components. In an 'interrupted' stellate plan, the stellate outline is interrupted by [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] (right-angle) projections in the [[cardinal direction]]s, resulting in star points that have been skipped.&lt;ref name="bidar"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 63&lt;/ref&gt; Two basic kinds of architectural articulation are found in Indian architecture: the southern Indian ''dravida'' and the northern Indian ''nagara''.&lt;ref name="wall"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 42&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Figure sculptures''' are  miniature representations that stand by themselves, including architectural components on pilasters, buildings, sculptures, and complete towers. They are generally categorised as "figure sculpture" or "other decorative features".&lt;ref name="figure"&gt;Foekema (2003), pp 35, 37, 48&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, rich figure sculpture can obscure the articulation of a shrine, when representations of gods, goddesses, and mythical figures are in abundance.&lt;ref name="myth"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categories===
[[Image:Yellamma temple at Badami.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yellamma temple at Badami, early phase construction, 11th century]]
[[File:Open mantapa (hall) in Kalleshvara temple at Bagali 1.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Kalleshvara temple at Bagali (987 CE); Open ''[[mantapa]]'' with ornate pillars, some of which have decorative relief on the pedestal]] 
Chalukyan temples fall into two categories – the first being temples with a common ''mantapa'' (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as ''dvikuta''), and the second being temples with one ''mantapa'' and a single shrine (''ekakuta''). Both kinds of temples have two or more entrances giving access to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, which have a small closed ''mantapa'' leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples which generally have a large, open, columned ''mantapa''.&lt;ref name="porch"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chalukyan architects retained features from both northern and southern styles. However, in the overall arrangement of the main temple and of the subsidiary shrines, they inclined towards the northern style and tended to build one main shrine with four minor shrines, making the structure a ''panchayatna'' or five-shrined complex.&lt;ref name="pancha"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 19&lt;/ref&gt; Chalukyan temples were, almost always, built facing the east.&lt;ref name="multi"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanctum (cella) is connected by a [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] (''ardha mantapa'' or ante-chamber) to the closed ''mantapa'' (also called the ''navaranga''), which is connected to the open ''mantapa''.  Occasionally there can be two or more open ''mantapas''. In Shaiva temples, directly opposite the sanctum and opposite the closed ''mantapa'' is the ''nandi mantapa'', which enshrines a large image of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], the bull attendant of Shiva. The shrine usually has no ''pradakshina''.&lt;ref name="nandi"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The pillars that support the roof of the ''mantapa'' are monolithic shafts from the base up to the neck of the [[capital (architecture)|capital]]. Therefore, the height of the ''mantapa'' and the overall size of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were able to obtain from the quarries.&lt;ref name="pillarette"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 23&lt;/ref&gt; The height of the temple was also constrained by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material.&lt;ref name="pillarette"/&gt;

The absence of mortar allows some ventilation in the innermost parts of the temple through the porous masonry used in the walls and ceilings. The modest amount of light entering the temples comes into the open halls from all directions, while the very subdued illumination in the inner closed ''mantapa'' comes only through its open doorway. The vestibule receives even less light, making it necessary to have some form of artificial lighting (usually, oil lamps) even during the day. This artificial source of light perhaps adds "mystery" to the image of the deity worshipped in the sanctum.&lt;ref name="cememt"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early developments===
[[Image:Inner mantapa with lathe turned pillars in the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi.jpg|thumb|right|Kasivisvesvara Temple, inner closed ''[[mantapa]]'' with polished, bell-shaped, lathe-turned pillars in [[Lakkundi]], 1087 CE]]

From the 11th century, newly incorporated features were either based on the traditional ''dravida'' plan of the Badami Chalukyas, as found in the Virupaksha and Mallikarjuna Temples at [[Pattadakal]], or were further elaborations of this articulation. The new features produced a closer juxtaposition of architectural components, visible as a more crowded decoration, as can be seen in the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district.&lt;ref name="juxta"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pillars at Sarasvati Temple in Gadag.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Full and half Gadag-style pillars at Sarasvati Temple in [[Gadag]]]]

The architects in the Karnataka region seem to have been inspired by architectural developments in northern India. This is evidenced by the fact that they incorporated decorative miniature towers (multi-[[aedicule|aedicular]] towers depicting superstructures) of the ''[[Sekhari (architecture)|Sekhari]]'' and ''[[Bhumija (architecture)|Bhumija]]'' types, supported on pilasters, almost simultaneously with these developments in the temples in northern India. The miniature towers represented shrines, which in turn represented deities. Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon. Other northern ideas they incorporated were the pillar bodies that appeared as wall projections.&lt;ref name="pilaster"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 51&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the Nannesvara Temple, both at Lakkundi.&lt;ref name="lak"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 51, p 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th century, temple projects began employing [[soapstone]], a form of greenish or blueish black stone, although temples such as the Mallikarjuna Temple at [[Sudi]], the Kallesvara Temple at [[Kuknur]], and the temples at Konnur and Savadi were built with the formerly traditional [[sandstone]] in the ''dravida'' articulation.&lt;ref name="juxta" /&gt;

Soapstone is found in abundance in the regions of [[Haveri]], [[Savanur]], [[Byadgi]], [[Motebennur]] and [[Hangal]]. The great archaic sandstone building blocks used by the Badami Chalukyas were superseded with smaller blocks of soapstone and with smaller masonry.&lt;ref name="hangal"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 18&lt;/ref&gt; The first temple to be built from this material was the Amrtesvara Temple in Annigeri in the Dharwad district in 1050 CE.   This building was to be the prototype for later, more articulated structures such as the [[Mahadeva Temple (Itagi)|Mahadeva Temple]] at Itagi.&lt;ref name="sand"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Soapstone was also used for carving, modelling and chiselling of components that could be described as "chubby".&lt;ref name="chub"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, the finish of the architectural components compared to the earlier sandstone temples is much finer, resulting in opulent shapes and creamy decorations.&lt;ref name="rorana"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stepwell|Stepped wells]] are another feature that some of the temples included.&lt;ref name="well"&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent|date=20 September 1996|url=http://www.indoarch.org/place.php?placelink=R%3D5%2BS%3D18%2BP%3D230%2BM%3D1212|author=Kamiya, Takeo|publisher=Gerard da Cunha-Architecture Autonomous, Bardez, Goa, India|work=|accessdate=2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later enhancements===
[[Image:Dodda Basappa temple Stellate plan.JPG|thumb|right|Twenty-four pointed stellate plan of ''[[Shikhara|vimana]]'' of Dodda Basappa Temple in [[Dambal]], 12th century CE]]
The 11-century temple-building boom continued in the 12th century with the addition of new features. The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi and the Siddhesvara Temple in Haveri are standard constructions incorporating these developments. Based on the general plan of the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri, the Mahadeva Temple was built in 1112 CE and has the same architectural components as its predecessor. There are however differences in their articulation; the ''sala'' roof (roof under the [[finial]] of the superstructure) and the miniature towers on [[pilaster]]s are chiseled instead of moulded.&lt;ref name="sala"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 57&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the two temples, built fifty years apart, is the more rigid modelling and decoration found in many components of the Mahadeva Temple. The voluptuous carvings of the 11th century were replaced with a more severe chiselling.&lt;ref name="chisele"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Square floorplan with five projections.svg|thumb|left|Square floorplan with five projections per side of the shrine]]

As developments progressed, the Chalukyan builders modified the pure ''dravida'' tower by reducing the height of each stepped storey and multiplying their number.  From base to top, the succeeding storeys get smaller in circumference and the topmost storey is capped with a crown holding the ''kalasa'', a finial in the shape of a decorative water pot. Each storey is so richly decorated that the original ''dravida'' character becomes almost invisible. In the ''nagara'' tower the architects modified the central panels and niches on each storey, forming a more-or-less continuous vertical band and simulating the vertical bands up the centre of each face of the typical northern style tower.&lt;ref name="hangal" /&gt; Old and new architectural components were juxtaposed but introduced separately.&lt;ref name="sala"/&gt; Some superstructures are essentially a combination of southern ''dravida'' and northern ''nagara'' structures and is termed "[[Vesara]] [[Shikhara]]" (also called [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] Shikhara).&lt;ref name="nandi"/&gt;

The characteristically northern stepped-diamond plan of projecting corners was adopted in temples built with an entirely ''dravida'' articulation.&lt;ref name="chub"/&gt; Four 12th century structures constructed according to this plan are extant: the Basaveshwara Temple at [[Basavana Bagevadi]], the Ramesvara Temple at Devur and the temples at Ingleshwar and Yevur, all in the vicinity of the Kalyani region, where ''nagara'' temples were common. This plan came into existence in northern India only in the 11th century, a sign that architectural ideas traveled fast.&lt;ref name="bij"&gt;Foekema (2003), pp 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stellate plans===
[[Image:32-pointed interrupted stellate floorplan.svg|thumb|right|Thirty-two pointed interrupted stellate floorplan (one side of the shrine)]]

A major development of this period was the appearance of stellate (star-shaped) [[shrine]]s in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed uninterrupted star, a ground-plan not found anywhere else in [[India]] and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of ''bhumija'' shrines in northern India.&lt;ref name="interrupt"&gt;Foekema (2003), pp 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:16-pointed uninterrupted stellate plan of Trimurti Temple in Savadi Gadag district.svg|left|thumb|Sixteen-pointed uninterrupted stellate floorplan (one side of the shrine), Trimurti Temple at Savadi in [[Gadag district]], 11th century CE]]

The stellate plan found popularity in the soapstone constructions such as the Doddabasappa Temple at Dambal as well. Contemporary stellate plans in northern India were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist anywhere in India, with the exception of the unique temple at Dambal, which can be described either as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan, or a 48-pointed plan with large square points of 90 degrees alternating with small short points of 75 degrees.&lt;ref name="degrees"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 60&lt;/ref&gt; The upper tiers of the seven-tiered superstructure look like cogged wheels with 48 dents.&lt;ref name="dent"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 61&lt;/ref&gt; The Doddabasappa Temple and the Someshvara Temple at [[Lakshmeshwar]]a are examples of extreme variants of a basic ''dravida'' articulation. These temples prove that the architects and craftsman were consciously creating new compositions of architectural components out of traditional methods.&lt;ref name="trad"&gt;Foekema (2003), pp 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 13th century, 12th century characteristics remained prominent; however, many parts that were formerly plain became decorated. This change is observed in the Muktesvara Temple at [[Chaudayyadanapura]] (Chavudayyadanapura) and the Santesvara Temple at Tilavalli, both in the Haveri district. The Muktesvara Temple with its elegant ''vimana'' was renovated in the middle of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="elegent"/&gt; In the Tilavalli Temple, all the architectural components are elongated, giving it an intended crowded look. Both temples are built with a ''dravida'' articulation.&lt;ref name="elegent"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 58&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from exotic ''dravida'' articulations, some temples of this period have ''nagara'' articulation, built in the stepped-diamond and the square plan natural to a ''nagara'' superstructure. Notable among temples with a stepped-diamond style are the Ganesha Temple at [[Hangal]], the [[Banashankari Temple, Amargol|Banashankari temple]] at Amargol (which has one ''dravida'' shrine and one ''nagara'' shrine), and a small shrine that is a part of the ensemble at the Mahadeva Temple.&lt;ref name="dent"/&gt; At Hangal, the architects were able to provide a ''sekhari'' superstructure to the shrine, while the lower half received a ''nagara'' articulation and depictions of miniature ''sekhari'' towers. The style of workmanship with a square plan is found at Muttagi and the [[Kamala Narayana Temple]] at Degoan.&lt;ref name="dent"/&gt;

===Kalyani region===
&lt;!--[[Image:Tripurantakesvara Temple Sculpture and Grill work at Balligavi.jpg|thumb|right|Window grill work at Tripurantakesvara Temple in [[Balligavi]], 1070 CE]]--&gt;
[[Image:Stepped Diamond floorplan of Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki in Gulbarga district.svg|thumb|right|Stepped floorplan of Dattatreya Temple (one side of the shrine) with five projections at Chattarki in Gulbarga district, 12th century CE]]
Temples built in and around the Kalyani region (in the [[Bidar district]]) were quite different from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was ''nagara'', and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate.&lt;ref name="bidar"/&gt; The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine.&lt;ref name="bidar" /&gt; Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The ''nagara'' shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side.&lt;ref name="bidar"/&gt; Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations on the rest of the wall pillar have a striking resemblance to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.&lt;ref name="wall100"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The other type is the square plan with simple projections and recesses but with a possibility of both ''sekhari'' and ''bhumija'' superstructures. The plan does not have any additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these ''nagara'' temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the ''dravida'' temples in the north Karnataka region but from the ''nagara'' temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day [[Gulbarga district]].&lt;ref name="wall100"/&gt; The plan and the ''nagara'' articulation of these temples are the same as found to the north of the Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.&lt;ref name="outlook" /&gt;

===Overview===
The Western Chalukya decorative inventiveness focused on the pillars, door panels, lintels (''torana''), domical roofs in bays,&lt;ref name="bay"&gt;A square or rectangular compartment in a hall (Foekema 1996, p 93)&lt;/ref&gt; outer wall decorations such as ''[[Kirtimukha]]'' (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration),&lt;ref name="kirthi"&gt;The face of a monster used as decoration in Hindu temples (Foekema 1996, p 93)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kirti"&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent|date=20 September 1996|url=http://www.indoarch.org/place.php?placelink=R%3D5%2BS%3D18%2BP%3D230%2BM%3D1056|author=Kamiya, Takeo|publisher=Gerard da Cunha-Architecture Autonomous, Bardez, Goa, India|work=|accessdate=2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and miniature towers on pilasters.&lt;ref name="pillarette" /&gt; Although the art form of these artisans does not have any distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed.&lt;ref name="bas"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 20&lt;/ref&gt; The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a [[cornice]] top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders.&lt;ref name="nandi"/&gt; The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the ''dravida'' tiered type, and in the ''nagara'' style they were made in the ''[[Latina (architecture)|latina]]'' (mono aedicule) and its variants; the ''bhumija'' and ''sekhari''.&lt;ref name="bhumi"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vimana===
[[Image:Kirthimukha at Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Kirtimukha]] decoration at Kasivisvesvara Temple at [[Lakkundi]]]]

The [[Jain Temple, Lakkundi]] marked an important step in the development of Western Chalukya outer wall ornamentation, and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting [[eave]] (''chhajja''), used centuries later in [[Vijayanagara architecture|Vijayanagara]] temples.&lt;ref name="pilaster"/&gt; The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches. The artisans used northern style spires and expressed it&lt;!--obscure antecedent--&gt; in a modified ''dravida'' outline. Miniature towers of both ''dravida'' and ''nagara'' types are used as ornamentation on the walls. With further development, the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked, until they almost lost their individuality. This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, where the original ''dravida'' structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental encrustation that covers the surface of each storey.&lt;ref name="pancha" /&gt;

The walls of the ''vimana'' below the ''dravida'' superstructure are decorated with simple pilasters in low relief with boldly modeled sculptures between them. There are fully decorated surfaces with frequent recesses and projections with deeper niches and conventional sculptures.&lt;ref name="bas"/&gt; The decoration of the walls is subdued compared to that of the later Hoysala architecture. The walls, which are broken up into hundreds of projections and recesses, produce a remarkable effect of light and shade,&lt;ref name="bas"/&gt; an artistic vocabulary inherited by the Hoysala builders in the decades that followed.&lt;ref name="hoy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage |url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |author=Settar S |publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu |work=Frontline, Volume 20 – Issue 08, April 12–25, 2003 |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701065442/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |archivedate=1 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:View of ornate pillared hall in Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.jpg|thumb|left|Open ''mantapa'' (hall) at the [[Mahadeva Temple (Itagi)|Mahadeva Temple]] at Itagi, the [[Koppal district]], 1112 CE]]

===Mantapa===
An important feature of Western Chalukya roof art is the use of domical ceilings (not to be confused with the European types that are built of [[voussoir]]s with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive.&lt;ref name="porch" /&gt; The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome.&lt;ref name="porch"/&gt; The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from [[Hindu mythology]].&lt;ref name="porch"/&gt;

[[Image:Sculpture at Siddhesvara temple at Haveri.JPG|150px|upright|thumb|A figure sculpture at Siddhesvara Temple in [[Haveri]], 11th century CE]]

Pillars are a major part of Western Chalukya architecture and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own.&lt;ref name="pillarette" /&gt; Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal.&lt;ref name="pillarette"/&gt; This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.&lt;ref name="gadpillar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Templenet Encyclopedia – Temples of Karnataka, Kalyani Chalukyan temples|url=http://www.templenet.com/Karnataka/kalyani_chalukya.html|author= Kannikeswaran|publisher=webmaster@templenet.com|work=|accessdate=2006-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable in Western Chalukya architecture are the decorative door panels that run along the length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled [[fretwork]], moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door.&lt;ref name="porch"/&gt; The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open ''mantapa''. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars.&lt;ref name="body"/&gt; The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.&lt;ref name="body"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
[[Image:Ornate baluster in Thripuranthakeshwara temple at Balligavi, Shimoga district.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Yali (Hindu mythology)|Yali]]'' [[Baluster|Balustrade]] at Tripurantakesvara Temple, [[Balligavi]], the [[Shivamogga district]]]]

====Figure sculpture====

Figural sculpture on [[frieze]]s and panels changed during the period. The heroes from the Hindu epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], depicted often in early temples, become fewer, limited to only a few narrow friezes; there is a corresponding increase in the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses in later temples.&lt;ref name="sculpt"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 26&lt;/ref&gt; Depiction of deities above miniature towers in the recesses, with a decorative lintel above, is common in 12th-century temples, but not in later ones.&lt;ref name="chisele"/&gt; Figures of holy men and dancing girls were normally sculpted for deep niches and recesses. The use of [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]] figures depicting dancing girls became common on pillars under beams and cornices. Among animal sculptures, the elephant appears more often than the horse: its broad volumes offered fields for  ornamentation.&lt;ref name="sculpt"/&gt; Erotic sculptures are rarely seen in Chalukyan temples; the Tripurantakesvara Temple at [[Balligavi]] is an exception. Here, erotic sculpture is limited to a narrow band of friezes that run around the exterior of the temple.&lt;ref name="eros"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 107&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Figure Sculpture at Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.JPG|thumb|right|Figure sculpture at [[Mahadeva Temple (Itagi)|Mahadeva Temple]] at Itagi, the [[Koppal district]]]]

====Deity sculpture====

In what was a departure from convention, the Western Chalukyan figure sculptures of gods and goddesses bore stiff forms and were repeated over and over in the many temples.&lt;ref name="body"/&gt; This was in contrast to the naturalistic and informal poses employed in the earlier temples in the region.  Barring occasional exaggerations in pose, each principal deity had its own pose depending on the [[incarnation]] or form depicted. Consistent with figure sculpture in other parts of India, these figures were fluent rather than defined in their musculature, and the drapery was reduced to a few visible lines on the body of the image.&lt;ref name="body" /&gt;

Western Chalukyan deity sculptures were well-rendered; exemplified best by that of Hindu goddess [[Sarasvati]] at the Sarasvati temple in Gadag city.&lt;ref name="render"&gt;Cousens (1926), p 78&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the drapery on the bust of the image is ornamentation comprising jewellery made of pearls around her throat. An elaborate pile of curls forms her hair, some of which trails to her shoulders.  Above these curly tresses and behind the head is a tiered [[coronet]] of jewels, the curved edge of which rises to form a halo.&lt;ref name="halo"&gt;Cousens (1926), pp 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; From the waist down, the image is dressed in what seems to be the most delicate of material; except for the pattern of embroidery traced over it, it is difficult to tell where the drapery begins and where it ends.&lt;ref name="drape"&gt;Cousens (1926), pp 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Miniature Tower at Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Miniature decorative ''dravida''-style tower (aedicule) at Siddhesvara Temple in [[Haveri]]]]

====Miniature towers====

From the 11th century, architectural articulation included icons between pilasters, miniature towers supported by pilasters in the recesses of walls, and, on occasion, the use of wall pillars to support these towers.&lt;ref name="pilaster" /&gt; These miniature towers were of the southern ''dravida'' and northern ''bhumija'' and ''sekhari'' types and were mostly used to elaborate ''dravida'' types of articulation. The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral lintel on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction of gods.&lt;ref name="rorana" /&gt; These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri. These miniatures became common in the 12th century, and the influence of this northern articulation is seen in the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi and in the nearby Nannesvara Temple.&lt;ref name="pilaster"/&gt;

The miniature towers bear finer and more elegant details, indicating that architectural ideas traveled fast from the north to the south.&lt;ref name="date"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 53&lt;/ref&gt; Decoration and ornamentation had evolved from a moulded form to a chiseled form, the sharpness sometimes giving it a three-dimensional effect. The foliage decorations changed from bulky to thin, and a change in the miniature towers on dual pilasters is seen. The 11th century miniatures consisted of a cornice (''kapota''), a floor (''vyalamala''), a [[baluster|balustrade]] (''vedika'') and a roof (''kuta'') with a voluptuous moulding, while in the 12th century, detailed ''dravida'' miniature towers with many tiny tiers (''tala'') came into vogue.&lt;ref name="chisele"/&gt; Some 12th-century temples such as the Kallesvara Temple at Hirehadagalli have miniature towers that do not stand on pilasters but instead are supported by balconies, which have niches underneath that normally contain an image of a deity.&lt;ref name="under"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple deities==
{{See also|Western Chalukya temples}}

[[Image:Door jamb and lintel decoration, and Tirthankara image in the sanctum at the Jain temple at Lakkundi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tirthankar|Jaina]] image in sanctum, doorpost and lintel decoration at the [[Jain Temple, Lakkundi]]]]

The Western Chalukyan kings [[Shaiva]]s (worshippers of the Hindu god Shiva) dedicated most of their temples to that God.  They were however tolerant of the Vaishnava or Jain faiths and dedicated some temples to [[Vishnu]] and the Jain [[tirthankaras]] respectively.  There are some cases where temples originally dedicated to one deity were converted to suit another faith. In such cases, the original presiding deity can sometimes still be identified by salient clues. While these temples shared the same [[Western Chalukya architecture#Basic layout|basic plan]] and [[Western Chalukya architecture#Architectural elements|architectural sensibilities]], they differed in some details, such as the visibility and pride of place they afforded the different deities.&lt;ref name="porch"/&gt;

&lt;!--; Sanctum--&gt;
[[Image:Chaturmukha (four faced) Brahma image in the mantapa in the Jain temple at Lakkundi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Chaturmukha'', a four-faced [[Brahma]] image at [[Jain Temple, Lakkundi]], 11th century CE]]

As with all Indian temples, the deity in the sanctum was the most conspicuous indicator of the temple's dedication.  The sanctum ([[Garbhagriha]] or [[cella]]) of a Shaiva temple would contain a Shiva ''[[linga]]'', the universal symbol of the deity.&lt;ref name="linga100"&gt;Foekema (1996), p 93&lt;/ref&gt; An image of Gaja [[Lakshmi]] (consort of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]]) or an image of Vishnu riding on [[Garuda]], or even just the Garuda, signifies a [[Vaishnava]] temple.  Gaja Lakshmi, however, on account of her importance to the [[Kannada]]-speaking regions,&lt;ref name="porch"/&gt; is found on the lintel of the entrance to the [[mantapa]] (pillared hall) in all temples irrespective of faith.
&lt;!--;projecting lintel/doorway--&gt;
The carving on the projecting [[lintel]] on the doorway to the sanctum has the image of a ''linga'' or sometimes of [[Ganapati]] (Ganesha), the son of Shiva in the case of Shaiva temples or of a seated or upright Jain saint ([[Tirthankar]]) in the case of Jain temples.&lt;ref name="porch"/&gt;

The [[sukanasi]] or great arched niche at the base of the superstructure ([[Shikhara]] or tower) also contains an image indicative of the dedicators' sect or faith.&lt;ref name="porch"/&gt; Above the lintel, in a deep and richly wrought [[architrave]] can be found images of the Hindu [[trimurti]] (the Hindu triad of deities) [[Brahma]], Shiva and Vishnu beneath arched rolls of [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]].  Shiva or Vishnu occupies the centre depending on the sect the temple was dedicated to.&lt;ref name="porch"/&gt;

Occasionally, Ganapati and his brother [[Kartikeya]] (Kumara, Subramanya) or the ''[[Shakti|sakti]]s'', the female counterparts, can be found at either end of this carving. Carvings of the river Goddesses [[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]] and [[Yamuna]] are found at either end of the foot of the doorway to the shrine in early temples.&lt;ref name="pillarette" /&gt;

The Western Chalukya dynastic rule ended in the late 12th century, but its architectural legacy was inherited by the temple builders in
southern Karnataka, a region then under the control of the Hoysala empire.&lt;ref name="grow"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp 115, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, [[Hoysala architecture]] is derived from a variant of Western Chalukya architecture
that emerged from the [[Lakshmeshwar]] workshops.&lt;ref name="laks"&gt;Hardy (1995), p 243&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] was the first major project commissioned by Hoysala King [[Vishnuvardhana]] in 1117 CE. This temple best exemplifies the Chalukyan taste the Hoysala artisans inherited.
Avoiding overdecoration, these artists left uncarved spaces where required, although their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, on the outer walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic.&lt;ref name="org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="secular"&gt;
{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage |url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |author=Settar S |publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu |work=Frontline, Volume 20 – Issue 08, April 12–25, 2003 |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701065442/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |archivedate=1 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started in the middle of the 11th century with Chalukyan temples.&lt;ref name="juxta" /&gt; Other common artistic features between the two [[Kanarese]] dynasties are the ornate ''[[Salabhanjika]]'' (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the [[Yalli (motif)|makara]] [[torana]] (lintel with mythical beastly figure).&lt;ref name="org"/&gt; The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.&lt;ref name="towwr"&gt;Sastri (1955), p 427&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was in power in the 15th and 16th centuries, its workshops preferred granite over soapstone as the building material for temples. However, an archaeological discovery within the royal center at [[Vijayanagara]] has revealed the use of soapstone for stepped wells. These stepped wells are fashioned entirely of finely finished soapstone arranged symmetrically, with steps and landings descending to the water on four sides. This design shows strong affinities to the temple tanks of the Western Chalukya–Hoysala period.&lt;ref name="affinity"&gt;Davison–Jenkins (2001), p 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Badami Chalukyan temples featured in detailed studies by Henry Cousens (1927), Gary Tartakov (1969) and George Michell (1975), Western Chalukyan architecture suffered neglect despite its importance and wider use. Recently however, scholars have returned to the modern Karnataka region to focus on a longer chronology, investigating a larger geographical area, making detailed studies of [[Epigraphy|epigraph]]s and giving more importance to individual monuments dating from the 11th through 13th centuries.&lt;ref name="local"/&gt;

The first detailed study of Western Chalukya architecture was by M.A. Dhaky (1977), who used as a starting point two medieval epigraphs that claimed the architects were masters of various temple forms. This study focused in particular on the riches of the Western Chalukya miniature wall shrines (aedicules). An important insight gained from this work was that the architects of the region learned about temple forms from other regions. These forms to them appeared "exotic", but they learned to reproduce them with more or less mastery, depending on the extent of their familiarity with the other regions' building traditions.&lt;ref name="tradition"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 12&lt;/ref&gt; This conscious [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] attempt to freely use elements from other regions in India was pointed out by Sinha (1993) as well.&lt;ref name="eclectic"&gt;Foekema (2003), p 31&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminal work by Adam Hardy (1995) examined the Karnataka temple-building tradition over a period of 700&amp;nbsp;years, from the 7th century to the 13th century, and reviewed more than 200&amp;nbsp;temples built by four dynasties; Badami Chalukya, [[Rashtrakuta]], Western Chalukya and Hoysala. The study covered ''dravida'' and ''nagara'' style monuments and the differences between the ''dravida'' tradition in modern Karnataka and that of neighbouring Tamil Nadu and made it possible to interpret the many architectural details as part of a larger scheme.&lt;ref name="local"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eclectic"/&gt;

The temples and epigraphs of the Western Chalukyas are protected by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] and the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums–Government of Karnataka.&lt;ref name="protect"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alphabetical list of Monuments|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_alphalist_karnataka.asp|author=|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India|work=Protected Monuments|accessdate=2007-06-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808023916/http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_alphalist_karnataka.asp|archivedate=8 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of Monuments in Karnataka|url=http://kannadasiri.kar.nic.in/archaeology/eng/dirmon.htm

The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi dedicated to Shiva is among the larger temples built by the Western Chalukyas and perhaps the most famous.  Inscriptions hail it as the 'Emperor among temples'.&lt;ref name="emperor"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the main temple, the sanctum of which has a ''linga'', is surrounded by thirteen minor shrines, each with its own ''linga''. The temple has two other shrines, dedicated to Murthinarayana and Chandraleshwari, parents of Mahadeva, the Chalukya commander who consecrated the temple in 1112 CE.&lt;ref name="parent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emperor of Temples' crying for attention|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/06/10/stories/2002061003760500.htm|author=Rao, Kishan|publisher=The Hindu|date=10 June 2002|work=|accessdate=2007-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128010619/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/06/10/stories/2002061003760500.htm|archive-date=28 November 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Siddheshwara temple in the Haveri district has sculptures of deities of multiple faiths. The temple may have been consecrated first as a Vaishnava temple, later taken over by Jains and eventually becoming a Shaiva temple.&lt;ref name="multi" /&gt; The hall in the temple contains sculptures of ''Uma Mahesvara'' (Shiva with his consort [[Parvati|Uma]]), Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, [[Surya]] (the sun god), Naga-Nagini (the snake goddess), and the sons of Shiva, Ganapati and Kartikeya. Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the ''damaru'' (drum), the ''aksamala'' (chain of beads) and the ''[[trishula|trishul]]'' (trident) in three arms. His lower left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him with her right arm while gazing into his face. The sculpture of Uma is well decorated with garlands, large earrings and curly hair.&lt;ref name="uma"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sculptures from the Later Calukyan Temple at Haveri|jstor=3249429|author=Rao, Nagaraja M.S-Artibus Asiae Publishers|journal=Artibus Asiae, Vol. 31, No. 2/3 (1969), pp. 167–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some temples, in a departure from the norm, were dedicated to deities other than Shiva or Vishnu. These include the Surya (portrayed as '[[Narayana|Suryanarayana]]') shrine at the Kasi Vishveshwara temple complex and a Jain temple dedicated to [[Mahavira]], both at Lakkundi; the Taradevi temple (built in a Buddhist architectural style) at Dambal in the Gadag district; the Mahamaya temple dedicated to a [[Tantra|tantric]] goddess at Kuknur in the Koppal district, and the [[Durga]] temple at [[Hirekerur]] in the Haveri district.&lt;ref name="tantric"&gt;{{cite web|title=Templenet Encyclopedia, The Ultimate Source of Information on Indian Temples|url=http://www.indiantemples.com/Karnataka/kalyani_chalukya.html|author=K.
