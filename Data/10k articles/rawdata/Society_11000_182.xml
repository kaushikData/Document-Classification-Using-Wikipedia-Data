The '''Harvard-Navy lacrosse game of 1941''' was an [[college lacrosse|intercollegiate lacrosse]] game played in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], between the [[Harvard Crimson men's lacrosse|Harvard University Crimson]] and the [[Navy Midshipmen men's lacrosse|United States Naval Academy Midshipmen]] on April 4, 1941. Before the game, the Naval Academy's [[List of Superintendents of the United States Naval Academy|superintendent]] told Harvard that the Navy team would not play against a racially integrated team. Harvard's one [[African-American|black]] player, Lucien Alexis Jr. of New Orleans, left of his own accord after Harvard's athletic director told Harvard's coach to send him home. Harvard's players, supported by their coach, had voted to forfeit the game rather than play without him. The game went on as scheduled. Both Harvard's and the Naval Academy's administrations were criticized for their actions.

==Game==
On April 3, 1941, the Harvard lacrosse team's 18 players arrived at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], to play the Naval Academy in a scheduled intercollegiate match. That day, the Naval Academy's superintendent, Rear Admiral [[Russell Willson]] discovered that Harvard's team included one black player, Lucien Alexis Jr. He informed Harvard's coach, Dick Snibbe, and athletic director, [[William J. Bingham]], that Navy's squad would not play against a racially integrated team.&lt;ref&gt;Gup, Doan, Fisher, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angry at the Naval Academy's stance, Snibbe and Alexis' teammates elected to forfeit the game and return to Harvard. Bingham intervened and ordered the Harvard coach to send Alexis home and play the game. Learning of Bingham's directive, Alexis voluntarily decided to depart and told his teammates that it was his idea. The game was played as scheduled the next day and Navy won 12-0.&lt;ref&gt;Gup, Doan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Harvard's student newspaper, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', learned of the incident and sharply criticized Bingham and Harvard's administration. The newspaper said of the incident:&lt;ref name="Fisher, p. 133"&gt;Fisher, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Those officials here who asked the negro to return to college should explain the reasons for their actions by which Harvard has [[Kowtow|kow-towed]] to [[Jim Crow laws|Jim-Crowism]]. Navy bigwigs should also be taught that when this country, this college and the navy itself declare their faith in democratic equality, they mean to practice what they preach.}}
In response Bingham said: "We were guests of the Naval Academy and had no choice in the matter. Had the game been played at Cambridge, I would have insisted that he be allowed to participate."&lt;ref name="Fisher, p. 133"/&gt;

Newspapers in [[Boston]] and [[New York City]] picked up the story and criticized Harvard's and the Naval Academy's administrations for their actions. The [[Harvard Council for Democracy in Education]] complained to U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] about USNA's actions in the incident. The [[Harvard Corporation]] told Bingham and the Harvard Athletic Association to inform all future sports competitors that the school would not tolerate further racial discrimination against its student athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Gup, Doan, Fisher, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

One week after the incident, Alexis and the rest of Harvard's lacrosse team traveled to [[West Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to play a game against the [[United States Military Academy]]. In contrast to the reception the Navy had given Harvard's team, at West Point a cordon of cheering [[cadet]]s, led by black cadets attending the academy, welcomed Alexis and his team.&lt;ref&gt;Doan&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] counts this incident among several that pressured President Roosevelt, in June 1941, to sign [[Executive Order 8802]] that prohibited [[racial discrimination]] in the defense industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodwin |first1=Doris Kearns|title=No Ordinary Time: Franklin &amp; Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II|date=1994 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=NY|pages=249ff.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hfv-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp; |accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Danelo&gt;Danelo, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later events==
In 1949 [[Wesley A. Brown]] was the first black student to graduate from the Naval Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Gup&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, 2008, a dedication ceremony was held on the Naval Academy campus for its newest building, the [[Wesley Brown Field House]], named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rucker |first=Philip |title=Facility Dedicated to Black Pioneer: D.C.

Mike Mullen, Naval Academy Superintendent Vice Adm. Jeffrey L. Fowler, and Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. Also present were almost one thousand guests.

Lucien Victor Alexis (1887-1981), Harvard '17, was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the US Army and later became the principal of the only black high school in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creolegen.org/2014/05/05/the-negro-einstein/ "The Negro Einstein"], CreoleGen, 5 May 2014, accessed 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Class of 1918: ''Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Report'' (1943), Harvard University Archives; ''Orleans Parish School Board Minutes 9/23/1921, p.467 and 9/14/1923, p.336 (University of New Orleans)&lt;/ref&gt; His son Lucien Victor Alexis, Jr. graduated from Harvard in turn and went into the service in World War II. After his return, he got a degree from [[Harvard Business School]]. He later served as head of a New Orleans business college for black students, segregated by state law. He married and had children. He died in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/11/17/class-report Roger Angell, "Class Report"], ''The New Yorker'', 17 November 2008, accessed 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter [[Lurita Alexis Doan]] became an entrepreneur, owning her own business from 1990 to 2005, and approved as the first woman and second African American to serve as Administrator of the [[General Services Administration]] (2006 to 2008), during the administration of President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="Senate confirms FEMA, GSA chiefs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0506/052606d2.htm  |title=Senate confirms FEMA, GSA chiefs |date=May 26, 2006

'''Albanians in Serbia''' ({{lang-al|Shqiptarët në Serbi}}; {{lang-sr|Албанци у Србији / Albanci u Srbiji}}) are an officially recognized [[ethnic minority]] living in the present-day country of [[Serbia]].

==Geography==
In the municipalities of [[Preševo]] and [[Bujanovac]] Albanians form the majority of population (89.1% in Preševo and 54.69% in Bujanovac according to the 2002 census). In the municipality of Medveđa, Albanians are second largest ethnic group (after [[Serbs]]), and their participation in this municipality was 32% in 1981 census, 28.67% in 1991 and 26.17% in 2002.&lt;ref name=popis&gt;{{cite book|title=Popis stanovništva, domaćinstava i Stanova 2002. Knjiga 1: Nacionalna ili etnička pripadnost po naseljima|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia|language=Serbian|year=2003|isbn=86-84433-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region of Bujanovac and Preševo is widely known as the [[Preševo Valley]] (Serbian: Прешевска Долина, ''Preševska Dolina'', Albanian: ''Lugina e Preshevës'').

There is a small community of Albanians in the [[Pešter]] region of [[Sandžak]] living in villages such as Boroštica, Doliće and Ugao.&lt;ref name = Pieroni/&gt; For the past two generations these villages have become partly ''bosniakicised'', due to intermarriage with the surrounding [[Bosniaks of Serbia|Bosniak]] population.&lt;ref name = Pieroni/&gt; As such and also due to the Yugoslav wars and thereafter, they have opted to declare themselves in censuses as "[[Muslims by ethnicity|Muslims]]"  and "Bosniaks" instead of as Albanians to avoid problems.&lt;ref name = Pieroni/&gt; Elders in these villages are still fluent in Albanian.&lt;ref name = Pieroni&gt;Andrea Pieroni, Maria Elena Giusti, &amp; Cassandra L. Quave (2011). "Cross-cultural ethnobiology in the Western Balkans: medical ethnobotany and ethnozoology among Albanians and Serbs in the Pešter Plateau, Sandžak, South-Western Serbia." ''Human Ecology''. '''39'''.(3): 335. "The current population of the Albanian villages is partly “bosniakicised”, since in the last two generations a number of Albanian males began to intermarry with (Muslim) Bosniak women of Pešter. This is one of the reasons why locals in Ugao were declared to be “Bosniaks” in the last census of 2002, or, in Boroštica, to be simply “Muslims”, and in both cases abandoning the previous ethnic label of “Albanians”, which these villages used in the census conducted during “Yugoslavian” times. A number of our informants confirmed that the self-attribution “Albanian” was purposely abandoned in order to avoid problems following the Yugoslav Wars and associated violent incursions of Serbian para-military forces in the area. The oldest generation of the villagers however are still fluent in a dialect of Ghegh Albanian, which appears to have been neglected by European linguists thus far. Additionally, the presence of an Albanian minority in this area has never been brought to the attention of international stakeholders by either the former Yugoslav or the current Serbian authorities."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1992, the Albanian representatives in the municipalities Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac organized a referendum in which they voted for the joining of these municipalities to the self-declared assembly of the [[Republic of Kosova]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pashtriku.beepworld.de/kosovalindore.htm organized a referendum in which they voted that Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac should join Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt; However, no major events happened until the end of the 1990s.

Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], and nearby [[Kosovo War]] which lasted until 1999, between 1999 and 2001, an ethnic Albanian [[paramilitary]] separatist organization, the [[Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac|UÇPMB]], raised an armed [[insurgency in the Preševo Valley]], in the region mostly inhabited by Albanians, with a goal to occupy these three municipalities from Serbia and join them to (future independent) Kosovo.

Unlike in the case of Kosovo, western countries condemned the attacks and described it as the "extremism" and use of "illegal terrorist actions" by the group.&lt;ref name="Staf2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=European Centre for Minority Issues Staf|title=European Yearbook of Minority Issues: 2001/2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rkz7lvqGpDkC&amp;pg=PA652|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-411-1956-6|pages=652–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milošević]], the new Serbian government suppressed the violence by 2001 and defeated the separatists. [[NATO]] troops also helped the Serbian government by ensuring that the rebels do not import the conflicts back into Kosovo, and even supported Serbia's military suppression of Albanians in their country, as an act to restore the relations with Serbia after 1999 bombing. This has left a dark chapter on Albania's relations with NATO, although Albania later joined the organization.

Since then, the [[Albanian Coalition from Preševo Valley]] has gained representation in the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] where it holds two seats. In 2009, Serbia opened a military base [[Cepotina]] 5 kilometers south of Bujanovac, to further stabilize the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Otvorena baza na jugu Srbije|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=23&amp;nav_id=394131|accessdate=6 March 2017|work=b92.net|agency=Beta|date=23 November 2009|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2017, the [[President of Albania]] [[Bujar Nishani]] made a historical visit to the municipalities of Preševo and Bujanovac, in which Albanians form the ethnic majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Musliu: Albanski predsednik Bujar Nišani posetiće 7. marta Bujanovac i Preševo|url=http://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/musliu-albanski-predsednik-bujar-nisani-posetice-7-marta-bujanovac-i-presevo/k5khx8q|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=blic.rs|agency=Beta|date=3 March 2017|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Education in Albanian is provided for primary and secondary schools. There may be some university-level courses provided in Albanian, in the capital of Serbia, [[Belgrade]], but students mainly do their university degree in the [[Universiteti i Prishtinës|University of Prishtina]] in the Republic of Kosovo, in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], or in [[Albania]]n Universities.

The main religion of Albanians in this region is [[Islam]]. Prior to the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion of the Balkans]], the population of the Preševo Valley was mostly [[Roman Catholic]]. There are still Catholic churches in the Karadak villages, located in Kosovo today.

According to the results of the 2002 census, there were 61,467 ethnic Albanian citizens. Most Albanians boycotted the 2011 census, which resulted in only 5,809 Albanians being recorded as living in Serbia.&lt;ref name="popis2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.popis2011.stat.rs/2012/Nacionalna%20pripadnost-Ethnicity.pdf|title=2011 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in the Republic of Serbia: Ethnicity|date=2012|location=Belgrade|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, [[Belgrade]] has a minor Albanian community. In the census of 1981, 8,212 Albanians were registered. In 1991 there lived only 4,985 Albanians in Belgrade. After the [[Kosovo War]], this number decreased to 1,492, and according to the latest census (2011), the number is 1,252.

{{italic title}}
'''''An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy''''' is a 1944 study of [[race relations]] authored by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel-laureate]] [[economist]] [[Gunnar Myrdal]] and funded by [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]]. The foundation chose Myrdal because it thought that as a non-American, he could offer a more unbiased opinion. Myrdal's volume, at nearly 1,500 pages, painstakingly detailed what he saw as obstacles to full participation in American society that American [[Negro]]es faced as of the 1940s. [[Ralph Bunche]] served as Gunnar Myrdal's main researcher and writer at the start of the project in the Fall of 1938.&lt;ref name=racebeat&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Gene Roberts (journalist)|Roberts, Gene]] and [[Hank Klibanoff]] | title = [[The Race Beat|The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle, and the Awakening of a Nation]] | publisher = [[Alfred A. Knopf]] | place = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-679-40381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It sold over 100,000 copies and went through 25 printings before going into its second edition in 1965. It was enormously influential in how racial issues were viewed in the United States, and it was cited in the landmark ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' case "in general".  The book was generally positive in its outlook on the future of race relations in America, taking the view that [[democracy]] would triumph over [[racism]]. In many ways it laid the groundwork for future policies of [[racial integration]] and [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref name=racebeat /&gt;

== Analysis ==
Myrdal believed he saw a vicious cycle in which whites oppressed Negroes, and then pointed to Negroes' poor performance as reason for the oppression. The way out of this cycle, he argued, was to either cure whites of the prejudice he believed existed, or to improve the circumstances of Negroes, which would then disprove whites' preconceived notions. Myrdal called this process the "principle of cumulation".

In ''Black-White Relations: The American Dilemma'', economist Junfu Zhang gives this description of Myrdal's work:

{{quote|According to Myrdal, the American dilemma of his time referred to the co-existence of the American liberal ideals and the miserable situation of blacks. On the one hand, enshrined in the American creed is the belief that people are created equal and have human rights; on the other hand, blacks, as one tenth of the population, were treated as an inferior race and were denied numerous civil and political rights. Myrdal's encyclopedic study covers every aspect of black-white relations in the United States up to his time. He frankly concluded that the "Negro problem" is a "white man's problem". That is, whites as a collective were responsible for the disadvantageous situation in which blacks were trapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang, Junfu | title = Black-White Relations: The American Dilemma | journal = Perspectives | publisher = Overseas Young Chinese Forum | volume = 1 | number = 4 | date = February 2000}}  [http://www.oycf.org/Perspectives2/4_022900/black_white.htm (available online)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Myrdal, writing before the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, alleged that northern whites were generally ignorant of the situation facing Negro citizens, and noted that "to get publicity is of the highest strategic importance to the Negro people". This proved, given the pivotal role played by the press in the movement, to be strikingly prescient.&lt;ref name=racebeat /&gt;

== American Creed ==
At the center of Myrdal's work in ''An American Dilemma'' was his postulate that political and social interaction in the United States is shaped by an "American Creed". This creed emphasizes the ideals of individualism, civil liberties, and equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name=racebeat /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myrdal, Gunnar (1944). ''An American dilemma: The negro problem and modern democracy''. New York: Harper &amp; Bros.&lt;/ref&gt;  Myrdal claims that it is the "American Creed" that keeps the diverse melting pot of the United States together.  It is the common belief in this creed that endows all people—whites, negroes, rich, poor, male, female, and immigrants alike—with a common cause and allows for them to co-exist as one nation.&lt;ref name=racebeat /&gt;

'''Baloch people in the United Arab Emirates''' comprise residents of the [[United Arab Emirates]] whose ancestral roots lie in [[Balochistan]]. The Baloch are one of the oldest migrant groups in the country.&lt;ref name="KT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/inside.asp?xfile=/data/community/2012/July/community_July3.xml&amp;section=community|title=Information desk for Pak Baloch community|work=Khaleej Times|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total population of the community is up to 468,000.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

Due to the proximity between both regions, Baloch settlers have been in contact with the Persian Gulf since centuries. The Baloch are mentioned in Arabic chronicles dating back to the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Etheredge"/&gt; The majority of Baloch migrants originate from the southern [[Makran]] coast.&lt;ref name="GN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/tourism/sharjah-balochistan-flights-to-start-in-may-1.234248|title=Sharjah-Balochistan flights to start in May|work=Gulf News|date=25 April 2006|accessdate=23 July 2016|first=Nissar|last=Hoath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baloch who resided in the [[Trucial States]] prior to 1925 or before the formation of the union were offered the [[Emirati nationality law|Emirati citizenship]] as per Article 17 of the United Arab Emirates Citizenship and Passport Law of Year 1972.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc-legal.org/LawAsPDF.aspx?opt&amp;country=0&amp;LawID=3147#Section_6582 |title=UAE Citizenship and Passport Law of Year 1972, Article 17 |accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surname '''Bayat''' or '''Baiyat''' is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] clan name.

==Clans==

Bayat is the name of an originally [[Oghuz Turks|Turkic clan]] in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Iran which traces its origin to the 12th century. When Bayat clan started to migrate from the [[Kazakh Steppe|Aral steppes]], their first destination was the city of [[Neyshabur|Nishapur]] in the south of [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], a state in the north-east of [[Iran]]. The Bayat clan moved in the 13th century to three different locations after attacks by Mongol forces.

The Bayat clan made war with the [[Mongols]], killing [[Genghis Khan]]'s son-in-law with his army. Then Khan attacked Nishapur with all his forces, killing many Bayat clansmen, and the rest of the Bayat clan escaped to the mountains around Nishapur.

From there, one group went east and north-east, so that the surname Bayat is still found in [[Afghanistan]].{{cn|date=June 2015}} A second group went south-west towards Isfahan, and the surname Bayat is prominent in [[Arak, Iran|Arak]], [[Hamedan]], [[Malayer]], [[Isfahan]], [[Zanjan, Iran|Zanjan]] and [[Shiraz]]. The third group went north-west, and in [[Azerbaijan]] they divided in two; one part of the group took the west to [[Turkey|Anatolia]], and second part went south into [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].

Bayat was the name of one of the 24 [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz Turkish clans]] purported to descend from [[Oghuz Khaqan]] according to [[Oghuzname]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the oral legends prior to the writing of that book in the early 14th century. It is also the name of several localities and persons connected to the legend. In [[Afghanistan]], the clan is known to have who originally emigrated into the country with [[Nader Shah]].{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Notable figures from this clan include:{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
* Ata Korkut, legendary figure of the Oghuz
* [[Fuzûlî]], famous [[Azeri]] poet of Ottoman era

==People with the name Bayat==

Bayat is a common surname today in [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]] and to a lesser extent in [[Turkey]], [[Afghanistan]],{{cn|date=June 2015}} and [[Turkmenistan]] where it carries the meaning "Knight" or "Chevalier".

Notable people with his name include:
* [[Abbas Bayat]] (born 1947), Iranian businessman
* [[Asef Bayat]], Iranian professor of sociology
* [[Ehsan Bayat]], Afghan-American entrepreneur, owner of [[Ariana Television Network]] and founder of the Bayat Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/Asia/2526.cfm The Bayat Foundation - Making a Difference in Afghanistan]. October 18, 2006. WorldPress.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Morteza Gholi Bayat]] (1890–1958), former Prime Minister of Iran

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11053">{{Bisexuality topics sidebar}}'''Bisexual chic''' is a phrase used to describe the public acknowledgment of  [[bisexuality]] or increased public interest or acceptance of bisexuality. Another usage describes a [[fad]]dish attention towards bisexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/gayrights/story/0,12592,1115656,00.html US girls embrace gay passion fashion, The Observer, by Richard Luscombe, January 4, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Bisexual chic is often accompanied by celebrities publicly revealing their bisexuality.

==Origin of term==
In the United States, the 1920s was a decade of social experimentation, particularly with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], who theorized that people would behave in any manner to satisfy sexual desire. With the well-publicized image that sexual acts were a part of lesbian women and relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, Lillian (1991). Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth Century America, Penguin Books. pg63-67; {{ISBN|0-14-017122-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase itself came into wide usage in the 1970s, on the tail end of the [[hippie]] movement, which extolled [[free love]]. During the [[glam rock]] and disco era, there was a media-generated fascination with bisexuality in the [[club scene]] and among musicians such as [[Elton John]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Patti Smith]]; in fact, in 1980, ''[[TIME|Time]]'' magazine referred to Bowie's persona [[David Bowie#Ziggy Stardust|Ziggy Stardust]] as "the orange-haired founder of bisexual chic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920940-2,00.html Time magazine], Monday, Aug. 04, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bisexuality in the United States: A Social Science Reader''
by Paula Claire Rust, 2000, pg 538&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, bisexual groups formed in several large [[United States|US]] cities, heralding the birth of the modern bisexual [[civil rights]] and [[liberation movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.binetusa.org/bihistory2.html A Brief History of the Bisexual Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase can be used to imply someone is only pretending to be bisexual because it’s fashionable at the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/bicent.htm San Francisco's Bisexual Center and the Emergence of a Bisexual Movement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403194900/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/bicent.htm |date=April 3, 2007 }} by Jay P. Paul&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, it can be used to assert that someone is free of taboos, experimental, in touch with both masculine and feminine aspects of themselves, and therefore potentially a better lover or even a better person.&lt;ref&gt;''Sex in Public: Australian Sexual Cultures'' by Jill Julius. Matthews; 1997, pg 75&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergence ==
Though the terminology is attributed to the 1970s, a bisexual trend occurred in the 1920s.  In ''Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life'', [[Marjorie Garber]] argues "the twenties has been linked to the popularization of Freud (or "[[Freudianism]]"), the advent of World War I, and a general predilection for the daring and unconventional: [[bobbed hair]], short skirts, the rejection of [[Prohibition]] and [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] strictures."  Examples of this include [[drag balls]], and the success of artists such as [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Marlene Dietrich]].&lt;ref name="Garber, Marjorie B. 1995"&gt;{{cite book |author=Garber, Marjorie B. |authorlink=Marjorie Garber |title=Vice versa: bisexuality and the eroticism of everyday life |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-684-80308-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking back from the 70s, writer [[Elaine Showalter]] accused Woolf and the [[Bloomsbury Group]] of bisexual chic when she warned Woolf and her friends of indulging "the fashion of bisexuality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Showalter]], A Literature of Their Own: British Women Novelists from Bronte to Lessing (Princeton University Press, 1977), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

== From 1970s onwards ==
After a strain of social movements centred on LGBT rights like the [[Stonewall riots|Stone Wall Riots]] in 1969, from 1970s onwards, awareness of bisexuality was on the rise and non-conforming sexual behaviors were seen as an act of social defiance. In 1972, the hit musical film  ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' featured a love triangle with a man and woman fighting for the same (male) lover. The author who inspired it, [[Christopher Isherwood]], was among the first openly homosexual celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/literature/isherwood_c.html Christopher Isherwood on GLBTQ.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104004742/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/isherwood_c.html |date=January 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent cultural representations of the 1970s include ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' and  ''[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)]]''. In the 90s, under the influences of the contemporary [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] subculture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.micar.com/origins-of-the-hipster/|title=Where Did the Hipster Come From?|last=Digital|first=Andy Simpson @ Thunderbolt|date=2015-08-06|website=Micar Apparel Software|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which symbolizes the resistance against mainstream lifestyle and encourages unconventionalities, more and more people started to speculate about their own identity as well as sexuality.

The phenomenon of bisexual chic can also be attributed to the growing number celebrities disclosing their bisexual identity. For example, in 1995, the lead vocalist of punk rock band [[Green Day]] [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] came out as bisexual in an interview with [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2010/03/14/billie-joe-armstrong-idiot-savant|title=Billie Joe Armstrong: Idiot Savant|date=2010-03-15|website=www.out.com|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the media, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s music videos for  "[[Justify My Love]]" and "[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]" and her book "[[Sex (book)|Sex]]" featured same-sex eroticism. Openly bisexual comedian [[Sandra Bernhard]] was featured as a bisexual on the popular television sitcom [[Roseanne]] amidst the trend. To illustrate the trend, Roseanne later found herself kissed by another woman and was "consoled" by Bernhard's character, bringing bisexuality to Middle America. (''See Also: [[Lesbian kiss episode]]s'') The 1992 film ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' featured a glamorous bisexual murderess played by [[Sharon Stone]]. Mainstream singer [[Janet Jackson]] recorded a [[cover version]] of [[Rod Stewart]]'s "[[Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)]]" in which she sings to a woman with whom she is about to engage in a ''[[ménage à trois]]'', saying, ''"This is just between me... and you... and you....".''

In the 21st century, bisexuality (or manifestations thereof) was alluded to in the films ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'', ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'', ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', ''[[Kinsey (film)|Kinsey]]'', and ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', in the television series ''[[The O.C.]]'' in the US and ''[[Torchwood]]'' in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2006430699,00.html|title=Dr Ooh gets four gay pals|authorlink=|date=September 2006|publisher=The Sun|quote=GAY Doctor Who star John Barrowman gets four BISEXUAL assistants in raunchy BBC3 spin-off Torchwood.|accessdate=2006-10-06|author=Sarah Nathan|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Lady Gaga's music videos for "[[Lovegame|LoveGame]]" and "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]". In the 2003 [[MTV Video Music Award]]s,  [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] kissed [[Britney Spears]] and then [[Christina Aguilera]]; many news and tabloid outsources referred to it as "lesbian chic".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1477729/20030828/spears_britney.jhtml?headlines=true&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://extratv.warnerbros.com/dailynews/extra/09_03/09_02c.html&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 hit song "[[I Kissed a Girl]]" by [[Katy Perry]] had bicurious lyrics. According to surveys by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] in the USA, a larger number of female college and high school students in America are experimenting with other women than ever before and, in a surprising twist, actually report being encouraged to do so by pop culture for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9358339 More women experimenting with bisexuality] from [[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Despite the visibility and acceptance of bisexuality brought by the effects of bisexual chic, this phenomenon has been criticised for its "trendy" property rather than a genuine act of advocating bisexual equality. The idea of bisexuality being chic is also detrimental to the bisexual movement as "faux bisexuality" gives bad credits to bisexual people that their sexuality is only a form of art, not a real sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedebrief.co.uk/news/real-life/why-all-these-public-displays-of-faux-lesbianism-need-to-stop-20140713768|title=Why All These Public Displays Of Faux-Lesbianism Need To Stop|website=The Debrief|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also misleads people who are [[bi-curious]], which means questioning their attraction to both sexes and possibly end up being [[Monosexuality|monosexual]], to identify with being bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hercampus.com/school/georgia-southern/bi-curious-vs-bisexual-do-some-girls-really-girls-or-attention|title=Bi-curious vs Bisexual.

The '''Bumiputera''' or '''Bumiputra''' (from the [[Sanskrit]] word 'Bhumiputra' (भूमिपुत्र), which roughly translated means 'sons of the soil')&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Graham (1994).''A History of Brunei'', p.192. Oxford University Press, Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/ref&gt; also referred as '''Melayu Jati'''&lt;ref&gt;http://berita-utama.971100.n3.nabble.com/Pupuk-usaha-pelihara-warisan-budaya-Melayu-td4024269.html&lt;/ref&gt; ("Indigenous Malays") in [[Brunei]] is the term used to refer to a member of majority [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[ethnic group]] and members of certain native groups as outlined below.

==Definition==
The [[Brunei]] [[Constitution]] defines a '''Bumiputera''' as a member of the following ethnic groups:
[[Bruneian Malay people|Bruneian Malay]],
[[Tutong people|Tutong]],
[[Belait people|Belait]],
[[Dusun people|Dusun]],
[[Murut people|Murut]],
[[Kedayan]], and
[[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]].

Other indigenous peoples (e.g. [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Kelabit people|Kelabit]] and [[Penan]]) are not defined as being Bumiputera by the Brunei constitution, nor are citizens who are of ethnic-Chinese, Indians or of Caucasian ancestry.  Race is patrilineally defined in Brunei, so, for example, a half-Chinese man with an ethnic Dusun father is considered to be Bumiputera.

This is different from the definition in Malaysia where a larger number of races and ethnic groups are considered as [[Bumiputra]]. The Malaysian Constitution does not actually provide a definition of the term, which has led to some controversy concerning its relation to the indigenous groups in that country. See [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)]]. Constitutional references to Bumiputeras can be found in Section 160 (2) of the Constitution of Brunei Darassalam.

==Precedence==
Being accorded the status of Bumiputera in Brunei (as in Malaysia) carries with it certain benefits and opportunities which other ethnic groups in the country may not have access to.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"&gt;Minority Rights Group International, World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Brunei Darussalam : Dusun, Murut, Kedayan, Iban, Tutong, Penan, 2008, available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49749d48c.html [accessed 3 August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of [[affirmative action]] items targeting the Bumiputeras in Brunei. Under special legislation they have extended land rights and are given special privileges for employment opportunities in the [[Royal Brunei Armed Forces]] and Brunei Shell Petroleum.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The justification for these special privileges and affirmative action schemes is that Bumiputeras face disadvantages due to the success of other groups in society, for example the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, Geoffrey (1997). ''Language, Power, and Ideology in Brunei Darussalam '', p.7. Ohio University Center for International Studies, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt; One case of such disadvantage can be seen in the demise of the construction industry in Brunei. The building sector is a major employer of Bumiputeras and forms the lifeblood of many Bumiputera families.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, Geoffrey (2008). 'Brunei Darussalam: Dynastic Fallout, Economic Crisis and Recovery' Nagasaki University's Academic Output Site http://hdl.handle.net/10069/20942, accessed 3 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they are the group in society most affected by the global economic crisis. In the past, government policies in relation to economic recovery has been directly focussed on improving the position of Bumiputeras. During the Asian Economic Crisis of the late 1990s, Brunei's Economic Council developed an Action Plan to increase economic activity and thereby bring about some form of relief. A major part of that plan was to actively encourage and subsidise investment in Bumiputera-owned businesses.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Bumiputera and Islam==
The term Bumiputera often connotes those people of Malay-speaking ethnic groups who belong to the Islamic faith. Indeed, it has become advantageous for Bruneians to convert to Islam to truly qualify for Bumiputera status.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, Geoffrey (1997). ''Language, Power and Ideology in Brunei Darussalam'', pp.6-7. Ohio University Center for International Studies, Ohio&lt;/ref&gt; There are some concerns that members of indigenous groups who technically fall under the Bumiputera category, but do not belong to the Islamic faith, may be under official pressure to convert to maintain their rights and privileges.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt; In the 1970s, many indigenous people converted to Islam for this reason.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Bruneian government bans many religious activities not related to Islam, while at the same time benefitting those who participate in activities conducted by Muslim groups.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} This increases disadvantages to indigenous Bumiputeras who are not Muslims.

==Comparing the concept of Bumiputera privileges in Malaysia and Brunei==
Whereas the delineation between Bumiputeras and other groups in Malaysia has been the cause of much conflict and unrest of late, it does not appear to have had the same consequences in Bruneian society. This may be because [[affirmative action]] strategies are not so prevalent or obvious in Bruneian society. A lack of opposition to the Bumiputera concept in Brunei may also be because as an autocratic sultanate, the country does not experience a great deal of political diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Economist Intelligence Unit (2008).''Country Profile/Report'', Malaysia, Brunei&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the situation in Malaysia, where protests against Bumiputera privileges in Malaysia are often backed by opposition parties to raise dissatisfaction with the government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cell 16''' was a militant [[feminist]] organization in the United States known for its program of [[celibacy]], separation from men and self-defense training (specifically [[karate]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bevacqua, Maria. ''Rape on the Public Agenda: Feminism and the Politics of Sexual Assault'' (2000) {{ISBN|1-55553-446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echols, Alice 1990, p164"&gt;Echols, Alice.

''Feminism For Sale''. ''[[This Magazine]]'' (2005) {{cite web|url=http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2005/05/feminism.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022080224/http://thismagazine.ca/issues/2005/05/feminism.php |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Founded in 1968 by [[Roxanne Dunbar]], Cell 16 has been cited as the first organization to advance the concept of [[separatist feminism]].&lt;ref name="Echols, Alice 1990, p164" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saulnier, Christine F. ''Feminist Theories and Social Work: Approaches and Applications'' (1996) {{ISBN|1-56024-945-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Historian [[Alice Echols]] cites Cell 16 as an example of feminist ''heterosexual separatism'', as the group never advocated lesbianism as a political strategy. Echols credits Cell 16's work for "helping establishing the theoretical foundation for [[lesbian separatism]].&lt;ref name="Echols, Alice 1990, p164" /&gt; In ''No More Fun and Games'', the organization's radical feminist periodical, Cell Members Roxanne Dunbar and Lisa Leghorn advised women to "separate from men who are not consciously working for female liberation" and advised periods of celibacy, rather than lesbian relationships, which they considered to be "nothing more than a personal solution."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, Leghorn. ''The Man's Problem'', from ''No More Fun and Games'', November 1969, quoted in Echols, 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the Summer of 1968, Dunbar placed an ad in a [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] underground newspaper calling for a "Female Liberation Front." The original membership also included Hillary Langhorst, Sandy Bernard, [[Dana Densmore]], the daughter of [[Donna Allen (feminist)|Donna Allen]], Betsy Warrior, Ellen O'Donnell, Jayne West, Mary Anne Weathers, Maureen Maynes, Gail Murray, and [[Abby Rockefeller]].&lt;ref&gt;Endres and Lueck. ''Women's Periodicals in the United States: Social and Political Issues'' (1996) {{ISBN|0-313-28632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echols, Alice 1990"&gt;Echols, Alice. ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967-75'', University of Minnesota Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8166-1787-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's name was meant "to emphasize that they were only one cell of an organic movement" and referenced the address of their meetings — 16 Lexington Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/cwhp/bios_c.html |title=Cambridge Women's Heritage Project |access-date=2007-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128225509/http://www.cambridgema.gov/cwhp/bios_c.html#Cell16 |archive-date=2010-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''No More Fun and Games'' ceased publication in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenlion.com/NMFG/nmfg.html ''No More Fun and Games, A Journal of Female Liberation'']&lt;/ref&gt; Cell 16 disbanded in 1973 as well.&lt;ref name="Echols, Alice 1990" /&gt;

The '''Central Jail of Nicosia''' is the only [[correctional facility]] in [[Cyprus]]&lt;ref name="GOV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/All/8D1190D346BABF91C2257014005189FC?OpenDocument|title=Defence - Security - Prisons Department|work=Cyprus Government Web Portal|publisher=cyprus.gov.cy|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is run by the [[Cyprus Prisons Department]]. It is located to the west of the walled part of the Cypriot city of [[Nicosia]], south of the [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]]. In the facility are detained convicted and unconvicted prisoners of both sexes and of all age groups from 16 years and over.&lt;ref name="GOV" /&gt;

The Nicosia central prison was built by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1894 and were in use until 1955 as a place of detention of those condemned by the courts to imprisonment, but also as a place of temporary detention of persons under judicial decree.

It is known primarily for the "[[Imprisoned Graves]]" where 13 [[EOKA]] fighters were interred. Nine of them were hanged by the British, three were killed in action and one died in hospital from his battle wounds.

During the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] (1974) battles raged around the Central Jail of Lefkosia. Vastly outnumbered, the Cypriot national guardsmen - aided by corrections officers - managed to fight off the Turks and keep the jail with its Imprisoned Tombs from being captured.

'''Crime in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]''' is above the national [[median]] and has been a major problem for the city since the middle 20th century.

Atlanta’s public safety improvement between 2001 and 2009 occurred at more than twice the rate of the rest of the country.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/opinion/how-to-create-a-711260.html |title=How to create a safer Atlanta |first=David |last= Edwards |date=November 1, 2010 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109075330/http://www.ajc.com/opinion/how-to-create-a-711260.html |archivedate=November 9, 2010 |accessdate=January 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After ranking in the top five highest violent crime cities for most of the previous three decades, in 2009 Atlanta ranked 31st,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and in 2015, 24/7 Wall Street ranked it 19th.&lt;ref&gt;[http://247wallst.com/special-report/2016/09/27/25-most-dangerous-cities-in-america/3/ ''The Most Dangerous Cities in America'', page 3], 24/7 Wall Street, September 27, 2016. Retrieved February 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; While various news sources report rankings by crime rate, FBI strongly cautions against this, because this is a misuse of bare statistics, since it ignores various important factors, such as population density, degree of urbanization, composition of population, economic conditions, etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use|title="Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics: Their Proper Use"|website=Ucr.fbi.gov|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Atlanta Police GA USA - Ford Crown Victoria (1).jpg|thumb|250px|An Atlanta [[police car]] ]]
During the 1970s, like with many large cities within the [[United States]], Atlanta's population began to decline.  By 1990, the population was 394,017, down almost 20% from its population in 1970, which was 496,973.&lt;ref name="populationdivision,laurak.yax"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/twps0027.html|title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places In TheUnited States: 1790 to 1990|author=Population Division, Laura K. Yax|website=Census.gov|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the city center and surrounding areas began to go through an [[urban decay]], and crime spiked significantly throughout the 1980s.  Along with many other major cities in the United States, Atlanta was hard hit by the [[crack epidemic (United States)|crack epidemic]] of most of the 1980s to early 1990s.  In 1994, Atlanta was ranked the most dangerous city in the country by the [[Morgan Quitno Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganquitno.com/1st_safest.htm The First Safest/Most Dangerous City Listing]. Morgan Quitno Press. Lawrence, Kansas, United States. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[drug-related crime]] in [[metro Atlanta]] increased slightly, in part due to Atlanta becoming an important distribution center for [[cocaine]], and other related [[illegal drug|drug]]s [[Mexican Drug War|imported from Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/09/15/daily55.html | date=September 17, 2008 | title=Major cocaine and marijuana ring busted in Atlanta|website=Bizjournals.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/10/27/daily52.html?q=cocaine%20in%20Atlanta | date=October 29, 2008 | title=Mexican drug cartel busted up in Atlanta|website=Bizjournals.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These increases were mostly seen in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]], [[Gwinnett]], [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]], [[Cobb County|Cobb]], and [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]] counties. Many [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies in the area have joined forces together with the [[Atlanta Police Department]] in an effort to decrease the overall crime in metro Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/05/27/police_crime_sweep.html] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, due to large amounts of [[urban renewal|revitalization]] projects in the city core, crime continued to fall, even amidst the hard economic times of the late-2000s/early 2010s.&lt;ref name="populationdivision,laurak.yax"/&gt;

==Policing==
The city is served by the [[Atlanta Police Department]]. In 2013, the APD had 2,000 officers,&lt;ref name="Godwin"&gt;Becca J. G. Godwin, [http://www.ajc.com/news/local/atlanta-homicides-from-2016-remain-unsolved-these-are-the-victims/UelLUXycTlEOJTJ7mqKf6N/ 51 Atlanta homicides from 2016 remain unsolved. These are the victims], ''Atlanta Journal Constitution'' (February 15, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;Jonathan Shapiro, [http://news.wabe.org/post/2000-atlanta-police-officers-gripes-remain-over-pay 2,000 Atlanta Police Officers, But Gripes Remain Over Pay], WABE (October 25, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katie Leslie, [http://www.myajc.com/news/local/apd-reaches-once-elusive-goal-000-officers/Ao9jWRR0M23HJNKApTJP1L/ APD reaches a once-elusive goal of 2,000 officers], ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' (October 25, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; but the number of officers has decreased since that time.&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; Mayor [[Kasim Reed]] has identified an increase in the number of officers to 2,000 as a goal for the city.&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; Although city data shows that APD attrition rates have improved from the 2000s to 2013, morale issues within the police department has persisted due to officer dissatisfaction with salaries.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"/&gt; About 45 percent of officers hired between 2005 and 2013 left the force by 2017.&lt;ref name="Boone"&gt;Christian Boone, [http://www.myajc.com/news/crime--law/murders-atlanta-are-way-but-overall-crime-way-down/dBSfTIdF7afBJ38yGmqVrM/ Murders in Atlanta are way up, but overall crime is way down], ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' (January 31, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta is divided into six police patrol zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantapd.org/about-apd/zone-maps|title=Atlanta Police Department : Zone Maps|website=Atlantapd.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] (MARTA), which operates rail, bus, and parking lots in the city and surrounding area, has its own police force. Overall crime rates in are about 30 per every 100,000 system daily riders, which is identical to the crime figure for the [[Washington, D.C. area]]'s [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|WMATA]], higher than crime figure for the Boston area's [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]], and lower than the crime figure for the San Francisco area's [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]]. Homicides within the MARTA system have varied. In the [[fiscal year]] ending in 2017, for example, there were four homicides investigated by MARTA police, but there were no homicides in the MARTA system in any of the previous last four fiscal years.&lt;ref name="SharpeMARTA"&gt;Joshua Sharpe, [http://www.ajc.com/news/local/after-recent-killings-how-safe-marta/KUtM1GmuvSiNsKFs1Ln58L/ After recent killings, how safe is MARTA?], ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' (February 16, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Total crimes in the MARTA system have declined from fiscal year 2013.&lt;ref name="SharpeMARTA"/&gt;

From 2009 to 2016, overall crime in Atlanta declined 27 percent, "with sharp declines in burglaries (9,102 in 2009 to 4,377 in 2016), robberies (2,622 to 1,914) and aggravated assaults (2,602 to 2,179)."&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt;

===Homicide===
Consistent with national trends, the murder rate in Atlanta peaked in 1990 and have declined since.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Cronan, [http://www.atlantamagazine.com/crime-city/the-homicide-report/ The Homicide Report], ''Atlanta Magazine'' (May 15, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 to 2010, murders in the city declined by nearly 50 percent.&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt; The years 2009 and 2012 had the lowest numbers of homicides in Atlanta than any year dating back to 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Marcus K. Garner, [http://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/atlanta-homicides-2nd-lowest-years/5KZDukpRGDMGUwXb5maL4K/ Atlanta homicides 2nd lowest in 50 years], ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' (January 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; but there has been an increase in murders in the city beginning in 2013.&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt; The number of murders in Atlanta was 80 in 2009, 92 in 2010, 88 in 2011, 85 in 2012, 82 in 2013, 93 in 2014, 95 in 2015, and 111 in 2016.&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt; A significant number of murders have remained unsolved; as of February 2017, 51 of the 111 homicides from 2016 remain unsolved.&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; 

An analysis of FBI [[Uniform Crime Report]] data for 2015, conducted by the economic analysis website 24/7 Wall Street, showed a murder rate in Atlanta of about 20.2 per 100,000 people, making it the 18th highest murder rate among U.S. cities.&lt;ref name="Pirani"&gt;Fiza Pirani, [http://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/atlanta-named-one-america-top-murder-capitals/iazY5cSkTgXxs436eN8chL/ Atlanta named one of America's top 'murder capitals'], ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' (November 2, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; A October 2016 ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' analysis of preliminary 2016 data, taken from official police information and local  reports, found that among U.S. cities with populations of over a quarter-million people, Atlanta had the tenth-highest murder rate, at 23.9 per 100,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Asher, [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/u-s-cities-experienced-another-big-rise-in-murder-in-2016/ A Handful Of Cities Are Driving 2016's Rise In Murders], ''FiveThirtyEight'' (October 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] District Attorney Paul Howard said that 17% of 2014 homicides in the county were gang-related.&lt;ref name="BooneGangs"&gt;Christian Boone, [http://www.myajc.com/news/crime--law/violent-crime-fueled-gangs-the-rise-atlanta/rPSsKPTcDm4qLg34iHle6N/ Violent crime fueled by gangs on the rise in Atlanta], ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' (July 1, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In Atlanta, guns were involved in 82% of homicide cases.&lt;ref name="Pirani"/&gt; In July 2016, in an attempt to combat an increase in homicide, the city began Operation Whiplash, with additional police officers and other resources assigned to 33 "challenging and crime-ridden" neighborhoods in the city.&lt;ref name="Boone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2016/jul/05/murder-rate-rises-atlanta-aims-get-guns-streets/374393/ As murder rate rises, Atlanta aims to get guns off streets], Associated Press (July 5, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gang crime==
[[Street gang]]s of various levels of sophistication have had a presence in the city since the late 1970's. In 2015, Atlanta police were tracking about 192 gangs, more than double the number identified six years earlier.&lt;ref name="BooneGangs"/&gt; The supervisor of the FBI's Atlanta Safe Streets Gang Task Force&lt;ref name="Econ"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21654076-what-gangs-can-offer-young-asian-americans-fighting-back Crime in Atlanta: Fighting back: What gangs can offer young Asian-Americans], ''The Economist'' (July 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; said in 2016 that more than half of violent crime in the city was involved gang members.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Winne, [http://www.wsbtv.com/news/2-investigates/metro-atlantas-gang-problem-larger-than-ever-before/466378876 Metro Atlanta's gang problem larger than ever before], WSB-TV (November 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to violent crime, [[drug dealing]], and [[carjacking]], some Atlanta gangs committ [[identity theft]] and [[credit card fraud]].&lt;ref name="Econ"/&gt;

==Human trafficking==
{{Main|Human trafficking in Georgia (U.S. state)#Atlanta}}
Atlanta is now a major transportation hub when it comes to trafficking young girls from Mexico and is one of the fourteen U.S. cities with the highest levels of sex trafficking of children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/priority-areas/civil-rights/human-trafficking|title=Civil Rights Prosecutions: Human Trafficking {{!}} USAO {{!}} Department of Justice|website=Justice.gov|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year of 2007 the sex trade generated $290 million in Atlanta.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streetgrace.org/georgia-laws/|title=Georgia Laws|website=Street Grace, Inc|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Atlanta has “the same ready access to commercial air and ground routes that draws businesses and travelers to Atlanta also entices criminals engaged in human trafficking”. There are numerous events and conventions in Atlanta that bring many people to the city which also exemplifies the issue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Notable incidents==
*[[Atlanta murders of 1979-1981]] — A [[serial killing|series of murders]] that started from the summer of 1979 and ended in the spring of 1981. Twenty children were killed in this incident.
*[[Atlanta Prison Riots]] — A series of riots in 1987. One hundred people were made hostage and a portion of the [[Atlanta Federal Penitentiary]] was burned.
*[[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]] — Killed 2 people and injured 111 during the [[1996 Summer Olympics]].
*[[Mark O. Barton]] - Known for the July 29, 1999 murders of 12 people and wounding of 13 more at two Atlanta day trading firms.
*[[Brian Nichols]] — Known for 2005 escape and killing spree in the [[Fulton County Courthouse (Georgia)|Fulton County Courthouse]] and later killing an off-duty [[Special agent|federal agent]].

[[University of Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;http://slavic.ucla.edu/czech/czech-republic/. [[University of California, Los Angeles]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czech&amp;ndash;Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the [[high medieval]] period, and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech&amp;ndash;Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period. In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the [[Czech National Revival]]. The main vernacular, known as Common Czech, is based on the vernacular of [[Prague]], but is now spoken throughout most of the Czech Republic. The [[Moravian dialects]] spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak.

Czech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten [[monophthong]]s, three [[diphthong]]s and 25 consonants (divided into "hard", "neutral" and "soft" categories). Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. Czech has a [[raised alveolar trill]], which is not known to occur as a [[phoneme]] in any other language, represented by the [[grapheme]] ''[[ř]]''. Czech uses a simple [[orthography]] which [[phonology|phonologists]] have used as a model.

==Classification==
{{further information|Czech-Slovak languages|West Slavic languages}}
[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|alt=Language-tree graph|Classification of Czech within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family. Czech and Slovak make up a "Czech–Slovak" subgroup.]]
Czech is a member of the [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] sub-branch of the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. This branch includes [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], [[Upper Sorbian|Upper]] and [[Lower Sorbian]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]. Slovak is the closest language genetic neighbor of Czech, followed by Polish and Silesian.&lt;ref name="Sussex 2011 54–56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West Slavic languages are spoken in Central Europe. Czech is distinguished from other West Slavic languages by a more-restricted distinction between "hard" and "soft" consonants (see [[#Phonology|Phonology]] below).&lt;ref name="Sussex 2011 54–56"/&gt;

{{see also|History of the Czech lands}}

===Medieval/Old Czech===
The term "Old Czech" is applied to the period predating the 16th century, with the earliest records of the high medieval period also classified as "early Old Czech", but the term "Medieval Czech" is also used.

Around the 7th century, the  [[early Slavs|Slavic expansion]] reached Central Europe, settling on the eastern fringes of the [[Frankish Empire]]. The West Slavic polity of  [[Great Moravia]] formed by the 9th century. The [[Christianization of Bohemia]] took place during the 9th and 10th centuries. The diversification of the [[Czech-Slovak languages|Czech-Slovak]] group within [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] began around that time, marked among other things by  its ephemeral use of the [[voiced velar fricative]] consonant (/ɣ/)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liberman|Trubetskoi|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consistent stress on the first syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liberman|Trubetskoi|2001|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bohemian (Czech) language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries. Literary works written in Czech appear in the late 13th and early 14th century and administrative documents first appear towards the late 14th century. The first complete [[Bible translations into Czech|Bible translation]] also dates to this period.&lt;ref name="Sussex Cubberley 2011 98 99"/&gt; Old Czech texts, including poetry and cookbooks, were produced outside the university as well.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski 2009 95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Piotrowski|2012|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary activity becomes widespread in the early 15th century in the context of the [[Bohemian Reformation]]. [[Jan Hus]] contributed significantly to the standardization of [[Czech orthography]], advocated for widespread literacy among Czech commoners (particularly in religion) and made early efforts to model written Czech after the spoken language.&lt;ref name="Sussex Cubberley 2011 98 99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Modern Czech ===
There was no standardization distinguishing between Czech and Slovak prior to the 15th century.&lt;ref name="tuebingen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/tilman.berger/Publikationen/CzechSlovak.pdf|title=Slovaks in Czechia – Czechs in Slovakia|publisher=[[University of Tübingen]]|last=Berger|first=Tilman|format=PDF|accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the division between Czech and Slovak becomes apparent, marking the confessional division between Lutheran Protestants in Slovakia using Czech orthography and Catholics, especially Slovak Jesuits, beginning to use a separate Slovak orthography based on the language of the [[Trnava]] region.

The publication of the [[Kralice Bible]] between 1579 and 1593 (the first complete Czech translation of the Bible from the original languages) became very important for standardization of the Czech language in the following centuries.

In 1615, the Bohemian diet tried to declare Czech to be the only official language of the kingdom. After the [[Bohemian Revolt]] (of predominantly Protestant aristocracy) which was defeated by the [[Habsburg]]s in 1620, the Protestant intellectuals had to leave the country. This emigration together with other consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]] had a negative impact on the further use of the Czech language. In 1627, Czech and German became official languages of the Kingdom of Bohemia and in the 18th century German became dominant in Bohemia and Moravia, especially among the upper classes.&lt;ref name="Cerna 2007 26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cerna|Machalek|2007|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Czech ===
[[File:Jan Vilímek - Josef Dobrovský.jpg|thumb|right|[[Josef Dobrovský]], whose writing played a key role in reviving Czech as a written language|alt=In a detailed pencil sketch, a middle-aged man in a suit looks idly into the distance.]]
{{see also|Czech National Revival}}
The modern standard Czech language originates in standardization efforts of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chloupek|Nekvapil|1993|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chloupek|Nekvapil|1993|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes include the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] shift of ''í'' to ''ej'' and ''é'' to ''í'' (although ''é'' survives for some uses) and the merging of ''í'' and the former ''ejí''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chloupek|Nekvapil|1993|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime before the 18th century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /ʎ/ which survives in Slovak.&lt;ref name="Maxwell 2009 106"/&gt;

[[File:NTK prohibition signs.jpg|thumb|Prohibition signs written in Czech, by entry #3 into the building of National Technical Library in Prague.]]

With the beginning of the national revival of the mid-18th century,  Czech historians began to emphasize their people's accomplishments from the 15th through the 17th centuries, rebelling against the [[Counter-Reformation]] (the Habsburg re-catholization efforts which had denigrated Czech and other non-[[Latin language|Latin]] languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agnew|1994|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech [[Philology|philologists]] studied sixteenth-century texts, advocating the return of the language to [[high culture]].&lt;ref name="Agnew 1994 251–252"&gt;{{Harvnb|Agnew|1994|pp=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period is known as the Czech National Revival&lt;ref name="Wilson 2010 18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2009|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or Renaissance).&lt;ref name="Agnew 1994 251–252"/&gt;

During the national revival, in 1809 linguist and historian [[Josef Dobrovský]] released a German-language grammar of Old Czech entitled ''Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der böhmischen Sprache'' (''Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language''). Dobrovský had intended his book to be [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]], and did not think Czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language. However, [[Josef Jungmann]] and other revivalists used Dobrovský's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival.&lt;ref name="Wilson 2010 18"/&gt; Changes during this time included spelling reform (notably, ''í'' in place of the former ''j'' and ''j'' in place of ''g''), the use of ''t'' (rather than ''ti'') to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns (which had been a late borrowing from German).&lt;ref name="Maxwell 2009 106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|2009|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chloupek|Nekvapil|1993|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal, widespread use.&lt;ref name="Wilson 2010 18"/&gt;

Adherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard Czech adopted a number of features from [[Common Czech]] (a widespread, informal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]), such as leaving some proper nouns undeclined. This has resulted in a relatively high level of homogeneity among all varieties of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chloupek|Nekvapil|1993|pp=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

[[File:Vojvodina rusyn croatian czech map.png|thumb|right|alt=Map of Vojvodina, a province of Serbia, with Czech in official use in one southeastern municipality|Official use of Czech in [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]]]]
In 2005 and 2007, Czech was spoken by about 10 million residents of the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name="Cerna 2007 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Eurobarometer]] survey conducted from January to March 2012 found that the [[first language]] of 98 percent of Czech citizens was Czech, the third-highest in the [[European Union]] (behind [[Greece]] and [[Hungary]]).&lt;ref name="eu"/&gt;

Czech, the official language of the Czech Republic (a member of the [[European Union]] since 2004), is one of the EU's official languages and the 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that Czech was the foreign language most often used in Slovakia.&lt;ref name="eu"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf|publisher=[[Eurobarometer]]|title=Europeans and Their Languages|date=June 2012|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist Jonathan van Parys collected data on language knowledge in Europe for the 2012 [[European Day of Languages]]. The five countries with the greatest use of Czech were the [[Czech Republic]] (98.77 percent), [[Slovakia]] (24.86 percent), [[Portugal]] (1.93 percent), [[Poland]] (0.98 percent) and [[Germany]] (0.47 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languageknowledge.eu/languages/czech|publisher=Language Knowledge|title=Language knowledge in the European Union|date=2012|last=van Parys|first=Jonathan|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech speakers in Slovakia primarily live in cities. Since it is a recognised [[minority language]] in Slovakia, Slovak citizens who speak only Czech may communicate with the government in their language to the extent that Slovak speakers in the Czech Republic may do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alppi.vedeckecasopisy.cz/publicFiles/00131.pdf|format=PDF|title=Language Policy of Slovak Republic|last=Škrobák|first=Zdeněk|publisher=''Annual of Language &amp; Politics and Politics of Identity''|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|Czech American|Czech Texan}}
Immigration of Czechs from Europe to the United States occurred primarily from 1848 to 1914.

==Standard Czech==
The modern written standard is directly based on the standardization during the [[Czech National Revival]] in the 1830s, significantly influenced by  [[Josef Jungmann]]'s Czech–German dictionary published during 1834–1839. Jungmann used vocabulary of the [[Bible of Kralice]] (1579–1613) period and of the language used by his contemporaries. He borrowed words not present in Czech from other Slavic languages or created neologisms.&lt;ref name="Czech Literature"&gt;{{cite web|last=Naughton|first=James|title=CZECH LITERATURE, 1774 TO 1918|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tayl0010/lit_to_1918.htm|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=25 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612013916/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tayl0010/lit_to_1918.htm|archivedate=12 June 2012|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonology===
{{main article|Czech phonology}}

[[File:Synagoga v Úštěku.ogg|thumb|Spoken Czech]]

Standard Czech contains ten basic [[vowel]] [[phoneme]]s, and three more found only in [[loanword]]s. They are {{IPA|/a/, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /o/, and /u/}}, their long counterparts {{IPA|/aː/, /ɛː/, /iː/, /oː/ and /uː/}}, and three diphthongs, {{IPA|/ou̯/, /au̯/ and /ɛu̯/}}. The latter two diphthongs and the long {{IPA|/oː/}} are exclusive to loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dankovičová|1999|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vowels are never reduced to [[schwa]] sounds when unstressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harkins|1952|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each word usually has primary [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] on its first [[syllable]], except for [[enclitic]]s (minor, monosyllabic, unstressed syllables). In all words of more than two syllables, every odd-numbered syllable receives secondary stress. Stress is unrelated to vowel length, and the possibility of stressed short vowels and unstressed long vowels can be confusing to students whose native language combines the features (such as most varieties of English).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harkins|1952|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] [[consonant]]s with unvoiced counterparts are unvoiced at the end of a word before a pause, and in [[consonant cluster]]s [[voicing assimilation]] occurs, which matches voicing to the following consonant. The unvoiced counterpart of /ɦ/ is /x/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dankovičová|1999|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Czech consonants are categorized as "hard", "neutral" or "soft":

*Hard: {{IPA|/d/, /ɡ/, /ɦ/, /k/, /n/, /r/, /t/, /x/}}
*Neutral: {{IPA|/b/, /f/, /l/, /m/, /p/, /s/, /v/, /z/}}
*Soft: {{IPA|/c/, /ɟ/, /j/, /ɲ/, /r̝/, /ʃ/, /ts/, /tʃ/, /ʒ/}}

This distinction describes the [[Czech declension|declension]] patterns of nouns, which is based on the category of a noun's ending consonant. Hard consonants may not be followed by ''i'' or ''í'' in writing, or soft ones by ''y'' or ''ý'' (except in loanwords such as ''[[kilogram]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psaní i – y po písmenu c|url=http://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/en/?id=102|website=Czech Language Institute|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutral consonants may take either character. Hard consonants are sometimes known as "strong", and soft ones as "weak".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harkins|1952|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phoneme represented by the letter ''[[ř]]'' (capital ''Ř'') is often considered unique to Czech&lt;ref name="dyk"/&gt;, but in fact it also occurs in Irish Gaelic in front of a slender vowel, as in the word [[''Éire'']], the Irish name of [[Ireland]]. It represents the [[raised alveolar non-sonorant trill]] ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[r̝]}}), a sound somewhere between Czech's ''r'' and ''ž'' (example: {{audio|Cs-řeka.ogg|"řeka" (river)}}),&lt;ref name="dyk"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harkins|1952|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is present in ''[[Dvořák]]''. In unvoiced environments, /r̝/ is realized as its voiceless allophone [r̝̊].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dankovičová|1999|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The consonants {{IPA|/r/ and /l/}} can be [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]], acting as [[syllable nuclei]] in place of a vowel. ''[[Strč prst skrz krk]]'' ("Stick [your] finger through [your] throat") is a well-known Czech [[tongue twister]] using only syllabic consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
Slavic grammar is [[fusional language|fusional]]; its nouns, verbs, and adjectives are [[inflection|inflected]] by phonological processes to modify their meanings and grammatical functions, and the easily separable [[affix]]es characteristic of [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] languages are limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Qualls|2012|pp=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Slavic inflection is complex and pervasive, inflecting for case, gender and number in nouns and tense, aspect, [[Grammatical mood|mood]], person and subject number and gender in verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Qualls|2012|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of speech include adjectives, [[adverb]]s, numbers, [[interrogative word]]s, [[preposition]]s, [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s and [[interjection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=v–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverbs are primarily formed from adjectives by taking the final ''ý'' or ''í'' of the base form and replacing it with ''e'', ''ě'', or ''o''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative statements are formed by adding the affix ''[[wikt:ne#Czech|ne-]]'' to the verb of a clause, with one exception: ''je'' (he, she or it is) becomes ''není''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sentence and clause structure====
{{see also|Czech word order}}

|}

Because Czech uses [[grammatical case]] to convey word function in a sentence (instead of relying on [[word order]], as English does), its word order is flexible. As a [[pro-drop language]], in Czech an [[Transitivity (grammar)|intransitive]] sentence can consist of only a verb; information about its subject is encoded in the verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enclitics (primarily [[auxiliary verb]]s and pronouns) must appear in the second syntactic slot of a sentence, after the first stressed unit. The first slot must contain a subject and object, a main form of a verb, an adverb or a conjunction (except for the light conjunctions ''a'', "and", ''i'', "and even" or ''ale'', "but").{{sfn|Short|2009|p=324}}

Czech syntax has a [[subject–verb–object]] sentence structure. In practice, however, word order is flexible and used for [[topicalization]] and focus. Although Czech has a [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] [[Passive voice|passive]] construction (like English), colloquial word-order changes frequently produce the passive voice. For example, to change "Peter killed
Paul" to "Paul was killed by Peter" the order of subject and object is inverted: ''Petr zabil Pavla'' ("Peter killed Paul") becomes "Paul, Peter killed" (''Pavla zabil Petr''). ''Pavla'' is in the [[accusative case]], the grammatical object (in this case, the victim) of the verb.{{sfn|Short|2009|p=325}}
 
A word at the end of a clause is typically emphasized, unless an upward [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] indicates that the sentence is a question:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Pes jí bagetu.'' – The dog eats the baguette (rather than eating something else).
*''Bagetu jí pes.'' – The dog eats the baguette (rather than someone else doing so).
*''Pes bagetu jí.'' – The dog eats the baguette (rather than doing something else to it).
*''Jí pes bagetu?'' – Does the dog eat the baguette? (emphasis ambiguous)
In portions of [[Bohemia]] (including [[Prague]]), questions such as ''Jí pes bagetu?'' without an interrogative word (such as ''co'', "what" or ''kdo'', "who") are [[Intonation (linguistics)|intoned]] in a slow rise from low to high, quickly dropping to low on the last word or phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Czech syntax, adjectives precede nouns,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; with few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Uhlířová|first1=Ludmila|title=SLOVOSLED NOMINÁLNÍ SKUPINY|url=https://www.czechency.org/slovnik/SLOVOSLED%20NOMINÁLNÍ%20SKUPINY|website=Nový encyklopedický slovník češtiny|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relative clause]]s are introduced by [[relativizer]]s such as the adjective ''který'', analogous to the English [[relative pronoun]]s "which", "that", "who" and "whom". As with other adjectives, it is declined into the appropriate case (see [[#Declension|Declension below]]) to match its associated noun, person and number. Relative clauses follow the noun they modify, and the following is a [[Interlinear gloss|glossed]] example:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harkins|1952|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| cellpadding=3

|}
'''English:''' I want to visit the university that John attends.

====Declension====
{{Main article|Czech declension}}
In Czech, nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases. Nouns are inflected to indicate their use in a sentence. A [[nominative–accusative language]], Czech marks subject nouns with nominative case and object nouns with accusative case. The genitive case marks possessive nouns and some types of movement. The remaining cases (instrumental, locative, vocative and dative) indicate semantic relationships, such as secondary objects, movement or position ([[dative case]]) and accompaniment (instrumental case). An adjective's case agrees with that of the noun it describes. When Czech children learn their language's declension patterns, the cases are referred to by number:&lt;ref name="Naughton 2005 25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!No. || Ordinal name (Czech) || Full name (Czech) || Case || Main usage
|-
|1. || ''první pád'' || ''nominativ'' ||[[nominative case|nominative]] || Subjects
|-
|2. || ''druhý pád'' || ''genitiv'' ||[[genitive case|genitive]] || Belonging, movement away from something (or someone)
|-
|3. || ''třetí pád'' || ''dativ'' ||[[dative case|dative]] || [[Indirect object]]s, movement toward something (or someone)
|-
|4. || ''čtvrtý pád'' || ''akuzativ'' ||[[accusative case|accusative]] || [[Direct object]]s
|-
|5. || ''pátý pád'' || ''vokativ'' ||[[vocative case|vocative]] || Addressing someone
|-
|6. || ''šestý pád'' || ''lokál'' ||[[locative case|locative]] || Location
|-
|7. || ''sedmý pád'' || ''instrumentál'' ||[[instrumental case|instrumental]] || Being used for a task; acting with someone (or something)
|}
Some Czech grammatical texts order the cases differently, grouping the nominative and accusative (and the dative and locative) together because those declension patterns are often identical; this order accommodates learners with experience in other inflected languages, such as Latin or [[Russian language|Russian]]. This order is nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and vocative.&lt;ref name="Naughton 2005 25"/&gt;

Some prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case. The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical (or metaphorical) direction, or location, conveyed by it. For example, ''[[wikt:od|od]]'' (from, away from) and ''[[wikt:z#Czech|z]]'' (out of, off) assign the genitive case. Other prepositions take one of several cases, with their meaning dependent on the case; ''[[wikt:na#Czech|na]]'' means "onto" or "for" with the accusative case, but "on" with the locative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=201–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of declension patterns (using prepositions) for a few nouns with adjectives follow. Only one plural example is given, since plural declension patterns are similar across genders.

This is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases:
{| cellpadding=3
|''Czech:'' || ''Nes-l'' || ''js-em'' || ''krabic-i'' || ''do'' || ''dom-u'' || ''se'' || ''sv-ým'' || ''přítel-em.''
|-

|}
''English:'' I carried the box into the house with my friend.

Czech distinguishes three [[grammatical gender|genders]]—masculine, feminine, and neuter—and the masculine gender is subdivided into [[animacy|animate]] and inanimate. With few exceptions, feminine nouns in the nominative case end in ''-a'', ''-e'', or consonant; neuter nouns in ''-o'', ''-e'', or ''-í'', and masculine nouns in a consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjectives agree in gender and animacy (for masculine nouns in the accusative or genitive singular and the nominative plural) with the nouns they modify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main effect of gender in Czech is the difference in noun and adjective declension, but other effects include past-tense verb endings: for example, ''dělal'' (he did, or made); ''dělala'' (she did, or made) and ''dělalo'' (it did, or made).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]], distinguishing between singular and plural. Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case. The [[Czech koruna]] is an example of this feature; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence, and declined as genitive for numbers five and up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Czech's [[grammatical number]]s are singular and [[plural]], several residuals of [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] forms remain. Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases: ''[[wikt:ruka|ruka]]'' (hand)—''ruce'' (nominative); ''[[wikt:noha|noha]]'' (leg)—''nohama'' (instrumental), ''nohou'' (genitive/locative); ''[[wikt:oko|oko]]'' (eye)—''oči'', and ''[[wikt:ucho|ucho]]'' (ear)—''uši''. While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms, all plural forms are considered feminine; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms are plural semantically, used for any non-singular count, as in ''mezi čtyřma očima'' (face to face, lit. ''among four eyes''). The plural number paradigms of these nouns are actually a mixture of historical dual and plural forms. For example, ''nohy'' (legs; nominative/accusative) is a standard plural form of this type of noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Komárek|2012|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Verb conjugation====
{{Main article|Czech conjugation|Morphological classification of Czech verbs}}
{{See also|Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages}}
Czech verb conjugation is less complex than noun and adjective declension because it codes for fewer categories. Verbs agree with their subjects in [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third) and [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), and are  conjugated for tense (past, present or [[future tense|future]]). For example, the conjugated verb ''[[wikt:mluvit|mluvíme]]'' (we speak) is in the present tense and first-person plural; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the [[infinitive]] ''mluvit'' by its ending, ''-íme''.&lt;ref name="Naughton 2005 131"/&gt;

Typical of Slavic languages, Czech marks its verbs for one of two [[grammatical aspect]]s: [[perfective aspect|perfective]] and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs—for example, ''[[wikt:koupit|koupit]]'' (perfective) and ''[[wikt:kupovat|kupovat]]'' (imperfective). Although the verbs' meaning is similar, in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing. This is distinct from [[past tense|past]] and [[present tense]],&lt;ref name="Naughton 2005 146"&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; and any Czech verb of either aspect can be conjugated into any of its three tenses.&lt;ref name="Naughton 2005 131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense.&lt;ref name="Naughton 2005 146"/&gt;

The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective ''psát'' (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective ''napsat'' (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are ''na-'', ''o-'', ''po-'', ''s-'', ''u-'', ''vy-'', ''z-'' and ''za-''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs ''koupit'' (to buy) and ''prodat'' (to sell) have the imperfective forms ''kupovat'' and ''prodávat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and [[frequentative]] forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb ''jít'' (to go) has the iterative form ''chodit'' (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form ''chodívat'' (to go regularly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lukeš|first1=Dominik|publisher=DominikLukeš.net|title=Gramatická terminologie ve vyučování - Terminologie a platonický svět gramatických idejí|url=http://www.dominiklukes.net/bibliography/platonickysvetgramatickychkategorii|accessdate=August 5, 2014|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many verbs have only one aspect, and verbs describing continual states of being—''[[wikt:být|být]]'' (to be), ''[[wikt:chtít|chtít]]'' (to want), ''[[wikt:moct|moct]]'' (to be able to), ''[[wikt:ležet|ležet]]'' (to lie down, to be lying down)—have no perfective form. Conversely, verbs describing immediate states of change—for example, ''[[wikt:otěhotnět|otěhotnět]]'' (to become pregnant) and ''[[wikt:nadchnout se|nadchnout se]]'' (to become enthusiastic)—have no imperfective aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Czech's use of present and future tense is largely similar to that of English, the language uses past tense to represent the English [[present perfect]] and [[Pluperfect|past perfect]]; ''ona běžela'' could mean ''she ran'', ''she has run'' or ''she had run''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some contexts, Czech's perfective present (which differs from the English [[present perfect]]) implies future action; in others, it connotes habitual action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the language has a proper future tense to minimize ambiguity. The future tense does not involve conjugating the verb describing an action to be undertaken in the future; instead, the future form of ''být'' (as shown in the table at left&lt;!-- Please change directions here if moving table --&gt;) is placed before the infinitive (for example, ''budu jíst''—"I will eat").&lt;ref name="Naughton 2005 151"&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conjugation is not followed by ''být'' itself, so future-oriented expressions involving nouns, adjectives, or prepositions (rather than verbs) omit ''být''. "I will be happy" is translated as ''Budu šťastný'' (not ''Budu být šťastný'').&lt;ref name="Naughton 2005 151"/&gt;

The infinitive form ends in ''t'' (archaically, ''ti''). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, ''můžu tě slyšet''—"I can ''hear'' you").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech verbs have three [[grammatical mood]]s: [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]].&lt;ref name="Rothstein 2010 359"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rothstein|Thieroff|2010|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: ''-Ø/-i/-ej'' for second-person singular, ''-te/-ete/-ejte'' for second-person plural and ''-me/-eme/-ejme'' for first-person plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditional mood is formed with a [[Grammatical particle|particle]] after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as "I would" or "I wish".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=152–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Czech verbs fail into one of five [[morphological classification of Czech verbs|classes]], which determine their conjugation patterns. The future tense of ''být'' would be classified as a Class I verb because of its endings. Examples of the present tense of each class and some common irregular verbs follow in the tables below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=136–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthography===
[[File:Psací písmo.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The handwritten Czech alphabet]]
{{main article|Czech orthography}}
{{see also|Czech Braille}}
Czech has one of the most [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic orthographies]] of all European languages. Its thirty-one [[grapheme]]s represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, ''i'' and ''y'' have the same sound), and it contains only one [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]: ''ch'', which follows ''h'' in the alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pansofia|1993|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters ''q'', ''w'' and ''x'' appear only in foreign words.&lt;ref name="Harkins 1952 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harkins|1952|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[háček]] (ˇ) is used with certain letters to form new characters: ''[[š]]'', ''[[ž]]'', and ''[[č]]'', as well as ''[[ň]]'', ''[[ě]]'', ''[[ř]]'', ''[[ť]]'', and ''[[ď]]'' (the latter five uncommon outside Czech). The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above (ʼ, an abbreviated háček) because of their height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harkins|1952|pp=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character ''ó'' exists only in loanwords and [[onomatopoeia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harkins|1952|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most European languages, Czech distinguishes [[vowel length]]; long vowels are indicated by an [[acute accent]] or, occasionally with ''ů'', a [[ring (diacritic)|ring]]. Long ''u'' is usually written ''ú'' at the beginning of a word or morpheme (''úroda'', ''neúrodný'') and ''ů'' elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harkins|1952|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; except for loanwords (''skútr'') or onomatopoeia (''bú'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pansofia|1993|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long vowels and ''ě'' are not considered separate letters in the alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hajičová|1986|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech [[typography|typographical]] features not associated with phonetics generally resemble those of most [[Latin script|Latin]] European languages, including English. [[Proper noun]]s, [[honorific]]s, and the first letters of quotations are [[capitalization|capitalized]], and [[punctuation]] is typical of other Latin European languages. Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages. The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point. When writing a long number, spaces between every three numbers (e.g. between hundreds and thousands) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts, but not in decimal places, like in English. The number 1,234,567.8910 may be written as 1234567,8910 or 1 234 567,8910. Ordinal numbers (1st) use a point as in German (1.). In [[proper noun]] phrases (except personal names), only the first word is capitalized (''Pražský hrad'', [[Prague Castle]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pansofia|1993|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
{{further information|Czech–Slovak languages}}
The main vernacular of Bohemia is "Common Czech", based on the dialect of the [[Prague]] region.
Other Bohemian dialects have become marginalized, while [[Moravian dialects]] remain more widespread, with a political movement for Moravian linguistic revival active since the 1990s.

===Common Czech===
The main Czech vernacular, spoken primarily in and around [[Prague]] but also throughout the country, is known as [[Common Czech]] (''obecná čeština''). This is an academic distinction; most Czechs are unaware of the term or associate it with vernacular (or incorrect) Czech.&lt;ref name="Wilson 2010 21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2009|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to standard Czech, Common Czech is characterized by simpler inflection patterns and differences in sound distribution.&lt;ref name="sciences"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15079160|publisher=[[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]]|date=2003|title=The present-day situation of Czech|last=Daneš|first=František|accessdate=August 10, 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common Czech has become ubiquitous in most parts of the Czech Republic since the later 20th century. It is usually defined as an [[dachsprache|interdialect]] used in common speech in [[Bohemia]] and western parts of [[Moravia]] (by about two thirds of all inhabitants of the [[Czech Republic]]). Common Czech is not [[codification (linguistics)|codified]], but some of its elements have become adopted in the written standard. 
Since the second half of the 20th century, Common Czech elements have also been spreading to regions previously unaffected, as a consequence of media influence.
Standard Czech is still the norm for politicians, businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations, but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media.&lt;ref name="sciences"/&gt;

Common Czech is characterized by quite regular differences from the standard [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[phonology]]. These variations are more or less common among all Common Czech speakers:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tahal|2010|pp=245-253}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''é'' usually replaced by ''ý/í'': mal'''ý''' město (small town), plam'''í'''nek (little flame), l'''í'''tat (to fly);
* ''ý'' (sometimes also ''í'') replaced by ''ej'': mal'''ej''' dům (small house), ml'''ej'''n (mill), pl'''ej'''tvat (to waste), b'''ej'''t (to be) – as a consequence of the loss of the difference in the pronunciation of y/ý and i/í in the 15th century;
* unified [[plural]] [[Ending (linguistics)|ending]]s of [[adjective]]s: mal'''ý''' lidi (small people), mal'''ý''' ženy (small women), mal'''ý''' města (small towns) – stand.: malí lidé, malé ženy, malá města;
* unified [[instrumental case|instrumental]] [[Ending (linguistics)|ending]] ''-ma'' in [[plural]]: s tě'''ma''' dobrej'''ma''' lid'''ma''', žena'''ma''', chlapa'''ma''', města'''ma''' (with the good people, women, guys, towns) – stand.: s těmi dobrými lidmi, ženami, chlapy, městy. In essence, this form resembles the form of the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], which was once a productive form, but now is almost extinct and retained in a lexically specific set of words. In Common Czech the ending became productive again around the 17th century, but used as a substitute for a regular plural form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Komárek|2012|pp=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* prothetic ''v-'' added to most words beginning ''o-'': '''v'''otevřít '''v'''okno (to open the window) – stand.: otevřít okno; but ''ovoce'' not *''vovoce'' (fruit)
* omitting of the syllabic ''-l'' in the masculine ending of past tense verbs: řek (he said), moh (he could), pích (he pricked) – stand.: řekl, mohl, píchl.

===Bohemian dialects===
{{further information|Chod dialect}}
Apart from the Common Czech vernacular, there remain a variety of other Bohemian dialects, mostly in marginal rural areas. Dialect use began to weaken in the second half of the 20th century, and by the early 1990s regional dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eckert|1993|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Czech Statistical Office]] in 2003 recognized the following Bohemian dialects:&lt;ref name="map"&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of Czech Dialects|url=http://www.osu.cz/fpd/kcd/dokumenty/cestinapositi/kuldanova/mapka_01.htm|date=2003|publisher=Český statistický úřad ([[Czech Statistical Office]])|accessdate=July 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201000809/http://www.osu.cz/fpd/kcd/dokumenty/cestinapositi/kuldanova/mapka_01.htm|archive-date=December 1, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*''Podskupina doudlebská'' ([[Doudleby]] subgroup)
*''Nářečí severovýchodočeská'' (Northeastern Bohemian dialects)

Bohemian dialects use a slightly different set of vowel phonemes to standard Czech. The phoneme /ɛː/ is peripheral and is replaced by /iː/, and a second native diphthong /eɪ̯/ occurs, usually in places where standard Czech has /iː/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Komárek|2012|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moravian dialects===
{{main article|Moravian dialects}}
{{further information|Lach dialects}}
The Czech dialects spoken in [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]] are known as [[Moravian dialects|Moravian]] (''moravština''). In the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], "Bohemian-Moravian-Slovak" was a language citizens could register as speaking (with German, Polish and several others).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kortmann|van der Auwera|2011|p=714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Czech dialects, only Moravian is distinguished in nationwide surveys by the [[Czech Statistical Office]]. As of 2011, 62,908 Czech citizens spoke Moravian as their first language and 45,561 were [[Diglossia|diglossal]] (speaking Moravian and standard Czech as first languages).&lt;ref name="obyvatelstvo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vdb.czso.cz/sldbvo/#!stranka=podle-tematu&amp;tu=30629&amp;th=&amp;v=&amp;vo=H4sIAAAAAAAAAFvzloG1uIhBMCuxLFGvtCQzR88jsTjDN7GAlf3WwcNiCReZGZjcGLhy8hNT3BKTS_KLPBk4SzKKUosz8nNSKgrsHRhAgKecA0gKADF3CQNnaLBrUIBjkKNvcSFDHQMDhhqGCqCiYA__cLCiEgZGvxIGdg9_Fz__EMeCEgY2b38XZ89gIIvLxTHEP8wx2NEFJM4ZHOIY5u_t7-MJ1OIP5IdEBkT5OwU5RgH5IUB9fo4ePq4uEPNYw1yDolzhPstJzEvX88wrSU1PLRJ6tGDJ98Z2CyYGRk8G1rLEnNLUiiIGAYQ6v9LcpNSitjVTZbmnPOhmArq34D8QlDDwAG10C_KFWcoe4ugU6uPtWMLA4eni6hcSEAZ0FYe_k3OQmaGJUwUA4lOtR1sBAAA.&amp;vseuzemi=null&amp;void=|publisher=Český statistický úřad (Czech Statistical Office)|date=March 26, 2011|accessdate=July 26, 2014|title=Tab. 614b Obyvatelstvo podle věku, mateřského jazyka a pohlaví (Population by Age, Mother Tongue, and Gender)|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the sixteenth century, some varieties of Czech resembled Slovak;&lt;ref name="tuebingen"/&gt; the southeastern Moravian dialects, in particular, are sometimes considered dialects of Slovak rather than Czech. These dialects form a continuum between the Czech and Slovak languages,&lt;ref name="Kortmann Auwera 516"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kortmann|van der Auwera|2011|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the same declension patterns for nouns and pronouns and the same verb conjugations as Slovak.&lt;ref name="tartu"&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Šustek|first=Zbyšek|title=Otázka kodifikace spisovného moravského jazyka (The question of codifying a written Moravian language)|publisher=[[University of Tartu]]|year=1998|url=http://www.britskelisty.cz/9809/19980914d.html|language=cs|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Czech Statistical Office]] in 2003 recognized the following Moravian dialects:&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
*''Nářečí českomoravská'' (Bohemian–Moravian dialects)
*''Nářečí středomoravská'' (Central Moravian dialects)

===Mutual intelligibility===
Czech and Slovak have been considered [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]; speakers of either language can communicate with greater ease than those of any other pair of West Slavic languages. Since the 1993 [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], mutual intelligibility has declined for younger speakers, probably because Czech speakers now experience less exposure to Slovak and vice versa.{{sfn|Short|2009|p=306}}

In phonetic differences, Czech is characterized by a [[glottal stop]] before initial vowels and Slovak by its less-frequent use of long vowels than Czech;&lt;ref name="Sussex 2011 57–58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Slovak has long forms of the consonants ''r'' and ''l'' when they function as vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Esposito|2011|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemic differences between the two languages are generally consistent, typical of two dialects of a language. Grammatically, although Czech (unlike Slovak) has a fully [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] [[vocative case]],&lt;ref name="Sussex 2011 57–58"/&gt; both languages share a common syntax.&lt;ref name="tuebingen"/&gt;

One study showed that Czech and Slovak [[lexicon]]s differed by 80 percent, but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Esposito|2011|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovak morphology is more regular (when changing from the [[nominative case|nominative]] to the [[locative case]], ''[[Prague|Pra'''h'''a]]'' becomes ''Pra'''z'''e'' in Czech and ''Pra'''h'''e'' in Slovak). The two lexicons are generally considered similar, with most differences found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology. Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech.&lt;ref name="tuebingen"/&gt;

The similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th-century scholars who called themselves "Czechoslavs" (''Čechoslované''), believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded [[German Bohemians]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] and other Slavs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|2009|pp=101–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] (1918–1938), although "Czechoslovak" was designated as the republic's official language, both Czech and Slovak written standards were used. Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak State]] (which then aligned with [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]]), literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the [[Axis powers]] lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech,&lt;ref name="tuebingen"/&gt; due to the transformation of Czechoslovakia from a unitary state to a federation. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, "Czechoslovak" has referred to improvised [[pidgin]]s of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref name="cscs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240751085|publisher=''International Journal of the Sociology of Language''|last=Nábělková|first=Mira|title=Closely-related languages in contact: Czech, Slovak, "Czechoslovak"|date=January 2007|accessdate=August 18, 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
{{see also|List of English words of Czech origin}}
Czech vocabulary derives primarily from Slavic, Baltic and other Indo-European roots. Although most verbs have Balto-Slavic origins, pronouns, prepositions and some verbs have wider, Indo-European roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1957|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some loanwords have been restructured by [[folk etymology]] to resemble native Czech words (''[[wikt:hřbitov|hřbitov]]'', "graveyard" and ''[[wikt:listina|listina]]'', "list").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1957|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Czech loanwords originated in one of two time periods. Earlier loanwords, primarily from German,&lt;ref name="Mathesius 2013 20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mathesius|2013|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin,&lt;ref name="Sussex 2011 101"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrived before the Czech National Revival. More recent loanwords derive primarily from English and [[French language|French]],&lt;ref name="Mathesius 2013 20"/&gt; and also from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. Many Russian loanwords, principally animal names and naval terms, also exist in Czech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|1957|pp=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although older German loanwords were colloquial, recent borrowings from other languages are associated with high culture.&lt;ref name="Mathesius 2013 20"/&gt; During the nineteenth century, words with Greek and Latin roots were rejected in favor of those based on older Czech words and common Slavic roots; "music" is ''[[wikt:muzyka|muzyka]]'' in Polish and ''музыка'' (''muzyka'') in Russian, but in Czech it is ''[[wikt:hudba|hudba]]''.&lt;ref name="Sussex 2011 101"/&gt; Some Czech words have been borrowed as loanwords into [[List of English words of Czech origin|English]] and other languages—for example, ''[[robot]]'' (from ''[[wikt:robota|robota]]'', "labor")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=robot|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|title=robot (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[polka]]'' (from ''[[wikt:polka|polka]]'', "[[Polish people|Polish]] woman" or from "půlka" "half").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=polka|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|title=polka (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17305">This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Rwanda]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education higher level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
Rwanda's population density, even after the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], is among the highest in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] at {{convert|230|PD/km2}}. This country has few villages, and nearly every family lives in a self-contained compound on a hillside. The urban concentrations are grouped around administrative centers.

Over half of the adult population is literate, but no more than 5% have received secondary education.

== Ethnic groups ==
{{Further information|Ethnic groups in Rwanda}}

The indigenous population largely consists of three ethnic groups. The [[Hutu]]s, who comprise the majority of the population (85%), are farmers of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] origin. The [[Tutsi]]s (14% before the Genocide, probably less than 10% now) are a pastoral people who arrived in the area in the 15th century. Until 1959, they formed the dominant [[caste]] under a [[feudal system]] based on cattleholding.

The [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]] ([[pygmies]]) (1%) and Jabiyans are thought to be the remnants of the earliest settlers of the region.

==Population==
In 1950, Rwanda had a very narrow population pyramid, with less than 250,000 males and females between 0-10 years old. The graph only gets narrower as it goes up with virtually no-one living past 50 years of age. In 2017, we see the population of Rwanda increase dramatically from 1950 with about 750,000 people between 0-20 years old, the graph remains very narrow in the older ages section but has improved from 1950. By 2050, it is predicted that more people will be living longer and the structure will broaden overall. By 2100, it is predicted that there will be more people aged between 30-60 than between 0-20 as previous years have shown.&lt;ref&gt;https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Graphs/DemographicProfiles/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Rwanda-demography.png|thumb|450px|A graph showing Rwanda's total population, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005; number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
According to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Rwanda}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 2,072,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 42.6%, 54.7% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.7% was 65 years or older

The [[Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004]] (c 28) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It is concerned with criminal justice and concentrates upon legal protection and assistance to victims of crime, particularly domestic violence.

In 2017 it was reported that the [[Office for National Statistics]]'s research findings suggested that over 10% of 16-19 year-old women are affected by the issue each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42093346|title=10% of young women 'face domestic abuse'|date=23 November 2017|accessdate=28 November 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government plans to cut funding for women's refuges could make it harder for women and children to escape domestic violence.  2,000 women a year could be affected.  60% of referrals to refuges were turned away in 2016-17 and funding cuts could make the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/29/survey-reveals-impact-of-proposed-funding-cuts-on-women-fleeing-abuse Survey reveals impact of proposed funding cuts on women fleeing abuse] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Other vulnerable groups will have to compete for funding with refuges against domestic violence and women fleeing domestic violence may be subject to a [[postcode lottery]] over whether they can escape or not.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-42416676/funding-change-could-see-domestic-violence-refuges-shut Funding change could see domestic violence refuges shut] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Womef fleeing domestic violence are frequently put into grossly unsuitable housing, housing where a toilet leaks and housing overrun with mice are examples.  This creates a risk that women will return to the abuser.  Other very vulnerable women fleeing domestic abuse are forced to sleep rough.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/14/thousands-fleeing-domestic-violence-squalid-housing-england Thousands fleeing domestic violence face squalid housing] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to [[legal aid]] meant 3234 victims had to face their abuser in court without legal support during the first 9 months of 2017, this contrasts with 1309 victims in the first 9 months of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/27/number-of-domestic-violence-victims-without-legal-help-soars Number of domestic violence victims without legal help soars] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katie Ghose]] of [[Women’s Aid]] said, “We know that the cross-examination of victims in the family courts by their abusive former partner is far too common. (...) It is a matter of urgency that the government prioritises the implementation of the ban on this abhorrent practice, be it through the courts bill or the domestic violence and abuse bill. Survivors must be able to safely access justice in both the criminal and family courts in their escape from domestic abuse.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/26/domestic-abuse-bill-amber-rudd-cross-examining-family-courts Rudd urged to prevent cross-examining by domestic abusers] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

65% of Local Authorities have cut real terms funding for women's refuges in England, Wales and Scotland since 2010.  The government plans to make victims of domestic abuse compete with other vulnerable groups for funding for temporary housing.  Women fleeing domestic violence will not be eligible for housing benefit; instead there will be limited funding to provide for domestic violence victims, drug addicts, former offenders and homeless people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/23/council-funding-womens-refuges-cut-since-2010-england-wales-scotland Council funding for women's refuges cut by nearly £7m since 2010] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's assets are taken into account in deciding if they qualify for legal aid. Frequently women cannot access their assets because the assets are controlled by the abuser. This prevents women getting protection from the courts. Mark Groves of the [[National Centre for Domestic Violence]] said, "While many people think Legal Aid is free, it is not, you have to pay a means-tested contribution. Economic abuse victims who don't control their money may not have this [and] those who have fled the family home may not have the right documentation. If you own a house, you have to put down a cash deposit equal to the equity in that house, which could be hundreds of thousands."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43660220 Legal costs halt thousands of domestic violence cases] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some men have repeatedly killed female partners. In the case of Theodore Johnson, convicted of murder in January 2018 and eventually jailed for a minimum of 30 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grierson|first=Jamie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/theodore-johnson-man-killed-three-partners-harsher-sentence-appeal|title=Man who killed three partners gets harsher sentence on appeal|work=The Guardian|date=8 March 2018|accessdate=9 March 2018}} The original minimum tariff was for 26 years.&lt;/ref&gt; he was found guilty of manslaughter on two previous occasions because of his mental health. Such cases are seen as evidence that violence by men against women is not treated seriously by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cocozza|first=Paula|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/03/theodore-johnson-freed-to-kill-domestic-violence-failure|title=Freed to kill again – and again: Theodore Johnson and the truth about domestic violence|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 January 2018|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "The refusal rate for applications under the domestic violence rule rose from 12% in 2012 to 30% in 2016, the last year for which full-year data was available. The figures show that 1,325 people were refused out of a total of 5,820 applications made between 2012 and 2016."  Abuse victims may be deported based on what the abuser states without their case being heard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/16/abuse-victims-increasingly-denied-right-to-stay-in-uk Abuse victims increasingly denied right to stay in UK] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people accused of domestic violence intimidate their victims into not appearing in court, then the case against them is dropped.  A report, from the police and Northumbria crime commissioner, Dame Vera Baird QC, monitored over 220 cases. It suggests cases where the complainant fails to appear are too easily dismissed and criminal justice services need more resources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/05/defendants-gaming-system-to-see-domestic-violence-cases-dropped Defendants 'gaming system' to get domestic violence cases dropped] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland there is an initiative to reduce domestic violence called the 'Equally Safe Strategy'.  This involves early intervention in domestic abuse cases affecting women, girls and children.  The Caledonian Programme dealing with men convicted of crimes involving domestic abuse will be extpanded to help reduce re-offending and the 'Rape Crisis Sexual Violence Prevention Programme' will also be introduced in more schools.  A rape and sexual abuse support service in England and Wales is also receiving a boost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/domestic-abuse-violence-against-women-scotland-action-plan-extension-a8650146.html Domestic abuse action plan to be extended in Scotland] ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Most refuges do not have disabled access though disabled women are more likely to experience domestic abuse than able bodied women.  One in ten refuge places is accessible to domestic violence victims with physical disabilities.  Out of 131 councils 20 had no accessible places at all.  16.8% of women with chronic sickness or disability suffer domestic abuse compared to 6.3% of able bodied women.  Domestic abuse can incvolve physical, sexual or emotional abuse, also not providing care from people with long lasting sickness or disability.  Council funding for women's refuges overall fell by 6% over the five years to 2018 data from 144 out of 210 UK councils contacted reveals.  The largest reduction in spending on domestic violence refuges was from Southampton City Council, which cut spending by 65% since 2013/4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46371441 Why disabled women can't access all refuges] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Halang''', also known as '''Salang''', is a [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric language]] of the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] branch of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]]. It is spoken in the southern [[Laos|Laotian]] province of [[Attapu Province|Attapu]] by approximately 4,000 people and in the neighboring [[Kon Tum Province]] of [[Vietnam]] by approximately 20,000 people.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; In Vietnam, Halang is spoken in Đắk Na Commune, [[Đắk Tô]] District, [[Kon Tum Province]] (Lê et. al 2014:175)&lt;ref&gt;Lê Bá Thảo, Hoàng Ma, et. al; Viện hàn lâm khoa học xã hội Việt Nam - Viện dân tộc học. 2014.

In more specific usage, ''Halang'' refers to the dialect spoken in Vietnam, whereas ''Salang'' refers to the dialect spoken in Laos. Halang or [[Salang (language)|Salang]] may also serve as an ethnonym for members of the [[ethnic group]] that speak the language. However, in Vietnam, the Halang speakers are officially classified as a subgroup of the larger [[Xo Dang people|Sedang]] ethnicity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7174">{{Close relationships}}
In [[sociology]], '''heterosociality''' describes social relations with persons of the opposite sex or a preference for such relations, often excluding relationships of a [[Romance (love)|romantic]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beere |first=Carole A. |title=Sex and Gender Issues: A Handbook of Tests and Measures |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1990 |isbn=0-313-27462-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJy49uyFEwoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of heterosociality is [[homosociality]].

At an institutional level, the spread of heterosociality, epitomized by the entrance of women into public life/space, is closely associated with the progress of [[modernization]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Singer, ''Melodrama and Modernity'' (2001) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
The term ''heterosocial'' can refer to either:
* an individual who prefers to befriend or socialize with the opposite sex, as opposed to homosocial (preferring same-sex social relations) or [[bisocial]] (enjoying social relations with both sexes)
* a social relationship between two people who are of different sexes, as opposed to homosocial (of the same sex).

Whether the term can be applied to groups of three or more people has been disputed.  One possible argument is that such a group is homosocial if composed of people of a single sex, and bisocial if composed of people of both sexes, since in the latter case each member will be interacting with people of both sexes.  On the other hand, ''Collins English Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/heterosocial|title=Definition of "heterosocial" - Collins English Dictionary|work=collinsdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines '''heterosocial''' as "relating to or denoting mixed-sex social relationships", without specification of whether it applies to relationships between two people or among larger groups, suggesting that the term can describe social interactions involving people of both sexes more generally.

==Historical developments==
The pervasiveness of heterosociality in contemporary life can lead to the obscuring of its [[Social constructivism|social construction]] as a late development in Western history. Writing of early society, [[Freud]] considered that there was "an unmistakable tendency to keep the sexes apart. Women live with women, men with men".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; [[Durkheim]] associated sexual [[totemism]], binding men and women into two separate totemic corporations, with such a social division of the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 165-6&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the twentieth century, rules of etiquette in some traditional villages dictated that men and women do not greet each other when passing in public.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (1971) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Urbanization]] and modernization have seen a gradual erosion of the barriers to male/female socialising, not without significant [[culture war]]s along the way over each particular new arena. Thus for example part of the hostility to the Elizabethan theatre lay in the fact that men and women freely intermingled in its audience;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Greenblatt, ''Will in the World'' (2005) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; while dance halls and cabarets later offered similarly controversial new areas for heterosocial interaction,&lt;ref&gt;Mark P. Holt, ''Alcohol: A Social and Cultural History'' (2006) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; as too did [[amusement parks]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Peiss, ''Cheap Amusements'' (1987) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the challenge presented to traditional societies by the way the discourse of [[modernity]] encourages heterosociality over an older homosociality continues to be a live issue.&lt;ref&gt;N. Naghibi, ''Rethinking Global Sisterhood'' (2007) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on feminism==
The 20th century opening up of the public sphere to women&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Craig, ''The Face of Fashion'' (1994) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;—work, politics, culture, education—both fuelled, and was fed by, the [[feminist movement]]; but the increase in heterosociality which accompanied it was seen as double-edged by many feminists. On the one hand, it served to undercut older feminist homosocial bonds and support systems;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Layleff, ''Wash and be Healed'' (1991) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; on the other, it split the new feminist movement, as calls for [[separatist feminism]] challenged heterosociality, let alone heterosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Walby, ''The Future of Feminism'' (2011) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; in ways many found unacceptable.

[[Post-feminism]] has generally accepted heterosociality, along with a new strategy of [[gender mainstreaming]], but not without reservations as to the exploitative aspects of (for example) [[raunch culture]] within the new 21st century public gender regime.&lt;ref&gt;Walby, p. 20 and p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adolescence==
Acquiring heterosocial competence is a key adolescent task.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. R. Levesque, ''Encyclopedia of Adolescence'' (2011) p. 1302&lt;/ref&gt; Other-sex friendships, even more than romances, can play a key role in this process.&lt;ref&gt;Levesque, p. 1297-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Different societies and different [[subculture]]s place varying restrictions upon adolescent heterosocial roles and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (1972) p. 269–70&lt;/ref&gt; American [[youth culture|teen culture]] in particular has been seen as aggressively promoting heterosociality over homosociality.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wilson/D. Lavery, ''Fighting the Forces'' (2002) p. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The advancement of culture was seen by [[Henry James]] as linked to heterosociality.&lt;ref&gt;Beverly Havilland, ''Henry James's Last Romance'' (1997) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Kenneth Clark]] saw the flourishing of 18th-century French culture as rooted in the heterosociality of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, ''Civilisation'' (1969) p. 251-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic conflicts==
* Postfeminist criticism of [[Buffy Summers]] as powerful female [[role model]] has centred on the heterosocial nature of her particular universe of social networks.&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Jowett, ''Sex and The Slayer'' (2005) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-sex relationships play a predominant part in the Buffy world, foreclosing more politicised readings&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, p. 49 and p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; from a feminist viewpoint.
* [[Virginia Woolf]] wrote an early essay on the pleasures of heterosociality—of finding "much to say to each other which neither would say to a person of the same sex".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hermione Lee, ''Virginia Woolf'' (1996) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bloomsbury group]] as a whole can be seen as a heterosocial construct, formed in opposition to the more segregated sexual worlds of the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 161 and p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8903">Germany is a European source, point of transit, organization and destination country for women, children, and men subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2014/226728.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2015/243443.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Germany complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but has not implemented European Union recommendations to reduce sexual slavery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/germany-too-lax-on-human-trafficking/a-16724634&lt;/ref&gt; The government made substantial progress in addressing forced labor. Available statistics indicate the majority of convicted labor and sex trafficking offenders were not required to serve time in prison, raising concerns that punishments were inadequate to deter traffickers.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Germany". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 1"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Victims ==

Ninety percent of identified victims of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation came from Europe, including 28 percent from Germany, 20 percent from Romania, and 18 percent from Bulgaria. Non-European victims originated in Nigeria, other parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Almost one-quarter of identified trafficking victims were children. The majority of identified sex trafficking victims have been exploited in bars, brothels, and apartments – approximately one third of identified sex trafficking victims reported that they had agreed initially to engage in prostitution. Victims of forced labor have been identified in hotels, domestic service, construction sites, and restaurants. Police estimate that gangs brought around 1,000 Chinese people to Germany over the past decade and forced them to work in restaurants under exploitative conditions. Members of ethnic minorities, such as Roma, as well as foreign unaccompanied minors who arrived in Germany, were particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.

== Prosecution ==

Most convicted traffickers are not required to serve time in prison, however, the Government of Germany made some progress regarding the conviction of sex and labor trafficking offenders. Germany prohibits all forms of trafficking; trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation is criminalized in Section 232 of its Penal Code, and forced labor is criminalized under Section 233. Prescribed punishments in these statutes range from six months’ to 10 years’ imprisonment.

It is common practice for judges in Germany to suspend prison sentences of two years or less for all crimes, including trafficking. Authorities prosecuted 173 persons for sex trafficking in 2008, the last year for which statistics were available. Of those, 138 were convicted, including seven juveniles, up from 123 convictions for sex trafficking in 2007. Of the 131 adults convicted, 92 – or 70 percent – received either a fine or a suspended sentence. Prison sentences for the remainder ranged from two to 10 years imprisonment.

Authorities prosecuted 25 persons for labor trafficking in 2008; 16 were convicted, including seven juveniles, up from eight labor trafficking convictions in 2007. Of the nine adult labor trafficking offenders, one received a sentence of between three and five years imprisonment and the remaining eight received suspended sentences or fines. Police boosted efforts against labor trafficking in 2008—more than 1,300 police officers and customs officials took part in raids in several cities. There were no reports of trafficking-related complicity of government officials during the reporting period. The government, in partnership with NGOs, provided a range of specialized anti-trafficking training to judges, prosecutors, and police. The federal criminal police counter-trafficking office coordinated international trafficking cases and promoted partnership with other countries by offering training programs for foreign law enforcement.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==

The German government provided economical means with a value of €500,000 for victim protection during the reporting period. The Federal Family Ministry used the funds to capitalize an umbrella organization representing 39 NGOs and counseling centers that provided or facilitated shelter, medical and psychological care, legal assistance, and other services for victims. The majority of these NGOs focused on adult, female victims; however, a number of NGOs, in cooperation with local governmental youth welfare services, also attended to child victims. Some of these NGOs also made their services available to male victims. The government continued to distribute formal guidelines on victim identification techniques to police, counseling centers, prosecutors and judges. According to the federal police, authorities pro-actively identified 38 percent of all victims registered by the government in 2008. Authorities registered 676 sex trafficking victims and 96 forced labor victims in 2008, down from 689 sex trafficking victims and 101 forced labor victims identified in 2007. Formal victim referral mechanisms existed in 12 out of 16 German states. The government publicly encourages victims to cooperate in anti-trafficking investigations; however, police and NGOs reported that victims were often reluctant to assist law enforcement officials due to fear of retribution from traffickers. The government provided legal alternatives to foreign victims’ deportation to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Trafficking victims were provided a 30-day reflection period to decide whether to cooperate with investigators.

Victims who agreed to act as witnesses were only provided temporary residence permits for the duration of trial proceedings, and in very rare circumstances long-term residence permits, such as when the victim faced severe threats in the country of origin.

The government reportedly did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. The governmental German Institute for Human Rights in July 2009 began a $800,000 project to assist trafficking victims in claiming their financial rights in German courts, as some victims had made claims for financial compensation.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==

The government made some progress in trafficking prevention activities during the reporting period. The government sustained funding for NGOs that produced public awareness campaigns in Germany and abroad through websites, postcards, telephone hotlines, pamphlets, and speaking engagements.

The government did not take measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or focus public awareness on potential clients in some of Germany’s best known red light districts, such as the one in Hamburg. A Berlin NGO, funded largely by the [[Senate of Berlin|Berlin Senate]], operated a trafficking awareness website directed at clients of the sex trade. The German Federal Police published an annual report containing statistics about its anti-trafficking activities. The Labor Ministry commissioned a study in 2009 to assess the extent of and government response to labor trafficking. The Federal Family Ministry, which has the responsibility for implementing the national anti-trafficking action plan, chaired a federal-state interagency working group on female sex trafficking. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs contributed approximately $297,000 toward anti-trafficking projects in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Mekong region. The government sustained a partnership with ECPAT to promote awareness of the child sex tourism problem; there were no reports of new prosecutions for child sex tourism by German citizens abroad during the reporting period. The government provided trafficking awareness training to commanders of German military units prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions; the training focused on how the commanders could sensitize subordinates to human trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The Ijigban is one of the twenty-two districts found in [[Idoma land]] today. It occupies a land stretching from the southernmost part of Idoma to the fringes of Igbo land particularly, the [[Abakaliki Division]]. They fall within borderline of the [[Idoma people|Idoma ethnic group]] and the Ezza/Izze in the Northern part of [[Igbo land]]. The 2006 census figures numbered the [[Ijigban people]] to about 22,360. The people lived on a long bounded Northwest by the Igumale; Ulayi in the West; Utonkon in the North; Ekele and Igede to the Northeast and the Ezza/Izze Igbo in the south. The district is however located at the southernmost part of Ado local government area, and consisted of seven clans namely (according to seniority). Okpe, Ipole, Ehaje, Ogongo, Adegemi, Onogwu and Ai-Okpan, that collectively made up of two political wards.

The traditions of origin of the Ijigban, like the traditions of origins of many Nigerian, including the Idoma peoples as a whole is highly problematic. The word "Origins" in the strict anthropological sense refers to the emergence of a species of either plant or animal as distinct from another species". Traditions of origin in the context of Ijigban here are stories which people use to explain where their ancestors came from. As well as how they arrived at the place they presently occupy. Although traditions of origins often time yield towards the Hamitic hypothesis. The case of the Ijigban people of the southern Ado is quite unique, given evidence under available sources. In this wise, we shall adopt a comprehensive approaches to examine the various versions of the Ijigban’s traditions of origin.

==Who are the Ijigbans?==
The origin of this people forms a complex aspect of their pre-colonial historical information. Some of the earlier sources including the colonial once are mostly inadequate and contradicting. For instance, in attempt to trace this people’s origin, A.G. Armstrong asserted that the people of Ijigban, Ekele and Ulayi traced their traditions of origins to the Ngor in Ogoja province and are closely related. He therefore quoted Simey "that the Igumale, Ulayi, Agila and Ijigban are closely related, and all entered the area at about the same time and there are definite boundaries between these clans based on hunting right". His description of the people by name referred to as "Ijigbam-Ishieke" was not only contradicting but also has generated derogatory pitfall because, while the Ijigban people are one section of the original Idoma, the same could not be true about the Ishieke people of the Abakaliki. So how come "Ijigbam-Ishieke"? In another dimension, the Agila and the Ijigban (including Igumale, Ulayi and Utonkon alike) did not come to this present abode at the same time as claimed by Simey and supported by A.G. Armstrong. Reason been that while Agila traced the traditional of origin to "western origins" C. 165-1775, the Ijigban alongside Igumale attributed theirs to "Eastern origins" C. 1535–1745. For instance, according to E.O Erim, "The modern Agila district in Idomaland recalled that their ancestor Ago, who moved out from areas south of Idah C. 1625 – 1655, was of Bini extraction. He was the son of an unnamed Oba of Benin". The point we are trying to put across here, is that while Ijigban, Igumale claimed Apa as their traditional home land, the people of Agila may ignore that. At this juncture, R.G. Armstrong account could be say to be devoid of empirical historical fact.

R. G. Armstrong for one reason failed to understand that Ijigban who begot the seven sons that made up seven clans of Ijigban district today is begotten by Ogene, and Ogene a son of great Edor who traced his ancestral homeland to Apa 1 that is presently occupied by the Tiv. On the other hand, the Ishieke (as earlier observed) is a sub-clan of Izzi – Igbo who for all historical evidence have nothing to do with Idoma traditions of origins. If the Ijigban people are different from Izzi sub-clan (Ishieke) Igbo, where then was the origins of "Ijigbam-Ishieke"? From this above evidence (or called it myth), it is possible that the nomenclature ‘Ijigbam-Ishieke’ came as a result of the colonial "pacification" of the area, just like the early travelers and colonial officers referred to the whole Idoma as "Akpoto". Nonetheless, ignoring this biasness, his (R.G Armstrong) work is still a valuable source of information.

However, according to one informant, Chief Oriri Otseje (the District Head and Custodian of Ijigban History), As a result of the last war fought in Apa 1, (What Ochefu referred to as horse war), sacked heroes such as Ago, Ale and Edor, and that these leaders on the basis of hunting rights, founded their various settlements.

Another informant said that the traditions of origin of the Ijigban could be traced to Apa. Although, no particular historical period was given but that they migrated from Apa and they settled at various places including Izzekatton (or Izzekato) near Iyala in Cross-River for many years. Problems developed in Izzekatton as a result of Izze several attacks. He finally concludes thus; We met the Izze arrived after our ancestors. Soon, the Izze started menacing us (our ancestors) destroying their crops and domestic animals. Menace lasted for some years. The Izze killed several of our people. When the Izze overpowered my ancestor, the latter fled to another settlement called Iyede. He notes Iyede to be the present day Nyimegu where Izzegodo live today in North East part of Abakaliki. Resulting from push and pull factors, especially lacked of water and continuous Ezza disturbances, the Ijigban in a process of hunting found a stream where they later migrated to, because of the availability of water. He referred to this settlement as Ole-Efuu (native home). At Ole-Efuu, an Englishman whose name was not disclosed, demanded that Agbo who was then their king should crossed the stream and settled in present-day Ijigban District where his subjects in an earnest joined him.

Erim O. Erim also acknowledges these facts when he expresses that within the period C. 1685-1805, various invasion were made on Apa 1. He further agrees that; the Tiv whose demand for land and food always seemed to be insatiable. It is thus clear that it was the Tiv invasion which forced several Idoma groups to abandon their Apa 1 homeland and migrated to the south. At the south, there were the challenges of refugees as a result of "severe famine" in the present day Igumale. Though Ale during this famine had already established an extensive corn-farm (igu) and shortly, the corn got finished thereby forcing out other refugees to migrated further south looking for protection and safety. Also agreed with elder Onoja Agbo’s oral account, "that the Ijigban migrated from Izzekatto and Iyede due to unending problems", Erim established that; between C. 1685–1805 of the last phase of the eastern origins, five kindred’s came north moving away from unrest in Abakaliki region… fights for land between the various inhabitants of that country.

Note that the essence of this comparism account is to arrive at acceptable empirical historical evidence. From the above explanation also, the traditions of origin and migration of this people (Ijigban) could be seen as gradual process unlike the first version of Armstrong that "the people of Ijigban, Ekele and Ulayi came from Ngor in Ogoga province and are closely related". Indeed, according to intensive socio-political and economic interactions between the Ijigban and the Ishieke people in the pre-colonial period prior to colonial advent would have promoted a group like "Ijigbam-Ishieke". Added to the ongoing, Ochefu noted that the Ijigban (but spelled Ijigbam in his work), Agila, recognize "Apa" as their ancestral homeland from where they migrated to their present location. From every indication, by the middle of the eighteenth century, these proto-Idoma (of which Ijigban is included) groups, which claimed "eastern origins" had been pushed by a variety of factors into their second and from their second into a third homeland, of what could be regarded as modern settlement. And by 1800, the southern Portions (which Ijigban is a part) of modern Idomaland had already been settled. On the departure, the Ijigbam among other six Idoma kindred’s, adopted the Black monkey totem (iho) as part of indication of royal kindreds in Apa1. As noted earlier, the major cause of this migration was the invasion of the Tiv who were in process of incorporating the whole of Apa 1 into their homeland. Coincidentally, the expansion of the Keana Confederacy and troubles in Abakaliki to the south added to the pressures on the Idoma, inducing them to move.

==Settlement pattern and development of Ijigban district==
Settlement is a major component of rural land use and created in space for the purpose of living as well as a basis for man’s economic and political activities geared towards growth and development. By this, we mean that settlements are man’s first step towards self-adaptation to his envirionment33. Human settlement patterns involve physical and socio-economic or cultural factors. These two sets of factors determine the stable nature of interaction among the people and outside the district.

The settlement patterns and development of Ijigban District is based on their respective clans (Ipo-opu). But firstly, what is Ijigban district today could be traced to advent of colonial administration and the arrival of Captain John A.D.O. (Administrator Divisional Officer) at Okpoga Native Authority on 23 March, 192134. Consequently, the Okpoga Native Authority was moved to Otukpo on 7 February 1924, later Idoma Native Authority where the twenty-two (Including Ijigban) districts in Idomaland were recognised.

However, the Ijigban’s seven sons made up of the seven clans (Ipo-Opu) whose settlements are separated from each other respectively. These seven clans are according to seniority; Okpe clan who settled in the north-east of Ijigban and have boundaries with Ogogo (North), Ai-Okpan (East) and Onogwu and part of Ehaje in the centre; The Ipole live at the entrance (i.e. south west) and have – boundaries with Adegemi and part of Ogogo-Ole-Ogaba-Ede; Ehaje settled in the center stretching to the South and Ogogo at the North Adegemi is in between Ipole and Ogogo; Onogwu in south east respectively. Each of these clans (Ipo-Opu) further developed an out skirt settlements. For instance, Odumuke is an out skirt of Ipole, just like Anmeka is for Ehaje etc.

In Ijigban, the compound (Ododa-Ole) layouts shows that the majority of the houses face inwards onto one or more court-yards. Each compound may be occupied by members of an extended family or by a man, his wife and siblings. One or more junior men may assert their independence by settling up their compounds.

However, streets are not named or numbered in Ijigban, and visitors to the town often have to rely on elaborate description of the location of houses. Having said all these generally, the settlement pattern is naturally lineal in most cases quite unlike Igumale and Agila, and clustered to one another with motorable road at the middle. Not until the 1990s, most of the houses were thatched roof characterized with local mud’s with distinctive style of compound. Each clan has its own playground (Ofu) where dances, festival gatherings and meetings are held and paths lead from this playground (Ofu) to the various compounds that make up the quarter, that is the clan. In each of these clans, the name of the group is usually quite literally "the sons of… (ai). The clan (Ipoopu) here means" those of one playground or council ground.
Among the factors that led to the gradual development process of Ijigban district was economic. Markets were organized often four to five days interval where household items, out of surpluses and demand were exchanged. Agricultural practices such as communal and cooperative farming (Igbe-Opiatoha) among Age-set associations facilitated the development. As opined by Gordon Childe and popularized by Erim; …invention of agriculture automatically brought about surplus food which enabled groups of people to divorce themselves from food production and devote attention to other occupations. This situation created extensive division of labour… it was from this occupational specialization that political integration emerged.

With the conducive atmosphere and availability of food, settlement was encouraged, men and women encouraged to engaged on activities that geared toward development. The inter and intra marriages also played vital role in the developmental process. Settlement due to the above factors become complex, in addition to emergence of schools in the area. Before the civil war, schools at the elementary level mostly class 4 and 6 prevailed through efforts of some indigenes. One informant stated that;… We used our money to buy schools (that is 3 pounds) and teachers… we housed and fed them…He maintained that first school in the district was the initiative of Chief Agbo, located at Abizzen (present Ipole). He acknowledged the Chief (Oche) as hardworking man, who before colonial advent had transverse across borders. He was also the tax-collector during the colonial period and was a member of Idoma council of Chiefs (1929–1933 where he was known as Agboonma) representing Ijigban district. Other initiators of schools in this area were Eji Oduma (for Odumuke School, Oriri Otseje (for Anmeka School) The later Catholic school as also established at Anmeka by Basel Otseje after his arrival from the popular Burma war (that is the Second World War 1939-1945) although collapsed due to the prevailing Oriri’s school. It is important to note that all the first phase of the developmental plans and achievements were destroyed during the Nigerian civil war (1967–1970).

The development of Ijigban district which would be described as second phase, came on board probably two years after the civil war. Period coincided will the installation of Chief Oriri Otseje on 26 April 1972. However, since the 1970s, gradual development were remarkable including two primary schools, bore-hole of various capacity as well as the propose electricity. Attempt of building a secondary school since the 1980s failed, except that of recent Universal Basic Education (UBE) programme which can be found in its embryonic stage at the moment.

Finally the advent of modern networking and the expansion of subsistence economy coincided with its monetization and introduction of new modern communications like road and networking services, contributed to the growth and development of the Ijigban district. The settlement pattern did not only which not only ensures proximity to work place but subsequently reduces the amount of energy spent on conquering distance since the community travels primarily on foot to farm and market as the case may be.

From the preceding, the chapter has examined the location of Ijigban and also accounted for the physical geographical features. It has traced the origin of the people through different accounts. It has sought to amended the nomenclature "Ijigbam-Ishieke" by foreigners (especially Simey and R.G. Armstrong). Whatever the case may be, settlement pattern and how it has led to gradual development of the district has also be noted. It has held that the development of the district came in two phases: Before and after the Nigerian civil war (1967–1970).

==Language==
In determining and ascertaining the general extent of linguistic diversity of a locality in any given socio-linguistic survey, one is often confronted with the methodological problem of accurate identification, isolation, classification and enumeration of the various languages, dialects and sublets concerned.
This difficulty is compounded by the lack of clear distinction between the concepts of 'language' and 'ethnicity'. Over the years, linguists have increasingly reasoned with P. K. Bleambo's position that language and ethnicity are neither coincidental nor coterminous 46. This suggests in essence that some ethnic groups and their indigenes should be considered more as dialect clusters of the language of some larger ethno-cultural groups. The case of the Ijigban  is evident enough in this regard.

Studies in historical and comparative linguistics have empirically shown that Ijigban  for all intents and purposes is a linguistic and not an ethnic appellation. The Ijigban predominantly speaks the Abize’s language – a subsidiary of the Idoma tongue.

==The Ijigban traditional clans==
The ijigban consists of seven clans namely
# Ipole
# Ehaje
# Ogongo
# Adegimi
# Onoguw
# Ai'okpan
# Okpe
Each clan is traditionally governed by the clan’s head regarded as "Ejira".
The ijigban as a community is headed by the district head regarded as the "oche' ijigban" who is often regarded as the custodian of the ijigban tradition

==The Ijigban Culture and traditions==
The ijigban community celebrates three yearly cultural festivals namely
# Eronunu (new yam festival) - celebrated every September
# Arigwu - celebrated every July
# Egbedogwu - celebrated every June
The cultural practice by the ijigban community varies from clan to clan. While the people of Ipole, Ehaje, Onogwu, Okpe, Adegimi, and Ai’okpan warship unaroko as the idole of their fore-fathers, the Ogongo people idoled Arikwu.

==Personality and political leaders in Ijigban==
Hon Chief Aboh Edeh became the first elected chairman of Ado LGC from Ijigban Origin. Notable Personalities from Ijigban are Hon. Agbo Aboh (frontline graduate and the first executive chairman of Ado from Ijigban origin), Hon. Emmanuel Oketa (Late) (once a powerful political block and mobilizer),  Engr Simon Oketa, Hon. (Dr.) Francis Ottah Agbo, Hon. Barr Alexander Oketa. Other notable persons are  Patrick Onumah, Sunday Orinya, Evang. Sunday Onah, Amos Odega, Hon A. P Oketa and numerous others.

'''Indo-Guyanese''' or '''Indian-Guyanese''', are [[Guyanese people]] with heritage from the [[Indian subcontinent]] (including modern-day [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]]). Linguistically, they are historical speakers of North Indian [[Indo-Aryan languages]] such as [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Punjabi Language|Punjabi]] and [[Bhojpuri]], however some Indian immigrants also historically spoke South Indian [[Dravidian languages]] such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. As immigrants, Indo-Guyanese people originated from different parts of [[India]] and they have traditionally been known as ''Indians'' in Guyana. Indo-Guyanese are the largest ethnic group in Guyana identified by the official census, making up 39.8% of the population in 2012.

==History==
On May 5, 1838, the year of finalized abolition [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|slave emancipation]] in the [[British West Indies]] and the beginning of the [[Indian indenture system|indentured labor system]], 396 Indian immigrants popularly known as the 'Gladstone Coolies' landed in [[British Guiana]] (now Guyana) from Calcutta (now [[Kolkata]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/basdeo-mangru/indian-labour-british-guiana|title=Indian Labour in British Guiana - History Today|website=www.historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of the indenture system which was to continue for over three-quarters of a century and whose essential features were very reminiscent of slavery. Within a decade Indian immigration was largely responsible for changing the fortunes of the sugar industry, the mainstay of the economy, from the predicted 'ruin' to prosperity.

Up to the early 1860s recruits in North India were drawn from in and around Calcutta and from the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau|Chota Nagpur]] plateau, a sub-division of the [[Bengal Presidency]] about two to three hundred miles from Calcutta . Recruiting operations were pushed further north-westwards and the North-Western Provinces and Oudh (Modern [[Uttar Pradesh]]) and [[Bihar]] became the main suppliers of colonial labor.

The importation of labor from the Indian subcontinent was part of a continuing search by Guianese planters for a labor force that was docile, reliable and amenable to discipline under harsh, tropical conditions. Emancipation had conferred on the Guianese laborers both physical and occupational mobility. The majority of Indian immigrants were drawn from small villages in [[North India]] with smaller batches coming from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] districts of [[South India]]. They were recruited, very often on spurious promises, by professional recruiters, largely assisted by paid local agents called "Arkatis" in North India and "Maistris" in South India.

This system of recruitment by local agents formed the backbone of all recruiting operations from the inception of the system to its cessation in 1917. Intimidation, coercion, and deception were very often used to recruit Indian laborers. Women, in particular, were very vulnerable. When laborers were difficult to enlist, the recruiters resorted to such illegal practices as kidnapping and forced detention. Many recruited to be shipped off the Caribbean, were falsely advised on where they were heading. Names of places would be altered, to fit a higher meaning. For example, recruiters told migrants, heading to Dutch Suriname they were heading to Sri-Ram, instead of Suriname, taking into account, Ram in the Hindu religion means, a religious place where good triumphs evil.&lt;ref&gt;Roopnarine, Lomarsh, "East Indian Indentured Emigration to the Caribbean: Beyond the Push and Pull Model," ''Caribbean Studies'', 31:2, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a need for labor, after the slave emancipation within British territory in 1834, the recruited Indian immigrants set sail for Guiana and other British West Indian territories. Upon arrival, the newly transplanted indentured servants were forced to adapt to extreme tropical conditions, along with their new working contract working conditions. Between 1835 and 1918, 341,600 indentured laborers from India were imported into British Guiana.&lt;ref&gt;Despres, Leo, "Differential Adaptions and Micro-Cultural Evolution in Guyana," ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology'', 25:1, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increase of Indians laborers, hostility and fear of being undermined derived from the existing working class of newly free slaves in British Guiana. Treatment of the newly arrived immigrants was horrendous, and they were pushed into isolated communities.&lt;ref&gt;Roopnarine, Lomarsh, "East Indian Indentured Emigration to the Caribbean: Beyond the Push and Pull Model," ''Caribbean Studies'', 31:2, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The indentured servants were required to sign a contract, the terms binding their service to a plantation for five years, while earning a fixed daily wage. Once this five-year period had passed, they would have another five years of industrial residence in Guiana, then they were entitled to free repatriation. At the end of the contract, laborers either returned to India or stayed in British Guiana. Those who stayed received land and money to create their own businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Roopnarine, Lomarsh, "East Indian Indentured Emigration to the Caribbean: Beyond the Push and Pull Model," ''Caribbean Studies'', 31:2, 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospect of sexual relations with Indian women was at first unappealing to the original mostly male [[Chinese Guyanese|Chinese]] migrants to Guyana even though there was a lack of Chinese women.The prospect of sexual relations with Chinese men was not only unappealing but frowned upon by Indians. Economic circumstances and lack of opportunity for Indian women to find Indian partners gave the women no choice.  Eventually their attitude changed and Indian women and Chinese men established sexual relationships with each other as happened in [[Mauritian of Chinese origin#Migration history|Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=272–273|year=1995|accessdate=June 1, 2015|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|volume=Volume 22 of McGill-Queen's studies in ethnic history|issn=0846-8869|edition=illustrated|author=Brian L.

Over time, although there were more Creole marriages with Chinese, there was a growth of Indian marriages with Chinese. In 1891, Dr. Comins reported that "[i]t is not an uncommon thing to find a cooly woman living with a Chinaman as his wife, and in one or two instances the woman has accompanied her reputed husband to China", with six Indian women marrying Chinese men in 1892 as reported by The Immigration Report for 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=210|edition=illustrated|pages=|year=1993|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=|author=Walton Look Lai|editor=|quote=|location=|title=Indentured labor, Caribbean sugar: Chinese and Indian migrants to the British West Indies, 1838-1918|series=Johns Hopkins studies in Atlantic history and culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QJCxAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=and+to+one+another,+Chinese-Indian+unions+increased,+although+probably+more+slowly+than+Chinese-Creole+unions.+By+1891,+Dr.+Comins+was+saying,+%22It+is+not+an+uncommon+thing+to+find+a+cooly+woman+living+with+a+Chinaman+as+his+wife,+and+in+one+or+two+instances+the+woman+has+accompanied+her+reputed+husband+to+China.%2269+The+Immigration+Report+for+1892+reported+six+marriages+between+Chinese+men+and+Indian+women+in+British+Guiana.&amp;dq=and+to+one+another,+Chinese-Indian+unions+increased,+although+probably+more+slowly+than+Chinese-Creole+unions.+By+1891,+Dr.+Comins+was+saying,+%22It+is+not+an+uncommon+thing+to+find+a+cooly+woman+living+with+a+Chinaman+as+his+wife,+and+in+one+or+two+instances+the+woman+has+accompanied+her+reputed+husband+to+China.%2269+The+Immigration+Report+for+1892+reported+six+marriages+between+Chinese+men+and+Indian+women+in+British+Guiana.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4E6UVdy2HoHysAXo7ozYBA&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA|isbn=0801844657}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=350|pages=|year=1995|accessdate=June 1, 2015|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|volume=Volume 22 of McGill-Queen's studies in ethnic history|issn=0846-8869|edition=illustrated|author=Brian L.

==Culture==
Unlike the African slaves, the East Indian indentured workers were permitted to retain some of their cultural traditions. But the process of assimilation has made the culture of the modern Indo-Guyanese more homogeneous than that of their  immigrant ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/guyana/30.htm|title=Guyana - Indo-Guyanese|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural origins and religion===
Between 1838 and 1917 over 500 ship voyages with  238,909 indentured Indian immigrants came to Guyana; while just 75,898 of them or their children returned.  The vast majority came from the Hindustani (or Hindi) speaking areas of North India. The most popular dialect spoken was Bhojpuri (spoken in east Uttar Pradesh and west Bihar), followed by Awadhi (spoken in central Uttar Pradesh).  62% of the immigrants came from districts that are now part of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh; 21% from districts that are now part of Bihar state; 6% were from pre-partitioned Bengal; 3% from what are today Orissa and Jharkhand states; 3% from what is today Tamil Nadu state; 3% from Central India, 1% from pre-partitioned Punjab - and the remaining 1% from the rest of India.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Indenture documents show Hindu by caste: 11% were Brahmin, Bhumihar, Chatri, Rajput and Thakur castes; 1% were of the merchant or writer castes; 30% were of the medium agricultural castes; 9% were of the artisan castes; 2% were of the petty trading castes; 2% were of fishermen and boatmen castes; 25% were from menial or dalit castes; 3% were Hindus who were Madrasis; 2% were Hill Coolies or Tribals. The only acknowledgment the colonial government and the plantation managers gave to caste differences was their distrust of the [[Brahmins]] as potential leaders.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Indian people|East Indian]] workers were housed together and placed in work gangs without consideration of caste, and no solidified caste groups survived the early colonial period.

===Festivals and holidays===

Guyanese Hindus continue to observe holidays such as Phagwah also known outside the country as [[Holi]] (burning of [[Holika]]) and [[Diwali]] (festival of lights) among others while Muslims celebrate the holidays [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infosurhoy.com/cocoon/saii/xhtml/en_GB/features/saii/features/society/2011/02/11/feature-02|title=Infosurhoy|website=infosurhoy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through British influence, celebrating holidays such as [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]], is common regardless of religious beliefs. In [[Guyana]], [[Indian Arrival Day]] is celebrated on May 5 commemorating the first arrival of indentured servants from [[India]] to the country, on May 5, 1838.  On this day, the workers arrived to work in [[Sugar plantations#Sugar|sugar plantations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overseasindian.in/2006/apr/news/24dia4.shtml|title=overseasindian.in|website=www.overseasindian.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Among Hindus and Muslims, arranged, comparatively early marriages were common in rural areas until the modern period (early 1960s) but are rare now. Middle-class Indians had greater freedom in choosing a spouse, especially if the woman was a professional. As in most parts of the western world marriage now occurs later, and the family unit is smaller than in the past. Indo Guyanese families are patriarchal with an extended system, where family members assist each other, like many other groups in Guyana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ge-It/Guyana.html|title=Culture of Guyana - history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social|website=www.everyculture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For individuals who are Hindu, wedding ceremonies are now performed with the bride and groom dressed in traditional Indian clothing, as an expression of their culture. If it can be afforded there is usually a Hindu wedding ceremony and also a western or "regular" wedding reception, or a small Hindu ceremony and a much larger "reception" so friends from the larger community can attend.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Cuisine===
With the blending of cultures in the Caribbean Indo Caribbean dishes became one of the dominant notes throughout most of the English Caribbean, with dishes such as curry and roti, [[dal]] [[puri (food)|puri]]. Dishes that survived the colonial period include [[gulab jamun]], [[parasad]], [[kheer]] known as "sweet rice", and seven curry, and other dishes associated with religious functions. In Guyana, among the Indo-Guyanese people, it is popular to eat fried vegetables such as [[okra]] or "okro", [[pumpkin]], [[bitter melon]] or "karela", [[long beans]] or "bora", and [[eggplant]] known as "baigan" or "balanjay."     {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Entertainment===

The Indo-Guyanese community has always had great admiration for [[Bollywood]], the Hindi film industry. Bollywood movies and songs have had a huge impact upon the Guyanese pop culture since the early 1950s. Many Bollywood stars have visited and performed in Guyana like megastars [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Juhi Chawla]], and [[Preity Zinta]], also very popular singers such as [[Sonu Nigam]], [[Alka Yagnik]], [[Shreya Ghoshal]], [[Udit Narayan]], [[Sunidhi Chauhan]], and [[Kumar Sanu]] have had very successful shows in Guyana.In 1980, [[Lata Mangeshkar]], one of the most beloved singers in Guyana, was greeted with crowds of fans and was presented with the key of the city of [[Georgetown, Guyana]] on her visit. Indian soap operas have recently grown in popularity in Guyana. The most popular genres of music among Indo-Guyanese people include [[Chutney music]], [[Soca music]], [[Indian music]], and [[Chutney soca]]. Popular music artists include [[Sundar Popo]], [[Terry Gajraj]], [[Rakesh Yankaran]], and most definitely [[Babla &amp; Kanchan]]. Indian instrumental influence can be seen in Guyana through the use of the [[tabla]], [[harmonium]], [[dholak]], [[dhantal]], and [[tassa]] drums.

===Miss Guyana===
Indo-Guyanese women have always been a great asset to beauty pageants in Guyana. Most notable Miss Guyana is [[Shakira Baksh]], the 1967 Miss Guyana, who went on to become a runner-up at the [[Miss World 1967]] pageant and later married popular British actor [[Michael Caine]]. Rafieya Husain, Miss Guyana World 2014, won the ‘Beauty With a Purpose Title’, received the Miss World Caribbean, and became a contestant in the Final 10 at the [[Miss World 2014]] pageant. Alana Seebarran, Miss India Guyana, won the [[Miss India Worldwide 2012]].

'''Irving Bieber''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|b|ər}}; 1909–1991) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], best known for his study ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'' (1962), in which Bieber took the since discredited position that [[homosexuality]] is an illness.&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies"/&gt; 

==Life and career==
Irving Bieber was born in [[New York City]] and graduated from [[New York University Medical College]] in 1930. Bieber went on to work at [[Yale Medical College]], [[New York University]], and starting in 1953 at the [[New York Medical College]], where he taught a course in psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D7153FF93BA1575BC0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies | date=August 28, 1991 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bieber was, along with [[Lionel Ovesey]] and [[Charles Socarides]], one of the most influential American psychoanalysts who attempted to convert gay men to heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=LeVay, Simon |title=Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=1996 |page=75 |isbn=0-262-12199-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bieber's 1962 book ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'' was a counter reaction to the 1948 [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey Report on male sexual behavior]]. It remained the leading study on [[homosexuality]] until homosexuality was removed from [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="James Baldwin Now"&gt;William J. Spurlin, 'Culture, Rhetoric, and Queer Identity', ''James Baldwin Now'', ed. Dwight A. McBride, New York University Press, 1999, pages 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Bieber attended a meeting of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in [[San Francisco]] that was protested by [[LGBT social movements|gay activists]]. According to Socarides, Bieber, who felt he had "been working all these years to help these people", "took this very hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Socarides, Charles |title=Homosexuality: A Freedom Too Far |publisher=Adam Margrave Books |location=Phoenix |year=1995 |page=160 |isbn=0-9646642-5-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the same year the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders, Bieber told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim."&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies" /&gt; When [[Alan P. Bell]], [[Martin S. Weinberg]], and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith's study ''[[Sexual Preference (book)|Sexual Preference]]'' was published in 1981, Bieber declared that its findings were "totally disparate" with his experience from psychiatric consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brody, Jane E. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/23/us/kinsey-study-finds-homosexuals-show-early-predisposition.html?pagewanted=all | title = KINSEY STUDY FINDS HOMOSEXUALS SHOW EARLY PREDISPOSITION | accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bieber arranged a partial translation into English of a paper by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pediatrician S. Lindner, who had reported a systematic study of sucking. [[Sigmund Freud]] had used Lindner's observation that sensual sucking seems to absorb the attention completely and leads to either [[sleep]] or an [[orgasm]]-like response to develop his theory of infantile sexuality. Bieber pointed out what he saw as inaccuracies in Freud's use of this paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Macmillan, Malcolm |title=Freud Evaluated: The Completed Arc |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=1997 |page=311 |isbn=0-262-63171-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bieber died in [[Manhattan]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies"/&gt;

{{Main|Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals}}

''Homosexuality'' offered a view of homosexuality as an illness that has since been discredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Myers|first=Steven Lee|title=Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/28/nyregion/irving-bieber-80-a-psychoanalyst-who-studied-homosexuality-dies.html|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 28, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book has been criticized for examining homosexuals already in analytic treatment as opposed to non-patient heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedman, Richard C. |title=Male Homosexuality: Contemporary Psychoanalytic Perspective |publisher=Yale University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1988 |pages=36–37 |isbn=0300047452 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the study informed stereotypes later promulgated by the media.&lt;ref name="James Baldwin Now"/&gt; For example, in 1964 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;''Life'', June 26, 1964, page 68&lt;/ref&gt; featured an article on homosexuals and smothering mothers directly inspired by this study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edelman, Lee |title=Homographesis: essays in gay literary and cultural theory |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, London |year=1994 |page=166 |isbn=0415902592 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite its discrediting, ''Homosexuality'' continued to be read and taught in psychopathology courses in universities in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew88|Lewes 1988]]. pp. 184, 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] period, the two [[Baloch people|Baloch]] confederacies of Rind and Lashari (in eastern [[Balochistan]] and [[Punjab]]) remained allied with opposing powers. In the initial struggle between Emperor [[Humayun]] and [[Sher Shah Suri]] and later between Emperor Humayun and his brothers, the Rind appeared to be with Humayun, while Lashars chose to support Sher Shah and, later, the rebellious brothers of Humayun. During the confusion that followed the flight of Emperor Humayun to [[Persia]], a Baloch tribal union, headed by Fateh Khan Dodai, occupied [[Multan]]. However, after regaining the throne of India, he sent an army under the command of General Hebat Khan who, after a bloody battle, defeated the Baloch, and the Mughals retook Multan. During the reigns of Emperor Akbar the Great and Emperor Shah Jahan, Balochistan was under firm Mughal control. According to Raverty (1888), during Akbar’s reign, the Mughal governor of Multan, [[Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana]], sent many punitive expeditions against the Baloch. However, there is no mention of any significant encounter with the Baloch tribes during the reign of Emperor [[Jahangir]].

For a short period, this Baloch confederacy was also able to occupy the prosperous region of Multan. As observed earlier, during the confusion that followed the flight of Mughal Emperor Humayun to Persia, the Baloch tribal union headed by Fateh Khan Dodai occupied Multan which was later retook by the Mughals Army under the command of General Hebat Khan on the orders of Emperor Humayun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ru/search?newwindow=1&amp;sa=X&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22John+Whaley+Watson%22&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipq8LDnrrZAhXJWSwKHRP_CZcQ9AgIKTAA&amp;biw=961&amp;bih=678&amp;dpr=1|title=inauthor:"John Whaley Watson" - Google Search|website=www.google.ru|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.tm/books?isbn=8120605055|title=isbn:8120605055 - Google Search|website=books.google.tm|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tm/books?id=xIjyLNpusbAC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=fateh+khan+baloch&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipq8LDnrrZAhXJWSwKHRP_CZcQ6AEINDAC|title=The Baloch and Balochistan: A Historical Account from the Beginning to the Fall of the Baloch State|last=Dashti|first=Naseer|date=October 2012|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781466958968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corona ferrea, Monza, Tesoro del Duomo.jpg|thumb|[[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]]]
'''King of Italy''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Rex Italiae''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Re d'Italia'') was the title given to the ruler of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The first to take the title was [[Odoacer]], a "barbarian" military leader, in the late 5th century, followed by the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic kings]] up to the mid-6th century. With the [[Franks|Frankish]] conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the [[Carolingians]] assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent [[Holy Roman Emperors]] throughout the Middle Ages. The last Emperor to claim the title was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in the 16th century. During this period, the holders of the title were crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].

A [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] was restored from 1805 to 1814 with [[Napoleon]] as its only king, centered in Northern Italy. It was not until the [[Italian unification]] in the 1860s that a Kingdom of Italy covering the entire peninsula was restored. From 1861 the [[House of Savoy]] held the title of ''King of Italy'' until the last king, [[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto II]], was exiled in 1946 when Italy became a republic.

==History==
After the [[Deposition of Romulus Augustulus|deposition of the last Western Emperor]] in 476, [[Heruli]] leader [[Odoacer]] was appointed ''Dux Italiae'' ("Duke of Italy") by the reigning [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. Later, the Germanic ''[[foederati]],'' the [[Scirians]] and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, proclaimed Odoacer ''Rex Italiae'' ("King of Italy").&lt;ref name=Bury-406&gt;Bury, ''History'', vol. 1 p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; In 493, the [[Ostrogoth]]ic king [[Theoderic the Great]] killed Odoacer, and set up [[Amal dynasty|a new dynasty]] of kings of Italy. Ostrogothic rule ended when [[Gothic War (535–554)|Italy was reconquered]] by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 552.

In 568, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula and ventured to recreate a barbarian kingdom in opposition to the Empire, establishing their authority over much of Italy, except the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and the duchies of [[Duchy of Rome|Rome]], [[Duchy of Venetia|Venetia]], [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]] and the southernmost portions. In the 8th century, estrangement between the Italians and the Byzantines allowed the Lombards to capture the remaining Roman enclaves in northern Italy. However, in 774, they were defeated by the [[Franks]] under [[Charlemagne]], who deposed their king and took up the title "king of the Lombards". After the death of [[Charles the Fat]] in 887, Italy fell into instability and a number of kings attempted to establish themselves as independent Italian monarchs. During this period, known as the Feudal Anarchy (888–962), the title ''Rex Italicorum'' ("King of the Italians" or "King of the Italics") was introduced. After the breakup of the Frankish empire, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] added Italy to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and continued the use of the title ''Rex Italicorum''. The last to use this title was [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] (1004-1024). Subsequent emperors used the title "King of Italy" until [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. At first they were crowned in [[Pavia]], later [[Milan]], and Charles was crowned in [[Bologna]].

In 1805, [[Napoleon I]] was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy#Modern uses|Iron Crown of Lombardy]] at the [[Milan Cathedral]]. The next year, [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]] abdicated his imperial title. From the deposition of Napoleon I (1814) until the [[Italian Unification]] (1861), there was no Italian monarch claiming the overarching title. The ''[[Risorgimento]]'' successfully established a dynasty, the [[House of Savoy]], over the whole peninsula, uniting the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]] to form the modern [[Kingdom of Italy]]. The monarchy was superseded by the [[Italy|Italian Republic]], after a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|constitutional referendum]] was held on 2 June 1946, after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1047 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian monarchy formally ended on 12 June of that year, and [[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto II]] left the country.

:vassal of the German King [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], reduced to [[March of Friuli|Friuli]] 889-894, deposed by Arnulf in 896.

**[[Ratold of Italy|Ratold]] (sub-king 896)

In 896, Arnulf and Ratold lost control of Italy, which was divided between Berengar and Lambert:
*[[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar I]] (896&amp;ndash;924)

In 951 [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I of Germany]] invaded Italy and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]. In 952, Berengar and Adalbert became his vassals but remained Kings until being deposed by Otto.

Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned king of Italy, or to use the title.&lt;ref name="Muratori" /&gt; The [[Peace of Westphalia]], in 1648, formally ended the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors in Italy. However, the empire continued to include some territory in northern Italy, including Tyrol, until its dissolution in 1806.

Although there are several languages native to the territory, Azerbaijani is the official language and the medium of communication of the [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]].

== General ==
The primary and official language of Azerbaijan is [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], Azeri,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/AZ|publisher=www.ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] closely related to and partially [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]  with [[Turkish language|Modern Turkish]].&lt;ref name=innerAsia&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinor|first=Denis|title=Inner Asia.

Furthermore, Azerbaijan is recognized as an official medium of instruction in Dagestan and in the Republic of Azerbaijan, however, it is not an official language in Northern Iran where the number of Azerbaijanis exceed the ones in the Republic of Azerbaijan itself. The Azerbaijani language spoken in Iranian Azerbaijan is quite different than the one spoken in North Azerbaijan and instead of promoting the use of language, the Iranian government has discouraged and even banned it for several decades.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World 1st Edition|last=Keith|first=Brown|last2=Ogilvie|first2=Sarah|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2008|isbn=9780080877754|location=|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan has not ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] to which it became signatory in 1992, under the [[Popular Front of Azerbaijan|Popular Front]]. In 2001, the then President of Azerbaijan [[Heydar Aliyev]] issued a statement whereby "the Republic of Azerbaijan is not in the power to guarantee the implementation of the Charter regulations until its territory occupied by the Republic of Armenia is liberated".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/2902 Azərbaycan Respublikasının Regional dillər və ya azlıqların dilləri haqqında Avropa Xartiyasına dair bəyanatı]. 20 December 2001. Retrieved 17 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The medieval author [[Ibn al-Nadim]], in his book ''Al-Fihrist''  mentions that all the Median and Persian lands of antiquity (including what is today the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]) spoke one language. There, he quotes the great scholar [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa]]:

: "The ''Iranian'' languages are Fahlavi ([[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]])&lt;!-- throughout the section --&gt;, Dari, Khuzi, Persian, and Seryani. But Fahlavi comes from the word Fahleh. And Fahleh is a name that refers to 5 regions: [[Isfahan province|Isfahan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], [[Hamedan]], [[Nahavand|Mah-Nahavand]], and [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]]."

He then reports that Dari is the official language of the royal courts, and is from [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Balkh]] and eastern Iran; Parsi is the language of the [[Zoroastrian]] Moobeds, and is from [[Fars Province|Fars]]; Khuzi is the unofficial language of royalty and is from [[Khuzestan]]; and Seryani originates from Mesopotamia.

This has also been reported by reputed medieval historians such as [[Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]], [[Ibn Hawqal]], [[Istakhri]], [[Moqaddasi]], [[Yaghubi]], [[Masudi]], and [[Hamdollah Mostowfi|Mostowfi Qazvini]] as well. [[Al-Khwarizmi]] also mentions this in Chapter 6, Vol. 6, of his book ''Mafatih-ol-Olum''.

Etymological studies also further indicate that current dialects spoken from [[Baku]] through [[Khalkhāl, East Azarbaijan|Khalkhal]] to [[Semnan (city)|Semnan]], all originated from a common source. In other words, the people of ancient Azerbaijan spoke the same language spoken by the [[Medes]]{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Which was...?--&gt;. (See [[Columbia University]]'s distinguished professor [[Ehsan Yarshater]]'s report in: ''Majjaleh-ye Daaneshkadehye Adabiyaat'', 5, No 1-2, p35-37)

The medieval historian [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] also used the phrase ''Al-ajam-ol-Azariyah'' ("The Azeri Iranian") in his books ''Mo'ajjem ol-Odabaa'' and ''Mo'jem ol Baladaan''. In other sources such as ''Surat-ol-Arz'' by [[Ebne Hoghel]], ''Ahsan ol-Taqaaseem'' by [[Moqaddasi]], and ''Masaalik va Mamaalik'' by [[Istakhri]], the people of Azerbaijan are recorded as having spoken Iranian languages{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Since this is languages, plural, it doesn't jive with "the same language", singular, in the previous paragraph.--&gt;. Obviously, this was before the Turkic cultural arrival{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--No, it isn't obvious. This needs to be explained.--&gt;. And [[Tabari]] in 235 A.H.{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--This is English WP. Date need to be given in BC/AD or BCE/CE format.--&gt; also mentions that poets in [[Maragheh]] recited poetry in Pahlavi. Some Azerbaijani poets however, such as [[Qatran Tabrizi]] (d465 A.H.), used the word "Persian" and "Pahlavi" interchangeably to describe their native language.

The historian [[Hamdollah Mostowfi]] even goes as far as describing variants of "Pahlavi" spoken in different areas of Azerbaijan. In his book ''Tarikh Gozideh'', he describes eight poets from Azerbaijan, calling them "Ahl-ol She'r Men-al-Ajam" (Iranian poets), all Persian=speaking. By now,{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--By when?--&gt; of course, Dari and Pahlavi had merged into one, as successive dynasties moved from east to west, bringing with them the Dari version of the Iranian language.

Suffice it to say that the number of records and documents from Azerbaijan in the Pahlavi language are so numerous that there is little doubt that this was indeed the native tongue of Azerbaijan before the arrival of the Turks. Many words in the current Azeri vocabulary are in fact of Pahlavi origin. (See studies in ''Nashriyeh Adabiyaat'' of [[Tabriz University]], by Dr Mahyar Navabi, 5,&amp;nbsp;6. Also see ''Farhang e Kamaleddin Teflisi'' and ''Ajayeb ol-Makhluqaat'' by ''Najibeddin Hamadani''{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--These two are not books? If not, what are they?--&gt;, and the books ''[[Majmal al-tawarikh|Majmal-ol-Tavarikh wa al-qasas]]'' and ''Iskandar-Nameh e Qadeem'' for lists of words.)

It is agreed that the current Turkic form of the Azeri language supplanted and replaced Pahlavi in Azerbaijan before the [[Safavid]] dynasty, perhaps starting with the arrival of Seljukian Turks, and following a gradual course. But some historians report Pahlavi being spoken in [[Tabriz]] as late as the 17th century. (See ''Rowdhat ul-Jinan'' by Hafez Hosein Tabrizi (d997 A.H.), and ''Risaleh ye Anarjani'' written in 985 AH). Even the Ottoman Turkish explorer [[Evliya Celebi]] (1611-1682), mentions this in his [[Seyahatname]]. He also reports that the elite and learned people of [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]] and [[Maragheh]] spoke Pahlavi, during his tours of the region.

== Development ==
The first appearance of using Azerbaijani is closely connected with the first appearance of Turkish tribes in the early first millennium. With the settlement of Turkish tribes not only the economy but also culture and language used for communication were influenced by them. The evolvement of the Azerbaijani language as a means of communication has had a long way covering centuries. Just studying [[Book of Dede Korkut|Kitabi-Dede Gorgud]] (''Kitabi-Dede Korkut, The Book of Dede Korkut'') is enough to say Azerbaijani has at least 1300 years of history as a medium of communication in the territory of now the Republic of Azerbaijan, Eastern Turkey, Southeastern Georgia, Northwestern Iran, Eastern Armenia and Southern Russia. Some sources point out that the written literary examples of the use of language date back 13th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Azerbaijani language has two main periods of development - the ancient period covering 13th to 18th centuries, whereas the present day period starting from about the late 18th century and lasts up to the present day.

The ancient period covers not only the main development stage of the language but also covers renaissance literature of Azerbaijan. During the ancient period, the government and the army were ruled by the Safavids, Aggoyunlus, Qaraqoyunlus, and Djelairids which overlaps with the high literary development period of the territory and the country and the use of the language is characterized by extra-linguistic properties.

Azerbaijani has been influenced by many cultures throughout the history due to being occupied by different countries. The firmest and the longest of these external influences are Persian, Arabic, Russian. Due to being occupied and settled by the above-mentioned countries, the Azerbaijani language has also been used in harmony with their languages, allowing it to borrow an excessive amount of words from their culture and in return lend words as well. This could be the reason why, regardless of being independent for almost three decades, the influence of other languages is still remarkably strong, espiecally after being 70 years under Soviet occupation, Russian language is still widely used in the country.

'''Lavvu''' (or {{lang-se|lávvu}}, {{lang-smj|låvdagoahte}}, {{lang-smn|láávu}}, {{lang-sms|kååvas}}, {{lang-sjd|koavas}}, {{lang-fi|kota or umpilaavu}}, {{lang-no|lavvo or sametelt}}, and {{lang-sv|kåta}}) is a temporary dwelling used by the [[Sami people]] of northern Scandinavia. It has a design similar to a [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native American]] [[tipi]] but is less vertical and more stable in high winds. It enables the indigenous cultures of the treeless plains of northern [[Scandinavia]] and the high [[arctic]] of Eurasia to follow their [[reindeer]] herds. It is still used as a temporary shelter by the Sami, and increasingly by other people for camping. It should not be confused with the [[goahti]], another type of Sami dwelling, or the Finnish [[laavu]].

== Historical definition ==
[[Image:Sami-tent.jpg|thumb|A lavvu in the late 1800s, from "Norge i det nittende aarhundrede" (1900).]]
There are several historical references that describe the lavvu structure (also called a ''kota'', or a variation on this name) used by the Sami.  These structures have the following in common:&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Schefferus|Schefferus, Johannes]]. ''History of Lappland'' (English trans. ''[[Lapponia (book)|Lapponia]]''), 1674, p.80-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manker, Ernst and Vorren, Ørnulv. ''Lapp Life and Customs: A Survey''., Trans. Kathleen McFarlane, Oxford University Press London, 1962, p.42-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muus, Nathan. "Building a Lavvu", ''Bulletin of Primitive Technology'', Fall, 1997, No.14. p.21-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Manker|Manker, Ernst]]. ''People of Eight Seasons'', Crescent Books, New York, 1963, p.80-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eidheim, Harald. "Ethno-Political Development among the Sami after World War II", ''Sami Culture in a New Era: The Norwegian Sami Experience'', Gaski, H. ed. (1997) p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

# The lavvu is supported by three or more evenly spaced forked or notched poles that form a tripod.
# There are upwards of ten or more unsecured straight poles that are laid up against the tripod and which give form to the structure.
# The lavvu does not need any [[Tent peg|stakes]], [[guy-wire]] or ropes to provide shape or stability to the structure.
# The shape and volume of the lavvu is determined by the size and quantity of the poles that are used for the structure.
# There is no center pole needed to support this structure.

No historical record has come to light that describes the Sami using a single-pole structure claimed to be a lavvu, or any other Scandinavian variant name for the structure.  The definition and description of this structure has been fairly consistent since the 17th century and possibly many centuries earlier.

The [[goahti]], also used by the Sami, has a different pole configuration. While trees suitable to make lavvu poles are quite easy to find and often left at the site for later use, the four curved poles of the goahti have to be carried.

== Traditional and modern lavvu ==
The traditional lavvu consists of two types of wooden poles: 1) three or more ''forked poles'' and; 2) several ''straight poles''. The ''forked poles'' have a two-stem fork at the top end.  These three poles are interlocked so that they form a tripod. Upon this assembly of the forked poles, the ''straight poles'' are laid in a circular fashion.  Reindeer hides were used as a cover until the mid-19th century when large amounts of inexpensive manufactured [[Industrial Revolution|British textiles]] were made available to the Sami.

The traditional lavvus are still in use, but for ease of transportation modern designs have replaced the wooden poles with [[aluminum]] ones and heavier textiles with lighter fabrics. In addition, instead of an open fire an oven can be used. This reduces the smoke but produces less light making it quite dark inside. A lavvu of this type is easier to carry and is a common alternative to the tents often used for camping.

Very large lavvus also exist with enough room for dozens of people. These are typically used for large families.

== Symbolism ==

The lavvu has been – and still is – a strong symbol for the Sami as a cultural haven. The lavvu played a prominent role in two events during the 20th century as more than just a shelter. The first was at the end of [[World War II]] during the winter of 1944/45 when the German troops retreated westward across northern Norway, burning most of the housing in [[Finnmark]] and eastern [[Troms]] counties before the [[Russia]]n [[Red Army]]. Because of this destruction, many Sami lived in lavvus for many years afterward because of the lack of housing and unemployment from this period.&lt;ref&gt;Manker, Ernst and Vorren, Ørnulv. ''Lapp Life and Customs: A Survey''., Trans. Kathleen McFarlane, Oxford University Press London, 1962, p.154&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Sami are still alive today who were born in these lavvus and have fond memories of them.&lt;ref&gt;Kitti, Anja. (Sami Elder; former Chair, [[Sami Siida of North America]], Toronto, Canada), interview. July, 1995/Nov., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kautokeino komm.svg|left|thumb|150px|The [[coat of arms of Kautokeino]] ([[Guovdageaidnu]]), Norway.]]
The second event was when the lavvu was used during the [[Alta controversy]] in Norway from 1979 to 1981. A lavvu was set up in front of the [[Storting]] (Norwegian Parliament Building) which became an international focal point as several Sami went on a hunger strike to protest the proposed dam project that would have destroyed reindeer grazing grounds of the Sami herders in the area and inundated the Sami village of [[Máze]]. This lavvu became center stage in the political fight for Sami indigenous rights.&lt;ref&gt;Somby, Ande. http://somban.com/nealg06.html. Retrieved 11/5/2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, ''Ville bruke soldater i Alta-aksjon''; {{cite web |url=http://nrk.no/nyheter/innenriks/5620578.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807164055/http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/innenriks/5620578.html |archivedate=2007-08-07 |df= }} Retrieved: 11/7/2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eidheim, Harald. "Ethno-Political Development among the Sami after World War II", ''Sami Culture in a New Era: The Norwegian Sami Experience'', Gaski, H. ed. (1997) p.49&lt;/ref&gt;  The irony was not missed when the Oslo police bulldozed the lavvu during the protest.&lt;ref&gt;Somby, Ande. http://somban.com/nealg09.html. Retrieved 11/5/2007&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict gave birth to the ''Sami Rights Committee'' which addressed Sami legal rights within Norway, resulting in the ''Sami Act of 1987''. This in turn became the foundation for the [[Sami Parliament of Norway|Sámediggi]] (Sami Parliament of Norway), a democratically elected body for the Sami in Norway in 1989, and the [[Finnmark Act]] of 2005.

The strong symbolism of the lavvu has also been shown in its pictorial form as the coat-of-arms for the municipality of [[Guovdageaidnu]] (Kautokeino) and in the physical shape of the [[Sámediggi]] building, whose shape was inspired by the lavvu.

== Modern controversy ==
[[Image:Belltent patent.gif|right|thumb|300px|[[Bell tent]] U.S. Patent #14740 from April 22, 1856. Invented by [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]]. Easily confused with a lavvu, but having a very different pole structure.]]

Since the late 1990s there have been a few European companies that claim to offer a "lavvu", but with a very different construction.  This "lavvu" has a single pole which supports the tent in the middle of the structure, and is maintained and supported by stakes to the ground, often with guy-wires ropes to expand the cover outward giving its fullness. This pole and rope structure is closer in construction to a [[bell tent]] or conical tent which has been in use since the 1850s, and possibly much earlier. The bell/conical tent is different from the lavvu in three major ways:

1) "The tent is pitched by means of a single pole…"  in the center of the tent which is essential for support of the structure;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Hopkins Sibley|Sibley, Henry Hopkins]]. ''Conical Tent'', US Patent #14740, April 22, 1856. p.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

2) stakes are used and are essential to provide support and fullness to the tent as without them the structure would collapse; and,

3) guy-wires or ropes are often needed to provide fullness to the structure, depending on the size of the tent.

No historical records have been found that described the Sami using this single-pole construction. Only since the 1990s have these tent manufactures mentioned this type of single-pole structure to be a lavvu. The placing of the word "lavvu" on a single-pole tent structure different from the historical tent described as being used by the Sami, may be an example of [[cultural appropriation]].

== Using a lavvu ==
[[Image:Sami Tent in Jukkasjarvi.jpg|right|thumb|Sami lavvu at the open-air museum in [[Jukkasjarvi]], [[Sweden]].]]
Inside the living quarters of the lavvu, there is a fireplace in the middle used for heating and to keep [[mosquitoes]] away. The smoke escapes through the [[smoke hole]] in the top of the lavvu that is usually left open. Occasionally a rough blanket is wrapped round the smoke hole to make the opening smaller, but not to the point where smoke would be prevented from escaping. In order to prevent smoke from building up inside, proper air circulation is maintained by leaving an opening between the ground and the cover, or leaving the door slightly open. Keeping the fire hot enough to let the heated smoke rise through the smoke hole is necessary.

Traditionally, there was a smaller door in the back of the lavvu, opposite the front door, called the ''bear door''. This was used for ceremonial purposes, such as removing the dead (not appropriate out of the front door) and similar functions.&lt;ref&gt;Schibe, Tom (North American Sami Elder and reindeer owner; [[Sami Siida of North America]], Milltown, WI, USA), interview. July, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Few lavvus today have this door for such purposes.

== Other tent designs similar to lavvu ==
* [[Tipi]] - The Native American tipi is visually similar to the lavvu but has a different cut to the fabric and a slightly different pole structure and placement.
* [[Chum (tent)]] - The [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] people of northern [[Ural Mountains|Ural]], northern [[Siberia]] and the Tyvan Todzhans of southern Siberia have a tent structure that is similar in design and often much larger than the lavvu. It is still in use by these people as a year-round shelter.
* [[Goahti]] ({{lang-no|gamme}}, {{lang-fi|kota}}) - The goahti is often confused with a lavvu, although it has a different pole structure, is more elongated and is typically lower to the ground. In the first photo above, the tent in the background is a lavvu, while the tent in the foreground is a goahti.
* [[Kohte]], a traditional [[Germany|German]] [[scouting]] tent derived from the Lavvu, but is usually black.

The '''Lebbo'''' people (also known as the '''Lebu'''') are part of the indigenous [[Dayak people]] of [[East Kalimantan]] province (east central [[Borneo]]), [[Indonesia]]. They generally regarded themselves as a subgroup of the [[Kenyah people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Linguistik Indonesia, Volumes 24-25|year=2006|contribution=Masyarakat Linguistik Indonesia|publisher=Masyarakat Linguistik Indonesia|oclc=|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the modern era, the Lebbo' people were often [[hunter-gatherer]]s or [[horticulture|horticulturalists]].

Most members of the Lebbo' live in the [[Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat Karst]] range and speak the [[Wahau Kenyah language|Lebu’ Kulit]] (or Lepu' Kulit) language, also known as Wahau Kenyah (or Waha Kenya).

==Population genetics==
The Lebbo' have been of great interest to geneticists, due to their distinctive [[population genetics]]; these link them link them to most strongly to the [[Ma'anyan people]] of [[Central Kalimantan]], as well as other [[Ethnic groups of Southeast Asia|minorities in South East Asia]] and, far more distantly, to some [[South Asia]]n tribal peoples and [[indigenous Australians]]. In a small sample of  Lebbo' males (12 individuals) the following [[Y-DNA haplogroup]]s were found [[haplogroup C-M130|C*]] (M130) 13.33%, [[haplogroup K-M9|K*]] (M9) 6.67%), [[haplogroup K2|K2]] (M526) 13.33%, [[Haplogroup O-K18|O1b1a1a1a1a]] (M88) 33.33%, [[Haplogroup O-M119|O1a2]] (M50) 26.67% and [[Haplogroup O-M122|O2a1b~]] (M164) 6.67%.&lt;ref name="Kusuma"&gt;Kusuma, P. et al.

'''Levantine Arabic Sign Language''', also known as '''Syro-Palestinian Sign Language''',{{cn|date=March 2015}} is the [[deaf sign language]] of [[Jordan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. Although there are significant differences in vocabulary between the four states, this is not much greater than regional differences within the states, their grammar is quite uniform, and mutual intelligibility is high, indicating that they are dialects of a single language (Hendriks 2008).[https://www.lotpublications.nl/Documents/193_fulltext.pdf]

The language typically goes by the name of the country, as so:
* Jordanian SL: لغة الإشارة الأردنية ''Lughat il-Ishārah il-Urduniyyah'' (LIU)
* Lebanese SL: لغة الإشارات اللبنانية ''Lughat al-Ishārāt al-Lubnāniyyah'' (LIL)
* Palestinian SL: لغة الاشارات الفلسطينية ''Lughat al-Ishārāt al-Filisṭīniyyah'' (LIF)
* Syrian SL: لغة الإشارة السورية ''Lughat il-Ishārah il-Sūriyyah'' (LIS)

[[File:The tin was lowered into the pit latrine (6975392493).jpg|thumb|Example for unsafe manual pit emptying (which could be termed "manual scavenging") of a [[pit latrine]] in Korogocho slums in Kenya]]
'''Manual scavenging''' is a term used mainly in [[India]] for the manual removal of untreated [[Human waste|human excreta]] from [[bucket toilet]]s or [[pit latrine]]s by hand with buckets and shovels. It has been officially prohibited by law in 1993 due to it being regarded as a [[Dehumanization|dehumanizing]] practice (if not done in a safe manner). It involves moving the excreta, using brooms and tin plates, into baskets, which the workers carry to disposal locations sometimes several kilometers away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nhrc.nic.in/Documents/Publications/KYR%20Scavenging%20English.pdf|title = Human rights and manual scavenging|accessdate = September 16, 2013|publisher = National Human Rights Commission|series = Know Your Rights Series|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workers, called scavengers (or more appropriately "sanitation workers"), rarely have any [[personal protective equipment]]. The term is mainly used in the Indian context only. 

The employment of manual scavengers to empty a certain type of [[dry toilet]] that requires manual daily emptying was prohibited in India in 1993. The law was extended and clarified to include insanitary latrines, ditches and pits in 2013.&lt;ref name="HRW2014" /&gt;

According to [[Socio Economic Caste Census 2011]], 180,657 households are engaged in manual scavenging for a livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/the-humiliation-continues/article1-1368562.aspx|title=Swachh Bharat Abhiyan should aim to stamp out manual scavenging}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2011 Census of India]] found 794,000 cases of manual scavenging across India.&lt;ref name="Umesh IsalkarUmesh Isalkar 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Umesh IsalkarUmesh Isalkar | first=TNN | title=Census raises stink over manual scavenging | website=The Times of India | date=30 April 2013 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Census-raises-stink-over-manual-scavenging/articleshow/19794299.cms | accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Maharashtra, with 63,713, tops the list with the largest number of households working as manual scavengers, followed by the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura and Karnataka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/manual-scavenging-still-a-reality-socioeconomic-caste-census/article7400578.ece|title = Manual scavenging still a reality|date = 9 July 2015|accessdate = 9 September 2015|publisher = The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar occupations existed and still exist in other countries, usually known by other terms and given different degrees of government protection.

== Definition ==
[[File:Dalberg Water Week Final.webm|thumb|A short video shedding light on the unsafe and undignified working conditions of many "[[Waste collector|sanitation workers]]" in India (2018)]]
[[File:Manual pit emptying (8151995298).jpg|thumb|Another example for manual pit emptying (in Durban, South Africa) but with [[personal protective equipment]] and formalised occupation - therefore no longer regarded as "manual scavenging" ]]
Manual scavenging refers to the unsafe and manual removal of raw (fresh and untreated) [[Human waste|human excreta]] from buckets or other containers that are used as [[toilet]]s or from the pits of simple [[pit latrine]]s. The safe and controlled emptying of pit latrines, on the other hand, is one component of [[fecal sludge management]].

The official definition of a manual scavenger in Indian law from 1993 is as follows:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Manual scavenger” means a person engaged or employed, at the commencement of this Act or at any time thereafter, by an individual or a local authority or an agency or a contractor, for manually cleaning, carrying, disposing of, or otherwise handling in any manner, human excreta in an insanitary latrine or in an open drain or pit into which the human excreta from the insanitary latrines is disposed of, or railway track or in such other spaces or premises, as the Central Government or a State Government may notify, before the excreta fully decomposes in such manner as may be prescribed, and the expression “manual scavenging” shall be construed accordingly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not all forms of [[dry toilets]] involve "manual scavenging" to empty them, but only those that require unsafe handling of raw excreta. If on the other hand the excreta is already treated or pre-treated in the dry toilet itself, as is the case for [[composting toilets]] and [[urine-diverting dry toilets]] for example, then emptying these types of toilets is not classified as "manual scavenging". [[Container-based sanitation]] is another system that does not require manual scavenging to function even though it does involve the emptying of excreta from containers.

Also, emptying the pits of twin-pit [[Toilet#Pour-flush|pour-flush toilets]] is not classified as manual scavenging in India, as the excreta is already partly treated and degraded in those pits.

The [[International Labour Organization]] describes three forms of manual scavenging in India:&lt;ref name="HRW2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/india0814_ForUpload_0.pdf|title=Cleaning Human Waste: "manual scavenging", Caste and Discrimination in India|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Removal of human excrement from public streets and "dry latrines" (meaning simple [[pit latrine]]s without a water seal, but not [[dry toilet]]s in general)
* Cleaning [[septic tank]]s
* Cleaning gutters and sewers
Manual cleaning of railway lines of excreta dropped from toilets of trains is another form of manual scavenging in India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://southasia.oneworld.net/features/manual-scavengers-indian-railways-in-denial#.UWMxqMrgUoI "Manual Scavengers: Indian Railways in denial".] ''OneWorld South Asia''. 25 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current prevalence==
Manual scavenging still survives in parts of India without proper sewage systems or safe fecal sludge management practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2008/07/10/clean-up|title=India’s manual scavengers Clean-up - How to abolish a dirty, low-status job|last=|first=|date=10 July 2008|website=|publisher=The Economist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to be most prevalent in [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref name="HRW2014" /&gt; Some municipalities in India still run public toilets using simple [[pit latrine]]s.

An estimate in 2018 put the number of "sanitation workers" in India at 5 million, and 50% of them being women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=110&amp;v=GGWn8G1cipA|title=Sanitation Worker Project Animation (video)|last=|first=|date=3 September 2018|website=|publisher=Dalberg Global Development Advisors|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest violator of this law in India is the [[Indian Railways]] where many train carriages have toilets dropping the excreta from trains on the tracks and who employ scavengers to clean the tracks manually.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The situation is largely improving with the introduction of biotoilets attached to the toilet chute. The railways has set a target of 2022 to attach biotoilets in all the coaches.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Manual scavenging is traditionally a role determined by the outlawed [[caste system in India]] for members of the [[Dalit]] caste, usually from the [[Balmiki caste|Balmiki (or Valminki)]] or [[Hela (caste)|Hela]] subcaste.&lt;ref name="HRW2014" /&gt;

In March 2014, the [[Supreme Court of India]] declared that there were 96 lakhs (9.6 million) dry latrines being manually emptied but the exact number of manual scavengers is disputed – official figures put it at less than 700,000.&lt;ref name=SCI2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Safai Karamchari Andolan And Ors vs Union Of India And Ors|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6155772/|website=Supreme Court of India|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manual scavenging is done with basic tools like thin boards and either buckets or baskets lined with sacking and [[Head-carrying|carried on the head]]. Due to the nature of the job, many of the workers have related health problems.&lt;ref name="HRW2014" /&gt;

==Initiatives for eradication==

===Legislation===
In the late 1950s, freedom fighter [[G. S. Lakshman Iyer]] banned manual scavenging when he was the chairman of [[Gobichettipalayam Municipality]], which became the first local body to ban it officially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kannadasan |first=Akila |title=Remembering a great man |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/remembering-a-great-man/article2831907.ece |date=25 January 2012 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |department=Features - Cinema |access-date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crusader against caste oppression and untouchability |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crusader-against-caste-oppression-and-untouchability/article1792408.ece |date=5 February 2007 |newspaper=The Hindu |access-date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanitation is a State subject as per entry 6 of the Constitution. Under this, in February 2013 Delhi announced that they are banning manual scavenging, making them the first state in India to do so. District magistrates are responsible for ensuring that there are no manual scavengers working in their district. Within 3 years time municipalities, railways and cantonments must make sufficient sanitary latrines available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-becomes-first-state-to-ban-manual-scavenging/article4458271.ece "Delhi first state to ban manual scavenging."] ''[[Hindustan Times]]''. 27 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the state of [[Maharashtra]] has planned to abolish the menace of manual scavenging completely from the state soon.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} But by using Article 252 of the constitution which empowers Parliament to legislate for two or more States by consent and adoption of such legislation by any other State, the Government of India has enacted various laws .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/washing-off-this-stain-will-need-more/article3958626.ece|title = Washing off this stain will need more|date = October 5, 2012|accessdate = September 16, 2013|publisher = The Hindu|location=Chennai, India|first=Agrima|last=Bhasin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuance of such discriminatory practice is violation of ILO’s Convention 111 (Discrimination in Employment and Occupation)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ilo.org/newdelhi/whatwedo/eventsandmeetings/WCMS_187486/lang--en/index.htm|title = National workshop on decent work for sanitation workers and workers in manual scavenging|accessdate = September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] human rights chief welcomed in 2013 the movement in India to eradicate manual scavenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2013/01/431022-un-rights-chief-welcomes-movement-eradicate-manual-scavenging-india#.UWMwysrgUoI|title=UN News Global perspective, Human stories|last=|first=|date=31 January 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993 ====
After six states passed resolutions requesting the Central Government to frame a law, The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993, drafted by the Ministry of Urban Development under the Narasimha Rao government,&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/washing-off-this-stain-will-need-more/article3958626.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Agrima | last=Bhasin | title=Washing off this stain will need more | date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed by Parliament in 1993.

The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993 punishes the employment of scavengers or the construction of dry (non-flush) latrines with imprisonment for up to one year and/or a fine of Rs 2,000.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://indiacode.nic.in/acts-in-pdf/252013.pdf The Employment Of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993].

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013 or M.S. Act 2013 ====
Government has passed the new legislation in September 2013 and issued Government notification for the same. In December, 2013 Government has also formulated Rules-2013 called as "The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Rules 2013" or "M.S. Rules 2013". The details about Act and Rules are available on the website of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, GOI.

Further, the hearing on 27 March 2014 was held on Manual Scavenging of writ petition number 583 of 2003, and supreme Court has issued final orders and case is disposed of with various directions to the Government.

The broad objectives of the act are to eliminate unsanitary latrines, prohibit the employment of manual scavengers and the hazardous manual cleaning of sewer and septic tanks, and to maintain a survey of manual scavengers and their rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=107395 | title=Legislature on Eradication of Manual Scavenging | publisher=[[Press Information Bureau]] | date=26 July 2014 | accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism===
In India in 1970s, [[Bindeshwar Pathak|Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak]] introduced his "[[Sulabh International|Sulabh]]" concept for building and managing public toilets in India, which has introduced hygienic and well-managed public toilet system. Activist [[Bezwada Wilson]] founded a group in 1994, Safai Karmachari Andolan, to campaign for the demolition of then newly illegal 'dry latrines' ([[pit latrines]]) and the abolition of manual scavenging. Despite the efforts of Wilson and other activists, the practice persists two decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-untouchable-indians-with-an-unenviable-job-2106970.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=The 'untouchable' Indians with an unenviable job | date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 "MissionSanitation" was a fashion show held by the [[United Nations]] as part of its [[International Year of Sanitation]]. On the runway were 36 previous workers, called scavengers, and top models to help bring awareness of the issue of manual scavenging.

The Movement for Scavenger Community (MSC) is an NGO founded in 2009 by Vimal Kumar with young people, social activists, and like-minded people from the scavenger community. MSC is committed to working towards the social and economic empowerment of the scavenger community through the medium of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Learn More |url=http://scavenger-movement.org/ |website=Movement for Scavenger Community – MSC |access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Sanitation of the Indus Valley Civilisation}}
There is evidence of the existence of toilets with a water seal in the civilisations of [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]]. These cities had toilets which were connected to an underground drainage system lined with burnt clay bricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/indus_valley/home_life/|title = Primary History Indus Valley: Home Life|accessdate = September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later stages, manual scavenging became a caste-based occupation, with the vast majority of workers involved being women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title = NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELIMINATION OF MANUAL SCAVENGING|url = http://idsn.org/fileadmin/user_folder/pdf/New_files/Key_Issues/Manual_scavenging/2012/ILO_Conference_Press_Release.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of manual scavenging in India dates back to ancient times. According to the contents of sacred scriptures and other literature, scavenging by some specific castes of India has existed since the beginning of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Road to Freedom: A Sociological Study on the Abolition of Scavenging in India, Bindeshwar Pathak, Motilal Banarsidass Publisher, 1999. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; One of the fifteen duties of slaves enumerated in ''[[Naradiya Samhita]]'' was of manual scavenging. This continues during the Buddhist and Mauraya period also.&lt;ref&gt;Road to Freedom: A Sociological Study on the Abolition of Scavenging in India, Bindeshwar Pathak, Motilal Banarsidass Publisher, 1999. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahangir]] built a [[public toilet]] at Alwar, 120&amp;nbsp;km away from Delhi, for 100 families in 1556 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Bindeshwar Pathak, [http://www.thevacuum.org.uk/issues/issues0120/issue18/is18arttoihis.html Toilet History] The Vacuum - Issue 18&lt;/ref&gt; Not much documentary evidence exists about its maintenance. Scholars have suggested that the Mughal women with [[purdah]] required enclosed toilets that needed to be scavenged.&lt;ref&gt;Road to Freedom: A Sociological Study on the Abolition of Scavenging in India, Bindeshwar Pathak, Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1999. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; It is pointed out that the ''bhangis''  ([[Chuhra]]) share some of the clan names with [[Rajput]]s, and propose that the ''bhangis'' are descendants of those captured in wars.There are many legends about the origin of ''bhangis'', who have traditionally served as manual scavengers. One of them, associated with [[Lal Begi]] bhangis, describes the origin of bhangis from Mehtar.&lt;ref&gt;The Bhangi: A Sweeper Caste, Its Socio-economic Portraits : with Special Reference to Jodhpur City, Shyamlal, Popular Prakashan, 1992 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipal records from 1870 show that the British organized municipalities in India which built roads, parks, public toilets etc.&lt;ref&gt;Themes in Indian History, Dr. Raghunath Rai, FK Publications, 2010, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; The British administrators organized systems for removing the fecal sludge and employed bhangis.&lt;ref&gt;Scavenging, Volume 17, Bombay (India : State), Government Central Press, 1884, p. 676-679&lt;/ref&gt;

Manual scavenging also took place in Europe but not specifically linked to a caste-based occupation and not called "manual scavenging": In European history the terms "[[nightsoil]] collectors" or "nightmen" and [[gong farmer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s were used. The contemporary term for safe nightsoil collection is [[fecal sludge management]]. Towns with sanitation systems based on [[pail closet]]s ([[bucket toilet]]s in [[outhouse]]s) relied on frequent emptying, performed by workers driving [[Honeywagon (vehicle)|"honeywagons"]], a precursor to the [[vacuum truck]] now used to pump out septage from [[Septic tank|septic tanks]]. The municipal emptying of pail toilets continued in Australia into the second half of the twentieth century; these were known as [[dunny|dunnies]] and the workers were dunnymen.



In Haiti, this type of occupation is called [[Bayakou (trade)|bayakou]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4324">The '''Med''' are an ethnic community found in the coastal areas of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]], mainly in the regions of [[Makran]] and [[Lasbela District|Las Bela]],&lt;ref&gt;Coastal Makran as Corridor to the Indian Ocean World by Sabir Badalkhan in Eurasian Studies (2002): 1/2 pp 257-262&lt;/ref&gt; and the Makran region of [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nomadism in Baluchistan by [[Brian J. Spooner|Brian Spooner]]'' in Pastoralists and nomads in South Asia by Lawrence S Leshnik pages 172 &amp; 175 {{ISBN|3-447-01552-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
There are different theories as to the origin of the Med community. According to their own tribal traditions, the Med originate from Gandava in the [[Bolan District|Kacchi]] region of Balochistan. It is likely that the Med are one of the earliest settlers of the Makran coast, and this is reinforced by the fact that the Med are mentioned in the chronicle of ancient [[Sindh]], the [[Chachnama]], as one of the tribes that inhabited coastal Balochistan. The Med now speak [[Balochi language|Balochi]], and consider themselves as [[Baloch people|Baloch]]. However, in both Makran and [[Lasbela District|Las Bela]], they are seen as distinct by both the [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]]. The [[Mohana (Sindhi tribe)|Mohana]] tribe of [[Sindh]] and southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] claim to be of Med origin.&lt;ref&gt;Conservatism and Change in Desert Feudalism: The Case of Southern Baluchistan by Carroll Pastner pages 247 to 260 in The nomadic alternative : modes and models of interaction in the African-Asian deserts and steppes / edited by W. Weissleder The Hague : Mouton, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balochistan District Gazetteer Makran pages 105 to 107&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social organization ==

In [[Lasbela District]] they are found mainly in the cities of Miani and [[Ormara]], and villages in between these towns, while in Makran they are found in the cities of [[Gwadar]] and [[Sonmiani Beach|Sonmiani]], and the villages in between. The Med are divided into four clans, the Chilmarzai, who claim descent from Numrio tribe of Sindh, the Jalalzai and Gazbur, who claim [[Baloch people|Baloch]] ancestry and then finally the Olmari who claim [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] ancestry. This suggests that the Med community is of diverse origin, absorbing different groups which migrated to Makran. In recent time the Med have absorbed groups of [[Black people|African]] ancestry such as the [[Siddi]]. Meds are [[Muslim]]s and like many other Makran communities, they are also divided along sectarian lines. Many Gwadar Med belong to the [[Zikri]] sect while the vast majority of Meds are [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coastal Makran as Corridor to the Indian Ocean World by Sabir Badalkhan in Eurasian Studies (2002): 1/2 pp 257-262&lt;/ref&gt; Along coastal Balochistan, fishing is entirely in the hands of the Med, with an individual fishing boat owned by a particular lineages. The Med also form an important element within the Baloch population of [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;Conservatism and Change in Desert Feudalism: The Case of Southern Baluchistan by Carroll Pastner pages 247 to 260 in The nomadic alternative : modes and models of interaction in the African-Asian deserts and steppes / edited by W. Weissleder The Hague : Mouton, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balochistan District Gazetteer Makran pages 105 to 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], the Med settlements cling to the coastline of Makran region of the province of [[Sistan and Baluchestan]]. They are largely engaged in fishing, but some of their settlements on the banks of the various seasonal streams also engage in agriculture. The Med have vague traditions of having originated in [[Sindh]], but now considers themselves and looked by others as Baloch. Like other Iranian Baloch, the Med are [[Sunni]], as distinct from the majority in Iran, who are [[Shia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nomadism in Baluchistan by Brian Spooner'' in Pastoralists and nomads in South Asia by Lawrence S Leshnik pages 172 &amp; 175 {{ISBN|3-447-01552-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SF Nude Ban Protest IMG 3778.jpg|thumb|Nude protesters demonstrate against the nudity ban in [[San Francisco]], 2013]]
'''[[Nudity]]''' is sometimes used as a tactic during a '''protest'''  to attract public attention to a [[cause]], and sometimes promotion of [[public nudity]] is itself the objective of a nude [[protest]].&lt;ref name="Alaimo2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alaimo|first1=Stacy|title=The naked word: The trans-corporeal ethics of the protesting body|journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory|volume=20|issue=1|year=2010|pages=15–36|issn=0740-770X|doi=10.1080/07407701003589253|ref=harv}}{{subscription needed|via=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the tactic goes back to well published photos of nude protests by ''svobodniki'' in Canada in 1903. The tactic has been used by other groups later in the century, especially after the 1960s. Like [[public nudity]] in general,  [[cultural]] and [[legal]] [[acceptance]] of nudity as a tactic in protest also varies around the world. Some opponents of any public nudity claim that it is [[indecent exposure|indecent]] especially when it can be viewed by children; while others argue that it is a legitimate form of expression covered by the [[Freedom of speech|right to free speech]].

Even in places where public nudity is tolerated, it is still unexpected enough that its use by activists as a deliberate tactic is often successful in attracting publicity from the media.

Some nude activism is not to promote a particular cause, but rather to promote public nudity itself, or to change community perceptions of the naked human body, or as an expression of a personal desire to be nude in public.

==Single issue protests==
===Animal rights and welfare===
[[Image:Spain-RON07-068.jpg|thumb|right|The annual [[Running of the Nudes]] in [[Pamplona]] (2007) is an example of nudity in the context of political movements and cultural events.]]
Animal rights groups such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)]], have used nudity to draw attention to their causes. ''(See [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals#Other campaigns|below]].)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|title=Naked politics : nudity, political action, and the rhetoric of the body|year=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=073916709X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the Lettuce Ladies, young women dressed in bikinis which appear to be made of lettuce, had gathered in city centers to hand out leaflets about [[veganism]]. Every year the [[Running of the Nudes]] campaign sees PETA activists run naked through [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]] in a parody of the annual [[Running of the Bulls]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runningofthenudes.com/ Runningofthenudes.com] (video)&lt;/ref&gt; Supermodels such as [[Christy Turlington]] and [[Naomi Campbell]] have posed naked on billboards with the slogan "I'd rather go naked than wear fur" emblazoned across their chests.&lt;ref name=FashionEB&gt;"Fashion and Dress", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brexit===
On 29 June 2016, Cambridge academic, Victoria Bateman walked into a meeting at the Faculty of Economics while naked in protest against the results of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016]]. She had written on her breasts and stomach "Brexit leaves Britain naked".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = 'Brexit leaves Britain naked': Cambridge academic stages nude protest against outcome of EU referendum | last = Espinoza | first = Javier | work = The Telegraph | date = 1 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-04 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/07/01/naked-don-a-cambridge-academics-protest-against-brexit/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace and anti-war===
[[Image:World naked bike ride 6.jpg|thumb|right|[[London]] [[World Naked Bike Ride|WNBR]] participants]]

Several groups and individuals have used nudity in [[anti-war]] demonstrations. Some groups include: [[Sherry Glaser#Breasts Not Bombs|Breasts Not Bombs]] and Artists for Peace/Artists Against War, which later became the [[Work Less Party of British Columbia]] in Vancouver, BC, Canada. The latter is known for its Naked Bike Rides which [[Conrad Schmidt]] later evolved into [[World Naked Bike Ride]].

Groups also started to use nudity to protest the [[Iraq War]]. Groups using their bodies to form words and symbols to convey their message included Baring Witness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baringwitness.org|website=Baring Witness|title=Baring Witness}}&lt;/ref&gt; US-based/founded by Donna Sheehan, which inspired other groups on all seven continents to stage similar events, including Bare Witness, based in the UK.

===The African curse of nakedness===
{{Main|Anasyrma}}
In Africa, women have used stripping naked on purpose as a curse,&lt;ref name="africanarguments.org"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Undress for redress: The rise of naked protests in Africa  | last = Guyson | first = Nangayi | work = African Arguments | date = 10 June 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-07 | url = http://africanarguments.org/2016/06/10/anything-to-get-justice-the-rise-of-naked-protests-africa/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; both historically, and in modern times. The idea is that women give life and they can take it away. The curse initiates an extreme form of [[ostracism]], which anthropologist [[Terisa Turner]] has likened to "[[social execution]]".  The curse extends to foreign men as well, and is believed to cause impotence, madness or other similar harm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyId=1098 The Curse of Nakedness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821102818/http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyId=1098 |date=2012-08-21 }}.

A group of about 16 women bared their buttocks and stormed into the offices of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in [[Tshwane]].

===Transgender rights===
In November, 2011, a transgender woman from [[Morristown, Tennessee|Morristown]], [[Tennessee]] was [[arrested]] and [[jailed]] for 21 days by Tennessee police for indecent exposure after removing her top in the parking lot of her local [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] after they refused to alter the gender designation on her driver's license from male to female. This was despite the fact that the U.S. federal government [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] office already had done so. As it is legal for a man to go [[Toplessness|topless]] in public and since the [[Tennessee]] [[Department of Public Safety]] refused to recognise her as female,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wate.com/story/16039917/morristown-transgendered-woman-says-she-went-topless-to-make-a-statement|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120082518/http://www.wate.com/story/16039917/morristown-transgendered-woman-says-she-went-topless-to-make-a-statement|date=15 November 2011|archive-date=2012-01-20|title=Morristown transgender woman says she went topless to make a statement|first=Monica|last=Nair|newspaper=WATE.com|location=Knoxville, TN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms Jones decided to protest her treatment by going [[Toplessness|topless]], stating "if I was a male, I had the right to, when I stepped out the door, take off my shirt...

==Public nudity movements==
[[Image:Bendprotest.jpg|thumb|Activists Terri Sue Webb and Daniel Johnson are being handcuffed and led away by [[police]] after a [[protest]] in [[Bend, Oregon]] on 2 May 2002]]

Not all people who engage in public nudity see themselves as  [[nudism|nudists]] or [[naturists]] or belong to traditional naturist or nudist organizations. Several activists, such as Vincent Bethell, claim that associations with naturism or nudism are unnecessary. Others will point out that many people who participate in events such as [[clothing-optional bike rides]] or visit [[nude beach|clothing-optional beaches]] do so casually and without association or formal affiliation to groups or movements. Activist Daniel Johnson believes that labels and affiliations overly complicate a relatively simple phenomenon, alienate others from a fear of over-commitment or undesirable stereotypes, and thus get in the way of integrating nudity into everyday life.

===Clothing-optional bike rides===
{{main|Clothing-optional bike ride}}
[[Image:Banner protesting vehicle emissions at the World Naked Bike Ride, Auckland, New Zealand - 20050217.jpg|thumbnail|Protesters gathered outside a courthouse on 17 Feb 2005 to protest against the arrest of [[Simon Oosterman]] (second from left), [[Auckland]]'s 2005 WNBR organiser.]]
[[World Naked Bike Ride]] (WNBR) is an international [[clothing-optional bike ride]] in which participants plan, meet and ride together ''en masse'' on [[human-powered transport]] (the vast majority on [[bicycle]]s, and fewer on [[skateboard]]s, [[rollerblade]]s, [[Roller skating|roller skates]]) to "protest oil dependency and celebrate the power and individuality of our bodies".{{ref|WNBRwebsite}} This represents one of the few events that combine elements that could be described as pro nudity and pro cycling (as well as environmental).

Many of the political rides have their roots from [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] and are often described or categorized as a form of [[Protest|political protest]], [[street theatre]], [[party]]-on-wheels, [[streaking]], [[public nudity]] and [[Naturism|clothing-optional recreation]] and thus attracts a wide range of participants. Since 1996 Critical Tits has been hosting a "raucous topless bicycle joyride" on Friday afternoon at the annual [[Burning Man]] festival in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticaltits.com/faq.html|title=Critical Tits Party FAQs|author=|date=|website=www.criticaltits.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In 1969, in Denmark, 300 individuals participated in a massive naked "wade-in" at a Danish beach. The event helped push forward dramatic reformation in public policy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} It is now possible and allowed to be naked at any public beach in Denmark with only two major exceptions: Holmsland Klit and Hennestrand. The remaining 4,700 kilometers of Danish coast are clothing-optional.

===Netherlands===
Robbert Broekstra (now deceased) was involved in a group called "Friends of Nature".  They would often go for naked excursions on public lands, sometimes in urban areas, often taking pictures.  He was also involved in INIC (International Naturist Information Center).  He authored the book ''Robbert Broekstra's Nude World''&lt;ref name="Broekstra1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Broekstra|first=Robbert |title=Nude World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZPFAAAACAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Internaturally|isbn=978-0-9636805-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his group appeared in "Naked Travels 1", by Charles MacFarland.

===German movements===
* '''Wald-[[Freikörperkultur|FKK]]''' – German movement for the liberalisation of public nudity. Founder Peter Niehenke was fined several times for indecent exposure because he went running nude in public spaces.
* '''Nacktwandern''' – German movement for the freedom to hike in the nude.
* '''Integral Nactiv''' -  Nacktiv is a combination of the German word "nackt" (naked) and "aktiv" (active).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anita &amp; Wolfgang Gramer |url=http://nacktiv.de |title=Nackt und aktiv, Bücher über nackte Menschen in der Öffentlichkeit |publisher=Nacktiv.de |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Freedom to be Yourself===
The Freedom to be Yourself campaign (TFTBY or FTBY) was founded in 1998 by Vincent Bethell. The group, according to Vincent Bethell is about "the right to be [[public nudity|naked in public]]". Supporters of the TFTBY organized several grassroots naked protests in public in [[London]]; there have also been protests in Brighton, Bristol, Birmingham, Coventry, and some in the [[United States]].

Terri Sue Webb is an activist living in [[Bend, Oregon]], who was one of few activists in the [[United States]] active in The Freedom to be Yourself (TFTBY or FTBY) campaign. She has been imprisoned and released multiple times for [[public nudity]]. On several occasions she has remained fully nude while incarcerated, often resulting in a much longer jail sentence. There has been quite a bit of media coverage of her activities. Daniel Johnson went nude with her in public on two occasions in 2001 and 2002.

He has been arrested several times and put in prison in the course of his rambles. In his last walk he was only arrested twice in England, and released almost immediately, but due to the different legal system and laws in Scotland, he was arrested many more times after crossing the border and spent time in HMP Edinburgh, then moved to HMP Barlinnie Glasgow in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/sln/blogentry.aspx?blogentryref=7521|title=report in University of Edinburgh School of Law's Scots Law News|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213102446/http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/sln/blogentry.aspx?blogentryref=7521|archivedate=2009-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Collins has been cycling naked through his home town of Cambridge, England for some time. He has been organizing several protests on the TFTBY Stop Segregation discussion group (no longer in existence). Richard has been arrested numerous times and released, although he was convicted of an offence under section 5, Public Order Act 1986, in Bournemouth, England, on 13 June after his nude cycling attracted complaints approximately 12-months earlier. Richard says: "My outings are NOT protests as such but 'activities'. Simply me having fun! And exercising my right to nude freedom!"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Topfreedom==
[[File:Topless protest.JPG|thumb|Protest for Topfree equal rights]]
{{main|Topfreedom}}
The topfreedom movement has challenged the law in a number of countries, especially in North America and in Europe, on [[sex equality]] grounds arguing that the present [[Public indecency#Legal status in the United States|public indecency]] laws discriminate against women. The movement advocates equal rights for women to be topfree in the same circumstances that a man is permitted to be [[bare-chested]].

The Topfree Equal Rights Association (TERA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tera.ca|title=Topfree Equal Rights Association|website=www.tera.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Canadian organization which endeavors to assist women who are having legal troubles exercising their rights to be topfree. Their website states that they serve both Canada and the United States. The organization also aims to inform and educate the public about topfreedom, and to change laws against topfreedom in North American [[jurisdiction]]s. GoTopless goes further and organizes demonstrations to protest against the legal and public attitude to the inequality. In [[Sweden]], Bara Bröst is active in advancing topfreedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/76183-swedes-fight-for-topless-rights |publisher=Metro.co.uk|date=November 19, 2007|title=Swedes fight for topless rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/9599/20080108/ Victory for topless bathers] Article from The Local&lt;/ref&gt; as is Topless Front in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/article506929.ece |publisher=[[Politiken]] |date=19 December 2009 |title=Topløs svømning har altid været tilladt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the feminist collective Les TumulTueuses has moved beyond seeking equality with men as indicated by their slogan: "My body if I want, when I want, like it is" ("Mon corps si je veux, quand je veux, tel qu'il est").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tumultueuses.com/ACTION-PISCINE Mon corps si je veux, quand je veux, comme il est] Tumultueuses website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20090507.OBS6010/des-feministes-enlevent-le-haut-dans-une-piscine-a-paris.html|title=Des féministes enlèvent le haut dans une piscine à Paris|date=7 May 2009|work=L'Obs|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2550">'''Online land planning''' is a collaborative process in which [[sustainable development]] practices and design professionals from across the world are networked to provide advice and solutions on [[urban design]] and [[land planning]] issues. The target audience includes property owners, communities, businesses and government agencies that have limited access, time, finances or personnel to make informed decisions about [[land use]]. In many cases, this approach provides [[electronic documents]] that become the catalyst to rebuild after natural or man-made spur [[rural community development]] and stimulate or create a new [[microeconomy]].

==Importance of technology==
One goal of online land planning is the effective use of the internet to support information sharing and decision making from remote locations such as the home. The use of the Internet, coupled with software technology such as [[geographic information systems]] (GIS), allows municipalities and other public and private organizations to compile base information, exchange information, present solutions to land planning issues, and receive feedback vis the internet. Benefits for land development companies and real estate industry organizations like the Urban Land Institute [http://www.uli.org] include easier access to efficient digital planning technologies, along with the opportunity for immediate participation and feedback.

Worldwide, local and regional governments have created their own websites with access to map-centric and entreprise GIS databases that provide operational and public-service resources.

In the [[politics of the United States]], '''opposition research''' (also called '''oppo research''') is the practice of collecting information on a political opponent or other adversary that can be used to discredit or otherwise weaken them. The information can include biographical, legal, criminal, medical, educational, or financial history or activities, as well as prior media coverage, or the voting record of a politician. Opposition research can also entail using "trackers" to follow an individual and record their activities or political speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-05-22/opposition-research-romney-obama/55138756/1 |title=Researchers dig deeper for dirt on political opposition |last=Schouten |first=Fredreka |date=23 May 2012 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research is usually conducted in the time period between announcement of intent to run and the actual election; however political parties maintain long-term databases that can cover several decades. The practice is both a tactical maneuver and a cost-saving measure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephanie |last=Mencimer |title=Dirty Politics |publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]] |date=30 May 2008 |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2008/05/30/3104/dirty-politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is frequently used to refer not just to the collection of information but also how it is utilized, as a component of [[negative campaigning]].

==Origins and history==
In the 1st century BC, [[Cicero]] is said to have gathered information that was damaging to opponents and using it in attacks against them. He accused one political opponent, [[Catiline]], of murdering one wife to make room for another. He attacked [[Mark Antony]] in speeches known as the ''[[Philippicae]]'', eventually prompting Antony to chop off his head and right hand and display them at the Roman Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kamber |first=Victor |author-link=Victor Kamber |title=Poison Politics |location=New York |publisher=Insight Books |year=1997 |page=9 |isbn=978-030645628-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition research also has its origins in military planning, as evident in such ancient texts as ''[[The Art of War]]'', published in the 5th century BC by [[Sun Tzu]]. This manual for warriors describes the necessity for understanding an opponent's weaknesses, for using spies, and for striking in moments of weakness.

In 18th century England, opposition research took the form of scandalmongering pamphlet wars between the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] parties. Writers such as [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Jonathan Swift]], and [[Henry Fielding]] participated, often writing under assumed names.&lt;ref&gt;Kamber, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition of robust attack was replicated later in the American colonies, when writers such as [[Thomas Paine]] or [[Benjamin Franklin]] conducted opposition research and published their results.

The first appearance of the phrase "opposition research" in the ''New York Times'' occurred on December 17, 1971, in an article that describes the infiltration of the [[Edmund Muskie]] presidential campaign by a female Republican volunteer:  "...an article appeared in a Washington newspaper describing the 'opposition research' program at Republican headquarters..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  |accessdate=2012-02-03}}  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition research became systematized in the 1970s when [[Ken Khachigian]], in the [[Nixon Administration]] suggested that the GOP keep files on individuals as insurance against future races, rather than "scramble" in an ''ad hoc'' fashion race by race.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Methods==

Opposition research differs immensely depending on the size and funding of a campaign, the ethics of the candidate, and the era in which it is conducted. Information gathering can be classified into three main categories: open-source research enabled by the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], [[covert operations]] or "[[tradecraft]], " and maintenance of human systems of informants. Increasingly, data-mining of electronic records is used. Information is then stored for future use, and disseminated in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John J. |last=Pitney |title=The Art of Political Warfare |location=Norman OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=2000 |pages=120–139 |isbn=978-080613263-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local election sometimes has a [[political campaign staff|staff member]] dedicated to reading through all of the opponents' public statements and their voting records; others initiate whisper campaigns that employ techniques of [[disinformation]] or "black ops" to deliberately mislead the public by advancing a pre-determined "narrative" that will present the opponent in a negative light.

Another technique is to infiltrate the opposition's operations and position a paid informant there. "Gray propaganda" techniques are often used to release damaging information to news media outlets without its source being identified properly, a technique inherited from disinformation tactics employed by intelligence agencies such as the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Pitney, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

File-sharing between operatives of political parties is quite common.  In the 2008 presidential election, a dossier of opposition research against Republican Vice-Presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]] was posted in its entirety on a political blog site, [[Politico.com]]. The file was compiled by the staff of her opponent in the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial race, [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ben |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Bresnehan |title=Documents Detail Palin's Political Life |website=Politico |date=2 September 2008 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2008/09/documents-detail-palins-political-life-013084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Oppo dumps" are used by political campaigns to systematically supply files of damaging information to press outlets, including matters of the public record, video footage from party archives and private collections, as well as private intelligence gathered by operatives. Many prime time television and radio news commentaries rely on this supply of party-generated material because it is free, and therefore more cost-effective than paying investigative reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Megan |last=McArdle |title=Prime Time for Oppo Dumps |magazine=[[Atlantic Monthly]] |date=31 March 2008 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2008/03/prime-time-for-oppo-dumps/3157/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Scherer |title=The Matt Drudge Primary |website=Salon.com |date=14 May 2007 |url=https://www.salon.com/2007/05/14/drudge_11/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates and incumbents who benefit from opposition research often choose to remain uninformed about their campaign's operations and tactics, to insure [[plausible deniability]] should criminal charges be brought against researchers.

==="Trackers" and videography===
Yet another technique is to position information or personnel within media outlets. Often the information is video footage gathered in campaign-funded "tracker programs" wherein videographers use candidates' itineraries to track them and record as many remarks as possible, since anything they say can and will be used against them, as was the case in former Senator George Allen's "macaca moment."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In  the 2006 election cycle, a Virginia senator, [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]], was unseated because of videotape of the senator calling a videographer/opposition researcher as "macaca" or monkey. The name was considered to be an ethnic slur, and Allen's campaign could not overcome the damage when the incident was broadcast widely in mainstream media and on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Bass |title=In Dixie, Signs of a Rising Biracial Politics |publisher=New York Times |date=May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/weekinreview/11bass.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital media and Wikipedia ===
A 2005 analysis of digital media strategies published by the American Academy of Political Science took the view that new technologies enable "political elites" to use database and Internet technologies to do opposition research more easily, but they use data-mining techniques that outrage privacy advocates and surreptitious technologies that few Internet users understand. Data becomes "richer" about political actors, policy options, and the diversity of actors and opinion in the public sphere, but citizenship is "thinner" by virtue of "the ease in which people can become politically expressive without being substantively engaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howard |first=Philip N. |author-link=Philip N. Howard |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |year=2005 |volume=597 |pages=153–170 |doi=10.1177/0002716204270139 |title=Deep Democracy, Thin Citizenship: The Impact of Digital Media in Political Campaign Strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Facebook]] photos became a tool of opposition researchers in [[California's 32nd congressional district special election, 2009]] to replace [[Hilda Solis]].  Front-runner [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Gil Cedillo]] sent out mailers targeting 26-year-old Emanuel Pleitez, grouping Pleitez's Facebook photos to suggest that he parties to excess with alcohol, and fraternizes with [[gangs]].  The text of the mailer suggested Pleitez, posing with a Latino stage actress and using a Latino [[voter registration drive]] hand sign, was "flashing gang signs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Blake |title=Facebook Photos Used as Opposition Research |website=The Hill |date=May 7, 2009 |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/campaigns/35943-facebook-photos-used-as-opposition-research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the campaign manager of Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate [[Cathy Cox]], Morton Brilliant, resigned after Cox's opponent, Lt. Gov, [[Mark Taylor (American politician)|Mark Taylor]], revealed Cox's campaign had added information from an opposition research dossier to a Wikipedia page on Taylor. Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] confirmed that the material had come from an IP address affiliated with the Cox campaign. Citing an Associated Press analysis, CNN reported that Wikipedia being used as a "popular tool" for opposition researchers became so widespread a problem that Wikipedia altered its submission guidelines and set up alerts so that its operators know when [[Capitol Hill]] staffers alter Wikipedia content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Hamby |title=Campaign Manager Resigns Amid Wikipedia Flap |work=CNN Politics |date=April 26, 2006 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/26/cox.wikipedia/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, anyone who wanted to could simply bypass this by using an IP address not associated with Capitol Hill.

===Grassroots oppo-research===
Opposition research is a necessary component of "grassroots" activist groups. Research on corporate or political opponents may enable activist groups to target neighborhoods from which to increase their numbers, to refine their focus or "target," to pinpoint the target's vulnerabilities, to reveal hidden sources of funding or little-known connections, to investigate scare tactics, and to augment a legislative initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lee |last=Staples |title=Roots to Power:  A Manual for Grassroots Organizing |edition=2nd |location=Westbury, CT |publisher=Praeger |date=2003 |page=227, passim |isbn=978-027596997-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the presidential election of 2008, the blog [[Talking Points Memo]] pioneered "collaborative citizen-reporting projects" based on groups of volunteers examining public documents that shed light on the George W. Bush administration's U.S. attorneys firings controversy.  Other organizations such as the [[Sunlight Foundation]] encouraged citizen examination of such public domain records as Mitt Romney's financial disclosure statements and Bill Clinton's income statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Arnoldy |title=Army of Average Joes Culls Through Candidates' Files, Bios |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=October 17, 2007 |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1017/p03s03-uspo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventative measures===
Political strategies for campaigns often include coaching on preventive measures to avoid providing too much information in public disclosure procedures that can provide ammunition for opponents' opposition researchers, particularly in itemized expenditure reports. "To eliminate some of these potential issues your campaign should take the time to review the wording of your campaign finance reports," advises one strategist writing for ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead of reporting that you spent $3,000 on a 'background check and public records search on Congressman X,' list the expenditure as 'issue research' or simply 'research'... One bonus financial filing tip:  warn your candidate about spending campaign funds on fancy restaurants for 'strategy meetings.' Eating at [[Ruth's Chris Steak House|Ruth's Chris]] or [[Morton's The Steakhouse|Morton's Steak House]] on your campaign's dime just looks bad.  The press may poke a little fun at your candidate's expense; your donors may feel their donation in being misspent and may never give again.&lt;ref&gt;Brent Barksdale, quoted in [http://www.politicsmagazine.com/blog_post/show/425 "TMI Can Sink Your Report,"] Campaigns &amp; Elections/Politics blog, ''The Hill'', July 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Funding and institutions===
Congressional and presidential opposition research is often conducted by or funded by a political party, lobbying group, [[political action committee]] (PAC), or a [[527 group]] that coalesces around a certain issue. In the U.S., both the Republican and Democratic parties employ full-time "Directors of Research" and maintain databases on opponents. In recent years the task of opposition research has been privatized in many areas. Full-time companies with permanent staff specializing in media productions or "grassroots" operations have replaced volunteers and campaign officials. Political media consultants may also opt for [[astroturfing]] techniques, which simulate wide popular appeal for a candidate's platform.

== In presidential elections ==
Opponents of [[Andrew Jackson]] in the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections unearthed his marriage records to imply that he was an [[adultery|adulterer]] for marrying Rachel Robards before she was legally divorced from her first husband.  Jackson had married her in 1791 on the strength of a statement from her husband that he had divorced her; Jackson had two wedding ceremonies, the not-recognizable one of 1791 and the legally corrective one of 1794.  His political opponents used this information decades later against him, and he fought many duels over his wife's honor.  Rachel Robards died before Jackson took office in his first term; he maintained that the stress of the opposition had killed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The life of Andrew Jackson |last=Remini|first=Robert Vincent |year=2001 |publisher=Perennial |isbn=0060937351 |edition=1st Perennial classics |location=New York |oclc=46951836 |pages=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], the law partner of [[Abraham Lincoln]], did research in the Illinois State Library to collect "all the ammunition Mr. Lincoln saw fit to gather" to prepare for the run against [[Stephen A. Douglas]] in the 1860 presidential race.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Harold Holzer, ed.  The Lincoln-Douglas Debates, New York: HarperCollins, 1994, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for Ronald Reagan’s debate with President [[Jimmy Carter]] in the presidential race 1980, Reagan’s campaign staff acquired under mysterious circumstances a 200-page briefing book, including information on Carter’s strategy, which staffers [[David Stockman]] and [[David Gergen]] had used to prepare Reagan.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department investigated to see how the information had been obtained by the Reagan camp. Two law professors filed suit in federal district court in Washington to request a special investigation, based on the 1978 [[Ethics in Government Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, “Special Prosecutor Sought in Briefing Book Case,”  October 26, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter’s staff believed the book to have been stolen from the White House, but the inquiry did not uncover any credible evidence that any law had been violated. The House of Representatives conducted its own investigation, and concluded in a 2,314-page report that the Reagan staff had two copies of the book, one from Reagan’s campaign director [[William J. Casey]], future head of the Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rottinghaus |first1=Brandon |last2=Bereznikova |first2=Zlata |date=September 2006 |title=Exorcising Scandal in the White House: Presidential Polling in Times of Crisis |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=493–505 |doi=10.1111/j.1741-5705.2006.02559.x |issn=0360-4918}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Baker]] attributed the acquisition of the documents to Casey, who claimed to know nothing about them, and an analysis of Carter campaign documents found in the “Afghanistan” files of Reagan aide [[David Gergen]] indicated they came from three White House offices: the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] and Domestic Adviser [[Stuart Eizenstat]].&lt;ref&gt;Ed Magnuson, “I Never Knew There Was Such a Thing,” Time, July 11, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Many years afterward, Carter himself stated in a PBS interview that the book had been taken by columnist [[George Will]], but Will denied it, calling Carter "a recidivist liar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Will |title=Briefing Book Baloney |work=Washington Post |date=August 11, 2005 |page=A23 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001796.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Atwater]] is considered to be the "father" of modern aggressive "oppo" techniques.  Atwater honed his style working in his native South Carolina for Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] and to elect Congressman (later Governor) [[Carroll Campbell]].  From his posts on the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], Atwater encouraged and helped direct what was then the advanced oppo work of the [[Republican National Committee]] against Democrats [[Walter Mondale]] and [[Michael Dukakis]]. During the 1988 presidential campaign, dozens of RNC researchers worked three shifts around the clock to feed the then-burgeoning [[24-hour news cycle]].  The now-infamous “Willie Horton” TV ads crafted by [[Floyd Brown]] helped turn voters away from Dukakis and towards the Republican, although Atwater and Bush were protected by [[plausible deniability]] because Brown's ads were independently funded and produced.  Academic research into the Bush archives decades later revealed that a Bush staffer, Candice Strother, had released a dossier of information on Willie Horton to Elizabeth Fediay, of the non-profit group that contracted for the ad.&lt;ref&gt;Tali Mendelburg, ''The Race Card'', Princeton University Press, 2004, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Horton story had been completely public for an entire year, part of news coverage that won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for the Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune newspaper.) [[Willie Horton]] was an African-American convicted murderer released on a weekend furlough during Governor Dukakis’s tenure, who escaped and committed a brutal rape in Maryland, also stabbing his victim's husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Beloved Mug Shot For the Bush Forces |work=New York Times |date=October 3, 1988 |page=A22 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/03/us/campaign-trail-a-beloved-mug-shot-for-the-bush-forces.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atwater is also credited with originating "push polls" and "whisper campaigns" that use disinformation strategies to alienate voters from opponents.  A biography of Atwater, quotes him as saying in an interview toward the end of his life that he regretted some of his less ethical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Joseph |last=Brady |title=Bad Boy: The Life and Politics of Lee Atwater |year=1997 |isbn=0201627337}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 presidential campaign, Republicans reported that they spent $6 million on a "state of the art (opposition research) war machine" to investigate Bill Clinton, who was running against [[George H. W. Bush]].  In the same election, the Clinton campaign paid more than $100,000 to a private investigator to look into allegations about Clinton's womanizing, investigating more than two dozen women.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Johnson, ''No Place for Amateurs'', 2nd edition. New York: Routlege, Taylor, and Francis Group, 2007, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 presidential election, longtime opposition researcher and Nixon loyalist [[Roger Stone]] was recruited by former Secretary of State [[James Baker]] to oversee the recount of the disputed Presidential election in Miami-Dade County in 2000. Stone is credited with organizing the street demonstrations and eventual shut-down of the recount in that pivotal county.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Toobin, ''Too Close to Call'',&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 presidential race, [[Chris Lehane]], a Democratic opposition researcher attracted notoriety and built a reputation not for deploying his skills against Republican opponents, but for using them against other Democrats in the primary races.  Working for retired Army general Wesley Clark, Lehane sought to establish a media "narrative" that Howard Dean was hypocritical and dishonest, based on surveys of his administrative archive as governor of Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Joshua |last=Green |title=Playing Dirty |work=The Atlantic Monthly |date=June 2004 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/06/playing-dirty/302960/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protege of Atwater's, [[Karl Rove]], is considered to be the "architect" of George W. Bush's election to the governor's office in Texas, and to the presidency in 2000 and 2004. In the 2000 race, Rove is credited with masterminding the push poll that initiated the "[[John McCain]] has a black love child" whisper campaign in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Dirty Tricks, South Carolina and John McCain |magazine=The Nation |date=January 14, 2008 |last=Banks |first=Ann |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/dirty-tricks-south-carolina-and-john-mccain/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anonymous telephone pollsters, upon determining that a voter was pro-McCain, asked the question, "Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew he had fathered a black child out of wedlock?" The question was not overt slander, but it prompted the president of [[Bob Jones University]] to launch his own internet campaign against McCain, and succeeded in crippling the trust of voters McCain had attracted. The Bush camp knew, as the general public did not, that in reality, John McCain was the adoptive father of a dark-skinned Bangladeshi refugee who was rescued by his wife Cindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard H. |last=Davis |title=The Anatomy of a Smear Campaign |work=Boston Globe |date=March 21, 2004 |url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 presidential election, opposition researchers for Barack Obama unearthed the fact that John Edwards had paid $400 for haircuts at campaign expense, and supplied Politico's Ben Smith with the tip, according to a memoir later published by campaign manager David Plouffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Smith |title=A Haircut Tip |work=Politico |date=November 10, 2009 |url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2009/11/a-haircut-tip-022732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Democratic National Committee]] continues to fund a research department, after the 2008 presidential election, the New York Times reported that "The legacy of the Democratic National Committee itself is hardly clear going forward. Mr. Obama effectively subsumed all the responsibilities in his campaign: fundraising, voter turn-out and opposition research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dean Steps Down as DNC Chair |work=New York Times |date=November 10, 2008 |url=https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/dean-steps-down-as-dnc-chair/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive branch==
* '''Franklin Roosevelt Administration''': In 1940, the White House accidentally taped a conversation of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] instructing a lower level aide to disseminate a rumor about his opponent [[Wendell Willkie]] having an extramarital affair: "We can't have any of our principal speakers refer to it, but the people down the line can get it out."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Roosevelt, quoted in John J. Pitney, ''The Art of Political Warfare'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Johnson Administration''': In 1964, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] sent 30 FBI agents to the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, N.J., to avert assassination attempts, and to monitor his political rival [[Robert Kennedy]] and civil rights activists. Johnson later also placed his Republican challenger, [[Barry Goldwater]], under FBI surveillance, with a federal wiretap.&lt;ref&gt;Pitney, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nixon Administration''': During the [[Richard Nixon]] administration, White House staffers compiled lists of names of political opponents, journalists who had criticized Nixon, and artists and actors (such as [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Paul Newman]]) who had dissented with Nixon policy, especially on the subject of Vietnam, with the intent of prompting Internal Revenue Service investigations. The full extent of Nixon's surveillance of private citizens solely on the basis of their dissent was not known until years after Nixon was forced to resign, as former staff members such as [[Charles Colson]] and [[John Dean]] began to disclose details.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  [[Nixon's Enemies List]] is the informal name of what started as a list of President Richard Nixon’s major political opponents compiled by Charles Colson, written by George T. Bell [1] (assistant to Colson, special counsel to the White House) and sent in memorandum form to John Dean on September 9, 1971. The list was part of a campaign officially known as “Opponents List” and “Political Enemies Project.” The official purpose, as described by the White House Counsel’s Office, was to “screw” Nixon’s political enemies, by means of tax audits from the IRS, and by manipulating “grant availability, federal contracts, litigation, prosecution, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;"List of White House 'Enemies' and Memo Submitted by Dean to the Ervin Committee," ''Facts on File, Watergate and the White House'', vol. 1, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ford Administration''': During the [[Gerald Ford]] presidency, Deputy Assistant [[Dick Cheney]] suggested in a now-infamous memo to [[Donald Rumsfeld]] that the White House use the [[United States Justice Department]] to conduct opposition research and retaliate against political opponents and critical journalists such as [[Seymour Hersh]] and the [[New York Times]], arguing that the executive branch had the power to prosecute journalists as they saw fit, under the provisions of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar/preview/documents.html Dick Cheney's Memos from 30 Years Ago] – Frontline.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reagan Administration''': In 1984, during the [[Ronald Reagan]] presidency, the [[Republican National Committee]] formed [[The Opposition Research Group]], with its own budget of $1.1 million. These staff amassed information on eight Democratic presidential candidates based on data from voting records, Congressional Record speeches, media clippings and transcripts, campaign materials, all of which was stored on a computer for easy access. In this way the Reagan team was able to track inconsistencies and attack them. This original data base evolved into a network that linked information gleaned by Republicans in all 50 states, creating a master data base accessible to high-ranking Republican staff, even aboard [[Air Force One]].&lt;ref&gt;J.M Bayer &amp; J. Rodota, "Computerized Opposition Research," ''Campaigns &amp; Elections'', 6, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this RNC database was accessible to both the Reagan White House and campaign team, no evidence has surfaced that U.S. federal dollars funded [[The Opposition Research Group]] or its efforts.
* '''Clinton Administration''': During the [[Bill Clinton]] administration, the "[[White House FBI files controversy|Filegate]]" scandal erupted when White House staffers said to be acting on the directions of First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] improperly accessed 500 FBI files compiled for security checks of Reagan and Bush staffers in previous administrations. Craig Livingstone, said to be hired by Mrs. Clinton with dubious credentials, resigned amid public outcry. In testimony under oath during the [[Kenneth Starr]] special prosecutor's investigation, Mrs. Clinton stated that she had neither hired Livingstone nor improperly perused the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=George Lardner Jr. |author2=Susan Schmidt |title=Livingstone Resigns, Denying Ill Intent |work=Washington Post |date=June 27, 1996 |page=A01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/stories/wwtr960627.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George W. Bush Administration''': Two former opposition researchers for the RNC appointed to Justice Department posts, [[Timothy Griffin]] and [[Monica Goodling]], were implicated in efforts to use data collected on Democratic-appointed federal attorneys as ground for dismissal. See [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy]]. See also [[Karl Rove]].  Also during this administration,  [[Counterintelligence Field Activity]] (CIFA), an intelligence gathering arm of [[the Pentagon]] was disbanded in 2008, after investigations into the bribery activities directed at [[Duke Cunningham]] revealed that the U.S. government kept a sizeable database of information about 126 domestic peace activist groups, including [[Quakers]], about 1,500 "suspicious incidents" including peace demonstrations outside armed forces recruiter offices, even though the groups posed no specified threat to national security.  The program was known as Talon. About two years elapsed between the program's disbanding and the ''Post'' report. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' quoted an unnamed "official" as saying,"On the surface, it looks like things in the database that were determined not to be viable threats were never deleted but should have been," the official said. "You can also make the argument that these things should never have been put in the database in the first place until they were confirmed as threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Walter |last=Pincus |title=Pentagon Will Review Database on U.S. Citizens |work=Washington Post |date=December 15, 2001 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/14/AR2005121402528.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Barack Obama Administration:'''  In February 2009, Shauna Daly, a former opposition researcher for the Democratic National Committee was appointed as a researcher for the White House's Office of Legal Counsel. Daly was [[Barack Obama]]'s deputy research director during the presidential campaign, spent much of the cycle rebutting viral online attacks on Obama's character and biography under the rubric of "Stop the Smears." Shortly thereafter, amid speculations that she would be conducting research against political opponents,  she was reassigned as Research Director to the DNC.  Politico.com reported on February 27, 2009 that "the counsel's office – which doesn't face the sort of rapid-response demands that were common in the late Clinton years – doesn't plan to fill the research post."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Smith, ''Politico.com'', February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The American Spectator]]'' reported on its "Washington Prowler" blog that Daly was posted in the White House Counsel's Office for "about a month," and thus had access to "reams of Bush administration documents related to such things as the firings of U.S. Attorney, the use and internal debate over the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] and the [[Scooter Libby]] and [[Karl Rove]] investigations.  The "Prowler" quoted  "a DNC staffer" as saying, "She realized that she could do more with all the material she saw outside of the building than inside where she'd be bound by the rules and legalities of the White House Counsel's Office.  Now she isn't.  She's good at what she does; her time at the White House means we've got a mother load (''sic'') of material that will have Republicans scrambling.  At least that's what we hope."&lt;ref&gt;"The Washington Prowler," [[The American Spectator]], March 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==

In 1916, after President [[Woodrow Wilson]] nominated [[Louis Brandeis]] for the Supreme Court, "concerned" citizens seeking to block his confirmation offered information that Brandeis was a "radical Zionist," even though he was not a practicing Jew. Brandeis aggressively outmaneuvered his detractors by mounting his own opposition research efforts, including a carefully constructed chart that exposed the social and financial connections of the group, mostly from Boston's Back Bay, and including Harvard president [[Lawrence Lowell]], as well as a group headed by former President [[William Howard Taft]] and a host of [[American Bar Association]] past presidents. Brandeis sent the chart to [[Walter Lippman]] at the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' who penned an editorial condemning "the most homogeneous, self-centered, and self-complacent community in the United States."  Brandeis was confirmed after four months of hearings, in a Senate vote of 47–22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boudin|first=Michael|date=1976|editor-last=Urofsky|editor-first=Melvin I.|editor2-last=Levy|editor2-first=David W.|editor3-last=Brandeis|editor3-first=Louis D.|title=Justice Brandeis: The Confirmation Struggle and the Zionist Movement|jstor=795344|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=85|issue=4|pages=591–596|doi=10.2307/795344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Reagan]] nominated Judge [[Robert Bork]] for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987, prompting a Senate floor speech from Democratic Massachusetts senator [[Ted Kennedy]], which later became known as the "Robert Bork's America" speech:
::&lt;small&gt;Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is – and is often the only – protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy.&lt;/small&gt;

Kennedy's speech prompted a rapid-response opposition research effort from Democrats, but the White House waited two and a half months to respond. The [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], under the direction of Delaware senator and presidential hopeful [[Joseph Biden]], commissioned a report in response to the materials Reagan's staff had released in support of Bork's nomination. Prepared by a panel of lawyers, including two Duke University law professors, the 78-page became known as "The Biden Report." The report detailed Bork's record, and analyzed the pattern of his rulings, and deeming him to be a conservative "activist" rather than an impartial jurist  Ultimately, Bork's embattled nomination failed, and Anthony Kennedy (no relation to Ted) was later confirmed to fill the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report Assails Bork's Record On Constitutional Questions |agency=AP |work=New York Times |date=September 4, 1987 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/us/report-assails-bork-s-record-on-constitutional-questions.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Christopher H. |last1=Schroeder |first2=Jeffrey |last2=Peck |title=Response Prepared to White House Analysis of Judge Bork’s Record (Biden Report) |date=September 2, 1987 |journal=Cardozo Law Review |volume=9 |pages=219–296 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fierce research-based opposition to Bork's nomination attracted significant media attention, even though a [[Gallup Poll]] on the eve of the confirmation vote showed that very few Americans could name the nominee in question, much less recall his rulings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gallup Poll'' (2007), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; A new verb was later coined; "to bork" a candidate or nominee by mounting such voluminous research and vocal opposition that the person in question would be forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]] (2001, May 27).

After President [[George W. Bush]] nominated [[Harriet Miers]] to the U.S. Supreme Court, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that Republican conservative advocacy groups were conducting opposition research against her: "Groups are circulating lists of questions they want members of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] to ask Miers at her confirmation hearings. The activists' thinly veiled hope is that Miers will reveal ignorance of the law and give senators a reason to oppose her."&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Savage, "Guess Who's Doing Opposition Research Against Harriet Miers?" ''Boston Globe'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Miers later withdrew her name from consideration for the court.

On July 7, 2005, soon after the resignation of Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], the [[Democratic National Committee]] gathered and circulated information on the "anti-civil rights" and "anti-immigrant" rulings of [[Samuel A. Alito, Jr.]], by then nominated by President [[George W. Bush]] to replace her. Upon inspection, the documents were revealed to have been amended by [[Devorah Adler]], research director for the DNC. Alito's "record" had been pointedly altered to present him in a negative light. While the incident was not unusual, it received publicity in prominent places because it drew attention to the "meta-data" that is often unwittingly stored in documents that are altered and forwarded electronically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Zeller, Jr.]], "Beware Your Trail of Digital Fingerprints," ''New York Times'', November 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2009, after Supreme Court Justice [[David Souter]] announced his intent to retire from the court, the ''New York Times'' reported that Curt Levey, executive director of the Committee for Justice, had noted that conservatives were "focusing opposition research efforts on 17 women, whom they have divided into two tiers based on their perceived chances."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Savage]], "Wider World of Choices to Fill Souter's Vacancy," ''New York Times'', May 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven aides to members of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] pleaded guilty on January 7, 2010, to illegal use of state resources for campaign activities, including opposition research against the political opponents of incumbent officeholders during 2007.

During [[Lamar Alexander]]'s 2002 campaign for the U.S. Senate, Alexander's campaign staff received an anonymous mailing of a photograph of opponent [[Bob Clement]] obviously serving as a board member of a failed bank whose owners had been imprisoned for bank fraud.  When the Alexander campaign raised the issue of Clement's financial ties with the convicted felons, Clement denied any connection.  When the Alexander campaign produced the photograph as evidence, Clement claimed his role was only an informal advisory one.&lt;ref&gt;Erik, Schellzig (Associated Press) "Opposition Research is 'Dark Art' for Campaigns," Jackson, Tennessee, ''Sun'', August 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July 2009 Alaska governor Sarah Palin announced that she would be resigning as governor, partly due to complications from opposition research and ethics inquiries after her inclusion on the 2008 GOP presidential race ballot as John McCain's running mate. At a later news conference Palin told reporters, "Obviously conditions had changed so drastically on August 29, the day I was tapped to be VP," she said. "The opposition research and the games that began there — which I think is the new normal in Alaska politics, until I hand the reins over to Sean Parnell — have been so distracting."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pennsylvania state legislature in July 2009, former state House Democratic Campaign Committee Chair, Rep. [[Stephen Stetler]] found himself amidst an investigation when he rejected a plan that would have shifted the job of opposition research from employees on the state payroll to private firms.  Attorney General [[Tom Corbett]] alleged that millions in public funds were paid to state employees who did such research on the 2006 and 2004 campaigns of Democrats in the state.  Stetler left the House after 2006 to become the state's revenue secretary. A former aide, Dan Wiedemer testified before grand jurors that the suggestion to remove politically motivated research from the hands of public employees "was more or less shot down."  Though Stetler has not been charged, 12 former House members and members of their staff were charged with diverting public funds for political campaign work.&lt;ref&gt;Tracie Mauriello and [[Dennis B. Roddy]], "Ex-aide's Testimony in Probe Revealed," ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Stetler was among those subpoenaed, said Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for Democratic Gov.

'''Australia'''

In October 2011, a media storm erupted in Australia over the leaking of 'dirt files' compiled by the [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] and further revelations that a former [[Australian Labor Party]] operative had been engaged to help compile the dossiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2011/s3337736.htm LNP caught with 'personal dirt files'] – The World Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite protestations that key party personnel had no knowledge of the dossiers it was later revealed a [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] opposition research strategist had been compiling the files as part of a [[SWOT analysis]] at previous elections which formed the basis of negative attack messaging for a 'rapid response unit'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/swot-tactics-used-in-2009/story-e6freoof-1226166240001 SWOT tactics used in 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===

In January 2017, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) was exposed when [[Sihle Bolani]] filed an affidavit in the [[Gauteng Division|Johannesburg High Court]], demanding payment for her part in project War Room. The War Room's mandate was to “disempower [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|DA]] and [[Economic Freedom Fighters|EFF]] campaigns” and set a pro-ANC agenda using a range of media, without revealing the [[African National Congress|ANC’s]] hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amabhungane.co.za/article/2017-01-24-inside-the-ancs-black-ops-election-campaign|title=Inside the ANC’s "black ops" election campaign|website=amabhungane.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass media ethics==

The practice of using tips from opposition research sources was examined in 1994 by [[Howard Kurtz]], media analyst for ''The Washington Post''. Kurtz surveyed the major networks, ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and other influential media outlets, and found varying levels of use of oppo research information on [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]] as a witness in the [[Whitewater controversy]]. At this time, Brown confirmed that he had been the source of four mainstream media stories that had received attention from the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' because they bore striking resemblance to the opposition research being disseminated by Citizens United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |title=Muckrakers and the Mudslinger: Should Media Treat Floyd Brown Seriously? |work=The Washington Post |date=April 19, 1994 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-886599.html |url-access=subscription |via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Far from being detached observers, reporters constantly call oppo staffs looking for tidbits and sometimes trading information," wrote three reporters, [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]], [[Gloria Borger]], and [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]], for ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Cooper, Gloria Borger, and Michael Barone, "Dirty Tricks?

==Political infighting==

In the spring of 2007, [[Roger Stone]], a political consultant in the employ of New York state senator [[Joseph Bruno]], was forced to resign after leaving threatening phone messages on the answering machine of the 85-year-old father of New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]], alleging that Spitzer's campaign finances were conducted improperly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |title=Political Consultant Resigns After Allegations of Threatening Spitzer's Father |date=April 23, 2007 |page=1 |last1=Hakim |first1=Danny |last2=Confessore |first2=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/nyregion/23stone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November of that same year, Stone sent a letter to the FBI detailing Spitzer's sexual preferences with prostitutes and sexual props, right down to his black calf-length socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Weiss |title='Two on One' vs. Spitzer |work=New York Post |date=April 24, 2008 |page=1 |url=https://nypost.com/2008/04/24/two-on-one-vs-spitzer/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone was considered to be an authoritative source because he frequented the same prostitutes as a client himself. A subsequent Justice Department investigation produced evidence that ultimately led to Spitzer's resignation as governor. [[Joseph Bruno]], Stone's client, has been a longtime political enemy of Eliot Spitzer.

==In popular culture==
The television show ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' depicts many examples of opposition research, particularly the character of Doug Stamper, the loyal adviser to [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Francis "Frank" Underwood]], who regularly engages in the practice with little morality and few ethics.

The '''Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act,''' commonly referred to as the '''Cat and Mouse Act''', was an [[Act of Parliament]] passed in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] under [[Herbert Henry Asquith]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government in 1913. Some members of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU, commonly referred to as [[suffragette]]s) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]]. In protest at being imprisoned some of the suffragettes undertook [[hunger strikes]]. The hunger strikers were then [[force-fed]] by the prison staff leading to a public outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Manchester Guardian|date=1912-08-24|page=6|url=http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/3/1367582648776/Lancet-1912-001.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was a response to the outcry that allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health. They then had a predetermined period of time in which to recover after which they were rearrested and taken back to prison to serve out the rest of their sentence. Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act, 1913|date=1913-04-25|location=Chapter 4|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/case-study-the-right-to-vote/the-right-to-vote/winson-green-forcefeeding/cat-and-mouse-act/cat-and-mouse-act-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One effect of the act was to make hunger strikes technically legal. The nickname of the Act came about because of the domestic cat's habit of playing with its prey, allowing it to temporarily escape a number of times, before killing it.

==Government use==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
After the act was introduced [[force-feeding]] was no longer used to combat hunger strikes. Instead, suffragettes on hunger strike were kept in prison until they became extremely weak, at which point they would be released to recover. This allowed the government to claim that any harm (or even death) which resulted from the starvation was entirely the fault of the suffragette. During the recovery period, any wrongdoing on the part of the suffragette would see them put straight back in prison.

==Background==
[[File:Forcefeeding.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A woman in prison is tied to a chair while four members of staff force feed her|A suffragette being force-fed in [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway prison]], {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1911]]
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
To attain the goal of suffrage on the same basis as men, the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU, known colloquially as the suffragettes) engaged in acts of protest such as the breaking of windows, arson, and the "technical assault" (without causing harm) of police officers. Many WSPU members were jailed for these offences. In response to what the organisation viewed as brutal punishment and harsh treatment by the government at the time, imprisoned WSPU members embarked on a sustained campaign of hunger strikes.  Some women were freed on taking this action, but this rendered the policy of imprisonment of suffragettes futile. The prison authorities then turned to a policy of force feeding hunger-strikers by [[nasogastric tube]]. Repeated uses of this process often caused sickness, which served the WSPU's aims of demonstrating the government's harsh treatment of the prisoners.

Faced with growing public disquiet over the tactic of force feeding, and the determination of the jailed suffragettes to continue their hunger strikes, the government rushed the Act through Parliament. The effect of the Act was to permit the release of prisoners for them to recuperate from the effects of a hunger strike whilst leaving the police free to re-imprison offenders once they had recovered. The intention of the Act was to counter the tactic of hunger strikes and the damaging consequences for the government's support among (male) voters by the force feeding of women prisoners but, if anything, it reduced support for the Liberal government.

==Women writing about the experience of being forcibly fed==
In a book called ''Suffrage and the Pankhursts'', Jane Marcus argues that forcible feeding was the main image of the women's suffrage movement in the public imagination. Women wrote about how the experience made them feel in letters, diaries, speeches and suffrage publications, including ''Votes for Women'' and ''The Suffragette''.&lt;ref name="Jane Marcus"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Marcus |first=Jane |authorlink= |editor-last=Marcus |editor-first=Jane |contribution=Rereading the Pankhursts and Women's Suffrage |title=Suffrage and the Pankhursts |publisher=Routledge |origyear=1987|year=2001 |location= |pages=1–17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKu2grJXr-8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-415-25693-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the force-fed suffragettes, [[Constance Lytton|Lady Constance Lytton]], wrote a book that suggested that working-class women were more likely to be forcibly fed in prison than upper-class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prisons &amp; Prisoners: Some Personal Experiences|last=Bulwer-Lytton|first=Constance|publisher=Library of Alexandria|year=2016|isbn=|location=USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the medical procedure of [[force feeding]] was described as a physical and mental violation that caused pain, suffering, emotional distress, humiliation, anguish and rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[June Purvis|Purvis, June]]; ''Emmeline Pankhurst'', London: Routledge, p 134, {{ISBN|0-415-23978-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Violet Bland]] also wrote in ''Votes for Women'' about her experiences of being force-fed, explaining how, "they twisted my neck, jerked my head back, closing my throat, held all the time as in a vice," while they tried to force feed her. She wrote how the guards were always six or seven to one and that, "there was really no possibility of the victim doing much in the way of protesting excepting verbally, to express one’s horror of it; therefore no excuse for the brutality shown on several occasions."&lt;ref&gt;''Votes for Women'', 5 July 1912&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of what she describes as her assault, when she didn't get up from her chair quickly enough because of her "helpless and breathless condition," they snatched the chair from under her, throwing her to the floor. She wrote that she had no doubt the attacks were made with the intention of breaking the hunger-strikers down.&lt;ref&gt;''Votes for Women'', 5 July 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unintended consequences==
{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}
The ineffectiveness of the Act was very soon evident as the authorities experienced much more difficulty than anticipated in re-arresting the released hunger-strikers.  Many of them eluded arrest with the help of a network of suffragette sympathisers and an [[Edith Margaret Garrud#Trainer of bodyguards|all-women team of bodyguards]], who employed tactics of misdirection, subterfuge and occasionally direct confrontation with the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Rachel|title=Edith Garrud: a public vote for the suffragette who taught martial arts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/25/edith-garrud-suffragette-martial-arts|work=The Guardian|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability of the government to lay its hands on high-profile suffragettes transformed what had been intended as a discreet device to control suffragette hunger-strikers into a public scandal.

This act was aimed at suppressing the power of the organisation by demoralising the activists, but turned out to be counter-productive as it undermined the [[moral authority]] of the government. The Act was viewed as violating basic human rights, not only of the suffragettes but of other prisoners. The Act's nickname of ''Cat and Mouse Act'', referring to the way the government seemed to play with prisoners as a cat may with a captured mouse, underlined how the cruelty of repeated releases and re-imprisonments turned the suffragettes from targets of scorn to objects of sympathy.

The Asquith government's implementation of the Act caused the militant WSPU and the suffragettes to perceive Asquith as the enemy — an enemy to be vanquished in what the organisation saw as an all-out war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartley|first1=Paula|title=Emmeline Pankhurst|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780415206518|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related effect of this law was to increase support for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], many of whose early founders supported votes for women. For example, philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] left the Liberal Party, and wrote pamphlets denouncing the Act and the Liberals for making in his view an illiberal and anti-constitutional law. So the controversy helped to accelerate the decline in the Liberals' electoral position, as segments of the middle class began to defect to Labour.

The Act also handed the WSPU an issue on which to campaign and rail against other parts of the British establishment - in particular the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]].  During 1913 the WSPU directly targeted The [[Bishop of Winchester]], [[Edward Talbot (bishop)|Edward Talbot]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Randall Davidson]], the [[Bishop of London]], [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]], the [[Archbishop of York]], [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]], and the Bishops of [[Bishop of Croydon|Croydon]], [[Bishop of Lewes|Lewes]], [[Bishop of Islington|Islington]] and [[Bishop of Stepney|Stepney]].  Each one was picketed by deputations at their official residences until granted an audience, during which the Church leaders were asked to protest against forcible feeding.  [[Norah Elam|Norah Dacre Fox]] led many of the deputations on behalf of the WSPU, which were widely reported in ''The Suffragette''.  At one point the Bishop of London was persuaded to visit [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway]] personally in connection with allegations of women prisoners being poisoned during force feeding.  The Bishop made several visits to the prison, but this came to nothing, and his public statements that he could find no evidence of ill treatment during force feeding – indeed, he believed that force feeding was carried out "in the kindest possible spirit" – was seen by the WSPU as collusion with the government and prison authorities.   If the WSPU had been hoping to win support from the Church for their wider cause by pressing on the issue of forcible feeding, they were disappointed.  The Church chose not to be drawn into a battle between the WSPU and the authorities, and maintained the party line that militancy was a precursor to forcible feeding and militancy was against the will of God, therefore the Church could not act against forcible feeding.&lt;ref name='McPherson &amp; McPherson'&gt;{{cite book| last =McPherson| first =Angela| authorlink =| author2 =McPherson, Susan| title =Mosley's Old Suffragette - A Biography of Norah Elam| publisher =| year =2011| location =| pages =| url =http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk| doi =| isbn =978-1-4466-9967-6| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154415/http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/| archivedate =2012-01-13| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that the Act did little to deter the activities of the suffragettes. Their militant actions only ceased with the [[World War I|outbreak of war]] and their support for the war effort. However, the start of the war in August 1914, and the ending of all suffragette activities for the duration of the war, meant that the full potential impact of the Cat and Mouse Act will never be known.

The '''Qidwai''' or '''Kidwai''' ({{lang-ur|قدوای }}) are a community of [[Muslims]] in [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] and is often considered the premier subdivision of Sheikhs due to their [[Sura Bani Isra'il|Bani Isra'il]] lineage as opposed to Bani Ismail of the rest of the Muslims. They are mostly settled in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]]. They are also settled in the city of [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]], and also in areas of the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Caste and Social Stratification Among Muslims'' (Manohar, 1978), edited by Imtiaz Ahmed, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qidwai, together with the [[Milki]], [[Malik]] and [[Chaudhary]], are the four sub-groups who collectively form the Mian Muslim. The Mian Muslim were once a community of substantial landowners in the [[Awadh]] region.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Uttar Pradesh'' (Manohar Publications), Volume XLII Part One, edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pp. 968-972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The Qidwai or Kidwai are a community of Shaikhs in Pakistan and India. They are mostly settled in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. They are also settled in the city of Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. The Qidwa claim descent from Qazi Qidwa, a son of the Sultans of Rum. In what is now modern Turkey. There are differing traditions as to the ethnic origin of the Qazi. Some sources claim he was a descendent of Abu Bakr, the first caliph of Islam. While other sources claim that he was a Sayyid by lineage. Qazi Qidwa fell out the Sultan, his brother, and migrated to India, with wife and son. There he became a close associate of the famous Sufi saint, Moinuddin Chishti. The saint is said to have sent him to the Awadh region to spread Islam, where he is said to have won over fifty villages to Islam.

The Qidwai were native Muslims of Uttar Pradesh. Sufi saints are claimed  to have gone to the [[Awadh]] region to spread [[Islam]], where he is said to have won over fifty villages to [[Islam]]. These fifty  villages were later awarded to him, and the region became known as Qidwara.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to another tradition, Qazi Qidwa is said have defeated a local ruler in the [[Awadh]] region by the name of Raja Jagdeopur. This Raja was said to have belonged to the aboriginal [[Bhar]] community. The original settlement of the tribe was Juggaur in [[Lucknow district]], from where they spread to [[Barabanki District]]. The [[taluqdar]] families have historically intermarried with the [[Bhatti of Awadh|Awadhi Bhatti]], a neighbouring [[Muslim Rajput]] community, with whom they share many cultural traits.&lt;ref&gt;''Barabanki: A Gazetteer'' (Government of India Press, 1904), Volume XLVIII, by H. R Neville, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The abolishment of the [[zamindar]] system by the newly independent [[India]] in 1947 had a major impact on the Qidwai community. The larger estates were broken, and land given to the [[farmers]] who worked on their lands. This led to some emigration of the Qidwais to [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Caste and Social Stratification among Muslims'' (Manohar, 1978), edited by Imtiaz Ahmed, pp. 209-215.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Qidwais are still found mainly in the districts of [[Lukhnow District|Lucknow]], [[Faizabad District|Faizabad]] village  masauli and baragaon in [[Barabanki district|Barabanki]] region of [[Uttar Pradesh|Uttar Pradesh.]]

The '''Rapid Climate Change-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array''' (RAPID/MOCHA) program is a collaborative research project between the [[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton|National Oceanography Centre]] (Southampton, U.K.), the University of Miami’s [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science|Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS)]], and NOAA’s [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML)]] that measure the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and ocean heat transport in the North Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=rsmas&gt;University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). 2009. Cruise Report, November 21-December 6, 2009. RRS Discovery Cruise No. D345.&lt;/ref&gt;  This array was deployed in March 2004 to continuously monitor the MOC and ocean heat transport that are primarily associated with the [[Thermohaline circulation|Thermohaline Circulation]] across the basin at 26°N. The RAPID-MOCHA array is planned to be continued through 2014 to provide a decade or longer continuous time series.&lt;ref name=Johns2009&gt;Johns WE, Baringer MO, Beal LM, et al. 2011. Continuous, array-based estimates of Atlantic Ocean heat transport at 26.5°N. J. Climate 24:2429-2449.&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuous observations are measured by an array of instruments along 26°N. This monitoring array directly measures the transport of the Gulf Stream in the Florida Strait using an undersea cable and a moored array measures bottom pressure and water column density (including temperature and salinity) at the western and eastern boundary and on either side of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge|Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR)]].&lt;ref name=church&gt;Church JA. 2007. A change in circulation? [[Science (journal)|Science]] 317:908.&lt;/ref&gt;  Absolute transports including barotropic circulation are monitored using precision bottom pressure gauges.&lt;ref name=cunningham2007 /&gt;  "Dynamic height" moorings are used to estimate the spatially average geostropic velocity profile and associated transports over relatively wide mooring separations.&lt;ref name=Johns2009 /&gt;  The dynamic height moorings requires measurements on both sides of the current field only, rather both the horizontal and vertical structure of the current field to be sufficiently well resolved to estimate transports.&lt;ref name=Johns2005&gt;Johns WE, Kanzow T, and Zantopp R. 2005. Estimating ocean transports with dynamic height moorings: an application in the Atlantic Deep Western Boundary Current at 26.5°N. Deep-Sea Research Part I 52:1542-1567.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basin-wide MOC strength and vertical structure are estimated via Ekman transports by satellite scatterometer measurements and the geotrophic and direct current observations.&lt;ref name=Johns2009 /&gt;

RAPID-MOCHA is funded by the National Environmental Research Council (NERC) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).&lt;ref name=rsmas /&gt;

==MOC Observations==
Kanzow and colleagues (2007) demonstrated the effective of the array and reported that the sum of the transports into the North Atlantic from March 2004 to March 2005 varies with root-mean-square value of only 3.4 Sv (where 1 Sv = a flow of ocean water of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cubic meters per second) as compared to expected measurement errors of 2.7 Sv.&lt;ref name=Kanzow2007&gt;Kanzow T, Cunningham SA, Rayner D, et al. 2007. Observed flow compensation associated with the MOC at 26.5°N in the Atlantic. Science 317:938.&lt;/ref&gt;  In another study also utilizing observations from March 2004 to March 2005, Cunningham et al. (2007) reported a year-long average MOC of 18.7 ± 5.6 Sv with a large variability ranging from 4.4 to 35.3 Sv within the course of a year.&lt;ref name=cunningham2007&gt;Cunningham SA, Kanzow T, Rayner D, et al. 2007. Temporal variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation at 26.5°N. Science 317:935.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johns et al. (2009) concluded that the meridional heat transport was highly correlated with changes in the strength of the MOC with the circulation accounting for nearly 90% of the total heat transport and the remainder contained in a quasi-stationary [[Ocean gyre|gyre]] pattern with little net contribution by mesoscale eddies.&lt;ref name=Johns2009 /&gt;  The average annual mean meridional heat transport from 2004-2007 was reported by Johns et al. (2009) to be 1.33 ± 0.14 petawatts (PW).&lt;ref name=Johns2009 /&gt;

The '''Schuylkill Fishing Company of Pennsylvania''', also known as the '''State in Schuylkill''', was the first angling club in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and remains the oldest continuously operating social club in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9907E6D6173AE733A25756C1A9679C946497D6CF ''The New York Times'': "Oldest Dining Club in the World" (January 15, 1905)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The club was established in 1732 as the '''Colony in Schuylkill''' under a treaty with the chiefs of the [[Lenni-Lenape]] (Delaware) Indians.&lt;ref name="History"&gt; [[John Thomas Scharf]], Thompson Westcott, : [https://books.google.com/books?id=8uYkAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1871 ''History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884''], Lippincott, Phila., 1884&lt;/ref&gt; Officers of the club assumed governmental titles: governor, lieutenant governor, three councilors, sheriff, coroner, secretary. Among its 28 founding members were [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], [[Philip Syng]], and [[Joseph Wharton (1707–1776)|Joseph Wharton]]; the first Governor was [[Thomas Stretch]] (born [[Staffordshire]], [[England]], 1695), who held the office for 34 years.  Other early members included [[Samuel Howell]], [[Thomas Wharton Jr.]], [[Tench Francis Jr.]], [[William Bradford (American Revolutionary printer)|William Bradford]], [[Samuel Nicholas]], [[Clement Biddle]], [[William Bingham]], Mayor [[Anthony Morris (II)|Anthony Morris]], [[Thomas Mifflin]], and [[Samuel Morris (soldier)|Samuel Morris]], second governor for 46 years. In 1737, membership was limited to twenty-five. After the [[American Revolution]], in 1782, the club changed its name to "State in Schuylkill", but retained its rules and organization.

The club claims to be the oldest in the world. The [[Beefsteak Club]] of London antedates it, but was suspended for a while.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Harper's Monthly Magazine|volume=LXIV|issue=February, 1882|pages=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1747, the members decided to build a clubhouse, dubbed The Castle, at the foot of the [[Schuylkill River]] falls near [[Fairmount, Philadelphia|Fairmount]], now part of [[Philadelphia]]. It used some of the nearby walnut trees for timber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine|year=1883|volume=XXVI|issue=August, 1883|pages=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the American Revolution, Samuel Morris, the club's governor, was the captain of the [[First City Troop]], which many other members joined. The club also changed its name to the "State in Schuylkill."&lt;ref name="Lippincott 1917 305"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippincott|first=Horace Mather|title=Early Philadelphia Its People, Life and Progress|year=1917|publisher=J. B. Lippencott Company|location=Philadelphia|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Philadelphia was the young nation's new capital, President [[George Washington]], an honorary member, was a frequent visitor to the clubhouse, as on June 14, 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of the State in Schuylkill 1732-1888|year=1889|publisher=The Members|location=Philadelphia|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOE_AAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 1825, [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]] visited the Castle and was elected a member.&lt;ref name="Lippincott 1917 305" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of the State in Schuylkill 1732-1888|year=1889|publisher=The Members|location=Philadelphia|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOE_AAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Fairmount Water Works|Fairmount Dam]] was constructed in 1822, spoiling the fishing at the Falls, the Castle was moved downriver to [[Rambo's Rock]], opposite [[Bartram's Garden]] and below [[Gray's Ferry Bridge|Gray's Ferry]].

On April 27, 1844, the club was incorporated under the name Schuylkill Fishing Company.

When the fish in the Schuylkill were poisoned by sewage, the club was forced to move again. In 1887, the club bought the Clock House, on the Delaware River at Eddington near Cornwells Heights, two miles above Andalusia. Over the winter of 1887-1888, the Castle and Kitchen were re-erected on this new site, where the Company remained until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wainwright|first=Nicholas|title=A History of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of the State in Schuylkill 1732-1982|year=1982|publisher=The State in Schuylkill|location=Philadelphia|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the former estate of William B. Chamberlain, Devon House on the [[Delaware River]] near [[Andalusia, Pennsylvania]], was conveyed to the State in Schuylkill. The Company moved all of its possessions, including the Castle and Kitchen, to this new site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wainwright|first=Nicholas|title=A History of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of the State in Schuylkill 1732-1982|year=1982|publisher=The State in Schuylkill|location=Philadelphia|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphia-reflections.com/topic/33.htm Philadelphia Reflections: Philadelphia Fish and Fishing]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Peter Stretch tallclock, circa 1740.jpg|thumb|150px|Peter Stretch [[Tall-case clock]], circa 1740, at the State in Schuylkill.]]

Inside the State House, portraits of the Governors lined the north wall of the entry hall and part of its south side. There were interesting ones of Governors [[Thomas Stretch]] and [[Samuel Morris (soldier)|Samuel Morris]], and several of the nineteenth century successors, as well as likenesses in oil of all nine Governors who served between 1896 and 1970.  The door onto the porch was flanked by a piano and by a tall case clock made by [[Peter Stretch]] about 1740, father of the Schuylkill Fishing Company's first Governor, [[Thomas Stretch]], which had been donated by Governor William Fisher Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wainwright|first=Nicholas|title=A History of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of the State in Schuylkill 1732-1982|year=1982|publisher=The State in Schuylkill|location=Philadelphia|pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State in Schuylkill was assigned the place of honor in the Grand Centennial Torchlight Procession held July 3, 1876, celebrating the centennial of the Nation's founding. The Company was to have served as the personal escort of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], but since he was unable to attend it escorted the Governor of Pennsylvania and Mayor of Philadelphia throughout the city, passing [[Independence Hall]] at midnight amidst the ringing of bells, firing of salutes, and cheers of a large crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wainwright|first=Nicholas|title=A History of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of the State in Schuylkill 1732-1982|year=1982|publisher=The State in Schuylkill|location=Philadelphia|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 1947, 125 years after its founding, members of the Schuylkill Fishing Company dedicated a memorial at the original clubhouse site on West River Drive (now Martin Luther King Drive) in [[Fairmount Park]]. The memorial was of gray stone, inset with a tablet of pink marble bearing the inscription:

{{cquote|
This is the Original Site of the Colony in Schuylkill
Instituted May 1st 1732
After the War of Independence
The Name was changed to the State in Schuylkill
The Organization is Still in Active Existence After an Unbroken Record  of Over Two Hundred and Fifteen Years
This Tablet was Placed Here in 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wainwright|first=Nicholas|title=A History of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of the State in Schuylkill 1732-1982|year=1982|publisher=The State in Schuylkill|location=Philadelphia|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1950s, when the Schuylkill Expressway was under construction, the Park Commission moved the monument about 200 yards west of the Girard Avenue Bridge (Martin Luther King Drive near Sweet Briar Drive) between West River Drive and the Expressway, some 125 yards from the actual spot where the Castle had stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wainwright|first=Nicholas|title=A History of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of the State in Schuylkill 1732-1982|year=1982|publisher=The State in Schuylkill|location=Philadelphia|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the frigid winter night of December 21–22, 1980, the State House, its caretaker's wing, and virtually all of its contents were destroyed in a fire.  The separate Castle and Kitchen structures were not harmed. A new state House was built on the site in 1981-82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wainwright|first=Nicholas|title=A History of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of the State in Schuylkill 1732-1982|year=1982|publisher=The State in Schuylkill|location=Philadelphia|pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Club designated May 1 as the "opening day" of the sporting season and claimed to have received its rights for fishing and fowling on the river directly from Chief [[Tammany]] in 1732. There are 13 appointed fishing days in each year, at equal periods between May 1 and October 1, when the company assembles at the castle and a citizen, designated "Caterer," assisted by the apprentices, prepares the golden perch in the ancient pans and old manner. Each club member serves as an apprentice at some time, and must learn to hold three perch in a long-handled frying pan over the blazing wood fire until one side is done to a tum, then, with a quick twist of his wrist, toss the fish up the old chimney, catching them as they fall on the uncooked side. The perch are served to the company assembled about the ancient table, on one of William Penn's platters presented to the club by his son John who was a member while Governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippincott|first=Horace Mather|title=Early Philadelphia Its People, Life and Progress|year=1917|publisher=J. B. Lippencott Company|location=Philadelphia|pages=305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statehood===
The club maintained a rather ambiguous claim to state sovereignty throughout its early history. During [[Prohibition in the United States]], it claimed that it was unaffected, and continued to openly manufacture and drink alcoholic beverages.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

===Fish House Punch===
The club is reputed to have been the origin of [[Fish House Punch]], an [[alcoholic drink]] consisting mainly of rum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slakethirst.com/2005/10/07/fish-house-punch/ History of Fish House Punch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of [[Fish House Punch]] — though not yet by that name — may be in the notes of William Black, the secretary of an embassy of Virginia Commissioners who visited Philadelphia in 1744. He recounted being met by local poobahs on the bank of the Schuylkill, where they were greeted “very kindly and welcomed . . . into their Province with a Bowl of fine Lemon Punch big enough to have Swimmed half a dozen of young Geese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Felten|first=Eric|title=What America's Oldest Club May Quaff|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123758172905298941#articleTabs%3Darticle|work=The Wall Street Journal. March 21, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Punch is traditionally made in a large bowl also used as a baptismal font for the citizens' infant sons; “its an ample space . . . . . would indeed admit of total immersion”, as one citizen noted. I doubt that there was Punch in it at the time — it was far too precious for such usage, and far too potent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wondrich|first=David|title=Imbibe!|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, on a visit to the Castle [[George Washington]] drank so much of the potent Fish House Punch, he subsequently couldn’t bring himself to make an entry in his diary for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Regan|first=Gary|title=The Joy of Mixology|year=2003|publisher=Clarkson Potter|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was said to be Washington's favorite.

'''Setos''' ({{lang-seto|setokõsõq}}, ''setoq'', {{lang-et|setud}}) are an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] ethnic and linguistic minority in south-eastern [[Estonia]] and north-western Russia. Setos are mostly Seto-speaking [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] of Estonian nationality. The [[Seto language]] (like [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]) belongs to the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] group of the [[Uralic languages]]. The Setos seek greater recognition, rather than having their language considered a dialect of Estonian. Along with Orthodox Christianity, vernacular traditional [[folk religion]] is widely practiced and supported by Setos.

There are approximately 15,000 Setos around the world. The bulk of Setos, however, are found in the [[Setomaa]] region, which is divided between south-eastern [[Estonia]] ([[Põlva County|Põlva]] and [[Võrumaa|Võro]] counties) and north-western [[Russian Federation]] ([[Pechorsky District]] of [[Pskov Oblast]]). Setos are an officially protected ethnic minority of Pskov Oblast.

The culture of Setos blossomed in the early 20th century when many national societies of Setos were organized. In 1905 the number of Setos reached its maximum. After the proclamation of independence of Estonia its authorities adopted a policy of Estonification of its population, which eventually led to virtual disappearance of Setos as a distinctive linguistic entity of Estonia. In Russia, due to the influence of Estonian language schools, high rates of mixed marriages, and emigration to Estonia, the number of Setos drastically decreased as well.

== Ethnic history ==

Prior to A.D. 600 the whole of Setomaa was within the vast northern Finnic lands of the indigenous Uralic peoples. After A.D. 600 Slavic tribes migrated northeast, into Uralic lands. During this migration north the Slavic and Finnic tribes interbred in the southern habitation areas of the indigenous Finnics. 

The first significant event that separated Setos from Estonians was forced conversion of the latter into [[Catholicism]] in the 13th century, while Setos who lived in [[Novgorod|Novgorod Land]] remained [[paganism|pagans]]. In the 15th century Setos were converted into [[Orthodox Christianity]] but kept their vernacular beliefs. Later elements of Catholic culture were brought to the Setos by Estonian colonists,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} while in Estonia itself they nearly disappeared after the [[Lutheran]] reformation in Estonia.

== The border issue ==

In 1920, with the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|peace treaty of Tartu]], the area Setomaa (Setoland) was ceded to the newly created [[Republic of Estonia]] and it was included into [[Petseri County]]. As a result of [[World War II]], the Republic of Estonia was forcibly annexed to the [[Soviet Union]]. And on August 15, 1944 the border between the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] was revised by Moscow authorities to what it is now. The issue became topical as the Republic of Estonia was restored in the borders of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1991 and a national border was established soon afterwards. The establishment of the border brought about the division of Setomaa between two countries for the first time in history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== Representative organisations ==

The Seto Congress, a body comprising representatives of Seto villages and organisations, is regularly convened every three years and elects a permanent Council of Elders. 

The Society for Seto Congress was a member of the [[European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages]]. The [http://www.setomaa.ee Setomaa federation of municipalities in Estonia] (''Setomaa Valdade Liit'', comprising the communes of [[Mikitamäe Parish|Mikitämäe]], [[Värska Parish|Värska]], [[Meremäe Parish|Meremäe]] and [[Misso Parish|Misso]]) publishes [https://web.archive.org/web/20061211220115/http://www.setomaa.ee/index.php?id=98f13708210194c475687be6106a3b84 the newspaper ''Setomaa''], partly in the [[Seto language]], partly in [[Estonian language|Estonian]].

Also, every year the Seto choose a steward of [[King Peko]] (''sootska'' or ''ülebtsootska'') for the so-called Kingdom of Setomaa at the annual celebration of the Day of the Kingdom (''Seto Kuningriigi päiv''), a local festival that rotates among the bigger Seto villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/07/in_pictures_the_seto_people/html/7.stm BBC News, ''In Pictures: The Seto People'']&lt;/ref&gt; The office is largely ceremonial and has been held by local activists, politicians, entrepreneurs and scholars. The tradition was initiated by [[Paul Hagu]], an ethnic Seto and a researcher of Seto folk songs and traditional vocal polyphony (Leelo) at the [[University of Tartu]].

'''Sonia Deepti''' (born 29 July 1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonia Deepti profile|url=http://www.veethi.com/india-people/sonia_deepti-profile-3710-14.htm|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Indian film actress, who has mostly appeared in Telugu films. Her debut performance as Shravs in the 2007 [[Sekhar Kammula]] film ''[[Happy Days (2007 film)|Happy Days]]'' won her the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress – Telugu]].

==Career==
Sonia was born and brought up in [[Hyderabad]], [[Telangana]].&lt;ref name="idlebrain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/news/2000march20/chitchat-sonia.html |title=Sonia interview - chitchat - Telugu film actress |publisher=Idlebrain.com |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing her studies with a degree in [[computer applications]], she worked as a [[software engineer]] in an IT company for three years, before stepping into acting.&lt;ref name="idlebrain"/&gt; At an event, she was spotted by [[Sekhar Kammula]], who gave her an acting offer, after seeing her performance in an audition. Accepting the offer, she made her acting debut in the 2007 Telugu film ''[[Happy Days (2007 film)|Happy Days]]'', enacting the role of Shravs. The film, upon release, became a blockbuster and won six awards at the 2008 [[Filmfare Awards South]], one of which was the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress – Telugu|Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for Sonia for her performance that won her critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://awardsandwinners.com/category/filmfare-awards-south/2008/|title=Filmfare Awards South - 2008 {{!}} Winners &amp; Nominees|website=awardsandwinners.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008, her second film ''[[Vinayakudu (film)|Vinayakudu]]'' opposite [[Krishnudu]], one of her co-actors in ''Happy Days'', was released, which went on to become a successful venture as well. She soon got offers from the [[Tamil film industry]] as well and made her debut in Tamil with the [[N. Lingusamy]]-directed romantic-action film ''[[Paiyaa]]'' in 2010. That year she had another Tamil film releasing, ''[[Inidhu Inidhu]]'', a remake of ''Happy Days'', in which she reprised her role from the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/inidhu-inidhu-a-saga-so-sweet/article600430.ece |title=Inidhu Inidhu - A saga so sweet |publisher=The Hindu |date=2010-08-28 |accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonia played the role of [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu|Samantha]]'s character's friend in the 2011 Telugu film ''[[Dookudu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/sonia-got-a-chance-to-play-in-dookudu--malayalam-news-60875 |title=Sonia got a chance to play in Dookudu - Malayalam Movie News |publisher=Indiaglitz.com |date=2010-10-18 |accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her debut in [[Kannada]] with the film ''[[Ninnindale]]'' starring [[Puneeth Rajkumar]] and [[Erica Fernandes]], which was released in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Share on Twitter |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Sonia-going-places/articleshow/44940114.cms |title=Sonia going places - Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2014-10-26 |accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a day before a day before [[International Women's Day]] in 2015, she released a short film on her YouTube channel. Scripted by Megha Wali, this film was about questioning moral policing. It was well received on social media and appreciated by many stars including [[Ram Gopal Varma]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. It was shot at Country Club in Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/sonia-deeptis-short-film-against-moral-policing-impresses-amitabh-bachchan-ram-gopal-varma-video-625940|title=Sonia Deepti's Short Film Against Moral Policing Impresses Amitabh Bachchan, Ram Gopal Varma [VIDEO]|last=Hooli|first=Shekhar H|work=International Business Times, India Edition|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inupiat Family from Noatak, Alaska, 1929, Edward S. Curtis (restored).jpg|thumb|Iñupiat Family from Noatak, Alaska, 1929]]

'''Subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale''' is permitted by the [[International Whaling Commission]], under limited conditions. While [[whaling]] is banned in most parts of the world, some of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native peoples of North America]], including the [[Eskimo]] and [[Inupiat|Iñupiat]] peoples in Alaska,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Condon, Richard G., Peter Collings, and George Wenzel. 1995. “The Best Part of Life: Subsistence Hunting, Ethnicity, and Economic Adaptation Among Young Adult Inuit Males”. Arctic 48 (1). Arctic Institute of North America: 31–46.&lt;/ref&gt; continue to hunt the [[Bowhead whale]]. [[Aboriginal whaling]] is valued for its contribution to food stocks ([[subsistence economy]]) and to cultural survival, although the days of commercial [[whaling in the United States]] and [[whaling in Canada|in Canada]] are over.

==Iñupiat==
The bowhead whale is of great cultural significance to the Iñupiat in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]], who say that one cannot live without the other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to the Iñupiat, the whale is the center of their diet, culture, and spirit. This makes them dependent on the complex system of sharing and celebrating the whale,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Hess, Bill. 1999. Gift of the Whale : The Iñupiaq Bowhead Hunt, a Sacred Tradition. Seattle, Wash., Sasquatch Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and leads them to [[Prayer|pray]] to any killed bowhead whale in thanks for the life it has given to them.

For the Iñupiat, subsistence hunting and fishing are important and viable economic strategies, which provide food and raw materials for the whole group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When hunters bring whales back to the community, about 65–70 people drag the whale onto the ice, where they work all day to harvest the meat. They work non-stop to prevent the whale's body heat from melting the ice too much. Afterwards, the captain and crew of the hunt invite the community to a celebratory meal.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;ECHO Partners. "Iñupiaq Whale Hunt." YouTube. February 25, 2009. Accessed March 22, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAqEK7K5oCQ&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Once the captain has taken what he needs, he gives the rest of the whale away to his community and any others who need the food.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, despite its necessity, the interest in subsistence hunting has reduced among the youth in the tribes. Reasons for this decline include a lack of training, a lack of equipment, changing dietary preferences, a lack of interest, an increasing dependence upon wage employment, and interest in other activities (for example, [[basketball]], [[hockey]], and [[baseball]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Six Eskimos standing beside native skinboat (umiak) on sled, Point Barrow, Alaska, 1935 - NARA - 531120.jpg|thumb|Eskimos standing beside umiak on sled, Point Barrow, Alaska]]
Subsistence hunters take pride in what they do, because they see themselves as strong providers for their family and community. People within the Inuit community describe active [[Hunting|hunters]] as follows "1) active hunters are always sharing meat with other people, 2) active hunters are always ready to go out hunting at a moment's notice, 3) active hunters travel at any time of year and not just during the spring, and 4) active hunters know more about travelling in cold weather and on the sea ice."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On the way to the hunt, they travel by snowmobile across the ice until they find a safe campsite, which can sometimes take all day. The campsite must be near landlocked ice, so the hunters can move to the safety of solid ice in an emergency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once on the hunt, they kill with [[harpoon]]s and dart guns&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; while sitting in their [[umiak]] (made from seal hide and part of a [[caribou]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Most nutrition from the [[whale meat|whale's meat]] and organs. According to the Iñupiat people, the whale's ''[[muktuk|maktak]]'', the thick black skin and attached oily blubber, contains body-warming energy and [[vitamin C]]. The whale's bones are used to frame sod ''iglus'' ([[igloo]]), and the elastic [[baleen]] is woven into baskets. The liver membrane is used for drums.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Legal rights to tribes in Alaska==
The problem of [[food security]] creates a need for laws on hunting in Alaska. Under the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Association]] (FAO), food security is defined as the ability for an individual to "have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Theriault, Sophie, Ghislain Otis, Gerard Duhaime, and Christopher Furgal. "The legal protection of subsistence: a prerequisite of food security for the Inuit of Alaska." ''Alaska Law Review'' 22 (2005): 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ANCSA Regional Corporations Map.jpg|thumb|ANCSA Regional Corporations Map]]
Under this definition, Alaskans would be able to hunt the bowhead whale despite conservation efforts, which creates a need for official regulation. Congress enacted the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) in 1971,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which removed "all aboriginal titles, if any, and claims of aboriginal title in Alaska based on use and occupancy, including submerged land underneath all water areas, both inland and offshore, and including any aboriginal hunting or fishing rights that may exist".&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Settlement US. Code § 1603. of 1971, title 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The act also titled Natives with "44 million acres of Alaska and extinguished remaining claims with a $1 billion payment."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Richardson, J.R. 1992. "Hunting for a balance." National Parks 66, no. 3/4: 34. Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost (accessed March 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Natives received compensation under this act, but it did not protect subsistence hunting. This led natives to look for exceptions in other laws, such as the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]] (MBTA), the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]] (MMPA), and the [[Endangered Species Act|Endangered Species Act of 1973]] (ESA).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1980, The [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] (ANILCA) was adapted to include subsidence hunting and fishing rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This act gives up its rights to lands and fishing rights and gives them to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Americans]], [[Eskimo]]s, or [[Aleut]]s for subsistence use. "ANILCA provides that Alaska may obtain subsistence jurisdiction of federal lands upon passage of a law providing for a similar subsistence priority for rural residents".&lt;ref&gt;Local and Regional Participation US. Code § 3115. of 1595, 1980, 1997, 1998, title 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The ANILCA also granted permanent protection to 104 million acres of federal land, including more than 40 million acres of parkland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under ANILCA, Natives are allowed to substance hunt on seven new and expanded parks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

ANILCA governs subsistence for "rural residents", on federal lands, whereas state law governs subsistence for "all Alaskans", on state and private lands (including Native-owned ANCSA lands).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since both state and federal governments take care of Alaska's subsistence hunting laws, dual management between state and federal agencies is needed. This is currently guided by an Interim Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Natives and hunting licences===
Permits are required to practise subsistence hunting in state of Alaska. The above laws allow for any resident of Alaska to apply for these permits. Because of this, many of the laws made for subsistence hunting fall in line with Alaska's normal hunting laws. A person under the age of sixteen must have completed a Basic Hunter Education course or be with someone over the age of sixteen who has.

'''TEJN''' (born 1976) is a [[pseudonymous]] Danish artist, who began his artistic work as a street artist in 2007 and occasionally exhibits contemporary art in galleries.

==Artist description==
TEJNs gallery sculptures typically demands a more extended effort to interpret, than his street art sculptures, which he often gives a layer of a more digestible nature, allowing it to communicate with an audience passing by on foot or bike.

The highly symbolic works typically debate philosophy, politics or existentialism, suggesting a form of self-appraisal among the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.lt/7aFC1h|title=curators description}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in [[Copenhagen]], TEJN's [[street art]] has made its mark on most bigger European cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ring, Katrine|title=Walk This Way|language=Danish, English|publisher=Radius (forlag)|year=2011|isbn=9788792334220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is best known by his trademark: "[[Lock On (street art)|Lock Ons]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/2012/03/24/copenhagen-street-art-on-lock-down/|title=Brooklyn Street Art:Lock On}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which are site-specific sculptures or statues, typically [[welded]] in recycled iron and chained in the street without permission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuQsgHYEIPw|title=short lock on movie}}&lt;/ref&gt; often mounted to urban furniture with a [[bicycle lock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classiccopenhagen.blogspot.com/2012/03/lock-on-tejn.html|title=Classic Copenhagen, Lock On}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second most preferred media is paintings on paper, pasted up with [[wheatpaste]] on a wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMbqQOyPUS4|title=short paste up movie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/2014/04/22/finding-peace-in-copenhagen-with-scupting-street-artist-tejn/#.U1ZWPDO_ky4/|title=Article in BSA – Brooklyn Street Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEJN also makes [[Street installation|installations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organiconcrete.com/2013/02/10/domenica-in-strada-tejn/|title=Italian art page, article about Tejn (in italian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stencil graffiti|stencil-art]], and [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tejnibyen.dk|title=Artist homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
TEJN finds metal scrap for his sculptures in urban areas and uses some of it in its original form. The rest is shaped and welded into [[figurative art|figurative]] objects that express a narrative deadopen for interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lunchmoneygallery.dk/node/65|title=Description of Tejn, in English, by curator on Lunchmoney Gallery|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022015317/http://lunchmoneygallery.dk/node/65|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iron is later "given back to the street" as street sculptures, in the same areas where he originally collected the material.

== Examples of artworks/interventions ==

===2007===
* TEJN places an unknown number of hidden time capsules in different Danish cities, containing original works commenting on the way we look at future, past and present. The time capsules were signed, sealed and buried or integrated in public areas or buildings without permission.
* Wheat pasted drawings appears in the streets, accompanied by messages playing with the Danish language, transforming and illustrating song titles and old sayings, such as "Time Heals all Wounds" transformed into "Time Stores all Wounds", etc.

===2008===
* TEJN commented on growing racism by releasing numerous of different "ethnic" pair shaped characters in the streets of Copenhagen, all wearing a stenciled message saying "Pære Dansk" ("danish as a pear"), presumably as a response to Danish right wing politicians who claimed that it requires certain lifestyles to be "pear-danish".
* First large roof top paste up

===2009===
* ''One of Those Noah Didn't Get on the Boat'' – a wheat paste series of various non-existing animals "that Noah didn't manage to save", appears in Copenhagen and in small towns in the Christian west coast of Jutland
* Street sculptures appear in seaports showing variations of the same theme, such as a woman sitting on a [[whaling]] cannon loaded with an anchor

===2010===
* "Project Re-Cycle" – Stolen, broken bikes were collected from corners, junk piles and train stations, roughly fixed and then placed in front of schools in troubled areas, homeless accommodations and a refugee camp, with a note saying "Free Bike". The project was criticized as it contained "too many" none legal issues.

===2011===
* ''Vultures Always Wins the War'' – Installation containing a wall showcasing spray-painted attacking bombers throwing exploding [[peace sign]]s, undisturbed by a large iron [[vulture]] on top of the wall, observing the process.

===2012===
* ''The Ego Coin Project'' – [[conceptual art|Conceptual]] work that questioned egocentric consumption of goods. The artist issued approximately €500 worth of modified valid coins earmarked for non-profitable purposes. The coins were engraved with the word EGO and then given away. The coins are supposed to be used to benefit new recipients other than the current owner.
* In a small city forest threatened by urban planners, a 200-pound revolver welded in iron was chained to one of the trees, carrying the stencil text: “My Ancestors Went Hunting in These Woods”.

===2013===
* ''Omnivorous'' (street sculpture) – Goat with its head stuck in a [[McDonald's]] bag, chained in front of the Danish government building.
* ''Victory'' (street sculpture) – Character freeing itself by cutting its chain with a bolt cutter – placed in front of Frihedsmuseet, the Museum of Danish Resistance during WW2

===2014===
* ''Captain Queer'' (street sculpture) Proud looking sailor with rainbow [[shoulder sleeve insignia]] and anchor on the chest is chained in Copenhagen's new square, "The Rainbow Square", as a tribute to diversity and the achievements the LGBT movement have reached so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xq28.dk/Nyheder/3910/DenmystiskefigurpaaRegnbuepladsen.aspx|title=XQ28 magazine, Rainbow Square (in danish)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/2014/04/22/finding-peace-in-copenhagen-with-scupting-street-artist-tejn/#.VDY3XksWPSN|title=TEJN, Brooklyn Street Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tejnibyen.dk|title=Artist homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information.dk/273760|title="Information" Danish newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.lt/7Ljer3|title=Ego Coin Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tenants Association of Punjab''' (AMP, Anjuman Muzareen Punjab) represents almost a 100,000 [[peasants]] in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]], who work and live on Pakistani government- and military-owned land, managed by the [[Punjab Seed Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_26-8-2002_pg3_1 State has no right to kill unarmed citizens -  The Daily Times Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The peasants had been working the land since 1900, under [[British Raj|British rule]], mostly under a crop share agreement. This agreement continued after [[partition of India|independence]]. The military and the government of Pakistan imposed a cash rent on the farm land, which the peasants tried to resist. There has been a dispute between the military who own the land and the peasants, which has led to military action, imprisoning and killing various members of AMP.

The Chairman, [[Younis Iqbal]], and others were arrested in 2001. At the time of their arrest, another faction was brought forward, supported by the [[Peoples' Rights Movement]] and the [[Labour Party Pakistan]].

== Lahore ==

April 13, 2018. (PCP) Pakistan Christian Congress PCC Founder President Dr. Nazir S Bhatti have expressed grave concern on Agents of Pakistan Military Intelligence MI, Inter Services Intelligence ISI and Punjab police raids of Christian and Muslim farmers effected by the land acquisition by Pakistan Army to built Garrison City of Okara in Punjab province of Pakistan decades ago.

The Association formed by effected farmers by the name of Anjuman-e-Muzareen AMP Chairman Younas Iqbal was arrested recently from court compound where he came for hearing. 
The Christian and Muslim leaders of AMP are facing cases against them under terrorism on protesting for their due rights when Okara Army wanted to change tenant’s agreement signed on acquiring land. ==

It is surprising to note that Pakistan Army have built many new Garrison Cities after 1965 in provinces of Punjab, Sindh, KP and Balochistan while not a new single city is built for general public when population have risen to two hundred million. 

In an urgent application to PPP leaders for immediate support by AMP reads as “We had a good relation with you, your leaders always stood by our side in our ups and downs of Muzareen. We always appreciated and remembered the great efforts of Madam Bainazir Bhutto who always fought for the rights of the lands of peasants. The reason for writing this application to you is that its time for us again to stand against the illegal act of Okara Military Farm. Today, the agencies and Okara police arrested Younas Iqbal (Chairman, Anjuman-e-Muzareen, Punjab AMP) when he went to anti-terrorist court, Sahiwal. So, we would like to request to Mr Bilawal Bhutto (Chairman Pakistan People Party) Shery Rehman (Senate Opposition Leader), Qamar Zaman Qaira (President Pakistan People Party) Chaudhary Manzoor Ahmad (General Secretary Pakistan People Party) and Napoleon Qayyum Minority Leader Pakistan Peoples Party, Human Rights activist to stand with us against this illegal act of Okara Military Farm so that we could continue our movement and fight for the rights of the Okara peasants. It would be very helpful for us if you speak about AMP. On 16th of March around at 8:30pm the AMP leadership and workers were making arrangement for the 17th March event a large number contingent of police raided the village Chak 10-4/L Antoniabad, District Okara They entered forcibly to the David Rehmat’s house (Secretary General, AMP) and Ulfat Dildar (Finance Secretary AMP, Okara). They wanted to arrest David Rehmat and Ulfat Dildar but arrested few activists and force them to postpone the event. Police used tear gas shells and aerial firing. Many were injured during the firing. The leader, activists and workers reacted strongly and police left the village. However, situation is still very tense and police is continually harassing the people of AMP requesting full solidarity, moral and legal help for AMP's struggle for peasant rights” 


Dr. Nazir S Bhatti have appealed COAS General Bajwa to intervene to solve this long-standing issue of farmers and to withdraw cases against AMP leaders.

WATCH BBC URDU REPORT ON PEASANT’S MOVEMENT OF OKARA

The following information is provided by the Chairman of Anjuman-e-Muzareen Punjab (AMP) and it is mainly oral without documentary proof.

The Military Dairy Farm Okara comprises six military farms. These farms cover an area of 18 chaks numbered as 3/4-L, 4/4-L, 5-A/4-L, 6/4-L, 8/4-L, 9/4-L, 10/4-L, 11/4-L, 12/4-L, 13/4-L, 17/4-L, 18/4-L, 20/4-L, 24/4-L, 25/4-L, 26/4-L, 44/3-R, and 45/3-R. In the early 20th century, land of the farm had been given to the ancestors of the peasants for cultivation and Abadkarai (habition) by the Government of British India. At that time, much of this region was infertile that could not be used for farming. The tenants were given the land with the promise that the peasants would be granted permanent ownership of the land once they succeeded in making it productive. The ancestors of the peasants succeeded in making the land fertile after much hardship, but the promise of ownership rights was not fulfilled.

Due to the environment created before the First World War, the Government of British India planned to set up several farms to meet the needs of military personnel. One of these farms named Military Dairy Farm Okara was set up in 1913. The government did not disturb the possession of the ancestors and they continued their tenancies under Military Farm Management. The land had been given on lease of 20 year which had expired in 1933 and it had never renewed.

The total land of military Dairy Farm Okara was 17013 acres out of which 5000 acres were in direct cultivation of the management while 12013 acres land was in possession of the tenants. Out of 12013 acre land 1000 acres land was spread over in the Chak # 26/4-L and 24/4-L. In these Chaks, 80% land had been possessed and cultivated by ancestors of Christian peasants.

After the partition of the sub-continents, in 1958, the land went waterlogged and could not be cultivated therefore, the peasants had to move around for earning their livelihood. In 1998, when the land returned to normal, the peasants came back and began farming. In 2000, the Military forcefully possessed the land for the purpose of Military Training Camp. The tenants did not want to leave the possession but Military vacant the land. However, the Military had not built any training camp but used that land for agricultural purpose.

The ancestors of the tenants occupied the under the valid authorities as sub-tenants of the former lessee. On setting up of the Military farm, they were allowed to continue at tenants but this condition had not been applied to their descendants. The other Military Farms are in possession of the tenants on which they are cultivating.

The Provincial Government had introduced many Abadkari Schemes during the last several years in which proprietary rights had been given to the tenants at a nominal rates. But with the tenants of the Chak # 24/4-L and 26/4-L had left without land.

Over 500 peasants had been earning their daily bread from that land. But after the possession of the Military, their lives turned to morning. They all were poor and unskilled people who knew only cultivation. They had no source of income to pursue the matter in the court. On the other hand, the military is the most powerful institution of the country and even the government had never dared to stand before the military.

The 500 peasants get together for their hereditary rights and after a struggle of 9 years; they managed to submit an application to the Board of Revenue Punjab in May 2009 on behalf of Rasheed Masih son of Barkat Masih. But the application had not been entertained properly due to the significant status of the Military.

Munawar Bibi who is president of the AMP, Dr. Chanan Pehalwan, senior Supreme Council member AMP and AMP chairman Younis Iqbal Founder of AMP are leading this movement. In Revenue Board’s documents they have their names as the ones plowing the land till 80’s. Later on they

On 1 July 2010 about 500 Christians and 200 muslims would enter the land and occupy it. Then we will give them legal help if any criminal case filed against them. Along with that a civil lawsuit for stay order will be filed. However, full consensus hasn’t yet developed whether they should go for the stay order or they should wait until the other party takes any legal action. One major reason is that our party hasn’t been able to get the agreement between Military Farms administration according to which the land was transferred to the Okara Cantonment Army — 40 Division and Engineering Corps. According to them the purpose of this transfer was for war practices of the army but they gave it to contractors for cultivation.

Each book has a different protagonist, but is set in the same futuristic era.

==Plot overview==
===''The Giver''===
{{Main article|The Giver}}
''The Giver'' is a 1993 American children's novel (generally young adult or older) set in a society that is at first presented as a utopian society but gradually appears more and more dystopian. The novel follows a boy, Jonas, through the twelfth and thirteenth years of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to "Sameness," a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory, the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness in case the memories that others lack are ever needed to aid decisions. Jonas learns the truth about his Utopian society and struggles with its weight. The Community lacks any color, memory, climate, and terrain; that Sameness emphasizes the utopian qualities of the Community.

''The Giver'' won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than 10 million copies. In Australia, Canada, and the United States, it is a part of many middle school reading lists, but it is also on many challenging book lists and appeared on the [[American Library Association]]'s list of most challenged books of the 1990s.

The novel forms a loose quartet with three other books set in the same future era: ''Gathering Blue'' (2000), ''Messenger'' (2004), and ''Son'' (2012).

===''Gathering Blue''===
{{Main article|Gathering Blue}}
''Gathering Blue'' is a 2000 children's dystopian novella. It is set in the same future time period and treats some of the same themes.

The central character, Kira, who has a deformed leg, is orphaned and must learn to survive in a society that normally leaves the weak or disabled exposed to die in the fields. Kira's father was apparently mauled by the Beasts at the Field. Kira's mother had died recently from an illness.

Since she is an orphan, Kira needs a reason for the Council of Edifice to keep her in the village, rather than send her to the Field, which is certain death at the hands of The Beast. Kira's mother used to do embroidery for the Council and taught Kira some of her talents. Kira's gift for embroidery convinces the Council to keep her around to mend and update a beautiful robe, which shows the history of their society. In the course of the book, she begins to learn the art of dyeing thread different colors from except for blue, which nobody in her community knows how to make. But only Annabella knows, Kira's mentor. She also learns more about the truth of her village and the terrible secrets it holds. She then finds her father, who tells the truth of what happened to him and about the Village he now lives in.

===''Messenger''===
{{Main article|Messenger (novel)}}
''Messenger'' takes place about eight years after the events of ''The Giver'' and about six years after the events of ''Gathering Blue''. Set in an isolated community, known simply as Village, it focuses on a boy, Matty, who serves as message-bearer through the ominous and lethal Forest, which surrounds the community. This book also tells of the fate of Jonas and Gabe, from 'The Giver''.

===''Son''===
{{Main article|Son (novel)}}
''Son'' follows Claire, the birth mother of Gabriel from ''The Giver'' and her journey to locate her son. Then she finds him.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main article|The Giver (film)}}
A film adaptation of the first book was produced by [[The Weinstein Company]] and [[Walden Media]]. It was released on August 15, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title='The Giver' Film Adaptation to Hit Theaters August 2014|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/giver-film-adaptation-hit-theaters-634759|accessdate=July 10, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starred [[Jeff Bridges]] as The Giver, [[Brenton Thwaites]] as Jonas and [[Meryl Streep]] as the Chief Elder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bahr|first=Lindsey|title='The Giver': First Look at Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaites in Lois Lowry's classic|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/01/23/the-giver-first-look/|accessdate=July 10, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''webcam model''' ([[colloquial]] gender-neutral: '''camodel'''; female: '''camgirl'''; male: '''camboy''') is a video performer who is streamed upon the [[Internet]] with a live [[webcam]] broadcast.&lt;ref name=Richtel&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richtel|first1=Matt|title=Intimacy on the Web, With a Crowd|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/technology/intimacy-on-the-web-with-a-crowd.html|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=New York Times|date=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A webcam model often performs erotic acts online, such as [[Striptease|stripping]], in exchange for money, goods, or attention. They may also sell videos of their performances. Since many webcam models operate from their homes, they are free to choose the amount of sexual content for their broadcasts.&lt;ref name=Box&gt;{{cite news|last1=Box|first1=Bobby|title=An Interview With A Webcam Model Who Makes $4,000 A Month Filming Herself|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/dating/sex/an-intimate-convo-with-webcam-model/1734402|accessdate=24 January 2018|work=Elite Daily|date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most display nudity and sexually provocative behavior, some choose to remain mostly clothed and merely talk about various topics while still soliciting payment as tips from their fans.&lt;ref name=Senft2&gt;{{cite book|first=Theresa |last=Senft|chapter=I'd Rather Be a Camgirl than a Cyborg - The Future of Feminism on the Web| pages=45–48 |title=Camgirls: Celebrity &amp; Community in the Age of Social Networks |location= New York | publisher=  Peter Lang Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8204-5694-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:MyFreeCams_Expo_Booth_with_Model_118.jpg | thumb | 340 px | right | A model demonstrates web broadcasting with a video camera and computer at an industry trade show. ]]

In 1996 an American college student and [[conceptual art]]ist, [[Jenny Ringley]], created a website called "JenniCam." Her web camera was located in her dorm room and automatically photographed her every few minutes. The camera captured Ringley doing almost everything – brushing her teeth, doing her laundry, doing stripteases – and then broadcast its images live over the Internet.&lt;ref name="disobey"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forgotten Web Celebrities: Jennicam.org's Jennifer Ringley |url=http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/2004_05_19_archive.html |accessdate=March 27, 2014 |date=May 19, 2004 |first=Steve |last=Baldwin |publisher=Disobey.com: Content for the discontented (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1998 she divided her website's access into free and paying.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite book|first=Jamie|last=Bartlett|chapter=Chapter 6: Lights, Web-camera, Action|pages=166–192|title=The Dark Net: Inside the Digital Underworld|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTlUBAAAQBAJ|location=London|publisher=Melville House|year=2014|isbn=9780434023172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1998, a commercial site called AmandaCam was launched. Amanda's site, like Ringley's, had multiple cameras around her house which allowed people to look in on her.&lt;ref name=Senft2/&gt;&lt;ref name=coloradoart1&gt;{{cite web | title=Histories of Internet Art: Fictions and Factions - Net Practice | url=https://art.colorado.edu/hiaff/artwork9fe4.html?id=28&amp;cid=10 | accessdate=28 January 2018 |work=University of Colorado |date=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Amanda made an important early discovery that would influence the camming industry for decades to come – that a website's popularity could be greatly increased by enabling viewers to chat with a performer while online.&lt;ref name=Senft2/&gt;&lt;ref name=webdaddie1&gt;{{cite web | title=JenniCam - AmandaCam | url=http://alt.fan.jennicam.narkive.com/VJEXHwt1/amandacam | accessdate=28 January 2018 |work=Narkive |date=13 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within her ''members section'', Amanda made it a point to chat with her viewers for over three hours a day.&lt;ref name=Senft2/&gt; Since the early days of live [[webcast]]s by Ringley and Amanda, the phenomenon of ''camming'' has grown to become a multibillion-dollar industry which has an average of at least 12,500 cam models online at any given time and more than 240,000 viewers at any given time.&lt;ref name=Rabouin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rabouin|first1=Dion|title=Camming Gives Internet Porn Fans a Personal Touch|url=http://www.newsweek.com/camming-internet-porn-personal-touch-416577|accessdate=28 January 2018|work=Newsweek|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payment systems define format===

A camming website acts as a middleman and talent aggregator by hosting hundreds of independent models, and verifies that all are at least 18 years old.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGehee&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGehee|first1=Cate|title=Camming Is Not Like Any Other Kind of Sex Work|url=https://www.thestranger.com/features/feature/2015/06/10/22360297/camming-is-not-like-any-other-kind-of-sex-work|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=the Stranger|date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camming websites typically fall into two main categories, dependent upon whether their video [[chat rooms]] are free or private. In private chat rooms, viewers pay by the minute for a private show. However, in free chat rooms payment is voluntary and is in the form of tips, thus providing the model with an income at a minimal cost for the multiple viewers of her chat room's video stream.&lt;ref name=Rachel&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stuart|first1=Rachel|title=Webcamming - The Sex Work Revolution That No One Wants to Talk About|url=https://theconversation.com/webcamming-the-sex-work-revolution-that-no-one-is-willing-to-talk-about-69834|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=The Conversation|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tips'' are electronic tokens that viewers can buy from a camming website, and then give to the models during live performances to show appreciation. Tokens can also be used buy access to private shows, operate a [[Teledildonics| Teledildonic]] device that a model may be wearing, or used to buy videos and souvenirs from a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pornsitestars.com/best-sex-cam-sites |title=27 Top Live Sex Cam Sites You Will Love! |at=Sex Cams Explained |language=en |website=Pornsitestars.com|accessdate=8 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website provides the transactional platform and then collects and distributes a percentage of the tips to the models. For public chat rooms, the model's portion of a tip is a little less than half.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;

Many of the industry’s top webcam models are said to make six figures a year.&lt;ref name=Rabouin/&gt;

===Through interaction a personal connection===

Performances can be highly interactive in both public and private video chat rooms. Customers and performers are able to communicate with each other by using keyboard, speech, and two-way cameras.&lt;ref name=Rachel/&gt; Within public chat rooms the audience can see tips and viewer comments as scrolling text which appears next to the real-time video stream. Camgirls will frequently read and respond to the scrolling viewer comments.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt; The chatter is constant, and is often led by a small band of regular fans.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt; However this is not the first time that ''conversational interaction'' had become a boon for the erotic entertainment industry. The [[Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre]] strip club is credited with the invention of the [[lap dance]] when during 1977 their new stage, New York Live, pioneered customer-contact shows with [[stripper]]s that came off the stage and sat in the laps of customers for tips.&lt;ref name=McCumber1&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=McCumber | pages=78–80, 155 | title=X-Rated | location= New York | publisher=  Pinnacle Books | year=1992 | isbn=978-0786011131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enabled with this new revenue stream for strippers, the [[strip club]] industry went through a period of extreme growth during the 1980s. And in the early 20th century sociologist Paul Cressey noted that within the hundreds of [[taxi dance hall|taxi-dance halls]] of America, "the traffic in romance and in feminine society" would become available when [[taxi dancer|taxi dancers]] would offer their companionship and "the illusion of romance" for ten cents a dance.&lt;ref name="Cressey1"&gt;{{cite book| last= Cressey | first=Paul| title=The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life |date=1932 | publisher=University of Chicago Press| location=Chicago, IL| isbn=9780226120515 | page=10–11, 129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Wright |first1=Evan | title=Dance With A Stranger |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/dance-with-a-stranger-2130263 | accessdate=6 February 2018| work=LA Weekly | date=20 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Much of the success of camming owes to its ability to move beyond the borders of erotic video performance, and into the everyday social lives of camming customers, or ''fans'' as they are known. Webcam performers are often highly entrepreneurial, and use mainstream social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Skype, and Tumblr to build and maintain relationships with their customers.&lt;ref name=Rabouin/&gt; Some fans communicate multiple times a day with models through social media. 

Unlike traditional pornography, the interactive nature of the camming medium titillates with the promise of ''virtual friendship''. [[Princeton University]] sociologist and author of ''The Purchase of Intimacy'', [[Viviana Zelizer]], states of camming: "They’re defining a new kind of intimacy. It’s not traditional sex work, not a relationship, but something in between."&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;  Cam models perform not just sex work, but also perform through their hosting duties, conveying authenticity, creating and animating fantasies, and managing relationships over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nayar|first=Kavita|date=March 28, 2017|title=Working it: the professionalization of amateurism in digital adult entertainment|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=Volume 17, 2017 - Issue 3|issue=3|pages=Pages 473–488|doi=10.1080/14680777.2017.1303622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Cam Girlz'', a documentary film about the industry, the male fans often say that they come to camming sites as a way to fulfill emotional needs. The film's director, Sean Dunne, states of the fans, "They said it’s not like a strip club -- it’s like a community, and you feel it when you’re in these chat rooms. It’s a community and entertainment that goes very far beyond sexuality."&lt;ref name=Rabouin/&gt;

However Dr. Kari Lerum of the [[University of Washington]] suggests that men are more open and vulnerable in cam rooms than in strip clubs, and can become very invested in relationships which only exist on the screen.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;

==Terminology==

The term [[webcam]] is a [[clipped compound]] used to combine the terms [[video camera]] and [[World Wide Web]]. 

When webcam models create their live [[webcast]]s, they perform the activity known as ''camming''.

A third-party hosting website which transmits multiple webcam models' video-streams is known as a ''camming site''.

Webcam models mostly perform individually in separate video [[chat rooms]], which are frequently referred to as ''rooms''.

The term "camwhore" was first used in print in November 2001&lt;ref&gt;Torpy, Kathryn. (November 10, 2001) [[The Courier-Mail]] ''Virtual lolitas.'' Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;; however, the label is considered derogatory and pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;Chua, Grace. (July 30, 2006) [[The Straits Times]] ''Look, it's me - Babes who blog.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppert, Allan; Mullens, Ken. (November 14, 2004) [[The Advertiser (Australia)|Sunday Mail (Adelaide, Australia).]] ''Surviving a great white: How it feels to be a webcam girl.'' Section: Features2; Page 66. (writing, "The first lot of cam girls coined the phrase "cam whores" as a bit of a tongue-in-cheek thing. &lt;nowiki&gt;[In 1999, we]&lt;/nowiki&gt; were whoring ourselves for hits, getting on cam and flirting.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==The camming industry==

As of 2016, the money generated by camming sites was upwards of $2 billion annually. The pornography business as a whole is estimated to be about $5 billion.&lt;ref name=Rabouin/&gt; According to the [[web traffic]] analysis service [[Compete.com]], [[LiveJasmin]] generates more than 9 million unique viewers a month. Similar webcam model hosting sites such as [[Chaturbate]], [[CAM4]] and [[MyFreeCams.com]] boast 4.1 million, 3.7 million and 2 million unique monthly visitors, respectively.&lt;ref name=Rabouin/&gt; The decentralized business model of camming has upended the pornography industry in multiple ways. Camming revenue has been severely cutting into the profits of the pornographic movie business, which has also been eroded for a number of years due to piracy and the distribution of free sexual content upon the Internet.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt; Additionally, the pornographic film industry used to be male-dominated except for the performers. But since camming only requires a video camera, broadband service, and computer, there has now been a power reversal and it is the ''female'' webcam performers who propel the industry while at home.&lt;ref name=Rachel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hess |first1=Amanda | title=Who Gets to Be Sexy? | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/style/porn-women-nonbinary-queer.html |accessdate=7 May 2018|work=New York Times|date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd Blatt, who once produced pornographic movies in California and has several Ferraris to show for it, declared:  "If you’re the middle guy who has been eating off this industry for 20 years, it’s a big change. The girls don’t need anybody."
&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt; Once viewed as a small niche in the world of adult entertainment, camming today has become "the engine of the porn industry", according to Alec Helmy, the publisher of [[XBIZ]], a sex-trade industry journal.&lt;ref name=Song&gt;{{cite news|last1=Song|first1=Jason|title=As L.A. porn industry struggles, 'web camming' becomes a new trend|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-porn-camming-20160803-snap-story.html|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new revolution that the decentralized camming industry had brought, has also challenged many cultural stereotypes concerning both the camgirls and their customers.&lt;ref name=Ciapponi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ciapponi|first1=Giana | title=Of Dildos and Degrees: Why College-Educated Women are Turning to Sex Work | url=https://ravishly.com/2014/06/13/college-women-sex-work-tuition | accessdate=25 January 2018 |work= Ravishly | date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnography researcher Dr. Theresa Senft herself became a camgirl for a year while doing four years of research for her 2008 book entitled, ''Camgirls: Celebrity and Community in the Age of Social Networks''. Senft has described herself as "the first academic camgirl" while becoming a “camgirl writing about camgirls.”&lt;ref name=Senft1&gt;{{cite book|first=Theresa |last=Senft|chapter=Introduction: The Personal as Political in the Age of the Global Network|pages= 8–11| title=Camgirls: Celebrity &amp; Community in the Age of Social Networks |location= New York | publisher=  Peter Lang Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8204-5694-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Anna Katzen, a camgirl who has a postgraduate degree from Harvard, stated during an interview, 
:"The men I meet online rarely fall into the category of anonymous asses who have abandoned all social etiquette, nor do they resemble the pasty, calculator-wristwatch-wearing forebears of chat rooms past. Many, in fact, are successful professionals in their field – whether it be law, the arts or academia. Some of my most popular performances entail me reading erotica, perhaps [[Anaïs Nin]] or the [[Marquis de Sade]], in the buff. Oftentimes, the books are gifts from fans, who will probe me for literary analysis, if I don’t probe myself with something else first. I have unwittingly created a powerful “brand” for myself: the wild intellectual, the bluestocking in garters. “''I came for the tits, but stayed for the intellectual banter'',” remarked one of my visitors, and another stated, "''most guys aren’t looking for some airbrushed [[Barbie]]. They want real, intelligent girls – like you.''”&lt;ref name=Katzen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katzen|first1=Anna | title=From Harvard to Webcam Girl | url=https://www.salon.com/2014/02/10/from_harvard_to_webcam_girl/ | accessdate=25 January 2018 |work= Salon | date=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Hosting websites===

Webcam models typically make use of third-party websites to stream their real-time video performances upon the Internet. Some of these sites charge viewers a fixed fee per minute, although many allow free access for unregistered visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Prager, Michael. (May 29, 2002) [[Boston Globe]] ''Wired now looks as good as it is.'' Section: Li';l'kving; Pge D4.&lt;/ref&gt; These Internet hosting websites, known as ''camming sites'', take care of the technical work – broadcast their video feed, payment processing, provide an intuitive interface, advertising – so that the cam model only has to focus on the actual shows for her video chat room. Most cam models are [[independent contractor]]s for camming sites, and are not employees.&lt;ref name=McGehee/&gt;

By presenting hundreds of different models via individual chat rooms, a camming site becomes a talent aggregator and middleman – but only in the sense that Apple is the middleman for bands selling music on iTunes.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt; Though a camming website may carry many hundreds of models, they frequently provide an interface for the viewer to easily switch between the most-visited models' rooms, and that interface occasionally resembles the multiple channel selection of [[cable television]].&lt;ref name=McGehee/&gt;

Camming sites typically supply each webcam model with an individual ''profile webpage'' where the performer can describe themselves, and more importantly create a ''virtual store'' where they can sell items like videos, photos, personal clothing, and memberships to their fan club. The profile page's virtual store creates a stream of passive income, meaning that even if a camgirl is not online and performing, she can still generate money while fans come to the ever-present profile page to purchase its wares. One of the most popular items are homemade videos that cam models make of themselves.&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; While most these videos are sexual in nature, they often include elements of comedy, fashion, and a narration of their lifestyles. The affordability and ease of new video recording technology has spawned new variations and genres of pornography since individual women as well as industry players can now create its content.&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; A profile page might also sell contact information like a personal phone number, a spot on her Snapchat contact list, or the ability to send her private messages through a camming site's ''friends list''.&lt;ref name=McGehee/&gt; The profile page may also suggest tip amounts for real-time performance requests like a sexy dance, a song request, removal of clothing, a spanking, or the spin on a game wheel.&lt;ref name=McGehee/&gt; All prices on a profile page are listed in quantities of ''tips'', which are electronic tokens that the viewer can buy in bunches from the cam site to be later given to various models during performance, or in later purchases upon the profile page.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bertrand&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bertrand|first1=Natasha|title=How Webcam Models Make Money|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-webcam-models-make-money-2014-11|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=New York Times|date=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The camming site keeps a percentage of the tips, but the amount varies. Big earners can get a bigger chunk of their tips.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt; Commissions earned by webcam models vary widely by website, but are usually based on a percentage of gross sales although sometimes they are in the form of a flat fee. They may also earn money through advertising or earn commissions by convincing customers to sign up for membership at adult pornographic paysites.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt; Many sites also encourage viewers to purchase items from online wish lists.&lt;ref name=Bertrand/&gt; Some webcam models cater to particular fetishes, such as a fascination with feet and might earn additional money by selling worn socks to patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of a Webcam Girl|last=Baxter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VCHCgAAQBAJ|first=Annabelle|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1620876671|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Camming sites specify rules and restrictions for their cam models, which in turn tend to give the camming site a distinct style and format. For example, one major free-access site, which only allows female models, fosters an environment where the camgirls are not necessarily obligated to do masturbation shows, or even display nudity.&lt;ref name=MFCRules&gt;{{cite web | title=Rules for Models - MFC | url=https://wiki.myfreecams.com/wiki/Rules_for_Models | accessdate=10 February 2018 | work=Wiki.MyFreeCams |date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, some of that site's models create a more relaxed "hangout atmosphere" within their rooms that occasionally resembles a [[talk show]].&lt;ref name=Box/&gt;&lt;ref name=Senft2/&gt; And conversely another major cam site, which additionally allows men and couples to perform, tends to be more sexual and show-oriented.&lt;ref name=CharRules&gt;{{cite web | title=Basic Rules to Follow - Chaturbate's blog | url=https://blog.chaturbate.com/rules-and-guidelines/basic-rules-to-follow/ | accessdate=10 February 2018 | work= Chaturbate Blog |date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cam site rules might prohibit working in a public place so that the model does not get a public indecency arrest, the way that Kendra Sunderland was charged after her 2014 performance inside the Oregon State University Library.&lt;ref name=McGehee/&gt; Models who violate a camming site's rules may be subjected to a temporary or permanent ban from the cam site.

===Resources for performers===

Cam studios allow models to rent facilities outside of their home. These businesses can supply models with video equipment, Internet service, computer, lighting, and furniture. One example was the pornographic film company [[Kink.com]], which rented individual cam studios in the [[San Francisco Armory]] by the hour, from 2013 until the building was sold in 2018.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dineen|first1=J.K.|title=SF Armory sells for $65 million — to be used for manufacturing and offices|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-Armory-sells-for-65-million-to-be-used-12560076.php|accessdate=22 April 2018|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within some studios the cam models can work by the percentage of business that they bring in, instead of renting studio time. The cam models do not have to pay to join this type of studio, but they are also not guaranteed a salary. These models can typically choose to charge customers between $1 and $15 per minute, and then the studio keeps half of the gross while the model gets the rest.&lt;ref name=Song/&gt;

Another workplace option is called a "camgirl mansion", which is a place that provides equipment and broadcast rooms where multiple camgirls can live and share expenses, but without a studio owner.&lt;ref name=McGehee/&gt;     

Various support websites&lt;!-- do not add specific examples without a reliable, independent source.--&gt; supply general information about business strategies, upcoming conferences, tips for performance, and reviews of studio equipment. Support sites also give advice about how to protect privacy, discourage piracy, avoid Internet security lapses, and how to prevent financial scams.&lt;ref name=Bertrand/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;

Conferences and industry trade shows can also aid cam models by allowing cam models to network and meet others in the profession on a personal level.&lt;ref name=McGehee/&gt;

==Legal issues==
===Laws===

Lawrence Walters, a Florida lawyer who is an expert in obscenity law, said that there was nothing inherently illegal about web model camming shows, as long as the models were over 18 and performed at home or in a model's studio.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;

A sex work researcher, Rachel Stuart, notes an interesting paradox in British law which tends to focus on the uploading of pornographic recordings, but does not deal with erotic performance when streamed upon the Internet through camming. For instance, the [[Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014]] ban certain acts from being depicted and uploaded by pornography producers in the United Kingdom, and the [[Digital Economy Act 2017]] seeks to restrict minors’ access to pornographic material online. And yet both laws will have no effect if the performances are ''streamed'' as opposed to being ''recorded''. Stuart states of the legal conundrum in England, "Performing an explicitly pornographic act via a webcam carries no repercussions, but if the same show is recorded and uploaded, the performer can be liable to a fine." &lt;ref name=Rachel/&gt;

In December 2017 the American [[FCC]] voted to do away with [[Net neutrality|Net Neutrality]] rules, which previously insured that [[Internet service provider]]s treat all data on the Internet as the same, and to not charge differently by user.&lt;ref name=Fiegerman1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fiegerman|first1=Seth|title=The end of net neutrality - What it all means |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-explainer/index.html |accessdate=28 January 2018|work=CNN|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But without the Net Neutrality rules, Internet service providers could dramatically increase costs for companies that need significant bandwidth – like [[CD Baby]], [[Spotify]], and [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name=Moss1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moss|first1=Marissa |title=Net Neutrality: How a Repeal Could Kill the Careers of Indie Musicians |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/net-neutrality-how-a-repeal-could-kill-artists-careers-w513787 |accessdate=28 January 2018|work=Rolling Stone | date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CD Baby is an online music store specializing in the sale of CDs and music downloads from independent musicians to consumers. Like camming's hosting sites, CD Baby is an aggregator of independent performers' digital media in the same way that camming sites enable cam models to sell their videos for tips.&lt;ref name=Ludwick1&gt;{{cite news||last1=Ludwick | first1=Robert | title=What the repeal of Net Neutrality could mean for musicians | url=http://diymusician.cdbaby.com/business/repeal-net-neutrality-mean-musicians/ | accessdate=28 January 2018|work=DIY Musician|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the free-access business model of the camming industry also relies on large bandwidth, these possible new costs could eventually be passed on to camming hosting sites, as well as to the cam models themselves. A politically alert camgirl, Melonie, states: "How many camgirls and webcam customers are going to be able to afford a $200+ monthly bill from their ISP for a high bandwidth connection capable of HD video streaming? How many camgirls are going to be able to continue to devote time to create webcam host programming if the payout percentage is reduced from 30% to 15%?"  
&lt;ref name=StripperWeb1&gt;{{cite web | title=Camming Connection - Net Neutrality and Webcam Modeling | url=https://www.stripperweb.com/forum/showthread.php?190926-net-neutrality-and-webcam-modeling | accessdate=28 January 2018|work=Stripper Web|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2018, the new ruling has yet to be leveraged by ISP's to increase costs. However bandwidth hungry companies like Netflix and CD Baby nervously await the eventual Internet service providers' response to the new FCC ruling that they lobbied so hard to bring about.&lt;ref name=Coldewey1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coldewey|first1=Devin|title=The FCC just repealed net neutrality. What happens next?|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/the-fcc-just-repealed-net-neutrality-what-happens-next/ | accessdate=28 January 2018|work=TechCrunch|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents===

In October 2014 a 19-year-old [[Oregon State University]] student, Kendra Sunderland, had been working as a camgirl before she made an hour-long video for MyFreeCams.com of herself at the Oregon State University Library, in which she stripped and masturbated on camera for a live audience. She was then charged with public indecency after the show was recorded by someone who was watching MyFreeCams.com online, and then posted it on other sites. Sunderland faced fines up to $6,250 and one year of jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Stuart|title=Former OSU student cited for public indecency in library filming faces up to 1 year in jail, $6,250 fine|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/01/former_osu_student_cited_for_p.html|accessdate=19 December 2016|work=The Oregonian|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She pleaded guilty, paid $1,000, and avoided jail. The incident generated headlines around the country and landed Sunderland reported deals with [[Playboy]], and a contract with [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'s parent company [[Friend Finder Networks]] purportedly worth six figures.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt; The incident greatly increased Sunderland's popularity, and she has continued to do camming and speak positively of it as a career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silverstein|first1=Jason|title=EXCLUSIVE: Oregon State webcam girl Kendra Sunderland opens up in first interview: ‘I've always been the type of girl who’s not afraid to show off'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/oregon-webcam-girl-kendra-sunderland-interview-article-1.2105248|accessdate=19 December 2016|work=New York Daily News|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rabouin/&gt;

In Arizona during 2015 a fan took his appreciation of camgirls to an illegal level when he was indicted for spending $476,000 on a company credit card, which he used for tips on camming websites.  He spent more than $100,000 on MyFreeCams.com alone, and sent $26,800 to one cam model in particular to pay for her college tuition bill, and new tires for her car. According to the indictment he also purchased flowers, chocolates, electronic equipment, shoes, a TV, a handbag, laptop computer, and an iPod for some of his favorite camgirls.&lt;ref name=Rabouin/&gt;

Webcam models have occasionally been the targets of cyber-stalkers and blackmailers. Sex work researcher, Rachel Stuart, reported that while doing her PhD research she encountered webcam models who were concerned about viewers filming and sharing their performances on porn sites, or acquiring personal information which could be used to stalk or blackmail them.&lt;ref name=Rachel/&gt; In 2013 the New York Times interviewed a woman who prefers to conceal her real identity while working as a camgirl. She revealed that she had been cyber-stalked by a heavy tipper who started making threats and demands about what outfits she should wear. A short while later she found out that her real name and address had been posted on the Internet along with her cam name. When she complained to the police, they said that they could do nothing, because "putting real information on the Internet is not illegal." She later found out that the same individual had also threatened and outed several other camgirls.&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;

A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' report described the story of [[Justin Berry]], a 13-year-old boy who, after hooking up his webcam and listing himself on an online forum in order to make friends, was propositioned by older men to strip and [[Masturbation|masturbate]] on camera. [[CNN]] referred to him as "in the language of cyberspace... a cam-whore".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Kyra. (December 21, 2005) [[CNN|CNN News]] ''Protecting Kids From Internet Dangers.'' Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He started his own [[paysite]], [[prostitution|prostituted]] himself, sold video recordings of his encounters with Mexican prostitutes, and helped hire other underage models. He made several hundred thousand dollars over five years before turning all information over to prosecutors in exchange for immunity.&lt;ref name="webcam"&gt;Eichenwald, Kurt (2005-12-19). [[The New York Times]] ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/national/19kids.ready.html?ex=1292648400&amp;en=aea51b3919b2361a&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss Through His Webcam, a Boy Joins a Sordid Online World.]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, [[Sex trafficking|sex traffickers]] who operated illegal brothels forced an indentured victim to have sex in webcam shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article49875620.html|title=11 years in prison for man convicted in Miami gay Hungarian sex-slave ring|work=miamiherald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/12/29/gay-sex-slave-trial-exposes-dilemmas-faced-by-male-trafficking-victims/|title=Gay sex slave trial exposes hardships of male trafficking victims|date=29 December 2015|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Hungarian-Gay-Sex-Trafficking-Ring-Busted-in-South-Florida-SAO-278040871.html|title=Hungarian Gay Sex Trafficking Ring Busted in South Florida: SAO|work=NBC 6 South Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;
