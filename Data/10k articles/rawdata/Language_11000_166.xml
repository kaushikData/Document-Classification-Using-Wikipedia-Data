Afroasiatic languages have over 495 million native speakers, the fourth largest number of any language family (after [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family|title=Summary by language family|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phylum has six branches: [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Chadic languages|Chadic]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Omotic languages|Omotic]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]. 

By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language or dialect continuum is [[Arabic]]. A de facto group of distinct [[Varieties of Arabic|language varieties]] within the Semitic branch, the languages that evolved from [[Proto-Arabic]] have around 313 million native speakers, concentrated primarily in West Asia and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ara|title=Arabic|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages, such as [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]], which forms a distinct branch of the family, and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]], all of which are from the Semitic branch. 

The [[Afroasiatic Urheimat|original homeland]] of the Afroasiatic family, and when the parent language (i.e. [[Proto-Afroasiatic]]) was spoken, are yet to be agreed upon by [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]]. Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara and the [[Levant]] (see below).

==Etymology==
During the early 1800s, linguists grouped the [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] and [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] languages within a "Hamitic" phylum, in acknowledgement of these languages' genetic relation with each other and with those in the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] phylum.&lt;ref name="Ruhlen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merritt|first1=Ruhlen|title=A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification|date=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0804718943|pages=76 &amp; 87|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mYwmDE3f6wUC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "Hamitic" and "Semitic" were etymologically derived from the [[Book of Genesis]], which describes various Biblical tribes descended from [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] and [[Shem]], two sons of [[Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregersen|first1=Edgar A.|title=Language in Africa: An Introductory Survey|date=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0677043807|page=116|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=w4lytWv1JKAC&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, the main constituent elements within the broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out.&lt;ref name="Ruhlen"/&gt;

[[Friedrich Müller (linguist)|Friedrich Müller]] introduced the name "Hamito-Semitic" for the entire family in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'' (1876).&lt;ref name="Lipiński"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipiński|first=Edward|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0815-4|pages=21–22|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=IiXVqyEkPKcC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Delafosse]] (1914) later coined the term "Afroasiatic" (often now spelled "Afro-Asiatic"). However, it did not come into general use until [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic spanned the continents of both Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="Lipiński" /&gt;

Individual scholars have also called the family "Erythraean" (Tucker 1966) and "Lisramic" (Hodge 1972). In lieu of "Hamito-Semitic", the Russian linguist [[Igor Diakonoff]] later suggested the term "Afrasian", meaning "half African, half Asiatic", in reference to the geographic distribution of the family's constituent languages.&lt;ref name=NEB&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 8; Volume 22|year=1998|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=978-0-85229-633-2|pages=722|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=6-lMAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Hamito-Semitic" remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries.

==Distribution and branches==
[[File:Interrelations between branches of Afro-Asiatic.svg|thumb|300px|Interrelations between branches of Afroasiatic (Lipiński 2001)]]
[[File:afroasiatic.svg|thumb|right|300px|Some linguists' proposals for grouping within Afroasiatic]]
Scholars generally treat the Afroasiatic language family as including the following branches:
* [[Berber languages|Berber]]
* [[Chadic languages|Chadic]]
* [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]
* [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]
* [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]
* [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]

Although there is general agreement on these six families, [[linguistics|linguists]] who study Afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement, in particular:
* The [[Omotic]] language branch is the most controversial member of Afroasiatic, because the grammatical formatives to which most linguists have given the greatest weight in classifying languages in the family "are either absent or distinctly wobbly" (Hayward 1995). Greenberg (1963) and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic, whereas others have raised doubts about it being part of Afroasiatic at all (e.g. Theil 2006).&lt;ref name="Sands2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1749-818x.2008.00124.x|title = Africa's Linguistic Diversity| journal=Language and Linguistics Compass| volume=3| issue=2| pages=559–580|year = 2009|last1 = Sands|first1 = Bonny}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Afroasiatic identity of [[Ongota language|Ongota]] is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the "mixed" appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. [[Harold C. Fleming |Harold Fleming]] (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&amp;T=1235007315045{haupt_harrassowitz=http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3277.ahtml?T=1235007315045}|title= Harrassowitz Verlag - The Harrassowitz Publishing House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author= |date= |website= harrassowitz-verlag.de|accessdate= 14 April 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170629231821/https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&amp;T=1235007315045%7Bhaupt_harrassowitz%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.harrassowitz-verlag.de%2Ftitle_3277.ahtml%3FT%3D1235007315045%7D|archive-date= 29 June 2017|dead-url= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonny Sands (2009) finds the proposal by Savà and Tosco (2003) the most convincing: namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a [[Nilo-Saharan languages |Nilo-Saharan]] [[substratum]]. In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.&lt;ref name="Sands2009" /&gt;
* [[Beja language|Beja]], sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic, is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a high degree of internal diversity.
* Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself.
* There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see [[# Subgrouping|§ Subgrouping]] below). This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: scholars also frequently disagree on the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance.
* [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] has been proposed{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the [[phonotactics]] characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification.

==Classification history==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Berber people]] --&gt;
In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah ibn Quraysh]] of [[Tiaret]] in [[Algeria]] was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and [[Aramaic]].&lt;ref name="Lipiński" /&gt;

In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships. In 1844, [[Theodor Benfey]] suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter "Ethiopic").{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Friedrich Müller (linguist)|Friedrich Müller]] named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'' ("Outline of Linguistics"), and defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a "Hamitic" group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It was the [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] (1810&amp;ndash;1884) who restricted Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized by a grammatical [[Grammatical gender|gender system]]. This "Hamitic language group" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient [[Egyptian language]], the [[Berber languages]], the [[Cushitic languages]], the [[Beja language]], and the [[Chadic languages]]. Unlike Müller, Lepsius considered that [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Nama language|Nama]] were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.&lt;ref name = "mer"&gt;Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification'', Stanford University Press, 1991, pp. 80–1&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.jpg|thumb|Distribution of the Afroasiatic/Hamito-Semitic languages in Africa]]
In 1912, [[Carl Meinhof]] published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' ("The Languages of the Hamites"), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Nandi languages|Nandi]], [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s.&lt;ref name = "mer"/&gt; Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that "speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'."&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a "fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]]." Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub "Nilo-Hamitic" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.&lt;ref name="Ruhlen109"&gt;Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct "Hamitic" subgroup, and included [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of "Hamitic" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate "Nilo-Hamitic" language category in particular, Greenberg was "returning to a view widely held a half century earlier." He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.&lt;ref name="Ruhlen"/&gt; He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.

Greenberg's model was fully developed in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Following [[Isaac Schapera]] and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the [[Hottentot language|Khoekhoe language]] as a member of the [[Khoisan languages]], a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of [[Click consonant|click sounds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sands|first=Bonnie|date=2009|title=Africa's linguistic diversity|url=|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|volume=3|issue=2|pages=559–580|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages consider them to be [[Language isolate|linguistic isolates]].&lt;ref&gt;Sands, Bonny E. (1998) 'Eastern and Southern African Khoisan: evaluating claims of distant linguistic relationships.' Quellen zur Khoisan-Forschung 14. Köln: Köppe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruhlen, p.117"&gt;Ruhlen, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Greenberg's classification remains a starting point for modern work of many languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this.&lt;ref name="Ruhlen, p.117"/&gt;

Since the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages (Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian) have not been shown to form an exclusive ([[Monophyly|monophyletic]]) phylogenetic unit of their own, separate from other Afroasiatic languages, linguists no longer use the term in this sense. Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family.&lt;ref name="Welmers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Everett Welmers|first1=William|title=African Language Structures|date=1974|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520022102|page=16|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=hCxpK-CkdgYC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]. This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.

Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and [[Robert Hetzron]], have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic.

''[[Glottolog]]'' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge. It therefore splits off the following groups as small families: [[South Omotic languages|South Omotic]], [[Mao languages|Mao]], [[Dizoid languages|Dizoid]], [[Gonga–Gimojan languages|Gonga–Gimojan]] (North Omotic apart from the preceding), [[Ongota language|Ongota]], [[Kujarge language|Kujarge]].

Little agreement exists on the [[subgrouping (linguistics)|subgrouping]] of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic. However, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.

Otherwise:
* [[Paul Newman (linguist)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic. Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iln/LING2110/v07/THEIL%20Is%20Omotic%20Afroasiatic.pdf|title=Is Omotic Afroasiatic? (In Norwegian)|author=|date=|website=uio.no|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or "Erythraean", into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian. He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed [[Ongota language|Ongota]] as a new third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.
* Like Harold Fleming, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean. He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic. He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and "Boreafrasian." According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic.
* [[Vladimir Orel]] and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a [[language family]].
* [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.
* [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as "Macro-Cushitic". He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.
* Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic.

==Position among the world's languages==
Afroasiatic is one of the four major [[Languages of Africa|language families]] spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.

There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:
* [[Hermann Möller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as grammatical gender, noun-adjective agreement, three-way number distinction, and vowel alternation as a means of derivation).
* Apparently influenced by Möller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic macro-family]] (cf. Pedersen 1931:336–338), also included the Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Yukaghir languages]], and [[Dravidian languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].
* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000–2002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].
* Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. The even larger [[Borean languages|Borean super-family]] contains Nostratic as well as [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené-Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]].

==Date of Afroasiatic==
[[File:Assyriansample.ogg|thumb|right|180px|Speech sample in the Semitic [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Aramaic]] language, a descendant of [[Old Aramaic]]]]
The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html|title=Earliest Egyptian Glyphs - Archaeology Magazine Archive|author=|date=|website=www.archaeology.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] (Naqada II) pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]] (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other [[proto-language]]s.

==Afroasiatic Urheimat==
{{main|Afroasiatic Urheimat}}
[[File:Expansion of Afroasiatic.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing one of the proposed Afroasiatic Urheimat (Eastern Sahara theory.)]]
The term Afroasiatic Urheimat (''Urheimat'' meaning "original homeland" in German) refers to the hypothetical place where [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in [[Western Asia|West Asia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahel]]. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the [[Sahara pump theory|Sahara pump]] operating over the last 10,000 years.

There is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed. The main theories of Urheimat are the Levant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wKT-5SOAKQC&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Quantitative Approaches to Linguistic Diversity: Commemorating the Centenary of the Birth of Morris Swadesh|page=73|isbn=978-9027202659|last1=Wichmann|first1=Søren|last2=Grant|first2=Anthony|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyhvaJq2biEC&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Transition to Modernity: Essays on Power, Wealth and Belief|author=John A.

Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include:
* A set of [[emphatic consonant]]s, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive.
* [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] [[linguistic typology|typology]] with [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] tendencies.
* A two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the sound /t/.
* All Afroasiatic subfamilies show evidence of a [[causative]] affix ''s''.
* Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic support [[possessive suffix]]es.
* [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|Nisba]] derivation in ''-j'' (earlier Egyptian) or ''-ī'' (Semitic)&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Peust,  [http://www.peust.de/2012_afroasiatic.pdf "On the subgrouping of Afroasiatic"], ''LingAeg'' 20 (2012), 221-251 (p. 243).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] in which words inflect by changes within the root (vowel changes or [[gemination]]) as well as with prefixes and suffixes.

One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at the start of this section), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.

According to Ehret (1996), [[tonal language]]s appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic languages. The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not use tones [[phoneme|phonemically]].

'''Amu''' ({{zh|阿母, 阿木}}) is a [[Hanoish languages|Southern]] [[Loloish language]] of [[Mojiang Hani Autonomous County]], [[Yunnan]], China.

Yang Meiqiong (2014) contains a vocabulary and phrase list of Amu transcribed using Hani orthography.

==Distribution==
In Mojiang County, Amu is spoken by a total of 7,050 people in the following townships (Yang &amp; Zhang 2010:9).

*Sinanjiang Township 泗南江乡 (4,001 persons), with more than half of all Amu living in Qian'gang Village 千岗村 and Ganba Village 干坝村 according to Yang (2014:1).
*Longtan Township 龙潭乡 (998 persons)
*Baliu Township 坝溜乡 (945 persons)
*Yayi Township 雅邑乡 (451 persons)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2114">The '''Arnold–Givental conjecture''', named after [[Vladimir Arnold]] and [[Alexander Givental]], is a statement on [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s. It gives a lower bound in terms of the [[Betti number]]s of {{mvar|L}} on the number of intersection points of {{mvar|L}} with a Hamiltonian isotopic Lagrangian submanifold which intersects {{mvar|L}} transversally.

Let {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''C''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M''); 0 ≤ ''t'' ≤ 1}} be a smooth family of [[Hamiltonian function]]s of {{mvar|M}} and denote by {{mvar|φ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} the one-time map of the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{mvar|H&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Let {{mvar|L}} be a Lagrangian submanifold, invariant under some antisymplectic involution of {{mvar|M}}. Assume that {{mvar|L}} and {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;(''L'')}} intersect transversally. Then the number of intersection points of {{mvar|L}} and {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;(''L'')}} can be estimated from below by the sum of the {{math|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} Betti numbers of {{mvar|L}}, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\left | L \cap \varphi_H (L) \right | \geq \sum_{k=0}^n b_k \left (L; \mathbf{Z}_2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Up to now,{{When|date=February 2014}} the Arnold–Givental conjecture could only be proven under some additional assumptions.

'''Bahing''' (ancestor named '''Paiwa, Dungmowa, Rukhusalu, Waripsawa, Timriwa, Dhimriwa, Nayango, Dhayango, Khaliwa/Khaluwa, Rendukpa/Rendu, Rungbu/Rumdali'''&lt;ref&gt;linked to [[Rumjatar]] by Hanßon–Winter 1991&lt;/ref&gt;) is a language spoken by 11,658 people (2011 census) of the [[Bahing|Bahing ethnic group]] in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=NP&amp;seq=20 Detailed language map of eastern Nepal, see language #4 near the map's north/south center and about 2/3 of the way from east to west]&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the family of [[Kiranti languages]], a subgroup of [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]].

The group Rumdali is also known as Nechali among some of them.

==Names==
''Ethnologue'' lists the following alternate names for Bahing: Baying, Bayung, Ikke lo, Kiranti-Bayung, Pai Lo, Radu lo.

==Geographical distribution==
Bahing is spoken in the following locations of Nepal (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

*Northeastern [[Okhaldhunga District]], [[Sagarmatha Zone]]: [[Harkapur]], [[Rajadip|Ragdip]], [[Bigutar]], [[Baraneshwar|Baruneswor]], [[Okhaldhunga]], [[Rumjatar]], [[Barnalu]], [[Mamkha]], [[Ratmate]], [[Serna]], [[Diyale]], and [[Bhadaure, Sagarmatha|Bhadaure]] VDC's (''Rumdali dialect'')
*Mid-southeastern [[Okhaldhunga District]]: [[Ketuke]], [[Moli]], [[Baksa, Nepal|Waksa]], and [[Ubu, Nepal|Ubu]] VDC's (''Tolocha dialect'')
*Southern tip of [[Solukhumbu District]]: [[Necha Batase]] and [[Salyan, Solukhumbu|Salyan]] VDC's
*[[Khotang District]]

==Dialects==
According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', Bahing consists of the Rumdali, Nechali, Tolacha, Moblocha, and Hangu dialects, with 85% or above intelligibility among all dialects. Rumdali is best understood by the most people.

==Documentation==
The Bahing language was described by [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]] (1857, 1858) as having a very complex verbal morphology. By the 1970s, only vestiges were left, making Bahing a case study of grammatical attrition and language death.

==Phonology==
Bahing and the related [[Khaling language]] have synchronic ten-vowel systems.&lt;!--broken link [http://www.iias.nl/host/himalaya/conferences/hls/1st_abstracts/mic.html--&gt; The difference of {{IPA|[mərə]}} "monkey" vs. {{IPA|[mɯrɯ]}} "human being" is difficult to perceive for speakers of even neighboring dialects, which makes for "an unlimited source of fun to the Bahing people" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20090214091840/http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/deboer01evolvingSound.html de Boer 2002] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080704143113/http://www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~junwang4/langev/localcopy/pdf/deboer01evolvingSound.pdf PDF]).

==Morphology==
Hodgson (1857) reported a [[Grammatical voice#The middle voice|middle voice]] formed by a suffix ''-s(i)'' added  to the verbal stem, corresponding to reflexives in other [[Kiranti]] languages ([http://www.opgenort.nl/jropgenort.lectures.php Opgenort.nl]).

The '''Bolyu language''' ([[Endonym|autonym]]: ''{{IPA|pɔ˧lju˩˧}}''; {{zh|巴琉语, 布流语}}; also known as '''Paliu''', '''Palyu''', or '''Lai''' 俫语, 徕语) is an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language of the [[Pakanic languages|Pakanic]] branch (Sidwell 1995). The [[Bolyu]] are among the [[unrecognized ethnic groups of China]]. In 1984, Bolyu was first studied by Liang Min of the Nationalities Research Institute in [[Beijing]]. Liang was the first to suggest the Mon–Khmer affiliation of Bolyu, which was later confirmed by Western linguists such as [[Paul K. Benedict]], [[Paul Sidwell]], and [[Jerold A. Edmondson]].

==Classification==
Bolyu is related to the [[Bugan language]], forming the [[Pakanic languages|Pakanic branch]] along with it. However, the place of the Pakanic branch within the Mon–Khmer family is uncertain. Sidwell (1995) suggests that the Pakanic branch may be an Eastern Mon–Khmer branch, thus making it most closely related to the [[Vietic languages|Vietic branch]]. However, Gérard Diffloth classifies Pakanic as Northern Mon–Khmer, making it most closely related to the [[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]] branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lc.mahidol.ac.th/Documents/Publication/MKS/37/vandriem2007austroasiatic.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809095425/http://www.lc.mahidol.ac.th/Documents/Publication/MKS/37/vandriem2007austroasiatic.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Bolyu speakers are found in the following locations in [[southern China]] (Edmondson 1995).&lt;ref&gt;俫语使用人口稳定增长原因探究。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Xulian [李旭练]. 1999. ''A Study of Lai (Bolyu)'' [倈语硏究]. Beijing: Minzu University Press [中央民族大学出版社].&lt;/ref&gt;

*Douhong 斗烘屯, Xinhe 新合村, Changfa township 长发, [[Longlin County]], [[Guangxi]] (often living with [[Gelao people|Gelao]] neighbors).

Li (1999) documents the Bolyu variety of Muzitun 亩子屯, Xinhe Village 新合村, Changfa Township 长发乡, [[Longlin County]], [[Guangxi]].

In the following villages, only elderly speakers of Bolyu remain.
*Zhelang township 者浪乡: Zhezhai 者寨、Langrong 郎荣、Linghao 岭好
*Kechang township 克场乡: Haichang 海长
*Shechang township 蛇场乡: Daguo 达果

1,400 Bolyu reside in Guangxi, and over 1,000 in Yunnan.&lt;ref name="gx"/&gt;

==Phonology==
Bolyu is a monosyllabic tonal language like the surrounding [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]], [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]] and even [[Vietic languages]]. Unlike Bugan, Bolyu does not have a tense–lax voice quality distinction.

'''''Cocacolonization''''' (alternatively '''''coca-colonization''''') refers to the [[globalization]] of American culture (also referred as to as [[Americanization]]) pushed through popular American products such as soft drink maker [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Viewpoints; A Brief History of Coca-Colonization|last = Pendergrast|first = Mark|date = 1993|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[portmanteau]] of the name of the multinational soft drink maker and "colonization": a process of change that happens everywhere the culture of [[capitalism]] takes root.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Coca-Colonization and the Cold War: The Cultural Mission of the United States in Austria After the Second World War|last = Wagnleitner|first = Reinhold|publisher = The University of North Carolina Press|year = 1994|isbn = 978-0-8078-4455-7|location = Chapel Hill, NC|pages = Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first documented in 1949 in [[France]], where the French Communist Party strongly opposed the further expansion of Coca-Cola.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=|oclc=907585907|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}} In 1948, the finance ministry stood against Coke on the grounds that its operation would bring no capital to help with French recovery, and was likely to drain profits back to the parent company in the United States.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|106}} The French Communist Party also warned that the Coke distribution system would double as an espionage network.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|107}}

In [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]], many outside of the United States associated Coca-Cola with American culture. With ties to the culture of the United States, select Europeans rejected attempts to cocacolonize their nations. It represented an invasion of their nationalistic identities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Coca-Colonization: The Exportation of "America" to Europe Following World War II|last = Gordon|first = Matthew|date = 2011|journal = HubPages|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Europe]], Coca-Cola was not just a carbonated refreshment, but bottled America.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By the end of the Cold War, American ideals were spread across the world by Coke and in certain cases, to combat [[Communism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cocacolonization as a historical concept gained visibility in the European Americanization debate with the 1994 publication of [[:de:Reinhold Wagnleitner|Reinhold Wagnleitner]]'s book, ''Coca-Colonization and the Cold War: The Cultural Mission of the United States in Austria After the Second World War''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Wagnleitner used cocacolonization to embody the premise of his book: America attempted [[cultural imperialism]] by expanding American ideals through the spread of consumer goods such as Coca-Cola and [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi]] jeans and through cultural symbols like [[Rock and roll]] and [[Marlon Brando]]'s black leather jacket, as well as through the promotion of [[democracy]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The expression is also used in medical literature, to describe the lifestyle changes and the associated increase of incidence of characteristic chronic diseases, e.g. [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Coca-colonization of diets in the Yucatan|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953604004587|journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine|date = 2005-08-01|pages = 833–846|volume = 61|series = The Social Production of Health: Critical Contributions from Evolutionary, Biological and Cultural Anthropology: Papers in Memory of Arthur J.

== History ==
Cocacolonization began at the beginning of World War II and still exists as of 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Over time, some countries resisted the American soft drink while others openly accepted it. To all, it represented America and her culture and at a majority of major historical events during the twentieth century, Coke was in attendance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

“Although the brand dates back to the late 1880s, the basic brand proposition - Coca-Cola satisfies, Coca-Cola is a delightful, refreshing beverage - has remained virtually unchanged, as has the brand name and its distinctive logo.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Slater, J. S. (2001). Collecting brand loyalty: A comparative analysis of how Coca-Cola and Hallmark use collecting behavior to enhance brand loyalty. ''ACR North American Advances''.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the Coca-Cola continues today: “The brand is seen as traditional, patriotic, friendly, and American.”&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== World War II ===
When war broke out and American troops were sent overseas, the Coca-Cola company vowed that any American in uniform should be able to get a Coke for five cents wherever they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coke and the U.S. troops|url = http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/2008/11/coke-and-the-us/|website = The Coca-Cola Company|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the company built bottling stations in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]] and on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western front]].
[[File:Vintage Coca-Cola Vending Machines 2.jpg|thumb|Vintage Coca-Cola vending machines from World War II. They resemble the machines spread out throughout the Pacific front.]]
[[Germans]] recognized Coke to be a "Jewish-American" drink. In response, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime only allowed Coke in the country if it displayed a [[swastika]] on the bottle, which it did.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the [[Soviet Union]], war hero Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov|Georgi Zhukov]] loved the drink, but Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] viewed it as an American [[Imperialism|imperialist]] symbol. As a solution, Coca-Cola developed a clear version of the drink bottled with a white cap and red star to not appear like the well-known American drink.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the Pacific front of the war, Coke had a tough time reaching the troops. To address the issue, the company created portable soda fountains that were distributed throughout the islands on the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = On the Front Lines with Coca Cola Pt II|url = http://envisioningtheamericandream.com/2013/05/30/on-the-front-lines-with-coca-cola-pt-ii/|website = Envisioning The American Dream|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian countries experienced Coca-Cola. According to the company, the drink spread throughout the islands because, "Coke symbolized the American way of life."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Throughout the war, Coke dispersed ads for their soda all over the world. The majority of the ads displayed an American soldier drinking a soda with the natives of that country.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the ad was in a country outside of the United States, it was written in the native language of that country. Popular ads had positive images of Americans with Coke in [[New Zealand]], Russia, the [[Philippines]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Italy]], [[England]], and in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Coca-Cola, "From the jungles of the Admiral Islands to the officer clubs in the [[Italian Riviera|Riviera]]," Coke and America was there.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Late 1940s and the Cold War ===
The end of World War II marked widespread cocacolonization of Europe and [[Asia]]. In 1947, Coca-Cola bottling operations began in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[Luxembourg]]; then [[Switzerland]], Italy, and France by 1949.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Author Mark Gordon said, "American ideals were now being pushed on Europeans every time they sipped a bottle of Coke."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By the early 1950s, there were 63 bottling plants expanding across three continents including the countries of: [[Egypt]], [[Iceland]], [[Iran]], [[West Africa]], and [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many US companies benefitted from expansion into Europe, including Coca-Cola. Through these foreign endeavours, the US was able to informally create a business and corporate empire via the expansion of several US companies.&lt;ref&gt;Wagnleitner, R. (2000). ''Coca-colonization and the Cold War: the cultural mission of the United States in Austria after the Second World War''. Univ of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coca-Cola does Chinese New Year.jpg|thumb|The Coca-Cola store in China helping to celebrate the New Year.]]
By the time of the Cold War, Coke met resistance in some countries. Italians kept from indulging in the soda.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Austrians]] recognized the expansion of the company as an attempt to spread American culture and ideals overseas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In France, French communists spread awareness about Coca-Cola. They coined the term cocacolonization because they saw the spread of Coke in their country as an attempt to make it an American colony.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uramericansinparis.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/coca-colonisation-anti-american-sentiment-in-france/|title=Coca-Colonisation: Anti-American Sentiment in France|last=Long|first=Brennan|website=Americans in Paris, Fall 2010|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the company attempted to open a bottling plant in the country, French Communists threatened to barricade [[Paris]] to keep Coke out.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coca Cola in Paris: A Changing France|url = https://uramericansinparis.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/coca-cola-in-france/|website = Americans in Paris, Fall 2010|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the French, the company represented [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] America.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

At the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the end of Communism in Germany in November 1989, Coca-Cola handed out sodas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Significance ==

=== Health factors ===
Medical experts use the term cocacolonization in their medical journals representing the spread of unhealthy American foods overseas.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A significant shift in nutrition has occurred. Developed nations export processed foods that are high in saturated fats to developing nations, causing a change from previous methods of survival such as hunting and gathering.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Zimmet, P. (2000). Globalization, coca‐colonization and the chronic disease epidemic: can the Doomsday scenario be averted?. ''Journal of Internal Medicine'', ''247''(3), 301-310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocacolonization has been linked to the spike in Type 2 Diabetes , obesity, and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases because of the connection between economic situation and low costs of high fat foods.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Due to an increase in tourism in their area, the Mayan tribe in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] experienced a decline in health because they were introduced to unhealthy American foods. They became increasingly dependent on the foods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Similarly, the Tz'utujill tribe in Guatemala was also introduced to the same food and encountered the same decline in health lead.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Worldwide, type 2 diabetes spread and steadily increased over the past 20 years. The explanation for their decline in health: cocacolonization.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Widespread ===

As of 2015, Coca-Cola has been distributed to over 200 countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlzn0JOqGDU|title = Globalization of Coca Cola|last = Wallace|first = Kristin|date = 2012|work = Video|access-date = |via = |last2 = Koch|first2 = Jillian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the many countries consist of [[China]], [[Guatemala]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Algeria]], and [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cultureunplugged.com/documentary/watch-online/play/10791/The-Cola-Conquest--Part-III--Coca-Colonization|title = The Cola Conquest, Part III: Coca-Colonization|last = Angelico|first = Irene|date = 1998|work = Documentary|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the company, "Coca-Cola is the second-most understood term in the world behind "okay."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Coca-Cola as a product has stretched across international borders to create a brand. “In much political, academic and conversational rhetoric the term Coca-Cola comes to stand, not just for a particular soft drink, but also for the problematic nature of commodities in general. It is a meta-commodity. … It may stand for commodities or capitalism, but equally Imperialism or Americanization.”&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Miller, D. (1998). Coca-Cola: a black sweet drink from Trinidad. ''Material cultures: Why some things matter'', 169-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Cocacolonization as referring to the spread of American culture and/or brands; Coca-Cola is an example of the widespread infrastructure of westernized capitalism and consumerism.

Coca-Cola operates via franchises,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; therefore for areas to benefit from its production local bottling plants are required. Trinidad obtained the franchise in 1939, so in Trinidad Coke was bottled by the firm of Cannings - which like other older colonial firms was taken over, in Cannings case in 1975.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In Trinidad sweet drinks are not viewed as luxury items but instead as everyday items of the common man.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In relation to Coca-Cola, “the centrality of the black sweet drink to Trinidadian drinking is above all summed up in the notion of a “rum and Coke” as the core alcoholic drink for most people of the island.”&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Having a common drink that requires the existence of an exact sweet drink emphasizes its hold on the local environment.

The seven days of the week, the fifty United States, the eight Hawaiian islands, the letters in the alphabet, the categories "male" and "female," the students in a class, or the flavors on offer at an ice cream store are all examples of contrast sets.

Contrast sets may be relatively natural in origin (such as the eight Hawaiian islands) or relatively conventional (such as the fifty United States). The mastery of certain conventional contrast sets is essential to basic socialization: for example, calendrical units, [[musical notes]], and elements of writing systems like [[Numeral system|numerals]] and the [[alphabet]]. These contrast sets frequently become the subject of [[synesthesia]]s.

[[Linguistic anthropology|Linguistic anthropologists]] [[Harold Conklin]] and [[Charles Frake]] were the first to work out the concept of the contrast set in the 1950s, and the concept was described in detail in Frake's article "The ethnographic study of cognitive systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles O. |last=Frake |chapter=The Ethnographic Study of Cognitive Systems |pages=28–41 |title=Cognitive Anthropology |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Tyler |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1969 |isbn=0-03-073255-7 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6aAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Doukhobor]]s''' are a Spiritual Christians (folk Protestants) from Russia who in 1899 established a number of [[commune (intentional community)|commune]]-style settlements in Western [[Canada]]. They have brought with them a [[Southern Russian dialects|Southern Russian dialect]] of their communities of origin, which over the following decades underwent some changes under the influence of the Canadian English environment and the speech of the Ukrainian settlers in [[Saskatchewan]].

Over several generations, this dialect has been mostly lost, as the modern descendants of the original Doukhobor migrants to Canada are typically native English speakers, and when they do speak Russian, it is typically a fairly standard variety of it.

== Linguistic history of the Doukhobors ==
It is reasonable to assume that the formative period for the speech of the Doukhobors was the first four decades of the 19th century.  It was in 1802 that the Doukhobors, as well as the members of Russia's other dissenter Christian groups, were encouraged to migrate to the [[Molochna River]] region, around [[Melitopol]] near [[Ukraine]]'s [[Sea of Azov]] coast. Over the next 10–20 years, the Doukhobor, [[Molokan]], and other settlers, speaking a variety of mostly  [[Southern Russian dialects]] arrived to the Molochna from several provinces located, primarily, in what is today eastern Ukraine and south-central Russia.&lt;ref&gt;See J.J. Kalmakoff's map, "Doukhobor Resettlement to Tavria" (Doukhobor Genealogy Website).&lt;/ref&gt; In the settlers' villages an opportunity thus arose for the formation of a certain [[Koiné language|dialect koiné]], based on Southern Russian and Eastern Ukrainian dialects.

Starting in 1841, the Doukhobors (as well as Molokans and certain other dissenters) were resettled from southern Ukraine to [[Transcaucasia]], where they founded a number of villages surrounded by mostly non-Russian speaking neighbors (primarily [[Azerbaijanis]] in [[Elisabethpol Governorate]], [[Armenians]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tiflis Governorate]] was in Georgia, it is ethnic Armenians who  populated its [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]] area, where the Doukhobor villages were&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Tiflis Governorate]], and likely a mix of both in the later (post-1878) settlements in [[Kars Oblast]]). These conditions allowed the dialect to develop in comparative isolation from the "mainstream" Russian.

With the migration of some 7,500 Doukhbors from Transcaucasia to Saskatchewan in 1899, and some smaller latecomer groups (both from Transcaucasia and from places of exile in Siberia and elsewhere), the dialect spoken in the Doukhobor villages of [[Transcaucasia]] was brought to the plains of [[Canada]]. From that point on it experienced influence from the [[Canadian English|English language of Canada]] and, during the years of Doukhobor stay in Saskatchewan, the speech of Doukhobor's [[Canadian Ukrainian|Ukrainian neighbors]].

A split in the Doukhobor community resulted in a large number of Doukhobors moving from Saskatchewan to south-eastern [[British Columbia]] around 1910. Those who moved (the so-called "Community Doukhobors" – followers of [[Peter Vasilevich Verigin|Peter Verigin]]'s [[Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood]] – continued living a communal lifestyle for several more decades, and had a better chance to preserve the Russian language than the "Independent Doukhobors", who stayed in Saskatchewan as individual farmers.

By the 1970s, as most Russia-born members of the community died, English became the first language of the great majority of Canadian Doukhobors.&lt;ref name=postnikoff&gt;Dr. John I. Postnikoff [http://www.doukhobor.org/postnikoff.html Doukhobors: An Endangered Species] MIR magazine, No. 16 (Grand Forks, BC: MIR Publication Society, May 1978) (Doukhobor Genealogy Website).&lt;/ref&gt; Their English speech is not noticeably different from that of other English-speaking Canadians of their provinces.  Russian still remains in use, at least for religious use among those who do practise the Doukhobor religion. However, practising Doukhobors are a shrinking group, with only some 3,800 persons in Canada identifying themselves as members of the Doukhobor religion as of the [[Canada 2001 Census]].

== Features of the Doukhobor Russian dialect in Canada ==
According to Gunter Schaarschmidt's survey article ("Four norms..."), research into the Russian spoken by Canada's Doukhobors has not been extensive. However, a number of articles, mostly published in the 1960s and 1970s, noted a variety of features in Doukhobors' Russian speech that were indeed characteristic of Southern, and in some cases [[Central Russian dialects]],  e.g. use of the Southern [h] where Standard Russian has [g].

Features characteristic of a number of locales in the [[East Slavic Languages|East Slavic]] language space were noted as well, reflecting perhaps the heterogeneous origin of the Doukhobors' settlements in [[Molochna River]] after 1800, e.g., similarly to [[Belarusians]], Doukhobor speakers don't palatalize [r] in "редко" (''redko'', 'seldom'). Remarkable was the dropping of the final -t in the 3rd person singular form of verbs. This can be considered a Ukrainian feature, and it is also attested in some Russian dialects spoken in Southern Ukraine (e.g., [[Mykolaiv Oblast|Nikolaev]], not too far from the Doukhobors' old homeland on the Molochna).

As with other immigrant groups, the Russian speech of the Doukhobors uses English loanwords for some concepts that they had not encountered until moving to Canada.

'''Echo suppression''' and '''echo cancellation''' are methods used in [[telephony]] to improve voice quality by preventing [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] from being created or removing it after it is already present. In addition to improving subjective audio quality, echo suppression increases the capacity achieved through [[silence suppression]] by preventing echo from traveling across a  [[telecommunications network|network]]. Echo suppressors were developed in the 1950s in response to the first use of satellites for telecommunications, but they have since been largely supplanted by better performing echo cancellers.

Echo suppression and cancellation methods are commonly called '''acoustic echo suppression''' ('''AES''') and '''acoustic echo cancellation''' ('''AEC'''), and more rarely '''line echo cancellation''' (LEC). In some cases, these terms are more precise, as there are various types and causes of echo with unique characteristics, including acoustic echo (sounds from a loudspeaker being reflected and recorded by a microphone, which can vary substantially over time) and line echo (electrical impulses caused by, e.g., coupling between the sending and receiving wires, impedance mismatches, electrical reflections, etc.,&lt;ref name="octasic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octasic.com/technology/voice-quality-enhancement-echo-cancellation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821193713/http://www.octasic.com/technology/voice-quality-enhancement-echo-cancellation |archivedate=2014-08-21 |title=Octasic: Voice Quality Enhancement &amp; Echo Cancellation |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which varies much less than acoustic echo). In practice, however, the same techniques are used to treat all types of echo, so an acoustic echo canceller can cancel line echo as well as acoustic echo.  ''AEC'' in particular is commonly used to refer to echo cancelers in general, regardless of whether they were intended for acoustic echo, line echo, or both.

Although echo suppressors and echo cancellers have similar goals&amp;mdash;preventing a speaking individual from hearing an echo of their own voice&amp;mdash;the methods they use are different:
* Echo suppressors work by [[Voice activity detection|detecting a voice signal]] going in one direction on a circuit, and then muting or attenuating the signal in other direction. Usually the echo suppressor at the far end of the circuit does this muting when it detects voice coming from the near-end of the circuit. This muting prevents the speaker from hearing their own voice returning from the far end.
* Echo cancellation involves first recognizing the originally transmitted signal that re-appears, with some delay, in the transmitted or received signal. Once the echo is recognized, it can be removed by subtracting it from the transmitted or received signal. This technique is generally implemented digitally using a [[digital signal processor]] or [[software]], although it can be implemented in analog circuits as well.&lt;ref name="eneroth"&gt;{{cite thesis| last=Eneroth |first=Peter |title=Stereophonic Acoustic Echo Cancellation: Theory and Implementation |publisher=Lund University |year=2001 |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=41259&amp;fileOId=1001945 |format=PDF |issn=1402-8662 |isbn=91-7874-110-6 |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;!-- http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/41259 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

ITU standards [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.168/en G.168] and [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.340/en P.340] describe requirements and tests for echo cancellers in digital and [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] applications, respectively.

== History ==
In [[telephony]], echo is the reflected copy of one's voice heard some time later. If the delay is fairly significant (more than a few hundred milliseconds), it is considered annoying. If the delay is very small (10s of milliseconds or less&lt;ref name="tmcnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/news/2006/01/27/1320637.htm |title=Echo in Voice over IP Systems |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the phenomenon is called [[sidetone]]. If the delay is slightly longer, around 50 milliseconds, humans cannot hear the echo as a distinct sound, but instead hear a [[chorus effect]].&lt;ref name="tmcnet" /&gt;

In the earlier days of telecommunications, echo suppression was used to reduce the objectionable nature of echos to human users. One person speaks while the other listens, and they speak back and forth. An echo suppressor attempts to determine which is the primary direction and allows that channel to go forward. In the reverse channel, it places [[attenuation]] to block or ''suppress'' any signal on the assumption that the signal is echo. Although the suppressor effectively deals with echo, this approach leads to several problems which may be frustrating for both parties to a call.
* [[Double-talk (telephony)|Double-talk]]: It is fairly normal in conversation for both parties to speak at the same time, at least briefly.  Because each echo suppressor will then detect voice energy coming from the far-end of the circuit, the effect would ordinarily be for loss to be inserted in both directions at once, effectively blocking both parties.  To prevent this, echo suppressors can be set to detect voice activity from the near-end speaker and to fail to insert loss (or insert a smaller loss) when both the near-end speaker and far-end speaker are talking.  This, of course, temporarily defeats the primary effect of having an echo suppressor at all.
* Clipping: Since the echo suppressor is alternately inserting and removing loss, there is frequently a small delay when a new speaker begins talking that results in clipping the first syllable from that speaker's speech. {{Further|Voice activity detection#Performance evaluation}}
* Dead-set: If the far-end party on a call is in a noisy environment, the near-end speaker will hear that background noise while the far-end speaker is talking, but the echo suppressor will suppress this background noise when the near-end speaker starts talking.  The sudden absence of the background noise gives the near-end user the impression that the line has gone dead.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

In response to this, [[AT&amp;T]] [[Bell Labs]] developed echo canceler theory in the early 1960s,&lt;ref name="sondhi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sondhi |first=Man Mohan |title=An adaptive echo canceler |journal=Bell System Technical Journal |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=497–511 |date=March 1967 |doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1967.tb04231.x |url=http://www3.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol46-1967/articles/bstj46-3-497.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416031355/http://www3.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol46-1967/articles/bstj46-3-497.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-16 |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell patent"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|3500000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then resulted in laboratory echo cancelers in the late 1960s and commercial echo cancelers in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="murano"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murano |first1=Kazuo |last2=Unagami |first2=Shigeyuki |last3=Amano |first3=Fumio |title=Echo Cancellation and Applications |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=49–55 |date=January 1990 |doi=10.1109/35.46671 |issn=0163-6804 |url=http://www.ece.rochester.edu/courses/ECE472/resources/Papers/Murano_1990.pdf |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an echo canceller is to synthesize an estimate of the echo from the talker's signal, and subtract that synthesis from the return path instead of switching attenuation into/out of the path. This technique requires [[Adaptive filter|adaptive signal processing]] to generate a signal accurate enough to effectively cancel the echo, where the echo can differ from the original due to various kinds of degradation along the way.

Rapid advances in the implementation of [[digital signal processing]] allowed echo cancellers to be made smaller and more cost-effective.  In the 1990s, echo cancellers were implemented within [[Telephone switch|voice switches]] for the first time (in the [[Northern Telecom]] [[DMS-100|DMS-250]]) rather than as standalone devices.  The integration of echo cancellation directly into the switch meant that echo cancellers could be reliably turned on or off on a call-by-call basis, removing the need for separate trunk groups for voice and data calls.  Today's telephony technology often employs echo cancellers in small or handheld communications devices via a software [[voice engine]], which provides cancellation of either acoustic echo or the residual echo introduced by a far-end PSTN gateway system; such systems typically cancel echo reflections with up to 64 milliseconds delay.

Since invention at AT&amp;T Bell Labs&lt;ref name="Bell patent"/&gt; echo cancellation algorithms have been improved and honed. Like all echo cancelling processes, these first algorithms were designed to anticipate the signal which would inevitably re-enter the transmission path, and cancel it out.

==Operation==
[[File:Telephone Echo Canceller.png|thumb|400px| An adaptive echo canceler for a telephone circuit.  The function of '''H''', the [[Telephone hybrid|hybrid transformer]], is to route incoming speech from the far end ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to the local telephone and route speech from the telephone to the far end. However, the hybrid is never perfect, so its output ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; contains both the desired speech from the local telephone plus filtered speech from the far end. The echo canceller is the adaptive filter ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, which attempts to minimize the error signal ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; by filtering the incoming far end speech into a replica ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of the far end speech that leaks through the hybrid. Once the adaption is complete, the error signal consists mostly of speech from the local telephone.]]

The acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) process works as follows:

# A far-end signal is delivered to the system.
# The far-end signal is reproduced.
# The far-end signal is filtered and delayed to resemble the near-end signal.
# The filtered far-end signal is subtracted from the near-end signal.
# The resultant signal represents sounds present in the room excluding any direct or reverberated sound.

The primary challenge for an echo canceller is determining the nature of the filtering to be applied to the far-end signal such that it resembles the resultant near-end signal. The filter is essentially a model of speaker, microphone and the room's acoustical attributes. Echo cancellers must be adaptive because the characteristics of the near-end's speaker and microphone are generally not known in advance. The acoustical attributes of the near-end's room are also not generally known in advance, and may change (e.g., if the microphone is moved relative to the speaker, or if individuals walk around the room causing changes in the acoustic reflections).&lt;ref name="eneroth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ahgren"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Åhgren |first=Per |date=November 2005 |title=Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Doubletalk Detection Using Estimated Loudspeaker Impulse Responses |url=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/research/projects/echo-detection/Acoustic%20Echo%20Cancellation%20and%20Doubletalk%20Detection.pdf |journal=IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=1231–1237 |doi=10.1109/TSA.2005.851995}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using the far-end signal as the stimulus, modern systems use an [[adaptive filter]] and can 'converge' from nothing to 55&amp;nbsp;dB of cancellation in around 200&amp;nbsp;ms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Until recently echo cancellation only needed to apply to the voice bandwidth of telephone circuits. [[PSTN]] calls transmit frequencies between 300&amp;nbsp;Hz and 3&amp;nbsp;kHz, the range required for human speech intelligibility. [[Videoconferencing]] is one area where full bandwidth audio is transceived. In this case, specialised products are employed to perform echo cancellation.

Echo suppression may have the side-effect of removing valid signals from the transmission. This can cause audible signal loss that is called "clipping" in telephony, but the effect is more like a "[[squelch]]" than amplitude [[clipping (signal processing)|clipping]]. In an ideal situation then, echo cancellation alone will be used. However this is insufficient in many applications, notably software phones on networks with long delay and meager throughput. Here, echo cancellation and suppression can work in conjunction to achieve acceptable performance.

===Quantifying echo===
Echo is measured as '''{{visible anchor|echo return loss}}''' (ERL). This is the difference in signal strength between the original far-end signal and the echo of that signal transmitted as the output of the near-end, expressed in [[decibels]].&lt;ref name="hp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c02602320 |title=HP NBX - What is Echo Return Loss (ERL) and how does it affect voice quality? |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ERL is the amount of [[signal loss]] applied to the original far-end signal that returns as echo. High values mean the echo is very weak, while low or negative values mean the echo is very strong (negative values would mean the echo is stronger than the original signal which was put in, which if left unchecked would cause [[feedback]]).

The performance of an echo canceller is measured in ''echo return loss enhancement'' (ERLE),&lt;ref name="tmcnet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cisco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/solutions_docs/voip_solutions/EA_ISD.html |title=Echo Analysis for Voice over IP |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the amount of additional signal loss applied by the echo canceller. Most echo cancellers are able to apply 18 to 35&amp;nbsp;dB ERLE.

The total signal loss of the echo (ACOM) is the sum of the ERL and ERLE.&lt;ref name="cisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eetimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1277615 |title=Echo Cancellation Part 1: The Basics and Acoustic Echo Cancellation |last1=Kosanovic |first1=Bogdan |accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current uses ==
Voice messaging and voice response systems which accept speech for caller input use echo cancellation while speech prompts are played to prevent the systems own speech recognition from falsely recognizing the echoed prompts.

Examples of echo are found in everyday surroundings such as:
* Hands-free car phone systems
* A standard telephone or cellphone in [[speakerphone]] or hands-free mode
* Dedicated standalone "conference phones"
* Installed room systems which use ceiling speakers and microphones on the table
* Physical coupling (vibrations of the [[loudspeaker]] transfer to the microphone via the handset casing)

In most of these cases, direct sound from the loudspeaker (not the person at the far end, otherwise referred to as the Talker) enters the microphone almost unaltered. The difficulties in cancelling echo stem from the alteration of the original sound by the ambient space. These changes can include certain frequencies being absorbed by soft furnishings, and reflection of different frequencies at varying strength.

In modern times, the main use of an AES (over an AEC) lies in the [[VoIP]] sector. This is primarily because AECs require a fast processor, usually in the form of a [[digital signal processor]] (DSP). For the PC market, and especially for the embedded VoIP market, this cost in MHz comes at a premium. This said, many (embedded) VoIP solutions do have a fully functional AEC.

===Modems===
Echo control on voice-frequency data calls that use [[dial-up modem]]s may cause data corruption. Some telephone devices disable echo suppression or echo cancellation when they detect the 2100 or 2225&amp;nbsp;Hz "answer" tones associated with such calls, in accordance with [[ITU-T]] recommendation [[G.164]] or [[G.165]].

In the 1990s most echo cancellation was done inside [[modem]]s of type [[v.32]] and later.  In voiceband modems this allowed using the same frequencies in both directions simultaneously, greatly increasing the data rate.  As part of connection negotiation, each modem sent line probe signals, measured the echoes, and set up its delay lines.  Echoes in this case did not include long echoes caused by acoustic coupling, but did include short echoes caused by impedance mismatches in the 2-wire [[local loop]] to the [[telephone exchange]].

After the turn of the century, [[DSL modem]]s also made extensive use of automated echo cancellation.  Though they used separate incoming and outgoing frequencies, these frequencies were beyond the voiceband for which the cables were designed, and often suffered [[attenuation distortion]] due to [[bridge tap]]s and incomplete [[impedance matching]].  Deep, narrow frequency gaps often resulted, that could not be made usable by echo cancellation.  These were detected and mapped out during connection negotiation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5445">'''''First fix''''' and '''''second fix''''' are terms used in the UK and Irish [[construction|housebuilding]] and commercial building construction industry.

''First fix'' comprises all the work needed to take a [[building]] from [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] to putting [[plaster]] on the internal [[wall]]s. This includes constructing walls, [[floor]]s and [[ceiling]]s, and inserting [[Electrical cable|cables]] for [[mains electricity|electrical supply]] and [[water pipe|pipes]] for [[water supply]].

Some argue that First Fix starts after the shell of the building is complete, and ends when the walls are plastered. Here is a list, in no particular order, of the elements of First Fix.
* 1.	Drain runs: must be downhill and straight
* 2.	Spare conduits: draw strings
* 3.	Soil Pipes
* 4.	Copper pipes
* 5.	MVHR runs
* 6.	Hep2O piping (or other plastic piping)
* 7.	Electrical backing boxes
* 8.	Electricity cable runs
* 9.	Data and Audio visual: printer, HDMI cables, speaker cables
* 10.	Telephony
* 11.	Socket location
* 12.	Security
* 13.	Fire alarm
* 14.	Normal pipes
* 15.	Door bell
* 16.	Door frames
* 17.	Pocket door frames
* 18.	Stair well: floating / cantilevered?
* 19.	Sound insulation
* 22.	Plaster Boarding

The list is not exhaustive. &lt;ref&gt;There is a wider discussion of the issue here&lt;/ref&gt;

''Second fix'' comprises all the work after the plastering of a finished house. Electrical fixtures are connected to the cables, [[sink]]s and [[bathtub|baths]] connected to the pipes, and [[door]]s fitted into doorframes. Second fix work requires a neater finish than first fix.

The division of work is a convenient description because [[electrician]]s, [[plumber]]s and [[carpenter]]s will probably have to make two separate visits to one property under construction, at separate times. [[Project manager]]s can report "first fix complete" or "second fix 50% done" and others can understand.

Some construction companies specialise in first fix work or second fix work, but most do both.

In North America, terms such as '''roughing in''' and '''finishing''' or '''rough-in''' and '''finish work''' are often heard, referring to similar concepts. Another related set of terms is '''outside work''' and '''inside work''' (the building is closed to the weather when the latter occurs). Carpenters speak of '''rough work''' and '''trim work''' (or framing versus trimming), and other fields have analogues, such as [[machining]] (roughing versus finishing cuts) and communications (rough [[draft document|draft]] versus revised draft).

== Electrical installations and "third fixes" ==

Electrical installations can be further divided into first, second and third fixes:&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jack (2007). ''The Streetwise Subbie: How to Survive the Contracts Jungle''. 3rd ed. Oxford: Newnes. {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8061-5}}. App. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

* First Fix:    Positioning and securing of accessory boxes
* Second Fix:   Preparation and positioning of cables
* Third Fix:    Termination of conductors to accessories and protective devices

As modern society's reliance on technology increases, the need to properly house sensitive electronic equipment becomes a greater concern.  The installation of this equipment takes place in the "third fix" segment of a construction project.  It is especially important that installation of sensitive electronic equipment be installed only when a construction site is dust-controlled and prepared for what would be considered "dust free" conditions.  For example, for the modern computer [[server room]], equipment would be installed only when dust and atmospheric conditions are minimized and controlled.  Similar to the atmospheric needs of medical and scientific research laboratories, the production sensitive computer chip technology is undertaken in a [[cleanroom]] atmosphere where low levels of environmental pollutants such as dust and airborne microbes are controlled and most preferably eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/inside-a-state-of-the-art-cleanroom/?pid=629&amp;viewall=true |title= A Chip Is Born:Inside a State-of-the-Art Clean Room |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 19, 2010 | first1=Dylan | last1=Tweney |first2=Jonathan | last2=Snyder }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK national building specifications, British Standard 5295:1989, specifically addresses "clean room" environments serving electronics manufacturers, as well as the pharmaceutical industry (the Pharmaceutical Industry has, for some time, worked to the ISO standard 14644 which is subtly different).  Standard 5295:1989 specifically pertains to constructed interior spaces where higher than normal environmental standards must be maintained, in order to control particulate contamination, temperature and humidity.  It is only at the third fix stage, when building site conditions are rendered virtually ''dust free'', so as to minimize the introduction, generation and retention of particles which may contaminate equipment serving the electronics and pharmaceuticals manufacturing process, that the build-out of "clean room" spaces can commence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saa.gov.uk/resources/148164/clean_rooms_pn_no5.pdf |title= Industrial Committee Practice Note 5, Reevaluation 2005, Valuation of Subjects Containing Clean Rooms. |publisher= Scottish Assessors Association |date=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Handwriting-Marlowe-Massacre-1.JPG|right|thumb|A sheet of what some consider to be [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s foul papers. It contains lines from his play, ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' (1593). Reproduced from Folger Shakespeare Library Ms.J.b.8]]
'''Foul papers''' are an author's working drafts. The term is most often used in the study of the plays of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and other dramatists of [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance drama]]. Once the composition of a play was finished, a transcript or "[[wikt:fair copy|fair copy]]" of the foul papers was prepared, by the author or by a scribe.

The term "foul papers" is given different definitions by various scholars. For example, some define them as "the author's original drafts." [[W. W. Greg]] and [[Fredson Bowers]] define them as "The author's last complete draft, in a shape satisfactory to him for transfer to a fair copy.&lt;ref&gt;Greg, W. W. ''The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare''. Oxford University Press (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Fredson. ''On Editing Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Dramatists''. University of Pennsylvania Library. (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. A. J. Honigmann]] defines them as "any kind of draft preceding the first fair copy.&lt;ref&gt;Honigmann, E. A. J. ''The Stability of Shakespeare's Texts.'' University of Nebraska Press (1965) p 17. {{ISBN|0-7131-5184-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Werstine states that foul papers "need not refer exclusively to authorial drafts", and that the term "simply describes papers that are to be, are being, or have already been transcribed," and that foul papers may once have been fair copies.&lt;ref&gt;Westerine, Paul. ''Early Modern Playhouse Manuscripts and the Editing of Shakespeare''. Cambridge University Press (2013). page 98 {{ISBN|978-1-107-02042-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few sets of foul papers actually exist from the era in question. Of the relatively small number of dramas that are extant in [[manuscript]],&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Chambers provides an extensive (though not exhaustive) list of fifty plays and masques in manuscript or manuscript fragments; Chambers, vol. 4, pp. 404–6.&lt;/ref&gt; the majority are from the [[English literature#Late Renaissance: 1625–1660|Caroline and Cromwellian era]] (1625–1660) rather than the [[English literature#Elizabethan and Jacobean period (1558–1625)|Elizabethan and Jacobean era]] (1558–1625), and most are fair copies of plays by professional scribes like [[Ralph Crane]].&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[A Game at Chess]];'' ''[[Sir John van Olden Barnavelt]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rare direct reference to foul papers and fair copies, [[Robert Daborne]] mentions both in a November 1613 letter to theatrical manager [[Philip Henslowe]]: "I send you the foul sheet and the fair I was writing"&lt;ref&gt;Spelling, punctuation modernized; Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 194; Halliday, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; – which appears to indicate that Daborne prepared a fair copy of his working drafts as he wrote.

The '''International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters''' ('''IAPTI''') is an [[international]] [[professional association]] of [[translator]]s and [[interpreter]]s based in [[Argentina]].

==History==
Based in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], IAPTI was established on 30 September 2009, [[Saint Jerome]]'s day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=344753&amp;CategoryId=14093 |title=International Translators Association Launched in Argentina |author= |date= |work=[[Latin American Herald Tribune]] |publisher= |accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by a group of professional language mediators as a vehicle for promoting ethical practices in translation and interpretation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexis.pro/news/global/addressing-issues-of-concern-in-the-translation-and-interpretation-industry/|title=Addressing issues of concern in the translation and interpretation industry|website=Lexis.pro|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and providing a forum for discussing problems typical of the globalized world, such as [[crowdsourcing]], [[outsourcing]], bad [[fee|rate]]s and other abuse.&lt;ref name="fundeu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundeu.es/noticia/nueva-asociacion-profesional-fomentara-el-ejercicio-etico-de-la-traduccion-y-la-interpretacion-2469/ |title=New association will promote ethical practices in translating and interpreting |publisher=[[Fundéu]] |date=30 September 2009}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological-ethical issues are also important to IAPTI, such as the exploitation of language professionals as cheap [[proofreading|proofreader]]s of [[machine translation|machine-translated]] texts.&lt;ref name="rock"/&gt;

It was founded by Aurora Humarán, an Argentinian [[Translating for legal equivalence|sworn translator]], Corresponding Member of the [[North American Academy of the Spanish Language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/IAPTI/videos/1671449429581741/ |title=Interview of Aurora Humarán to Gerardo Piña-Rosales, ANLE's Director |accessdate=18 August 2018}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anle.us/390/Aurora-Humar%C3%A1n.html |title=Aurora Humarán |publisher=[[North American Academy of the Spanish Language]] |accessdate=26 December 2016}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[marketing]] specialist.&lt;ref name="rock"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wantwords.co.uk/school/people-who-rock-the-industry-aurora-humaran/ |last=Stelmaszak |first=Marta |title= People who rock: Aurora Humarán |website=Wantwords.co.uk|access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IAPTI applied for registration as a civil association in the [[City of Buenos Aires]] (Argentina). Its legal registration under the name "International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters" took a long time to process with the Office of the Argentine Inspector-General for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iapti.org/association/|title=IAPTI - International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters|website=www.iapti.org|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 2017 it was announced that the Inspector-General for Justice has finally approved IAPTI as a civil association.&lt;ref name="IGJ approved"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iapti.org/news/not122-iapti-is-approved-by-igj-as-a-civil-association.html|title=IAPTI approved by IGJ |website=www.iapti.org|access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its bylaws, the Association is directed and managed by a Board of Directors made up of the six following officers: President, Vice President, Secretary General, Treasurer, two Voting Members and two Alternate Voting Members.&lt;ref name="bylaws"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iapti.org/bylaws/|title=IAPTI bylaws|website=www.iapti.org|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interslavic''' is a [[zonal constructed language]] based on the [[Slavic languages]]. Its purpose is to facilitate communication between representatives of different [[Slavs|Slavic nations]], as well as to allow people who do not know any Slavic language to communicate with Slavs. For the latter, it can fulfill an educational role as well.

Interslavic can be classified as a semi-[[constructed language]]. It is essentially a modern continuation of [[Old Church Slavonic]], but also draws on the various improvised language forms Slavs have been using for centuries to communicate with Slavs of other nationalities, for example in multi-Slavic environments and on the Internet, providing them with a scientific base. Thus, both grammar and vocabulary are based on the commonalities between the [[Slavic languages]], and non-Slavic elements are avoided. Its main focus lies on instant understandability rather than easy learning, a balance typical for naturalistic (as opposed to [[international auxiliary language#Classification|schematic]]) languages.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/slovianski/introduction.html|title=INTRODUCTION|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language has a long history, predating constructed languages like [[Volapük]] and [[Esperanto]] by centuries: the oldest description, written by the Croatian priest [[Juraj Križanić]], goes back to the years 1659–1666.&lt;ref&gt;М.И. Исаев, ''Словарь этнолингистическиж понятий и терминов''. Moscow, 2001, pp. 85–86. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its current form, Interslavic was created in 2006 under the name '''Slovianski'''. In 2011, Slovianski underwent a thorough reform and merged with two other projects, simultaneously changing its name to "Interslavic", a name that was first proposed by the Czech [[Ignac Hošek]] in 1908.&lt;ref name="Ruposova" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/introduction.html#name|title=Interslavic – Introduction|author=Jan van Steenbergen|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interslavic can be written using the [[Latin script|Latin]] and the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabets]].

== Background ==
[[File:Križanić - Gramatično izkazanje ob ruskom jeziku.png|thumb|''Gramatíčno izkâzanje ob rúskom jezíku'' (1665) by [[Juraj Križanić]], the first Interslavic grammar]]
The history of the Interslavic or [[Pan-Slavic language]] is closely connected with [[Pan-Slavism]], an ideology that endeavors cultural and political unification of all Slavs, based on the conception that all Slavic people are part of a single Slavic nation. Along with this belief came also the need for a Slavic umbrella language. A strong candidate for that position was [[Russian language|Russian]], the language of the largest (and during most of the 19th century the only) Slavic state and also mother tongue of more than half of the Slavs. This option enjoyed most of its popularity in Russia itself, but was also favoured by Pan-Slavists abroad, for example the Slovak [[Ľudovít Štúr]].&lt;ref name="Ruposova"&gt;Л.П. Рупосова, ''История межславянского языка'', in: ''Вестник Московского государственного областного университета'' (Московский государственный областной университет, 2012 no. 1, p. 55. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believed that [[Old Church Slavonic]] was a better and also more neutral solution. In previous centuries, this language had served as an administrative language in a large part of the Slavic world, and it was still used on a large scale in [[Orthodox church|Orthodox]] liturgy, where it played a role similar to [[Latin]] in the West. Old Church Slavonic had the additional advantage of being very similar to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, [[Proto-Slavic]]. However, Old Church Slavonic had several practical disadvantages as well: it was written in a highly archaic form of [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], grammar was complex and its vocabulary was characterized by many obsolete words as well as the absence of words for modern concepts. Hence, early examples of Pan-Slavic language projects were aimed at modernizing Old Church Slavonic and adapting it to the needs of everyday communication.

The first Interslavic grammar, ''Gramatíčno izkâzanje ob rúskom jezíku'' by the Croatian priest [[Juraj Križanić]], was written in 1665.&lt;ref&gt;Juraj Križanić, ''Граматично изказанје об руском језику''. Moscow, 1665.&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to the language as '''Ruski''', but in reality it was mostly based on a mixture of the Russian edition of [[Church Slavonic]] and his own [[Ikavian Čakavian]] dialect of [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Križanić used it not only for this grammar, but also in other works, including the treatise ''Politika'' (1663–1666). According to an analysis of the Dutch Slavist Tom Ekman, 59% of the words used in ''Politika'' are of common Slavic descent, 10% come from Russian and Church Slavonic, 9% from Croatian and 2.5% from Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miresperanto.com/esperantologio/interlingv_mysl.htm|title=ИЗ ИСТОРИИ ИНТЕРЛИНГВИСТИЧЕСКОЙ МЫСЛИ В РОССИИ|publisher=Miresperanto.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that Križanić was not the first who attempted writing in a language understandable to all Slavs. In 1583 another Croatian priest, [[Šime Budinić]], had translated the ''Summa Doctrinae Christanae'' by [[Petrus Canisius]] into "Slovignsky",&lt;ref&gt;Petrus Canisius, "Svmma navka christianskoga / sloxena castnim včitegliem Petrom Kanisiem; tvmacena iz latinskoga jazika v slovignsky, i vtisstena po zapoviedi presuetoga Otca Pape Gregoria Trinaestoga [...] Koie iz Vlasskoga, illi Latinskoga iazika, v Slouignsky Jazik protumačio iest pop Ssimvn Bvdineo Zadranin". Rome, 1583.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he used both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Orzechowska, Mieczysław Basaj, Instytut Słowianoznawstwa (Polska Akademia Nauk), ''Prekursorzy słowiańskiego jezykoznawstwa porównawczego, do końca XVIII wiek''. Warsaw, 1987, p. 124. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Križanić, numerous other efforts have been made to create an umbrella language for the speakers of Slavic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/constructed_slavic_languages.html|title=Constructed Slavic Languages|author=Jan van Steenbergen|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example is [[Universalis Lingua Slavica]] by the Slovak attorney [[Ján Herkeľ]] (1786–1853), published in Latin and in Slovak in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Ján Herkeľ, ''Elementa universalis linguae Slavicae e vivis dialectis eruta at sanis logicae principiis suffulta''. Budapest, 1826. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ján Herkeľ, ''Zaklady vseslovanskeho jazyka''. Vienna, 1826. {{sk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Križanić' project, this project was closer to the [[West Slavic languages]].

During the second half of the 19th century Pan-Slavic language projects were mostly the domain of Slovenes and Croats. In this era of awakening national consciousness, the Russians were the only Slavs who had their own state; other Slavic peoples inhabited large, mostly non-Slavic states, and clear borders between the various nations were mostly lacking. Among the numerous efforts at creating written standards for the [[South Slavic languages]] there were also efforts at establishing a common South Slavic language, [[Illyrian movement|Illyrian]], that might also serve as a literary language for all Slavs in the future. Of special importance is the work of [[Matija Majar]] (1809–1892), a Slovenian [[Austroslavism|Austroslavist]] who later converted to Pan-Slavism. In 1865 he published [[Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski]] ("Mutual Slavic Orthography").&lt;ref name="majar"&gt;Matija Majar-Ziljski, ''Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski, to je: Uzajemna Slovnica ali Mluvnica Slavjanska''. Prague, 1865.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he postulated that the best way for Slavs to communicate with other Slavs was taking own language as a starting point and then modifying it in steps. First, he proposed changing the orthography of each individual language into a generic ("mutual") Pan-Slavic orthography, subsequently he described a grammar that was based on comparing the five major Slavic languages of his days: Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbian. Apart from a book about the language itself, Majar also used it for a biography of [[Cyril and Methodius]]&lt;ref name="brata"&gt;Matija Majar Ziljski, ''Sveta brata Ciril i Metod, slavjanska apostola i osnovatelja slovstva slavjanskoga''. Prague, 1864.&lt;/ref&gt; and for a magazine he published in the years 1873–1875, ''Slavjan''. A fragment in the language can still be seen on the altar of Majar's church in [[Görtschach]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gary Minnich, "Collective identity formation and linguistic identities in the Austro-Italian Slovene border region", in: Dieter Stern &amp; Christian Voss, ''Marginal Linguistic Identities: Studies in Slavic Contact and Borderland Varieties'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Pan-Slavic language projects were published in the same period by the Croatian [[Matija Ban]],&lt;ref&gt;Matija Ban, "Osnova Sveslavjanskoga jezika", in: ''Dubrovnik. Cviet narodnog književstva. Svezak drugi''. Zagreb, 1851, pp. 131–174. {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Slovenes [[Radoslav Razlag]] and [[Božidar Raič]],&lt;ref&gt;Božidar Raič, "Vvod v slovnicų vseslavenskųjų", in: Radoslav Razlag red., ''Zora Jugoslavenska'' no. 2, Zagreb, 1853, pp. 23–44.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Bulgarian from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] [[Grigor Parlichev]]&lt;ref&gt;Г.П. [Григор Прличев], ''Кратка славянска грамматика''. Constantinople, 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; – all based on the idea of combining Old Church Slavonic with elements from the modern South Slavic languages.

All authors mentioned above were motivated by the belief that all Slavic languages were dialects of one single Slavic language rather than separate languages. They deplored the fact that these dialects had diverged beyond mutual comprehensibility, and the Pan-Slavic language they envisioned was intended to reverse this process. Their long-term objective was that this language would replace the individual Slavic languages.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Anna-Maria Meyer |date=2014 |title=Wiederbelebung einer Utopie. Probleme und Perspektiven slavischer Plansprachen im Zeitalter des Internets (Bamberger Beiträge zur Linguistik 6) |url= |location=Bamberg |publisher=Univ. of Bamberg Press |isbn=978-3-86309-233-7 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|86}} Majar, for example, compared the Pan-Slavic language with standardized languages like Ancient Greek and several modern languages:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{pull quote|
The ancient Greeks spoke and wrote in four dialects, but nevertheless they had one single Greek language and one single Greek literature. Many modern educated nations, for example the French, the Italians, the English and the Germans, have a higher number of more divergent dialects and subdialects than we Slavs, and yet they have one single literary language. What is possible for other nations and what really exists among them, why should this be impossible only for us Slavs?&lt;ref name="brata" /&gt;{{RP|154}}|author=Matija Majar|source=''Sveta brata Ciril i Metod, slavjanska apostola i osnovatelja slovstva slavjanskoga'' (1864)}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consequently, these authors did not consider their projects constructed languages at all. In most cases they provided grammatical comparisons between the Slavic languages, sometimes but not always offering solutions they labelled as "Pan-Slavic". What their projects have in common that they neither have a rigidly prescriptive grammar, nor a separate vocabulary.

=== The twentieth century ===
[[File:Bohumil Holy.jpg|thumb|120px|Bohumil Holý&lt;br /&gt;(1885–1947)]]
In the early 20th century it had become clear that the divergence of the Slavic languages was irreversible and the concept of a Pan-Slavic literary language was no longer realistic. The Pan-Slavic dream had lost most of its power, and Pan-Slavists had to satisfy themselves with the formation of two multinational Slavic states, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. However, the need for a common language of communication for Slavs was still felt, and due to the influence of constructed languages like [[Esperanto]], efforts were made to create a language that was no longer supposed to replace the individual Slavic languages, but to serve as an additional second language for Interslavic communication.&lt;ref name="Meyer" /&gt;{{RP|118}}

In the same period, the nexus of Interslavic activity shifted to the North, especially to the Czech lands. In 1907 the Czech dialectologist [[Ignac Hošek]] (1852–1919) published a grammar of '''Neuslavisch''', a proposal for a common literary language for all Slavs within the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ignác Hošek, ''Grammatik der Neuslawischen Sprache''. Kremsier, 1907. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later another Czech, [[Josef Konečný]], published '''Slavina''', a "Slavic Esperanto", which however had very little in common with Esperanto, but instead was mostly based on Czech.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Konečný, ''Mluvnička slovanského esperanta »Slavina«. Jednotná spisovná dorozumívací slovanská rěč pro obchod a průmysl. Sestavil Konečný J.'' Prague, 1912. {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duličenko"&gt;А. Д Дуличенко, ''Международные вспомогательные языки''. Tallinn, 1990. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|196}} Whereas these two projects were naturalistic, the same cannot be said about two other projects by Czech authors, '''Slovanština''' by [[Edmund Kolkop]]&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Kolkop, ''Pokus o dorozumívací jazyk slovanský''. Prague, 1912. {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Slavski jezik''' by [[Bohumil Holý]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Holý, ''Slavski jezik. Stručná mluvnice dorozumívacího i jednotícího jazyka všeslovanského. S pomocí spolupracovníků podává stenograf В. Holý.'' Nové Město nad Metují, 1920. {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both projects, published in 1912 and 1920 respectively, show a clear tendency towards simplification, for example by eliminating grammatical [[gender (grammar)|gender]] and [[case (grammar)|cases]], and [[international auxiliary language#classification|schematicism]].&lt;ref name="Duličenko" /&gt;{{RP|214}} &lt;ref name="Meyer" /&gt;{{RP|128–132, 137–143, 159}}

During the 1950s the Czech poet and former Esperantist [[Ladislav Podmele]] (1920–2000), also known under his pseudonym ''Jiří Karen'', worked for several years with a team of prominent interlinguists on an elaborate project, [[Mežduslavjanski jezik]] ("Interslavic language"). Among other things, they wrote a grammar, an Esperanto–Interslavic word list, a dictionary, a course and a textbook. Although none of those were ever published, the project gained some attention of linguists from various countries.&lt;ref name="Duličenko" /&gt;{{RP|301–302}}&lt;ref&gt;Věra Barandovská-Frank, "Panslawische Variationen", in: Cyril Brosch &amp; Sabine Fiedler (eds.), ''Florilegium Interlinguisticum. Festschrift für Detlev Blanke zum 70. Geburtstag''. Frankfurt am Main, 2011, pp. 220–223. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably due to the political reality of those days, this language was primarily based on Russian.

=== The digital age ===
Although Pan-Slavism has not played a role of any significance since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia]], [[globalization]] and new media like the [[Internet]] have led to a renewed interest in a language that would be understandable for all Slavs alike. Older projects were largely forgotten, but as it became relatively easy for authors of new projects to publish their work, several new projects emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Berger, [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/tilman.berger/Publikationen/BergerPlansprachen.pdf "Vom Erfinden Slavischer Sprachen"], in: M. Okuka &amp; U. Schweier, eds., ''Germano-Slavistische Beiträge. Festschrift für P. Rehder zum 65. Geburtstag''. München, 2004, {{ISBN|3-87690-874-4}}), p. 25. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them originated from Slavic émigrée circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tilman Berger|url=http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/tilman.berger/Handouts/PanslavismusInternet.pdf|format=PDF|title=''Panslavismus und Internet''|date=2009|page=37|language=de|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first years of the 21st century, especially [[Slovio]] of the Slovak [[Mark Hučko]] acquired some fame. Unlike most previous projects it was not a naturalistic, but a [[international auxiliary language#classification|schematic]] language, its grammar being based largely on [[Esperanto]].&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Barber, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100607222108/http://www.unc.edu/depts/slavdept/lajanda/slav075barber.ppt "Old Church Slavonic and the 'Slavic Identity'"]. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Slovio was not only intended to serve as an auxiliary language for Slavs, but also for use on a global scale like Esperanto. For that reason it gained little acceptance among Slavs: a high degree of simplification, characteristic for most international auxiliary languages, makes it easier to learn for non-Slavs, but widens the distance with the natural Slavic languages and gives the language an overly synthetic character, which by many is considered a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="narodna pravda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narodna.pravda.com.ua/discussions/4a8f1e1b731fc/|script-title=uk:Трошки про Штучні Мови: Панслов'янська Мова|publisher=Narodna.pravda.com.ua|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, the '''Slovianski''' project was started by a group of people from different countries, who felt the need for a simple and neutral Slavic language that the Slavs could understand without prior learning. The language they envisioned should be naturalistic and only consist of material existing in all or most Slavic languages, without any artificial additions.&lt;ref name="narodna pravda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="balkaninsight"&gt;Bojana Barlovac, [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/25946 Creation of 'One Language for All Slavs' Underway]. BalkanInsight, 18 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Slovianski was being developed in two different variants: a naturalistic version known as '''Slovianski-N''' (initiated by [[Jan van Steenbergen]] and further developed by [[Igor Polyakov (linguist)|Igor Polyakov]]), and a more simplified version known as '''Slovianski-P''' (initiated by [[Ondrej Rečnik]] and further developed by [[Gabriel Svoboda]]). The difference was that Slovianski-N had six grammatical [[case (grammar)|cases]], while Slovianski-P—like [[English language|English]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]—used [[preposition]]s instead. Apart from these two variants ('''N''' stands for ''naturalism'', '''P''' for ''[[pidgin]]'' or ''prosti'' "simple"), a schematic version, '''Slovianski-S''', has been experimented with as well, but was abandoned in an early stage of the project.&lt;ref name=Shorthistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/history.html |title=A Short History of Interslavic |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 12, 2013 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 it was decided that only the naturalistic version would be continued under the name '''Slovianski'''. Although Slovianski had three [[gender (grammar)|genders]] (masculine, feminine, neuter), six [[case (grammar)|cases]] and full [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of verbs—features usually avoided in international auxiliary languages—a high level of simplification was achieved by means of simple, unambiguous endings and irregularity being kept to a minimum.

Slovianski was mostly used in Internet traffic and in a news letter, ''Slovianska Gazeta''.&lt;ref&gt;Н. М.

Slovianski has played a role in the development of other, related projects as well. '''Rozumio''' (2008) and '''Slovioski''' (2009) were both efforts to build a bridge between Slovianski and Slovio. Originally, Slovioski, developed by Polish-American [[Steeven Radzikowski]], was merely intended to reform Slovio, but gradually it developed into a separate language. Like Slovianski, it was a collaborative project that existed in two variants: a "full" and a simplified version.&lt;ref&gt;{{bg}} Дора Солакова, "Съвременни опити за създаване на изкуствен общославянски език", in: ''Езиков свят&amp;nbsp;– Orbis Linguarum, Issue no.2/2010'' (Югозападен Университет "Неофит Рилски", Blagoevgrad, 2010, ISSN 1312-0484), p. 248. {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010 a new language was published, '''Neoslavonic''' ("Novoslovienskij", later "Novoslověnsky") by the Czech [[Vojtěch Merunka]], based on [[Old Church Slavonic grammar]] but using part of Slovianski's vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Vojtěch Merunka, ''Jazyk novoslovienskij''.

In 2011, Slovianski, Slovioski and Novoslověnsky merged into one common project under the name '''Interslavic''' (''Medžuslovjanski'').&lt;ref name=Shorthistory /&gt; Slovianski grammar and dictionary were expanded to include all options of Neoslavonic as well, turning it into a more flexible language based on prototypes rather than fixed rules. From that time Slovianski and Neoslavonic have no longer been developed as separate projects, even though their names are still frequently in use as synonyms or "dialects" of Interslavic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2991/icelaic-15.2016.60 | title=Neoslavonic Language Zonal Language Constructing: Challenge, Experience, Opportunity to the 21st Century | journal=Proceedings of the 2015 2nd International Conference on Education, Language, Art and Intercultural Communication | isbn = 978-94-6252-152-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the various simplified forms of Slovianski and Slovioski that were meant to meet the needs of beginners and non-Slavs, were reworked into a highly simplified form of Interslavic, '''Slovianto'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/slovianto.html|title=Slovianto - a Slavic Esperanto|author=Jan van Steenbergen|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2017 CISLa conference, the project of unifying the two standards of Interslavic has been commenced by Merunka and van Steenbergen, with a planned new, singular grammar and orthography. An early example of this endeavor is Merunka and van Steenbergen's joint publication on Slavic cultural diplomacy, released to coincide with the conference.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318452938_Slovjanska_kulturna_diplomacija_-_SWOT_analiza_strategija_i_taktika_do_buducnosti&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of people who speak Interslavic is difficult to establish; the lack of demographic data is a common problem among constructed languages, so that estimates are always rough. The Bulgarian author G. Iliev mentions a number of "several hundreds of speakers" in 2012,&lt;ref name="iliev" /&gt; the language's Facebook page mentions 4600 speakers.&lt;ref name="facebook.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Slovianski/107932102568734?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts|title=Slovianski|work=Facebook|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 an international conference took place in the Czech town of [[Staré Město (Uherské Hradiště District)|Staré Město]] near [[Uherské Hradiště]], which was dedicated to Interslavic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cisla.slavic-union.org/|title=CISLa 2017|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mistnikultura.cz/dny-slovanske-kultury-2017-skoncily|author=Jiří Králík|title=Dny slovanské kultury 2017 skončily|publisher=Místní kultura|date=6 June 2017|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presentations were either held in Interslavic or translated into Interslavic. A second conference took place in 2018.

== Alphabet ==
One of the main principles of Interslavic is that it can be written on any Slavic keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/slovianski/phono_ortho.html#orthography|title=Orthography|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border between [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] runs through the middle of Slavic territory, and therefore both alphabets can be used. Because of the differences between for example the [[Polish alphabet]] and other Latin alphabets, as well as between [[Serbian alphabet|Serbian]]/[[Macedonian alphabet|Macedonian]] Cyrillic and other forms of Cyrillic, Interslavic has no official orthography, but uses a prototype orthography instead, which means that many phonemes can be written and pronounced in various ways. For example, the distinction between hard and soft consonants ('''t''' vs. '''ť''', '''r''' vs. '''ŕ''', etc.), characteristic for the West and East Slavic languages, is optional both in speaking and in writing. Because Interslavic is not an ethnic language, there are no hard and fast rules regarding [[stress (linguistics)|accentuation]] either.

What all varieties of Interslavic have in common is the following basic set of phonemes that can be found in all Slavic languages:

Apart from the basic alphabet above, other characters are used as well, usually carrying a [[diacritic]], convey additional [[etymology|etymological]] information and linking directly to [[Proto-Slavic]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Their usage is not mandatory. The purpose of these characters is threefold:
* they allow for a more precise pronunciation,
* because sound changes from [[Proto-Slavic]] tend to be regular in all Slavic languages, they can be linked to a particular phoneme in every individual Slavic language, thus enhancing comprehensibility,
* by writing and/or pronouncing them in a different way, they can be used to manipulate the language in such way that it becomes more understandable for speakers of particular languages (in a process called "flavorization").

Lastly, the following [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] can also be encountered in Interslavic:

|-
| align="center" | '''Щ щ''' || align="center" | '''шч''' or '''шт'''
|}

=== Soft consonants ===
The consonants '''ľ''', '''ń''', '''ŕ''', '''ť''', '''ď''', '''ś''' and '''ź''' are [[softening|softened]] or [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] counterparts of '''l''', '''n''', '''r''', '''t''', '''d''', '''s''' and '''z'''. The latter may also be pronounced like their softened/palatalized equivalents before '''i''', '''ě''', '''ę''' and possibly before '''e'''. This pronunciation is not mandatory, though: they may as well be written and pronounced hard.

Soft consonants are normally represented by an [[acute accent|acute]] or a [[haček]], but other ways of writing are possible as well: '''nj''', '''n’''', etc. To avoid texts from becoming heavy on diacritics, it is recommended that before a vowel, soft consonants are written as a hard consonant followed by a '''j''': nom. ''koń'', gen. ''konja'' (instead of ''końa''). In the most recent revision of the language as of March 28th, 2018 - the recommended standard for writing the [ɲ] sound is '''nj''' at all times, even with no adjacent vowels. The letter '''ń''' is to be optionally used exclusively when '''j''' follows the [ɲ] phoneme and the two sounds are meant to be pronounced separately, such as in the suffix "-ńje", which is a common ending to the present participle form of many verbs.

== Morphology ==
Interslavic grammar is based on the greatest common denominator of that of the natural Slavic languages, and partly also a simplification thereof. It consists of elements that can be encountered in all or at least most of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://izviestija.info/index.php/nauka/195-zalozenja-za-medzuslovjanski-jezyk|title=Založeňja za medžuslovjanski jezyk|publisher=Izviestija.info|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nouns ===
Interslavic is an [[inflecting language]]. [[Noun]]s can have three [[gender (grammar)|genders]], two numbers (singular and plural), as well as six [[grammatical case|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]] and [[locative]]). Since several Slavic languages also have a [[vocative]], it is usually displayed in tables as well, even though strictly speaking the vocative is not a case. It occurs only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns.

There is no [[article (grammar)|article]]. The complicated system of noun classes in Slavic has been reduced to four or five [[declension]]s:
* masculine nouns (ending in a – usually hard – [[consonant]]): ''dom'' "house", ''mųž'' "man"
* feminine nouns ending in '''-a''': ''žena'' "woman", ''zemja'' "earth"
* feminine nouns ending in a soft consonant: ''kosť'' "bone"
* neuter nouns ending in '''-o''' or '''-e''': ''slovo'' "word", ''morje'' "sea"
* Old Church Slavonic also had a consonantal declension that in most Slavic languages merged into the remaining declensions. Some Interslavic projects and writers preserve this declension, which consists of nouns of all three genders, mostly neuters:
** neuter nouns of the group '''-mę/-men-''': ''imę/imene'' "name"
** neuter nouns of the group '''-ę/-ęt-''' (children and young animals): ''telę/telęte'' "calf"
** neuter nouns of the group '''-o/-es-''': ''nebo/nebese'' "heaven"
** masculine nouns of the group '''-en-''': ''kameń/kamene'' "stone"
** feminine nouns with the ending '''-òv''': ''cŕkòv/cŕkve'' "church"
** feminine nouns with the ending '''-i/-er-''': ''mati/matere'' "mother"

=== Adjectives ===
[[Adjective]]s are always regular. They agree with the noun they modify in gender, case and number, and are usually placed before it. In the column with the masculine forms, the first relates to animate nouns, the second to inanimate nouns. A distinction is made between hard and soft stems, for example: ''dobry'' "good" and ''svěži'' "fresh":

Some writers do not distinguish between hard and soft adjectives. One can write ''dobrego'' instead of ''dobrogo'', ''svěžogo'' instead of ''svěžego''.

==== Comparison ====
The [[comparative]] is formed with the ending '''-(ěj)ši''': ''slab'''ši''''' "weaker", ''pòln'''ějši''''' "fuller". The [[superlative]] is formed by adding the [[prefix]] '''naj-''' to the comparative: '''''naj'''slab'''ši''''' "weakest". Comparatives can also be formed with the adverbs ''bolje'' or ''vyše'' "more", superlatives with the adverbs ''najbolje'' or ''najvyše'' "most".

==== Adverbs ====
An adjective can be turned into an adverb with the ending '''-o''': ''dobr'''o''''' "well", ''svěžo'' "freshly". Comparatives and superlatives can be adverbialized with the ending '''-ěje''': ''slab'''ěje''''' "weaker".

=== Pronouns ===
The [[personal pronoun]]s are: '''ja''' "I", '''ty''' "you, thou", '''on''' "he", '''ona''' "she", '''ono''' "it", '''my''' "we", '''vy''' "you" (pl.), '''oni''' "they". When a personal pronoun of the third person is preceded by a [[preposition]], '''n-''' is placed before it.

* the [[demonstrative pronoun]]s '''toj''' "this, that", '''tutoj''' "this" and '''tamtoj''' "that"
* the [[relative pronoun]] '''ktory''' "which"
* the [[interrogative pronoun]]s '''kto''' "who" and '''čto''' "what"
* the [[indefinite pronoun]]s '''někto''' "somebody", '''něčto''' "something", '''nikto''' "nobody",  '''ničto''' "nothing", '''ktokoli''' "whoever, anybody", '''čto-nebųď''' "whatever, anything", etc.

=== Numerals ===
The [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s 1–10 are: 1 – '''jedin/jedna/jedno''', 2 – '''dva/dvě''', 3 – '''tri''', 4 – '''četyri''', 5 – '''pęť''', 6 – '''šesť''', 7 – '''sedm''', 8 – '''osm''', 9 – '''devęť''', 10 – '''desęť'''.

Higher numbers are formed by adding '''-nadsęť''' for the numbers 11–19, '''-desęt''' for the tens, '''-sto''' for the hundreds. Sometimes (but not always) the latter is inflected: ''dvasto/tristo/pęťsto'' and ''dvěstě/trista/pęťsòt'' are both correct.

The inflection of the cardinal numerals is shown in the following table. The numbers 5–99 are inflected either as nouns of the ''kosť'' type or as soft adjectives.

[[Ordinal number (linguistics)|Ordinal number]]s are formed by adding the adjective ending '''-y''' to the cardinal numbers, except in the case of ''pŕvy'' "first", ''drugi/vtory'' "second", ''tretji'' "third", ''četvŕty'' "fourth", ''stoty/sòtny'' "hundredth", ''tysęčny'' "thousandth".

[[Fraction (mathematics)|Fractions]] are formed by adding the [[suffix]] '''-ina''' to ordinal numbers: ''tretjina'' "(one) third", ''četvŕtina'' "quarter", etc. The only exception is ''pol'' (''polovina, polovica'') "half".

Interslavic has other categories of numerals as well:
* [[collective numeral]]s: ''dvoje'' "pair, duo, duet", ''troje, četvero...'', etc.
* [[multiplicative numerals]]: ''jediny'' "single", ''dvojny'' "double", ''trojny'', ''četverny...'', etc.
* [[differential numerals]]: ''dvojaki'' "of two different kinds", ''trojaki, četveraki...'', enz.

=== Verbs ===

==== Aspect ====
Like all Slavic languages, Interslavic verbs have [[grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|grammatical aspect]]. A [[perfective aspect|perfective]] verb indicates an action that has been or will be completed and therefore emphasizes the result of the action rather than its course. On the other hand, an [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] verb focuses on the course or duration of the action, and is also used for expressing habits and repeating patterns.

Verbs without a prefix are usually imperfective. Most imperfective verbs have a perfective counterpart, which in most cases is formed by adding a prefix:&lt;br /&gt;
''dělati ~ sdělati'' "to do"&lt;br /&gt;
''čistiti ~ izčistiti'' "to clean"&lt;br /&gt;
''pisati ~ napisati'' "to write"&lt;br /&gt;
Because prefixes are also used to change the meaning of a verb, secondary imperfective forms based on perfective verbs with a prefix are needed as well. These verbs are formed regularly:
* '''-ati''' becomes '''-yvati''' (e.g. ''zapisati ~ zapisyvati'' "to note, to register, to record", ''dokazati ~ dokazyvati'' "to prove")
* '''-iti''' become '''-jati''' (e.g. ''napraviti ~ napravjati'' "to lead", ''pozvoliti ~ pozvaljati'' "to allow", ''oprostiti ~ oprašćati'' "to simplify")

Some aspect pairs are irregular, for example ''nazvati ~ nazyvati'' "to name, to call", ''prijdti ~ prihoditi'' "to come", ''podjęti ~ podimati'' "to undertake".

==== Stems ====
The Slavic languages are notorious for their complicated [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] patterns. To simply these, Interslavic has a system of two conjugations and two verbal [[stem (linguistics)|stems]]. In most cases, knowing the infinitive is enough to establish both stems:
* the first stem is used for the [[infinitive]], the [[past tense]], the [[conditional mood]], the [[past passive participle]] and the [[verbal noun]]. It is formed by removing the ending '''-ti''' from the infinitive: ''dělati'' "to do" &gt; ''děla-'', ''prositi'' "to require" &gt; ''prosi-'', ''nesti'' "to carry" &gt; ''nes-''. Verbs ending in '''-sti''' can also have their stem ending on '''t''' or '''d''', f.ex. ''vesti &gt; ved-'' "to lead", ''gnesti &gt; gnet-'' "to crush".
* the second stem is used for the [[present tense]], the [[imperative mood|imperative]] and the [[present active participle]]. In most cases both stems are identical, and in most of the remaining cases the second stem can be derived regularly from the first. In particular cases they have to be learned separately. In the present tense, a distinction is made between two conjugations:
** the first conjugation includes almost all verbs that do not have the ending '''-iti''', as well as monosyllabic verbs on '''-iti''':
*** verbs on '''-ati''' have the stem '''-aj-''': ''dělati'' "to do" &gt; ''dělaj-''
*** verbs on '''-ovati''' have the stem '''-uj-''': ''kovati'' "to forge" &gt; ''kuj-''
*** verbs on '''-nųti''' have the stem '''-n-''': ''tęgnųti'' "to pull, to draw" &gt; ''tęgn-''
*** monosyllabic verbs have '''-j-''': ''piti'' "to drink" &gt; ''pij-'', ''čuti'' "to feel" &gt; ''čuj-''
*** the second stem is identical to the first stem if the latter ends in a consonant: ''nesti'' "to carry" &gt; ''nes-'', ''vesti'' "to lead" &gt; ''ved-''
** the second conjugation includes all polysyllabic verbs on '''-iti''' and most verbs on '''-ěti''': ''prositi'' "to require" &gt; ''pros-i-'', ''viděti'' "to see" &gt; ''vid-i-''
There are also mixed and irregular verbs, i.e. verbs with a second stem that cannot be derived regularly from the first stem, for example: ''pisati'' "to write" &gt; ''piš-'', ''spati'' "to sleep" &gt; ''sp-i-'', ''zvati'' "to call" &gt; ''zov-'', ''htěti'' "to want" &gt; ''hoć-''. In these cases both stem have to be learned separately.

==== Conjugation ====
The various moods and tenses are formed by means of the following endings:
* ''Present tense'': '''-ų, -eš, -e, -emo, -ete, -ųt''' (first conjugation); '''-jų, -iš, -i, -imo, -ite, -ęt''' (second conjugation)
* ''Past tense – simple'' (as in Russian): m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li'''
* ''Past tense – complex'' (as in South Slavic):
** ''Imperfect tense'': '''-h, -še, -še, -hmo, -ste, -hų'''
** ''Perfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the present tense of ''byti'' "to be"
** ''Pluperfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the imperfect tense of ''byti''
* ''Conditional'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the conditional of ''byti''
* ''Future tense'': the future tense of ''byti'' + the infinitive
* ''Imperative'': '''-Ø, -mo, -te''' after '''j''', or '''-i, -imo, -ite''' after another consonant.

The forms with '''-l-''' in the past tense and the conditional are actually participles known as the ''L-participle''. The remaining participles are formed as follows:
* ''Present active participle'': '''-ųći''' (first conjugation), '''-ęći''' (second conjugation)
* ''Present passive participle'': '''-omy/-emy''' (first conjugation), '''-imy''' (second conjugation)
* ''Past active participle'': '''-vši''' after a vowel, or '''-ši''' after a consonant
* ''Past passive participle'': '''-ny''' after a vowel, '''-eny''' after a consonant. Monosyllabic verbs (except for those on '''-ati''') have '''-ty'''. Verbs on '''-iti''' have the ending '''-jeny'''.

The ''verbal noun'' is based on the past passive participle, replacing the ending '''-ny/-ty''' with '''-nje/-{{Not a typo|tje}}.

Whenever the stem of a verbs of the second conjugation ends in '''s, z, t, d, st''' or '''zd''', an ending starting '''-j''' causes the following mutations:
* ''prositi'' "to require": ''pros-jų &gt; pro'''š'''ų, pros-jeny &gt; pro'''š'''eny''
* ''voziti'' "to transport": ''voz-jų &gt; vo'''ž'''ų, voz-jeny &gt; vo'''ž'''eny''
* ''tratiti'' "to lose": ''trat-jų &gt; tra'''ć'''ų, trat-jeny &gt; tra'''ć'''eny''
* ''slěditi'' "to follow": ''slěd-jų &gt; slě'''dž'''ų, slěd-jeny &gt; slě'''dž'''eny''
* ''čistiti'' "to clean": ''čist-jų &gt; či'''šć'''ų, čist-jeny &gt; či'''šć'''eny''
* ''jezditi'' "to go (by transport)": ''jezd-jų &gt; je'''ždž'''ų, jezd-jeny &gt; je'''ždž'''eny''

==== Alternative forms ====
Because Interslavic is not a highly formalized language, a lot of variation occurs between various forms. Often used are the following alternative forms:
* In the first conjugation, '''-aje-''' is often reduced to '''-a-''': ''ty dělaš'', ''on děla'' etc.
* Instead of the 1st person singular ending '''-(j)ų''', the ending '''-(e)m''' is sometimes used as well: ''ja dělam'', ''ja hvalim'', ''ja nesem''.
* Instead of '''-mo''' in the 1st person plural, '''-me''' can be used as well: ''my děla(je)me'', ''my hvalime''.
* Instead of '''-hmo''' in the imperfect tense, '''-smo''' and the more archaic '''-hom''' can be used as well.
* Instead of the conjugated forms of ''byti'' in the conditional (''byh, bys'' etc.), ''by'' is often used as a [[particle (grammar)|particle]]: ''ja by pisal(a)'', ''ty by pisal(a)'' etc.
* Verbal nouns can have the ending '''-ije''' instead of '''-je''': ''dělanije'', ''hvaljenije''.

==== Irregular verbs ====
A few verbs have an irregular conjugation:
* '''byti''' "to be" has ''jesm, jesi, jest, jesmo, jeste, sųt'' in the present tense, ''běh, běše...'' in the imperfect tense, and ''bųdų, bųdeš...'' in the future
* '''dati''' "to give", '''jěsti''' "to eat" and '''věděti''' "to know" have the following present tense: ''dam, daš, da, damo, date, dadųt''; ''jem, ješ...''; ''věm, věš...''
* '''idti''' "to go by foot, to walk" has an irregular L-participle: ''šel, šla, šlo, šli''.

==Vocabulary==
Words in Interslavic are based on comparison of the vocabulary of the modern Slavic languages. For this purpose, the latter are subdivided into six groups:
* [[Russian language|Russian]]
* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]
* [[Polish language|Polish]]
* [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]
* [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croat]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]
* [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]
These groups are treated equally. Interslavic vocabulary has been compiled in such way that words are understandable to a maximum number of Slavic speakers. The form in which a chosen word is adopted depends not only on its frequency in the modern Slavic languages, but also on the inner logic of Interslavic, as well as its form in [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]]: to ensure coherence, a system of regular [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] is applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/design_criteria.html#vocabulary|title=Vocabulary|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His eight-volume work, ''The Text of the Canterbury Tales'' (1940), written in collaboration with his former student Edith Rickert, has been cited as a definitive study of Chaucer's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/projects/centcat/centcats/fac/facch16_01.html|title=John M. Manly &amp; Edith Rickert |work=The University of Chicago Faculty: A Centennial View|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Manley was born in [[Virginia]] the son of Charles Manly, a Baptist minister and university president. He attended [[Staunton Military Academy]] and [[Greenville Military Institute]]. At the age of 18, Manly earned a master's degree in Mathematics from [[Furman University]]. In 1890, he received a [[PhD]] from [[Harvard University]] in Philology, a non-departmental field for which he created his own curriculum.&lt;ref name="UCL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.MANLY|title=Guide to the John Matthews Manly Papers 1892-1940|year=2006|work=University of Chicago Library|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1884, at the age of 19, Manly accepted a position at William Jewel College teaching Mathematics which he held for five years. After taking his doctorate in 1890 and teaching Anglo-Saxon at Radcliffe for a year, Manly accepted a call to [[Brown University]] and became one of the chief members of the English staff there, until 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hulbert|first=J.R.|title=John Matthews Manly, 1865 - 1940|journal=Modern Philology|date=Aug 1940|volume=38|issue=1|pages=1–8|jstor=433980|doi=10.1086/388458}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then accepted the department chair in English at the University of Chicago which he maintained until retirement.&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt;

In 1931 he published a paper in ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'' disproving [[William Romaine Newbold]]'s deciphering of the [[Voynich Manuscript]].&lt;ref name="MED"&gt;{{cite book|first=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15149">'''Language resource management - Lexical markup framework''' ('''LMF'''; '''ISO 24613:2008'''), is the ISO [[International Organization for Standardization]] [[ISO/TC37]] standard for [[natural language processing]] (NLP) and [[machine-readable dictionary]] (MRD) [[lexicon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37327 |title=ISO 24613:2008 - Language resource management - Lexical markup framework (LMF) |website=Iso.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scope is [[standardization]] of principles and methods relating to language resources in the contexts of multilingual communication and [[cultural diversity]].

==Objectives==
The goals of LMF are to provide a common model for the creation and use of [[lexical resource]]s, to manage the exchange of data between and among these resources, and to enable the merging of large number of individual electronic resources to form extensive global electronic resources.

Types of individual instantiations of LMF can include monolingual, bilingual or multilingual lexical resources. The same specifications are to be used for both small and large lexicons, for both simple and complex lexicons, for both written and spoken lexical representations. The descriptions range from [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[computational semantics]] to [[computer-assisted translation]]. The covered languages are not restricted to [[Languages of Europe|European languages]] but cover all [[natural languages]]. The range of targeted NLP [[Application software|applications]] is not restricted. LMF is able to represent most lexicons, including [[WordNet]], EDR and PAROLE lexicons.

==History==
In the past, lexicon standardization has been studied and developed by a series of projects like GENELEX, EDR, EAGLES, MULTEXT, PAROLE, SIMPLE and ISLE. Then, the [[ISO/TC37]] National delegations decided to address standards dedicated to NLP and lexicon representation.
The work on LMF started in Summer 2003 by a new work item proposal issued by the US delegation. In Fall 2003, the French delegation issued a technical proposition for a [[data model]] dedicated to NLP lexicons. In early 2004, the ISO/TC37 committee decided to form a common ISO project with Nicoletta Calzolari ([[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]]-ILC Italy) as convenor and [[Gil Francopoulo]] (Tagmatica France) and Monte George ([[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] USA) as editors.
The first step in developing LMF was to design an overall framework based on the general features of existing lexicons and to develop a consistent terminology to describe the components of those lexicons. The next step was the actual design of a comprehensive model that best represented all of the lexicons in detail. A large panel of 60 experts contributed a wide range of requirements for LMF that covered many types of NLP lexicons. The editors of LMF worked closely with the panel of experts to identify the best solutions and reach a consensus on the design of LMF. Special attention was paid to the morphology in order to provide powerful mechanisms for handling problems in several languages that were known as difficult to handle. 13 versions have been written, dispatched (to the National nominated experts), commented and discussed during various ISO technical meetings. After five years of work, including numerous face-to-face meetings and e-mail exchanges, the editors arrived at a coherent UML model. In conclusion, LMF should be considered a synthesis of the state of the art in NLP lexicon field.

==Current stage==
The ISO number is 24613. The LMF specification has been published officially as an International Standard on 17 November 2008.

==As one of the members of the ISO/TC37 family of standards==
The ISO/TC37 standards are currently elaborated as high level [[specifications]] and deal with [[word segmentation]] (ISO 24614), [[annotations]] (ISO 24611 a.k.a. MAF, ISO 24612 a.k.a. LAF, ISO 24615 a.k.a. SynAF, and ISO 24617-1 a.k.a. SemAF/Time), [[feature structure]]s (ISO 24610), multimedia containers (ISO 24616 a.k.a. MLIF), and [[lexical markup framework|lexicons]] (ISO 24613).
These standards are based on low level specifications dedicated to constants, namely data categories (revision of ISO 12620), [[language code]]s ([[ISO 639]]), [[Writing system|scripts codes]] ([[ISO 15924]]), [[country code]]s ([[ISO 3166]]) and [[Unicode]] ([[ISO 10646]]).

The two level organization forms a coherent family of standards with the following common and simple rules:
* the high level specification provides structural elements that are adorned by the standardized constants; 
* the low level specifications provide standardized constants as metadata.

==Key standards==
The linguistics constants like /feminine/ or /transitive/ are not defined within LMF but are recorded in the Data Category Registry (DCR) that is maintained as a global resource by ISO/TC37 in compliance with ISO/IEC 11179-3:2003.&lt;ref name="inria1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/12/14/74/PDF/LREC2006WS-RI-20AprilBis.pdf |format=PDF |title=The relevance of standards for research infrastructures |website=Hal.inria.fr |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; And these constants are used to adorn the high level structural elements.

The LMF specification complies with the modeling principles of [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) as defined by [[Object Management Group]] (OMG). The structure is specified by means of UML class [[diagram]]s. The examples are presented by means of UML instance (or object) diagrams.

An XML [[Document Type Definition|DTD]] is given in an annex of the LMF document.

==Model structure==
LMF is composed of the following components:
* The core package that is the structural skeleton which describes the basic hierarchy of information in a lexical entry.
* Extensions of the core package which are expressed in a framework that describes the reuse of the core components in conjunction with the additional components required for a specific lexical resource.

The extensions are specifically dedicated to [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[Machine-readable dictionary|MRD]], [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] [[syntax]], [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] [[computational semantics|semantics]], [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] [[multilingual notation]]s, [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] [[morphological pattern]]s, [[multiword expression]] [[pattern]]s, and constraint expression [[pattern]]s.

==Example==
In the following example, the lexical entry is associated with a lemma ''clergyman'' and two inflected forms ''clergyman'' and ''clergymen''. The language coding is set for the whole lexical resource. The language value is set for the whole lexicon as shown in the following [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[instantiation (computer science)|instance]] diagram.

[[Image:LMFMorphoClergymanInflected.svg]]

The elements ''[[Lexical resource|Lexical Resource]]'', ''Global Information'', ''Lexicon'', ''Lexical Entry'', ''[[Lemma (morphology)|Lemma]]'', and ''Word Form'' define the structure of the lexicon. They are specified within the LMF document.
On the contrary, ''languageCoding'', ''language'', ''[[Lexical category|partOfSpeech]]'', ''commonNoun'', ''writtenForm'', ''[[Grammatical number|grammaticalNumber]]'', ''singular'', ''plural'' are data categories that are taken from the Data Category Registry. These marks adorn the structure. The values ''ISO 639-3'', ''clergyman'', ''clergymen'' are plain character strings. The value ''eng'' is taken from the list of languages as defined by [[ISO 639-3]].

With some additional information like ''dtdVersion'' and ''feat'', the same data can be expressed by the following [[XML]] fragment:

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;LexicalResource dtdVersion="15"&gt;
    &lt;GlobalInformation&gt;
        &lt;feat att="languageCoding" val="ISO 639-3"/&gt;
    &lt;/GlobalInformation&gt;
    &lt;Lexicon&gt;
        &lt;feat att="language" val="eng"/&gt;
        &lt;LexicalEntry&gt;
            &lt;feat att="partOfSpeech" val="commonNoun"/&gt;
            &lt;Lemma&gt;
                &lt;feat att="writtenForm" val="clergyman"/&gt;
            &lt;/Lemma&gt;
            &lt;WordForm&gt;
                 &lt;feat att="writtenForm" val="clergyman"/&gt;
                 &lt;feat att="grammaticalNumber" val="singular"/&gt;
            &lt;/WordForm&gt;
            &lt;WordForm&gt;
                &lt;feat att="writtenForm" val="clergymen"/&gt;
                &lt;feat att="grammaticalNumber" val="plural"/&gt;
            &lt;/WordForm&gt;
        &lt;/LexicalEntry&gt;
    &lt;/Lexicon&gt;
&lt;/LexicalResource&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This example is rather simple, while LMF can represent much more complex linguistic descriptions the XML tagging is correspondingly complex.

The following is a list of Irish language organisations who form part of the Irish Language Movement. There is no coordinating organisation or body for the entire movement. Up until 2014 [[Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge]] (The National Irish Language Congress) was the coordinating body of the Irish language voluntary sector on the island of Ireland but a new funding scheme implemented that year by [[Foras na Gaeilge]] ended funding to half of the organisations under Comhdháil's remit, including Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge itself. As part of the same new funding process six funded lead organisations were announced by Foras na Gaeilge with extra funding. These are: Gael Linn, Gaeloideachas, Cumann na bhFiann, Conradh na Gaeilge, Oireachtas na Gaeilge and Glór na nGael.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forasnagaeilge.ie/about/about-foras-na-gaeilge/a-partnership-approach/?lang=en// |title=A Partnership Approach |publisher=Foras na Gaeilge |date= |accessdate=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/treibh/ceanneagra%C3%ADochta%C3%AD-nua-roghnaithe-ag-foras-na-gaeilge-1.1663162/ |title=Ceanneagraíochtaí nua roghnaithe ag Foras na Gaeilge |publisher=The Irish Times |date= |accessdate=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/rnag/articles/sceala/2014/0130/501223-raiteas-o-fhoras-na-gaeilge// |title=Ráiteas ó Fhoras na Gaeilge |publisher=Raidió na Gaeltachta |date= |accessdate=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative checking''' is a process by which producers of film, television and radio programs will attempt to ensure that the names of [[fictional characters]] cannot be confused  with real life people. For instance, during the making of the series ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', the producers of the show checked with local police authorities to check that the names of characters used in the program could not be confused with individuals in any real life cases. The primary reason for this practice is to prevent any possible legal action for libel which could result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tort Law: Texts and Materials |last=Lunney |first=Mark |last2=Oliphant |first2=Ken |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-921136-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approximately 450 '''Oceanic languages''' are a well-established branch of the [[Austronesian languages]]. The area occupied by speakers of these languages includes [[Polynesia]], as well as much of [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]].

Though covering a vast area, Oceanic languages are spoken by only two million people. The largest individual Oceanic languages are [[Fijian language|Eastern Fijian]] with over 600,000 speakers, and [[Samoan language|Samoan]] with an estimated 400,000 speakers. The [[Gilbertese language|Kiribati (Gilbertese)]], [[Tongan language|Tongan]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Western Fijian language|Western Fijian]] and [[Kuanua language|Kuanua]] (Tolai) languages each have over 100,000 speakers.

The [[protolanguage|common ancestor]] which is reconstructed for this group of languages is called [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]] (abbr. "POc").

==Classification==
The Oceanic languages were first shown to be a [[language family]] by [[Sidney Herbert Ray]] in 1896 and, besides [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]], they are the only established large branch of [[Austronesian languages]]. Grammatically, they have been strongly influenced by the [[Papuan languages]] of northern [[New Guinea]], but they retain a remarkably large amount of Austronesian vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Donohue and Tim Denham, 2010. Farming and Language in Island Southeast Asia: Reframing Austronesian History. ''Current Anthropology'', 51(2):223–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lynch, Ross, &amp; Crowley (2002)===
According to Lynch, Ross, &amp; Crowley (2002), Oceanic languages often form [[linkage (linguistics)|linkages]] with each other. Linkages are formed when languages emerged historically from an earlier [[dialect continuum]]. The linguistic innovations shared by adjacent languages define a chain of intersecting subgroups (a ''linkage''), for which no distinct [[proto-language]] can be reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Wave model]] is more appropriate than the [[Tree model]] for representing such linkages: see {{Citation

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch, Ross, &amp; Crowley (2002) propose three primary groups of Oceanic languages:

*[[Admiralty Islands languages|Admiralties linkage]]: languages of [[Manus Island]], its offshore islands, and small islands to the west.
*[[Western Oceanic languages|Western Oceanic (WOc) linkage]]: languages of the north coast of [[Irian Jaya]], [[Papua New Guinea]] (excluding the [[Admiralties]]) and the western [[Solomon Islands]]. West Oceanic is made up of three or four sub-linkages and families:
:*? [[Sarmi–Jayapura languages|Sarmi–Jayapura linkage]]: maybe part of the [[North New Guinea languages|North New Guinea linkage]]?
:*[[North New Guinea languages|North New Guinea linkage]]: consists of languages of the north coast of New Guinea, east from [[Jayapura]].
:*[[Meso-Melanesian languages|Meso-Melanesian linkage]]: consists of languages of the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] and [[Solomon Islands]].
:*[[Papuan Tip languages|Papuan Tip linkage]]: consists of languages of the tip of the [[Papuan Peninsula]].
*[[Central–Eastern Oceanic languages|Central–Eastern Oceanic (CEOc) linkage]]: nearly all languages of [[Oceania]] not included in the Admiralties and Western Oceanic. Central–Eastern consists of four or five subgroups:
:*[[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic linkage]]: of the South East Solomon Islands.
:*([[Utupua–Vanikoro languages|Utupua–Vanikoro linkage]]: later removed to Temotu languages).
:*[[Southern Oceanic languages|Southern Oceanic linkage]]: consist of languages of [[New Caledonia]] and [[Vanuatu]].
:*[[Central Oceanic languages|Central Oceanic linkage]]: consists of the [[Polynesian languages]], and the languages of [[Fiji]].
:*[[Micronesian languages|Micronesian linkage]].

The "residues" (as they are called by Lynch, Ross, &amp; Crowley), which do not fit into the three groups above, but are still classified as Oceanic are:
*[[St Matthias languages|St. Matthias Islands linkage]].
*? [[Yapese language]]: of the island of [[Yap]]. Perhaps part of the Admiralties?

Ross &amp; Næss (2007) removed Utupua–Vanikoro, from Central–Eastern Oceanic, to a new primary branch of Oceanic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Ross, Malcolm]] and Åshild Næss | title= An Oceanic Origin for Äiwoo, the Language of the Reef Islands? | journal= Oceanic Linguistics | year= 2007 | volume= 46 | pages= 456–498 | doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Temotu languages|Temotu linkage]], named after the [[Temotu Province]] of the [[Solomon Islands]].

Blench (2014)&lt;ref name="Blench2014"/&gt; considers Utupua and Vanikoro to be two separate branches that are both non-Austronesian.

==Non-Austronesian languages==
[[Roger Blench]] (2014)&lt;ref name="Blench2014"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2014. ''[https://www.academia.edu/5838021/Lapita_canoes_and_their_multi-ethnic_crews_marginal_Austronesian_languages_are_non-Austronesian Lapita Canoes and Their Multi-Ethnic Crews: Might Marginal Austronesian Languages Be Non-Austronesian?]'' Paper presented at the Workshop on the Languages of Papua 3. 20-24 January 2014, Manokwari, West Papua, Indonesia.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that many Oceanic languages are in fact non-Austronesian (or "[[Papuan language|Papuan]]", which is a geographic rather genetic grouping), including [[Utupua languages|Utupua]] and [[Vanikoro languages|Vanikoro]]. Blench doubts that Utupua and Vanikoro are closely related, and thus should not be grouped together. Since each of the three Utupua and three Vanikoro languages are highly distinct from each other, Blench doubts that these languages had diversified on the islands of Utupua and Vanikoro, but had rather migrated to the islands from elsewhere. According to Blench, historically this was due to the [[Lapita culture|Lapita]] demographic expansion consisting of both Austronesian and non-Austronesian settlers migrating from the Lapita homeland in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] to various islands further to the east.

Other languages traditionally classified as Oceanic that Blench (2014) suspects are in fact non-Austronesian include the [[Kaulong language]] of [[West New Britain Province|West New Britain]], which has a [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]] vocabulary retention rate of only 5%, and [[New Caledonian languages|languages of the Loyalty Islands]] that are spoken just to the north of [[New Caledonia]].

Blench (2014) proposes that languages classified as:
*''Austronesian but perhaps actually non-Austronesian'' are spoken in northern [[Vanuatu]] and [[South Vanuatu languages|southern Vanuatu]] (various [[Southern Oceanic languages]]).
*''Austronesian, but may have experienced bilingualism with non-Austronesian'' are spoken in central [[Vanuatu]] and [[New Caledonian languages|New Caledonia]] (various [[Southern Oceanic languages]]).
*''non-Austronesian, with some other languages traditionally classified as Austronesian but perhaps actually non-Austronesian'' are spoken in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[New Britain]] ([[Meso-Melanesian languages]]).

==Word order==
Word order in Oceanic languages is highly diverse, and is distributed in the following geographic regions (Lynch, Ross, &amp; Crowley 2002:49).

*'''[[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]''': [[Admiralty Islands]], most of [[Markham Valley]], Siasi Islands, most of [[New Britain]], [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], some parts of [[Bougainville Island]], most parts of the southeast [[Solomon Islands]], most parts of [[Vanuatu]], some parts of [[New Caledonia]], most of [[Micronesia]]
*'''[[Subject–object–verb|SOV]]''': central and southeast [[Papua New Guinea]], some parts of [[Markham Valley]], [[Madang]] coast, [[Wewak]] coast, Sarmi coast, a few parts of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], some parts of [[New Britain]]
*'''[[Verb–subject–object|VSO]]''': [[New Georgia]], some parts of [[Santa Ysabel Island]], much of [[Polynesia]], [[Yap]]
*'''[[Verb–object–subject|VOS]]''': [[Fijian language]], [[Anejom language]], [[Loyalty Islands]], [[Kiribati]], many parts of [[New Caledonia]], [[Nggela]]
*'''[[Topic-prominent language|TVX]]''' (where T = topic, V = verb, X = arguments other than topic): much of [[Bougainville Island]], [[Choiseul Island]], some parts of [[Santa Ysabel Island]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21389">The [[phonology]] of the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] language (also '''Ojibwa''', '''Ojibway''', or '''Chippewa''', and most commonly referred to in the language as '''Anishinaabemowin''') varies from [[dialects|dialect]] to dialect, but all varieties share common features. Ojibwe is an [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous language]] of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language family spoken in Canada and the United States in the areas surrounding the [[Great Lakes]], and westward onto the northern plains in both countries, as well as in northeastern [[Ontario]] and northwestern [[Quebec]]. The article on [[Ojibwe dialects]] discusses linguistic variation in more detail, and contains links to separate articles on each dialect. There is no standard language and no dialect that is accepted as representing a standard.  Ojibwe words in this article are written in the practical orthography commonly known as  the [[Ojibwe writing systems#Double vowel system|Double vowel system]].

Ojibwe dialects have the same phonological inventory of [[vowels]] and [[consonants]] with minor variations, but some dialects differ considerably along a number of phonological parameters. For example, the [[Ottawa language|Ottawa]] and [[Eastern Ojibwa language|Eastern Ojibwe]] dialects have changed relative to other dialects by adding a process of vowel [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] that deletes short vowels in specified positions within a word.

This article primarily uses examples from the [[Chippewa language|Southwestern Ojibwe]] dialect spoken in Minnesota and Wisconsin, sometimes also known as ''Ojibwemowin''.

{{IPA notice}}

==Phonemes==
Ojibwe dialects tend to have 29 [[phoneme]]s: 11 [[vowel]]s (seven [[oral vowel|oral]] and four [[nasal vowel|nasal]]) and 18 [[consonant]]s.

===Vowels===
All dialects of Ojibwe have seven [[Nasal vowel|oral vowels]]. [[Vowel length]] is phonologically [[Contrastive distribution|contrastive]], hence [[Phoneme|phonemic]]. Although the long and short vowels are phonetically distinguished by vowel quality, recognition of vowel length in phonological representations is required, as the distinction between [[Vowel length|long]] and [[Vowel length|short vowel]]s  is essential for the operation of the [[Metrical phonology|metrical]] rule of [[Ottawa language#Vowel syncope|vowel syncope]] that characterizes the Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe dialects, as well as for the rules that determine [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Valentine|2001|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There are three short vowels, {{IPA|/i a o/}}; and three corresponding long vowels, {{IPA|/iː aː oː/}}, in addition to a fourth long vowel {{IPA|/eː/}}, which lacks a corresponding short vowel. The short vowel /i/ typically has phonetic values centering on {{IPA|[ɪ]}}; {{IPA|/a/}} typically has values centering on {{IPA|[ə]~[ʌ]}}; and {{IPA|/o/}} typically has values centering on {{IPA|[o]~[ʊ]}}. Long {{IPA|/oː/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[uː]}} for many speakers, and {{IPA|/eː/}} is for many {{IPA|[ɛː]}}.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Rhodes|1985}} for the Ottawa dialect and {{Harvcoltxt|Nichols|Nyholm|1995}} for the Southwestern Ojibwe dialect.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ojibwe has a series of three short oral vowels and four long ones. The two series are characterized by both [[vowel length|length]] and quality differences. The short vowels are {{IPA|/ɪ o ə/}} (roughly the vowels in American English ''bit'', ''bot'', and ''but'', respectively) and the long vowels are {{IPA|/iː oː aː eː/}} (roughly as in American English ''beet'', ''boat'', ''ball'', and ''bay'' respectively). In the Minnesota variety of Southwestern Ojibwe language, {{IPA|/o/}} varies between {{IPAblink|o}} and {{IPAblink|ʊ}} and {{IPA|/oo/}} varies between {{IPA|[oː]}} and {{IPAblink|u|uː}}. {{IPA|/eː/}} also may be pronounced {{IPAblink|ɛ|ɛː}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} as {{IPAblink|ʌ}}.

Ojibwe has [[nasal vowel]]s; some arise predictably by rule in all analyses, and other long nasal vowels are of uncertain phonological status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nichols|1980|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter have been analysed both as underlying [[phoneme]]s,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also as predictable, that is derived by the operation of phonological rules from sequences of a long vowel followed by {{IPA|/n/}} and another segment, typically {{IPA|/j/}}.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Piggott|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long nasal vowels are ''iinh'' ({{IPA|[ĩː]}}), ''enh'' ({{IPA|[ẽː]}}), ''aanh'' ({{IPA|[ãː]}}), and ''oonh'' ({{IPA|[õː]}}). They most commonly occur in the final syllable of nouns with [[diminutive]] suffixes or words with a diminutive connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Valentine|2001|pp=185–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ottawa dialect long nasal ''aanh'' ({{IPA|[ãː]}}) occurs as well as in the suffix ''(y)aanh'' ([-({{IPA|(j)ãː]}}) marking the first person (conjunct) animate intransitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Valentine|2001|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples from Southwestern Ojibwe include: ''-iijikiwenh-'' ('brother'), ''-noshenh-'' ('cross-aunt'), ''-oozhishenh-'' ('grandchild') ''bineshiinh'' ('bird'), ''asabikeshiinh'' ('spider'), and ''awesiinh'' ('wild animal').

Orthographically the long vowel is followed by word-final {{angbr|nh}} to indicate that the vowel is nasal; while {{angbr|n}} is a common indicator of nasality in many languages such as French, the use of {{angbr|h}} is an orthographic convention and does not correspond to an independent sound.&lt;ref name="Valentine 2001 40"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Valentine|2001|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One analysis of the Ottawa dialect treats the long nasal vowels as [[Phoneme|phonemic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1958|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another treats them as derived from sequences of long vowel followed by {{IPA|/n/}} and underlying {{IPA|/h/}}; the latter sound is converted to {{IPA|[ʔ]}} or deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Piggott|1980|pp=110–111}}. Piggott's transcription of words containing long nasal vowels differs from those of Rhodes, Bloomfield, and Valentine by allowing for an optional {{IPA|[ʔ]}} after the long nasal vowel in phonetic forms.&lt;/ref&gt; Other discussions of the issue in Ottawa are silent on the issue.&lt;ref name="Valentine 2001 40"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rhodes|1985|p=xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa) dialect spoken in Minnesota describes the status of the analogous vowels as unclear, noting that while the distribution of the long nasal vowels is restricted, there is a [[minimal pair]] distinguished only by the nasality of the vowel: ''giiwe'' {{IPA|[ɡiːweː]}} ('he goes home') and ''giiwenh'' {{IPA|[ɡiːwẽː]}} ('so the story goes').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nichols|1980|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasalized allophones of the short vowels also exist. The nasal allophones of oral vowels are derived from a short vowel followed by a nasal+fricative cluster (for example, ''imbanz'', 'I'm singed') is {{IPA|[ɪmbə̃z]}}). For many speakers, the nasal allophones appear not only before nasal+fricative clusters, but also before all fricatives, particularly if the vowel is preceded by another nasal. E.g., for some speakers, ''waabooz'', ('rabbit') is pronounced {{IPA|[waːbõːz]}}, and for many, ''mooz'', ('moose') is pronounced {{IPA|[mõːz]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nichols|Nyholm|1995|p=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nlphon"&gt;{{cite web |author=Redish, Laura and Orrin Lewis |url=http://www.native-languages.org/ojibwe_guide.htm |title=Ojibwe Pronunciation and Spelling Guide |work=Native-Languages.org |accessdate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced/voiceless]]" [[obstruent]] pairs of Ojibwe vary in their realization depending on the dialect. In many dialects, they are described as having a "[[lenis]]/[[fortis and lenis|fortis]]" contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imp.lss.wisc.edu/~jrvalent/ais301/Grammar/Phonology/Phonol009.html |title=Consonants: Strong and Weak |work=Anishinaabemowin |author=Valentine, J. Randolph |accessdate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this analysis, all obstruents are considered voiceless. The '''fortis''' consonants are characterised by being pronounced more strongly and are longer in duration. They often are [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] or [[preaspiration|preaspirated]]. The '''lenis''' consonants are often voiced, especially between vowels, although they often tend to be voiceless at the end of words. They are pronounced less strongly and are shorter in duration, compared to the fortis ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Valentine|2001|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some communities, the lenis/fortis distinction has been replaced with a pure voiced/voiceless one.

In some dialects of Saulteaux (Plains Ojibwe), the sounds of {{angbr|sh}} and {{angbr|zh}} have merged with {{angbr|s}} and {{angbr|z}} respectively. This means that, for example, Southwestern Ojibwe ''wazhashk'', ('muskrat') is pronounced the same as ''wazask'' in some dialects of Saulteaux.  This merging creates additional consonant clusters of {{IPA|/sp/}} and {{IPA|/st/}} in addition to {{IPA|/sk/}} common in all Anishinaabe dialects.

{{IPA|/n/}} before velars becomes {{IPAblink|ŋ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nichols|Nyholm|1995|p=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glottal consonant|glottal]] fricative {{IPA|/h/}} occurs infrequently in most dialects, only appearing in a handful of expressive words and [[interjection]]s, but in a few dialects it has taken the place of {{IPAslink|ʔ}}.

==Phonotactics==

Ojibwe in general permits relatively few consonant clusters, and most are only found word-medially. The permissible ones are -''sk''-, -''shp''-, -''sht''-, -''shk''- (which can also appear word-finally), -''mb''-, -''nd''- (which can also appear word-finally),-''ng''- (also word-finally), -''nj''- (also word-finally), -''nz''-, -''nzh''- (also word-finally) and -''ns''- (also word-finally). Furthermore, any consonant (except ''w'', ''h'', or ''y'') and some clusters can be followed by ''w'' (although not word-finally).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nichols|Nyholm|1995|p=xxvii-xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many dialects, however, permit far more clusters as a result of vowel [[Ojibwe phonology#Phonological processes|syncope]].

==Prosody==

Ojibwe divides words into metrical "feet." Counting from the beginning of the word, each group of two syllables constitutes a foot; the first syllable in a foot is weak, the second strong. However, long vowels and vowels in the last syllable of a word are always strong, so if they occur in the weak slot of a foot, then they form a separate one-syllable foot, and counting resumes starting with the following vowel. The final syllable of a word is always strong as well.&lt;ref name="nlphon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Valentine|2001|pp=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word ''bebezhigooganzhii'' ('horse') is divided into feet as (be)(be)(zhi-goo)(gan-zhii). The strong syllables all receive at least secondary stress. The rules that determine which syllable receives the primary stress are quite complex and many words are irregular. In general, though, the strong syllable in the third foot from the end of a word receives the primary stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Weshki-ayaad |url=http://weshki.googlepages.com/oj_stress.html |title=My own notes about stress in Ojibwe |work=Anishinaabemowin: Ojibwe Language |accessdate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Valentine|2001|pp=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonological processes==

A defining characteristic of several of the more eastern dialects is that they exhibit a great deal of vowel [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], the deletion of vowels in certain positions within a word. In some dialects (primarily Odawa and Eastern Ojibwe), all unstressed vowels are lost (see [[Ojibwe phonology#Prosody|above]] for a discussion of Ojibwe stress). In other dialects (such as some dialects of Central Ojibwe), short vowels in initial syllables are lost, but not in other unstressed syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rhodes|Todd|1981|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word ''oshkinawe'' ('young man') of Algonquin and Southwestern Ojibwe (stress: ''oshk'''i'''naw'''e''''') is ''shkinawe'' in some dialects of Central Ojibwe and ''shkinwe'' in Eastern Ojibwe and Odawa. Regular, pervasive syncope is a comparatively recent development, arising in the past eighty years or so{{When|date=October 2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Valentine|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common [[Morphophonemic|morphophonemic variation]] occurs in some verbs whose roots end in -''n''. When the root is followed by certain suffixes beginning with ''i'' or when it is word-final, the root-final -''n'' changes to -''zh'' (e.g., -''miin''-, 'to give something to someone' but ''gimiizhim'', 'you guys give it to me'). In Ojibwe linguistics, this is indicated when writing the root with the symbol {{angbr|N}} (so the root 'to give something to someone' would be written {{angbr|miiN}}). There are also some morphophonemic alternations where root-final -''s'' changes to -''sh'' (indicated with {{angbr|S}}) and where root-final -''n'' changes to -''nzh'' (indicated with {{angbr|nN}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nichols|Nyholm|1995|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some dialects, obstruents become voiceless/fortis after the tense preverbs ''gii-'' (marking the past) and ''wii-'' (marking the future/desiderative). In such dialects, for example, ''gii-baapi'' ({{IPA|[ɡiː baːpːɪ]}}) ('s/he laughed') becomes {{IPA|[ɡiː pːaːpːɪ]}} (often spelled ''gii-paapi'').

==Historical phonology==

In the evolution from [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] to Ojibwe, the most sweeping change was the [[Voiced consonant|voicing]] of all Proto-Algonquian [[Voiceless consonant|voiceless]] [[obstruent]]s except when they were in clusters with *h, *ʔ, *θ, or *s (which were subsequently lost). Proto-Algonquian *r and *θ became Ojibwe {{IPA|/n/}}.

The relatively symmetrical Proto-Algonquian vowel system, *i, *i·, *e, *e·, *a, *a·, *o, *o· remained fairly intact in Ojibwe, although *e and *i merged as {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, and the short vowels, as described above, underwent a quality change as well.

Some examples of the changes at work are presented in the table below:

'''Philippe Alexandre Autexier''' (1954–1998) was a French [[music historian]], [[musicologist]], journalist and [[Masonic]] researcher, whose research on [[Mozart]] and other Masonic composers is particularly significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.netzwerk-freimaurerforschung.de/blog/wordpress/?page_id=105 |title=Zwei Arbeiten aus dem Nachlass Philippe Autexier |website=Netzwerk Freimaurerforschung |accessdate=2018-02-16 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Autexier was passionate about music, his research led him to become a musicologist and music historian, a speaker who expressed in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.editionsdetradavs.com/contents/fr/d3_Autexier_Philippe.html |title=Autexier, Philippe : Biographie |website=Éditions Detrad |accessdate=2018-02-16 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught at several [[Music school|conservatories]] and universities in France, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States. He has written music reviews for various specialised journals, and a number of books on [[Mozart]], [[Liszt]], [[Bartók]] and other [[Freemason]] musicians. He was director of the “{{lang|fr|Mozart et franc maçon|italic=no}}” (Mozart and Freemason) exhibition in 1991 in [[Cahors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ina.fr/video/TLC9109251804 |title=Exposition Mozart et franc maçon à Cahors |website=[[ina.fr]] |accessdate=2018-02-16 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also participated in many radio programmes, such as [[France Musique]], [[France Culture]], [[BBC Radio]], as well as [[Germany|German]] and [[Swiss]] channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.decitre.fr/livres/beethoven-9782070394234.html |title=Beethoven - La force de l'absolu : À propos de l'auteur |website={{ill|Decitre|fr}} |accessdate=2018-02-16 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.babelio.com/auteur/Philippe-Alexandre-Autexier/188749 |title=Philippe Alexandre Autexier |website=Babelio |accessdate=2018-02-16 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During more than 20 years, he worked on the subject of “{{lang|fr|Colonne d’Harmonie}}” (Column of Harmony)—a research on the [[Masonic music]] history—which led him to study all the collections of Masonic archives in Europe ([[Paris]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Zürich]], [[Vienna]], [[Bayreuth]], [[Berlin]], [[Poznań]], [[The Hague]], et cetera). The research results have been published in his book {{lang|fr|La Colonne d’Harmonie : Histoire, Théorie, Pratique|italic=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.detrad.com/contents/fr/p3181_La_Colonne_d_Harmonie_-_Philippe_Autexier.html |title=La Colonne d'Harmonie - Philippe Autexier |website=detrad.com |accessdate=2018-02-16 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Autexier’s publications, the only work for the general public is {{lang|fr|Beethoven : La force de l’absolu|italic=yes}}, which is a heavily illustrated [[Pocket edition|pocket book]] belonging to the [[Collection (publishing)|collection]] “[[Découvertes Gallimard]]” and has been translated into seven languages, including English. It is simple, concise and accessible to all, unlike the rest of his books which are elitist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7270">The '''Plain English Campaign''' ('''PEC''') is a commercial editing and training firm based in the [[United Kingdom]]. Founded in 1979 by [[Chrissie Maher]], the company is a world leader in [[plain language|plain-language]] advocacy, working to persuade organisations in the UK and abroad to communicate with the public in plain language. Maher was awarded the [[OBE]] in 1994 for her services to plain communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=53527 |date=1993-12-31 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, PEC created the Crystal Mark, its seal of approval. This is a symbol printed on documents that it considers to be as clear as possible for the intended audience. The symbol appears on over 20,000 documents worldwide. They also give out the annual [[Foot in Mouth Award]] for "a baffling comment by a public figure"&lt;ref name="fima"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/foot_in_mouth_award/ |work=Plain English Campaign |title=Bush leaves White House with Lifetime Achievement Award from Plain English Campaign |accessdate=2009-05-15 |year=2008 |publisher=www.plainenglish.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216035439/http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/foot_in_mouth_award/ |archivedate=February 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Golden Bull Award]] for "the worst examples of written tripe".&lt;ref name="gba"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/awards/ | work = Plain English Campaign | title = PEC Awards | accessdate = 2009-05-15| year = 2008 | publisher = www.plainenglish.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable winners of the Foot in Mouth Award include [[Donald Trump]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Gordon Brown]], [[Richard Gere]], and [[Donald Rumsfeld]].

PEC has worked all over the world for companies and organisations including [[British Gas]],&lt;ref&gt;British Gas, [http://www.britishgas.co.uk/business/what-we-do/credentials.html] "British Gas website"&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Telecom]],&lt;ref&gt;BT Today, [http://www.btplc.com/today/art73690.html "Help site is crystal clear"] "Bttoday newslist", January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irish Life]],&lt;ref&gt;Irish Life, [http://www.leadershipfactor.co.uk/files/irish-life.pdf "Irish Life case study"] "Case study", December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Telefónica O2]]&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Wardle, [http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/adr/responses/o2.pdf "Ofcom review of alternative dispute resolution schemes"] "Report and draft recommendations", 4 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and the World Bowls association.&lt;ref&gt;World Bowls, [http://www.worldbowlsltd.co.uk/laws/index.html "Laws of the sport of bowls"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409002720/http://www.worldbowlsltd.co.uk/laws/index.html |date=2011-04-09 }} "World Bowls", 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also worked with the majority of UK council and government departments. Many UK forms and bills carry the Crystal Mark, including the [[British passport]] application form.&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Office,

PEC is often described in the media as a [[pressure group]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Majendie,
[https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSL117878120071211 "George Bush loses close run for Foot in Mouth"] Reuters, 11 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and regularly makes public comment about language-related news stories, particularly [[jargon]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Lagerkvist, [http://blog.digitalhomemag.com/page/digitalhome?entry=id_theft_special_is_jargon "ID theft special: is jargon confusing computer users?"] "Digital Home", 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 it criticised a consultation document sent to residents living near [[Heathrow Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;UK Airport News,[http://www.uk-airport-news.info/heathrow-airport-news-230108a.htm "MP and Plain English Campaign back calls to extend Heathrow consultation"] "Heathrow Airport news", 23 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The year before, it mocked signs put up by police in Hertfordshire that warned the public not to commit crime.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6992544.stm "Police mocked for 'obvious' signs"] "BBC News website", 13 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 its supporters voted [[Bill Shankly]] the author of the greatest footballing quotation of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Sky News, [http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,91167-13531842,00.html "Best Footie Quote Ever?"] "Sky News website", 7 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 survey revealed that "At the end of the day" was considered the most irritating cliché.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3563229.stm "Campaign's call to ditch cliches"] "BBC News website", 24 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous supporters of PEC include [[Margaret Thatcher]] &lt;ref&gt;[Margaret Thatcher, &amp;quot;Plain English Campaign&amp;quot; D. E. Ager, ''Ideology and Image: Britain and Language''], May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and broadcaster [[John Humphrys]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC Press Office, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/news/johnhumphrys.shtml "John Humphrys"] "Biographies", December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

PEC has been criticised by writer [[Oliver Kamm]], who wrote: "The joke – not that it's funny – is that a body ostensibly concerned with clarity of language is both incompetent in its own use of English and heedless of the task it sets itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Oliver |last=Kamm |authorlink=Oliver Kamm |title=Plain English Baloney II|date=March 24, 2004 |url=http://oliverkamm.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/plain_english_b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different point of view was given by Tom McArthur, editor of ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', who said, "In all the history of the language, there has never been such a powerful grassroots movement to influence it as Plain English Campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/38503.stm  | title = Plain speaking is no joke  | work = BBC News  | date = 10 December 1997  | accessdate = 30 September 2010  | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 PEC criticised the [[Met Office]] for using the phrase "probabilities of precipitation" instead of "rain is likely". The Met Office responded by explaining that precipitation does not mean only rain. A Met Office spokesman said: "Precipitation covers a wide range of stuff falling from the sky including rain, sleet, snow, hail, drizzle, and even cats and dogs – but sums it up in just one word."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16100112 |title=Plain English award for Met Office 'gobbledygook' |publisher=BBC News |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In alignment with [[postmodern marketing]], '''postmodern branding''' hinges on personifying the brand based on a core set of traits as opposed to creating templates, blueprints or guidelines.  Postmodern branding is more about understanding and leveraging technology, space and mindset of the moment to create an enriched user experience. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Idris Mootee cites in, “Branding in the Post-Modern Culture When Consumer Transcends the State of Being the Subject in a Society” that brands are becoming more and more important in this day of age.  When looking at how the media ecosystem has evolved with the developments of [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], mobile codes and [[video]], a marketer can see that the brand “exists beyond the ads and the products”.  As a result brands have found new ways to enter the home and places in the consumers life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futurelab.be/blogs/marketing-strategy-innovation/2007/10/branding_in_the_postmodern_cul.html
|title=Branding in the Post-Modern Culture When Consumer Transcends the State of Being the subject in a Society |publisher=FutureLab.com |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This newly developed entryway and space usually takes the form of [[branded content]], [[branded entertainment]], branded utilities,   and most importantly brand personification (which occurs when the brand is treated and engaged with as one would engage with a physical person.  i.e. make appointments with, talk to, touching, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futurelab.be/blogs/marketing-strategy-innovation/2007/10/branding_in_the_postmodern_cul.html

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These are behaviors predominantly found in the daily life of the postmodern consumer.  Watching scheduled [[TV]] programs, utilizing and interacting with voice recognition services like [[Siri (software)|Siri]] are examples of how branded content and utilities are becoming more predominate within our current culture.  Although some examples are eroding away like scheduled TV viewing (according to [[JD Power and Associates]] roughly 45% of cable TV service customer have a [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] subscription, which is up from 38% in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.telecompetitor.com/dvrs-fueling-video-arpu-growth-telcos-beat-cable-for-tv-satisfaction/ |title=Residential Television Service Satisfaction Study |publisher=telecompetitor.com |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), others are introduces with remarkable interfaces and user engagement protocols.  Mobile applications like [[Siri (software)|Siri]] allow users interact with their phone at treat it like a personal assistant.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Successful branding within the postmodern society rely more on the developments of brand personality.  Developing brand personality sets the stage in identifying deeper meaning around “How it, the brand, works.”&lt;ref name="Warschauer"&gt;{{cite journal

According to this theory, inherent traits (habitual patterns, thoughts and emotions) are perceived to remain relatively stable over time.&lt;ref&gt; [[Saul Kassin]], (2003). ''Psychology''. USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc. &lt;/ref&gt; Holding inherent traits constant while manipulating environmental cues and situational stimuli, natural personalities emerge.  When applied to marketing, this process is called a brand-trait observational research study. By performing such studies a brand is able to extract “marketable” personalities; thus creating “livable brand personas”.  These personas are then used to help brands live better and more fluently within social destinations, communities and strategist around technical road maps, developments and customer interactions.

The '''"Power of Women"''' (''Weibermacht'' in German) is a medieval and Renaissance artistic and [[literary topos]], showing "heroic or wise men dominated by women", presenting "an admonitory and often humorous inversion of the male-dominated sexual hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  It was defined by [[Susan L. Smith]] as "the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history, or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of women, the power of love, and the trials of marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babinsky|first=Elen L.|year=1997|title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[American Society of Church History |Church History]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=340–341 |doi=10.2307/3170688 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2298424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith argues that the topos is not simply a "straightforward manifestation of medieval antifeminism"; rather, it is "a site of contest through which conflicting ideas about gender roles could be expressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|editor=Margaret Schaus|title=Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDhOv6hgN2IC&amp;pg=PA845 |year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0415969444 |pages=844–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''c.f.'' Nurse p. 1, who characterises it as arising from the complex religious and social turmoil provoked by the European Reformation of the sixteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith argues the topos originates in classical literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millett |first=Bella |date=22 September 1997 |title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[Medium Aevum]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Power+of+Women%3A+A+%27Topos%27+in+Medieval+Art+and+Literature.-a020331549}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finds it in medieval texts such as ''[[Aucassin et Nicolette]]'', ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]'', the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=Harp208&gt;Harp p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  The topos was attacked by [[Christine de Pizan]] around 1400, who argued that if women wrote these accounts their interpretations would be different from those of men.&lt;ref name= Wolfthal&gt;Wolfthal p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, images are found in various media, mainly from the 14th century onwards, and becoming increasingly popular in the 15th century. By then the frequently recurring subjects include [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], [[The tale of Phyllis and Aristotle|Phyllis riding Aristotle]], [[Samson in popular culture#Art|Samson and Delilah]], [[Salome]] and her mother [[Herodias]], [[Jael]] killing [[Sisera]], [[Bathsheba]] bathing in sight of [[David]], the idolatry of [[Solomon]], [[Virgil in his basket]], as well as many depictions of witches, and genre images of wives dominating their husbands. The last group came to be called the '''battle for the trousers'''.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87; "''strijd om de broek''" in sixteenth century Netherlandish literature and printmaking.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar|Potiphar's wife]] and [[Lot (biblical person)#Lot and his daughters|Lot and his Daughters]] were somewhat late joiners to the group, but increasingly popular later on.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 147–148, Nos 20–32 (Judith), 87–110, 120–125; Ainsworth, pp. 59–66; Salomon, pp. 87–88; Hall, 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomyris]], the [[Scythian]] queen who defeated [[Cyrus the Great]] and abused his corpse, was painted by Rubens and several Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

These scenes, mostly shown in consistent compositions involving just two persons and visually distinctive actions, were easily recognisable and seem to have also been represented dramatically in entertainments of various sorts, whether as short scenes or [[tableaux vivants]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear who first coined the term ''Weibermacht'', but it had evidently gained currency in the sixteenth century [[Northern Renaissance]] in Germany and the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Nurse p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==

In early images from the Gothic period genre subjects or "classical" ones such as ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' and ''Virgil in his Basket'', in fact both medieval legendary accretions, were more popular than the biblical ones predominating later. They often appear on the same pieces as the [[Assault on the Castle of Love]], as on a [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|casket in Baltimore]]. This and similar subjects of [[courtly love]] mostly survive on ivory objects for female use, such as caskets or mirror-cases. It shows ladies defending a castle against men, generally unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:A woman defends her castle.jpg|But not always]]. More typically the only real resistance is Cupid firing arrows.&lt;/ref&gt; These images are essentially light-hearted romantic fantasy given a comic treatment; such scenes were sometimes staged as light relief at [[tournament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Sherman Loomis|Loomis, Roger Sherman]], "The Allegorical Siege in the Art of the Middle Ages", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep., 1919), pp.&amp;nbsp;255–269,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/497460 JSTOR (free)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Power of Women theme is especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art from the sixteenth century, which depicts "images drawn from historical, mythological, and biblical sources that illustrate women's power over men, specifically as a result of their sexual attractiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the stories involve the killing of the male, and this and their religious context effectively remove much of the comic potential of the group, but by no means the erotic possibilites exploited by many artists.

The question of the attitudes shown towards violence by women in the cause of virtue is perhaps best seen in the figure of [[Jael]], whose killing of Sisera by hammering a tent peg into his head makes an especially graphic image. According to some feminist critics, depictions of her turned hostile in the Renaissance, and like Judith she is certainly grouped with "bad" figures such as Herodias and Delilah. Yet she was included, with Judith and Esther, as one of [[Hans Burgkmair]]'s "Drei Gut Judin" ("Three Good Jewesses") trio of Biblical heroines in his ''Eighteen Worthies'', adding nine women to the traditional male [[Nine Worthies]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 29&amp;ndash;39, No 1; Wolfthal, Diane (October 2000).

The Power of Women subjects are seen in painting and other media, but [[old master print|prints]] were their special home. [[Lucas van Leyden]] made two sets of [[woodcut]]s known as ''[[Lucas van Leyden|The Large and Small Power of Women]]''. The subjects featured include [[Adam and Eve]], Samson and Delilah, King Solomon, [[Herod the Great|Herod]] and Herodias, Jael and Sisera, and, less usually, [[Jezebel]] and [[Ahab|King Ahab]]. The woodcuts have somewhat static compositions, and it has been suggested that they draw from [[tableaux vivants]] of the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 119, 153, Large: Nos 90, 96, 100; Small: Nos 66, 92; Snyder, 461-462. The small set, of 1516&amp;ndash;19 included the scenes with Eve, Jael, Delilah, Solomon, Jezebel and Herodias, the large set of c. 1512 added Virgil and the legend of the ''[[Bocca della Verità]]'' or "Mouth of Truth" in Rome. The ''Aristotle and Phyllis'' of c. 1515 is in the same format but may be a later addition. Since no museum has a full set on the same paper they may have been sold mainly singly.&lt;/ref&gt; Another set by [[Hans Burgkmair]] (1519) is known as the ''Liebestorheiten'' or ''Follies of Love''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 160, Nos 94, 97. This set contains: ''Samson and Delilah'', Bathsheba and David, The Idolatry of Solomon, and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time there was also an interest, often among the same artists, in women from similar settings who were powerless, or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], [[Lucretia]], and [[Verginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Little Masters]] were among those artists greatly interested in both groups. The treatment of both groups, especially in prints, was often frankly erotic, and these groups took their place alongside female saints and lovers both mythological and realistic in the common treatments of women in art. Interest in such themes spread to Italy, affecting [[Venice]] first, and the subjects became common in Late Renaissance Italian painting, and even more so during the Baroque, perhaps culminating in the work of [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], who painted nearly all the biblical Power of Women subjects, most more than once. While her choice of subjects is assumed to be driven by her difficult life, [[Cristofano Allori]]'s best known work, ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'', uses as models his former mistress for [[Book of Judith|Judith]], with her mother as the maid, and a self-portrait for the head of [[Holofernes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, ''The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque'', p.270, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|9781902163291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern painting, the Cranachs were the first artists to paint the subjects often.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513 [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] decorated the nuptial bed of [[John, Elector of Saxony]] with a set of scenes including ''The Idolatry of Solomon'' as well as ''[[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]]'' (see below) and the ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''. The respective sons of the patron and artist, [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], generated another set of paintings, now in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility has been raised that some of the Cranach workshop's many ''Judith''s are portraits of ladies at the Saxon court;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, pp. 63&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt; some other paintings of Jael certainly are portraits.

===Themes and context===
[[File:Lucas van Leyden Arisztotelész és Phyllis.jpg|thumb|left|''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'', [[Lucas van Leyden]]]]
Several of these subjects contain a part-comical element of [[role reversal]] in a society that was essentially patriarchal, above all the "quintessential image from the Power of Women topos, ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle''."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Phyllis and Aristotle dates from the early 13th century (when the ''Lai d'Aristote'' was written) and became the subject of popular poems, plays and moralizing sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Boitani &amp; Torti p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was first analysed by [[Natalie Zemon Davis]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;"Women on Top" in her ''Society and Culture in Early Modern France: Eight Essays, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1975''&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded that the "overall functions" of these reversals was that "they afforded an expression of, and an outlet for, conflicts about authority within the system; and they also provided occasions by which the authoritarian current in family, workshop, and political life could be moderated by the laughter of disorder and paradoxical play. Accordingly they served to reinforce hierarchical structure".&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Zemon Davis, "Women on Top", quoted by Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The role reversal subject of [[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]] did not fit the main Power of Women trope, as Hercules' period serving Omphale was not caused by interaction between them, and they later married. It became popular from the 16th century, and the Cranach family painted many versions showing Omphale and her ladies dressing Hercules in drag.&lt;ref&gt;For a long analysis of the theme, see Rosenthal, Lisa, "Hercules' Distaff", especially p. 128 ff, in ''Gender, Politics, and Allegory in the Art of Rubens'', 2005, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521842441}}, 9780521842440, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIa0iUVpGbcC&amp;pg=PA128 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' was painted on the walls of several German [[town hall]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt; though the design [[Albrecht Dürer]] made for [[Nuremberg]], as part of a Power of Women cycle, was never carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Foister p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some sets of prints have ornamental borders that suggest they were intended to be pasted to walls, as many larger prints were. While many of the smaller prints were probably mostly seen by male collectors and their friends, these paintings and wall-mounted prints "must have been intended to entertain or amuse both men and women".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234&amp;ndash;235. Dürer's [[watercolour]] design is in the [[Morgan Library]] ([[:File:Albrecht Dürer - Design for Decoration of the Town Hall of Nuremberg.jpg|see Commons image]]), and has roundels with Bathsheba and David, [[Samson and Delilah (disambiguation)|Samson and Delilah]], and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Florentine [[Otto prints]], essentially designed for a female audience, show women triumphing over men, though most show pacific scenes of lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=756921&amp;partId=1 example, British Museum]. This collection, in the [[British Museum]] is the pattern book of a workshop probably making inserts for small boxes of sweet delicacies such as were given to the guests at weddings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large prints intended for walls, where Power of Women subjects are especially common, adopt a different type of composition from the small prints with a few figures, showing large and well-populated panoramic scenes where the key figures can be hard to pick out. ''David and Bathsheba'' or Salome's story are set amid wide townscapes, and Judith kills Holofernes in a corner of a huge battle scene in front of a walled city.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, p. 154, Nos. 96, 158, 160; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of witchcraft specifically and almost exclusively with women was a novelty of the late 15th century, for which the book ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1486) remains an emblem, though its significance has been questioned. The interpretation of the many images of witches has been the subject of considerable scholarly interest in recent decades, and many differing interpretations have been put forward. As well as allowing scope for imaginative fantasy, an erotic element is clear, above all in the work of [[Hans Baldung Grien]], the artist most associated with the subject. The seriousness with which either the artist or their audience took the reality of witchcraft has been questioned; to some extent these seem to have been the [[horror movie]]s of their day.&lt;ref&gt;Zika, Charles, "Images of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe", in Levack, Brian P. (ed), ''The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America'', 2013, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199578168}}, 9780199578160, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lum96_FPZp0C&amp;pg=PA143 Google Books]; Russell, pp. 14, 147&amp;ndash;148, Nos 103&amp;ndash;105; Harbison, Craig. ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'', pp. 120&amp;ndash;121, 1995, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, {{ISBN|0297835122}}; Bartrum, 69&amp;ndash;70; there is a further account of the development of scholarship by Zika in [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRvhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 pp. 48&amp;ndash;65 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Witch of Endor]] was a previously obscure subject that allowed the combination of biblical and witchcraft interest.

The concept of pressure points spread through the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] martial art called [[Varma kalai]], which is a martial art that concentrates on the body's pressure points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of pressure points is also present in the [[koryu|old school]]  Japanese martial arts; in a 1942 article in the ''Shin Budo magazine'', [[Takuma Hisa]] asserted the existence of a tradition attributing the first development of pressure-point attacks to [[Shinra Saburō Minamoto no Yoshimitsu]] (1045&amp;ndash;1127).&lt;ref name="Aiki News-Hisa"&gt;It is also called Internal point.

}} "Yoshimitsu [...] dissected corpses brought back from wars in order to explore human anatomy and mastered a decisive counter-technique as well as discovering lethal atemi. Yoshimitsu then mastered a technique for killing with a single blow. Through such great efforts, he mastered the essence of aiki and discovered the secret techniques of Aiki Budo. Therefore, Yoshimitsu is the person who is credited with being the founder of the original school of Daito-ryu."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock and Higashi (1905) published a book which pointed out a number of vital points in Japanese martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, H. Irving and Higashi, Katsukuma, ''The complete Kano Jiu-Jitsu (Judo)'', New York, G. P. Putnam &amp; Sons, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of pressure-point fighting appeared in Chinese [[Wuxia]] fiction novels and became known by the name of [[Dim Mak]], or "Death Touch", in western popular culture in the 1960s.

While it is undisputed that there are sensitive points on the human body where even comparatively weak pressure may induce significant pain or serious injury, the association of ''kyūsho'' with notions of [[Death]] have been disproven.&lt;ref name="Mann F."&gt;[[Felix Mann]]: "...acupuncture points are no more real than the black spots that a drunkard sees in front of his eyes." (Mann F. Reinventing Acupuncture: A New Concept of Ancient Medicine. Butterworth Heinemann, London, 1996,14.), quoted by Matthew Bauer in ''[http://www.chinesemedicinetimes.com/section.php?xSec=122 Chinese Medicine Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122104312/http://www.chinesemedicinetimes.com/section.php?xSec=122 |date=2009-01-22 }}'', vol 1 issue 4, Aug. 2006, "The Final Days of Traditional Beliefs? - Part One"&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-Indo-Aryan is meant to be the predecessor of Old Indo-Aryan (1500–300 BCE) which is directly attested as [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] and [[Mitanni-Aryan]]. Indeed, Vedic and Mitanni-Aryan are very close to Proto-Indo-Aryan.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. {{Harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|p=3}}; Witzel, Michael, "Vedas and {{IAST|Upaniṣads}}", in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|p=68}};  {{Harvnb|MacDonell|2004|pp=29–39}}; ''Sanskrit literature'' (2003) in Philip's Encyclopedia. Accessed 2007-08-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the [[Prakrits]] display a few minor features derived from Proto-Indo-Aryan that had already disappeared in Vedic Sanskrit.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Today, several [[Modern Indo-Aryan]] languages are extant.

==Differences from Vedic==
Despite the great archaicity of Vedic, the other Indo-Aryan languages preserve a small number of archaic features lost in Vedic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Colin P.|last=Masica|authorlink=Colin Masica|title=The Indo-Aryan Languages|year=1991|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these is the representation of Proto-Indo-European *l and *r. Vedic (as also most Iranian languages) merge both as {{IPA|/r/}}. Later, however, some instances of Indo-European {{IPA|/l/}} again surface in [[Classical Sanskrit]], indicating that the contrast survived in an early Indo-Aryan dialect parallel to Vedic. (A dialect with only {{IPA|/l/}} is additionally posited to underlie [[Magadhi Prakrit]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Colin P.|last=Masica|authorlink=Colin Masica|title=The Indo-Aryan Languages|year=1991|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common consonant cluster ''kṣ'' {{IPA|/kʂ/}} of Vedic and later Sanskrit has a particularly wide range of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and Proto-Indo-Iranian (PII) sources, which partly remain distinct in later Indo-Aryan languages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Masato|last=Kobayashi|title=Historical Phonology of Old Indo-Aryan Consonants|series=Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa Monograph Series|volume=42|year=2004|ISBN=4-87297-894-3|pp=60–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PIE *ks, *kʷs, *gs, *gʷs &gt; PII *kš &gt; Middle Indo-Aryan ''kh-'', ''-kkh-''
* PIE *dʰgʷʰ, *gʰs, *gʷʰs &gt; PII *gʱžʱ &gt; Middle Indo-Aryan ''gh-'', ''-ggh-''

'''Renaissance Latin''' is a name given to the distinctive form of [[Latin]] style developed during the European [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries, particularly by the [[Renaissance humanism]] movement.

== Ad fontes ==

''[[Ad fontes]]'' ("to the sources") was the general cry of the humanists, and as such their Latin style sought to purge Latin of the [[medieval Latin]] vocabulary and stylistic accretions that it had acquired in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire.  They looked to golden age Latin literature, and especially to [[Cicero]] in [[prose]] and [[Virgil]] in [[poetry]], as the arbiters of Latin style. They abandoned the use of the [[Sequence (poetry)|sequence]] and other accentual forms of [[metre in poetry|metre]], and sought instead to revive the Greek formats that were used in [[Latin poetry]] during the Roman period.  The humanists condemned the large body of medieval Latin literature as "[[High Medieval|Gothic]]"&amp;mdash;for them, a term of abuse&amp;mdash;and believed instead that only ancient Latin from the Roman period was "real Latin".

Some 16th-century Ciceronian humanists also sought to purge written Latin of medieval developments in its [[orthography]]. They insisted, for example, that ''ae'' be written out in full wherever it occurred in classical Latin; medieval scribes often wrote ''e'' instead of ''ae''. They were much more zealous than medieval Latin writers that ''t'' and ''c'' be distinguished; because the effects of [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] made them [[homophone]]s, medieval scribes often wrote, for example, ''eciam'' for ''etiam''.  Their reforms even affected [[handwriting]]; Humanists usually wrote Latin in a [[humanist minuscule]] script derived from [[Carolingian minuscule]], the ultimate ancestor of most contemporary [[lower-case]] [[typeface]]s, avoiding the [[black-letter]] scripts used in the Middle Ages. This sort of writing was particularly vigilant in edited works, so that international colleagues could read them more easily, while in their own handwritten documents the Latin is usually written as it is pronounced in the vernacular. Therefore, the first generations of humanists did not dedicate much care to the orthography till the late sixteenth and seventeenth century. [[Erasmus]] proposed that the [[Latin regional pronunciation|then-traditional pronunciations]] of Latin be abolished in favour of his [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed version]] of [[classical Latin]] pronunciation, even though one can deduce from his works that he himself used the ecclesiastical pronunciation.

The humanist plan to remake Latin was largely successful, at least in [[education]]. Schools taught the humanistic spellings, and encouraged the study of the texts selected by the humanists, to the large exclusion of later Latin literature. On the other hand, while humanist Latin was an elegant [[literary language]], it became much harder to write books about [[law]], [[medicine]], [[science]] or contemporary [[politics]] in Latin while observing all of the Humanists' norms about vocabulary purging and classical usage.{{cn|

Renaissance Latin gradually developed into the [[New Latin]] of the 16th–19th centuries, used as the language of choice for authors discussing subjects considered sufficiently important to merit an international (i.e., pan-European) audience.

'''Russenorsk'''  ({{IPA-no|ˈrʉsːəˌnɔʂk}}; {{lang-ru|Руссено́рск}}, {{IPA-ru|rʊsʲɪˈnorsk|}}; {{lang-en|Russo-Norwegian}}) is an extinct dual-source [[pidgin]] language formerly used in the Arctic, which combined elements of [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and which was created by [[Pomor|Russian traders]] and Norwegian fishermen from northern [[Norway]] and the Russian [[Kola Peninsula]]. It was used extensively in Northern Norway for about 150 years in the [[Pomor trade]]. Russenorsk is important as a test case for theories concerning pidgin languages since it was used far away from most of the other documented pidgins of the world.

As is common in the development of pidgins and [[lingua franca|trade language]]s, the interaction of  fishermen and traders with no common language necessitated the creation of some minimal form of communication. Like all pidgins, Russenorsk had a rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary, mostly composed of words essential to [[Arctic]] fishing and trade ([[fish]], [[weather]], etc.) and did not particularly deal with unrelated issues ([[music]], [[politics]], etc.).

==History==
[[Barter]] existed between Russians and Norwegians for 150 years in [[Troms]] and [[Finnmark]] counties. This barter was supported by the Norwegian government, and King [[Christian VII]] conferred city status to several settlements, such as [[Tromsø]], to facilitate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/NOR_Port_of_Tromso_3186.php| title= Port of Tromso|accessdate= 2014-11-08|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegians mainly traded fish for flour and wheat from Russians. The trading went on throughout the sunny months of the year and was beneficial to both sides; Norwegians had access to cheap fish in the summer, whilst Russians had surplus wheat.&lt;ref name=Germanics&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bandle |first1=Oskar |last2=Braunmüller |first2=Kurt |last3=Jahr |first3=Ernst Håkon |last4=Naumann |first4=Allan Karker Hans-Peter |last5=Teleman |first5=Ulf |date=2005 |title = The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages |publisher= Walter de Gruyter GmbH |location=Berlin |page= 1538 |isbn=3 11 017149 X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traders came from the areas near [[Murmansk]] and the [[White Sea]], most often to [[Vardø]], [[Hammerfest]], and Tromsø, sometimes reaching as far south as [[Lofoten]].{{r|Germanics}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ub.uit.no/northernlights/eng/pomor.htm| title= Pomor trade| accessdate= 2011-11-01|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded instance of Russenorsk was in 1785.{{r|Russenorsk}} It is one of the most studied northern pidgins; many linguists, for example, [[Olaf Broch]], studied it. Unlike equatorial pidgins, it was formed from only two languages: Norwegian and Russian. Furthermore, these languages are not from the same branch of Indo-European languages. Also unlike equatorial pidgins, Russenorsk was formed from one social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sprakrad.no/nb-no/Toppmeny/Publikasjoner/Spraaknytt/Arkivet/Eldre/Russenorsk/| title = Russenorsk| last1 = Broch| first1 = Ingvild| last2 = Jahr| first2 = Ernst Håkon| accessdate = 2011-11-02| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605232020/http://www.sprakrad.no/nb-no/Toppmeny/Publikasjoner/Spraaknytt/Arkivet/Eldre/Russenorsk/| archivedate = 2011-06-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1850, Russenorsk was socially acceptable for all social classes. In 1850, Russenorsk became more limited to Norwegian fishermen, whereas Norwegian traders spent more time in Russia, often formally studying the language to the extent that they could communicate in rudimentary Russian.{{r|Germanics}} This caused Russenorsk to lose some of its [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]].&lt;ref name=Russian&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kolamap.ru/library/russenorsk.htm| title = Руссенорск| last1=Serk-Hansen |first1=Karoline| accessdate = 2011-11-01|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland's declaration of independence]] from Russia caused the Russian-Norwegian border to decrease significantly. In 1919, the border disappeared completely.&lt;ref name=Russenorsk&gt;{{cite web | url = http://faculty.washington.edu/wassink/2010%20sketches/Russenorsk.pdf| title = Russenorsk – A Language Sketch| accessdate = 2011-11-02|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Soviet Union]] limited international contact significantly, decreasing the need for the common language between Norwegians and Russians. The last such Norwegian-Russian trade occurred in 1923.{{r|Russenorsk}}

==Phonology==
Russenorsk uses many of the phonemes mutual to Norwegian and Russian, altering phonemes only used in one.{{r|Russenorsk}}{{r|Belikov}}&lt;ref name=German&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sub-arctic.ac.at/articles/russ.htm| title = Pidgin – Russisch – Am Beispiel von Russenorsk| accessdate = 2011-11-01| 4 = | deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20121127194357/http://www.sub-arctic.ac.at/articles/russ.htm| archivedate = 2012-11-27| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
One of the characteristics differentiating the pidgin from [[jargon]] is its grammar.{{r|Germanics}} Russenorsk is mainly influenced by Norwegian grammar, leading some to conclude that it is a variant of Norwegian with some Russian influence.&lt;ref name=Kortlandt&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art197e.pdf| title = On Russenorsk| last1= Kortlandt | first1=Frederik| accessdate = 2011-11-01|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no clear verb conjugations. The main indication of a verb is the suffix ''-om'', for example, ''kapitan på kajuta slipom'' (the captain is asleep in his cabin). Nominative nouns usually end with ''-a''.{{r|Kortlandt}} Conjunctions used to make compound sentences or dependent clauses are ''ja'', ''i'', and ''jes''. ''Kak'' is used as an interrogative word. The general word order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]], with some alterations for questions and sentences with adverbs.&lt;ref name=Belikov&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philol.msu.ru/~otipl/new/main/articles/belikov/vib-russenorsk.doc| title = Some Fragments of Russenorsk Grammar| last1=Belikov |first1=Vladimir | accessdate = 2011-11-01|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''På'' is used as the only preposition for the [[oblique case]]:{{r|Russenorsk}}
*For possession: ''klokka på ju'' (your watch)
*For location: ''mala penge på lamma'' (little money in the pocket), and ''principal på sjib''? (Is the captain aboard the ship?)
*For temporal relation: ''på morradag'' (tomorrow), ''på gammel ras'' (last year).
*For direction: ''moja tvoja på vater kasstom'' (I will throw you in the water), ''nogoli dag tvoja reisa på Arkangel otsuda''? (How many days did you travel from here [to get] to Arkhangelsk?), ''på Arkangel reisom'' (go to Arkhangelsk).

==Vocabulary==
[[Text corpus|Corpora]] of Russenorsk consist of lists of individual words and phrases as well as records of dialogues compiled by linguists such as [[Just Knut Qvigstad]]. The corpora include c. 400 words, about half of those only appear once in the records (so-called [[hapax legomena]]).{{r|Germanics}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date = 1998| title = Atlas języków: Pochodzenie i rozwój języków świata|location=Poznań |publisher=Oficyna Wydawnicza Atena| page = 146| isbn = 83-85414-31-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of its vocabulary is generally held to be approximately 40% Russian and 50% Norwegian, with the remaining 10% from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Low German]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[Sami languages|Sami]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. {{r|Russenorsk}}{{r|Russian}}

Many words in Russenorsk have a synonym from the other primary language.{{r|Belikov}}
*''Balduska'', ''kvejta'' (halibut)
*''Musik'', ''man'' (man)
*''Eta'', ''den'' (this)
*''Njet'', ''ikke'' (not)
Some words can be etymologically traced to both Norwegian and Russian, for example, ''vin'' (Norwegian) and вино (Russian). Some words have an unclear etymology, for example, ''tovara'' or ''vara'' can come from Russian, Swedish, or Finnish.{{r|Belikov}}

Some Russenorsk words survive in the dialect of [[Vardø]]:{{r|Germanics}}
*''kralle'' (Russenorsk: krallom, {{lang-rus|красть|krast'}}, to steal)
*''klæba'' ({{lang-rus|хлеб|khleb}}, bread)

==Morphology==
Russenorsk does not have extensive morphology, but has some unique characteristics. The ending ''-om'' does not come from Russian nor Norwegian, but it may come from [[Solombala English]].{{r|Germanics}} The ending ''-mann'', from Norwegian, is used to indicate nationality or profession, for example ''russmann'' (Russian), ''burmann'' (Norwegian), or ''kukmann'' (trader). Other morphological features are [[reduplication]], such as ''morra-morradag'' (after tomorrow), and [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]], such as ''kua'' (cow) and ''sjorta'' (shirt) to ''kuasjorta'' (cowhide).{{r|Russenorsk}}

==Syntax==
One characteristic syntactical attribute of Russenorsk is the tendency to move the verb to the final position when the sentence has adverbs. This is found in neither Russian nor Norwegian.{{r|Germanics}} Another is that the negator (''ikke'', ''njet'') precedes the verb, but can be separated from the verb. This is unlike negation in either Russian or Norwegian, but it may have come from Finnish, in which this syntax was probable.{{r|Belikov}}

A lack of [[metalinguistic awareness]] amongst Russenorsk speakers may have led them to believe they were speaking the language of their interlocutor; that is, that Russians believed they were speaking Norwegian and vice versa.{{r|Kortlandt}}

'''Saal Mubarak''' ({{lang-gu|સાલ મુબારક}}, [[Farsi]]: سعال مبارک) is a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] and [[Parsi]] greeting used to commemorate the Gujarati [[New Year]] (and Nowruz), which is a day after [[Diwali]]: the [[Hindu]], [[Jainism|Jain]], [[Sikh]] and [[Parsi]] festival of lights, the triumph of good over evil, and light over darkness. ''Saal'' is also a [[Persian language|Indo-Persian]] word meaning year, and ''mubarak'' is an originally [[Arabic]] term meaning blessing or good wishes. Both phrases are the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] equivalent of Happy New Year. Arabic and Gujarati share many similarities, due to the [[Mughal tribe|Mughal]] invasion of India, and due to the [[Parsi]] influx into India after the Arab Invasion of Persia, Farsi, Gujarati and Arabic all share a large amount of similarities, along with [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] due to the Portuguese Colonisation of Western India. 

It is also used by the [[Parsi|Parsi community]] in India and Pakistan to mark [[Nowruz]] which occurs in either March or August depending on the specific [[Zoroastrian calendar]] used.

Hindu Gujarati New Year, also known as '''Bestu Varas''' (sitting year), is celebrated the day after the Diwali and is the fourth day of the five-day Diwali festival. The Hindu New Year is on [[Kartik (month)|Kartak]] ''Sud Ekam'' (The first month and first day of the Hindu[[Lunar Calendar]], ''Kartak'' is the first month in this new year while ''Ekam'' refers to the first day).

The Hindu community all over the world celebrates the New Year to mark the beginning of a new fiscal year and people put their worries behind them and prepare to welcome a new beginning. Hindu's will continue with the festivities from Diwali the day before and decorate their homes with [[rangoli]] patterns and [[garland]]s, light [[diya (light)|diyas]] and set off [[fireworks]]. It is tradition for people to wear new clothes on New Years Day and to show respect to their elders to seek their [[blessing]]s. Revellers will visit family and friends to exchange gifts of money and homemade [[Indian sweets|sweets]] and wish health and prosperity for the new year. People will also visit [[mandirs]] to offer [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] to the gods.

==In other culture==
The new year of [[Nepal Sambat]], lunar calendar of Nepal, also starts on the fourth day of Diwali.

The '''Signorelli parapraxis''' represents the first and best known example of a [[parapraxis]] and its analysis in [[Freud]]'s ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]''. The parapraxis centers on a [[Anomic aphasia|word finding]] problem and the production of substitutes. Freud couldn't recall the name ([[Luca Signorelli|Signorelli]]) of the painter of the [[Orvieto]] frescos and produced as substitutes the names of two painters [[Botticelli]] and [[Boltraffio]]. Freud's analysis shows what associative processes had linked Signorelli to Botticelli and Boltraffio. The analysis has been criticised by linguists and others.
 
==Botticelli - Boltraffio - Trafoi==
One important ingredient in Freud's analysis was the North-Italian village [[Trafoi]] where he received the message of the suicide of one of his patients, struggling with sexual problems. Without Trafoi the substitute Boltraffio rhyming to it would be incomprehensible. Freud links Trafoi to the theme 'death and sexuality', a theme preceding the word finding problem in a conversation Freud had during a trip by train through [[Bosnia-Herzegowina]].
 
The second important ingredient in Freud's analysis is the extraction of an Italian word ''signor'' from the forgotten name Signorelli. ''Herr'', the German counterpart of ''Signor'', is then linked to Herzegowina and the word ''Herr'' occurring, as Freud tells us, in the conversation.

Freud denies the relevance of the content of the frescos. Nevertheless, psychoanalysts have pursued their investigations particularly into this direction, finding however no new explanation of the parapraxis. [[Jacques Lacan]] suggested that the parapraxis may be an act of self-forgetting.

==Trafoi in Kraepelin's dream==
The first critique to Freud came from [[Emil Kraepelin]], who in a postscript to his 1906 monograph on [[dream speech|language disturbances in dreams]], relates a dream involving Trafoi. The dream centers around a neologism ''Trafei'', which Kraepelin links to Trafoi. The dream may be seen as an implicit critique on Freud's analysis. Italian ''trofei'' is associated to ''Trafei'' in the same way as Trafoi (cf. van Ooijen, 1996) and clarifies Kraepelin's dream. The meaning of ''trofei'' reads in German ''Siegeszeichen'' (victory-signs) and this German word together with Latin ''signum'' clearly links to Freud's first name (Engels, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;22-24).

==Sebastiano Timpanaro==
In ''The Freudian Slip'' [[Sebastiano Timpanaro]] discusses Freud's  analysis in chapter 6 "Love and Death at Orvieto." (p.&amp;nbsp;63-81). He in fact doubts, that the name Boltraffio would have played a major role during the parapraxis, as he states: "Boltraffio is a ''Schlimbesserung'' [that is a substitute worse than another substitute]" and adds "the correction goes astray because of incapacity to localize the fault."(p.&amp;nbsp;71). He calls Botticelli an "involuntary banalization" and Boltraffio "a semi-conscious disimproved correction."(p.&amp;nbsp;75). As to the Signor-element in Freud's analysis he puts: "The immediate equivalence Signore= Herr is one thing, the extraction of ''signor'' from Signorelli and of ''Her(r)'' from Herzegowina is another."

==Swales' investigation==
[[Peter Swales (historian)|Peter Swales]] (2003) investigated the historical data and states that Freud probably visited an exposition of Italian masters in [[Bergamo]] mid-September 1898, showing paintings of Signorelli, Botticelli and Boltraffio one next to the other. In his view the paintings at the exposition were the source of the substitute names in the parapraxis. Swales dwells largely on the three paintings. The association of the name Boltraffio to the name [[Da Vinci]], another hypothesis formulated by Swales (because Freud might have seen the statue of Boltraffio at the bottom of the Da Vinci monument on ''[[Piazza della Scala]]'' in [[Milan]] some days before his visit to [[Bergamo]]), is not further pursued by Swales. Although Freud visited Trafoi on the 8th of August 1898, Swales doubts whether Freud received a message on the suicide of one of his patients.

==Freud neglected his own observation==
[[File:Luca signorelli, cappella di san brizio, predica e punizione dell'anticristo 01.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Fresco of the Deeds of the Antichrist]]
Freud in his analysis did not use the fact that he remembered very well a picture of the painter in the lower left corner of one of the frescos. The picture, sort of a signature, was thus a third substitute to the forgotten name Signorelli. The "signature"  can be interpreted as a reference to the Latin verb ''signare'' and this word, instead of Freud's ''signore'', then leads to a simple analysis of the Signorelli parapraxis (Engels, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;66-69). There seems to be no more need for the Bosnia-Hercegovina associations (''Bo'' and ''Herr'') Freud himself introduced. In the alternative to Freud's analysis the suicide message in Trafoi remains an important point to understand the parapraxis (this message being a blow to Freud's [[self-esteem]]). The occurrence of the Signorelli parapraxis ''during'' Freud's trip from Ragusa to [[Trebinje]] (in Herzegowina) is not questioned, as was done by Swales. {{fact|date=June 2016}}

[[File:James VI of Scotland aged 20, 1586..jpg|160px|right|thumb|James VI, c.1586]]

'''''Ane Schort Treatise conteining some Reulis and Cautelis to be observit and eschewit in Scottis poesie''''' (1584) is the full title of a work of non-fiction prose in [[Scots language|Scots]], also called '''''The Essayes of a Prentise in the Divine Art of Poesie''''', written by the 19-year-old [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] of Scotland (later also James I of England) and first published in [[Edinburgh]]. Its original purpose was to describe and propose the ideal standard for poets writing in the [[Scottish literature|Scottish tradition]], a tradition which includes James' direct ancestor, [[James I of Scotland|James I]] (1394-1437).&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/kqintro.htm The Kingis Quair: an Introduction].&lt;/ref&gt;

James VI, as a young poet-king, was both the head and patron of the [[Castalian Band]], a fairly loose circle of court poets which he both established and composed with as peers in the 1580s and early 1590s. It is certain that the treatise was intended to set the aesthetic standard for the writing he wished to advocate. The Castalian poets included [[Alexander Montgomerie]], [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]], [[William Alexander, Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]], [[John Stewart of Baldynneis|John Stewart]] and [[Alexander Hume]] and others variously. James' patronage as Scottish king also attracted poets from [[Northern England]], such as [[Thomas Hudson (poet)|Thomas Hudson]].

Like most of James' writing, '''''Reulis and Cautelis''''' (''Rules and Cautions'') was written in his first language, [[Middle Scots]]. Because of its subject, it was one of the few manuscripts by the King that was not [[anglicise]]d by his London publisher [[Thomas Waldegrave]] for publication in England.&lt;ref&gt;N Rhodes, J Richards, J Marshall (eds).

==Purpose==
[[Land use]] is governed by a set of regulations generally known as [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] or [[Local ordinance|municipal codes]], which are authorized by the state's zoning enabling law.  Within an ordinance is a list of land use designations commonly known as zoning.  Each different type of zone has its own set of allowed uses.  These are known as by-right uses.  Then there is an extra set of uses known as special uses.  To build a use that is listed as a special use, a special use permit (or ''[[Conditional limitation|conditional use]] permit'') must be obtained.

An example of a ''special use permit'' may be found in a church applying for one to construct a church building in a residential neighborhood.  Although the church building is not a residential building, the zoning law may allow for churches in the residential neighborhood if the local zoning authority may review the impact on the neighborhood.  This process grants discretion to the local zoning authority to ensure that an acceptable land use does not disrupt the zoning scheme because of its particular location.

==US Zoning Model Act==

The [[Standard State Zoning Enabling Act]] allows special use permits based upon a finding of compatibility with surrounding areas and with developments already permitted under the general provisions of the ordinance.

==Abuse==
If the local zoning authority grants a special-use permit that exceeds the discretion allowed to it, then an incidence of [[spot zoning]] may arise.  Such discretion then may be attacked as ''[[ultra vires]]'', and the special-use permit overturned as an [[unconstitutional]] violation of [[equal protection]].

==Other uses==
Special land-use permits are also issued by the [[U.S. Forest Service]] for the operation of [[ski area]]s and other [[recreation]]al facilities in [[United States National Forest|national forest]]s.  Special-use permits have also been issued for other purposes, such as in [[Alaska]] during the summer of 2015, when special [[fishing permit]]s were issued to feed [[firefighter]]s who had difficulty receiving supplies via land routes due to the [[forest fire]]s that they were fighting in remote areas.

In [[broadcasting]], a [[restricted service licence]] ([[Ofcom|UK]]) or [[special temporary authority]] ([[FCC (US)|US]]) may be issued by a [[broadcasting authority]] for temporary changes or set-ups for a [[radio station]] or [[television station]].  This may be for a temporary [[LPFM]] station for a special event (an RSL), or for an unexpected situation such as having to operate at low power from an emergency [[radio antenna]] or [[radio tower]] after a disaster or major equipment failure (STA).

'''Sumitranandan Pant''' (20 May 1900 – 28 December 1977) was an Indian poet. He was one of the most celebrated "[[Progressivism|Progressive]]" [[Leftism|left-wing]] 20th century poets of the [[Hindi language]] and was known for romanticism in his poems which were inspired by nature, people and beauty within.

==Background==
Pant was born in Kausani village, [[Bageshwar District]] in what is now the state of [[Uttarakhand]], into an educated middle-class [[Brahmin]] family. His mother died a few hours after childbirth, and it appears he did not seek affection from his grandmother, father, or older brother, which later influenced his writing.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Rubin, David (1993). ''The Return of Sarasvati: Four Hindi Poets''. Oxford University Press. pp. 105–106. {{ISBN|978-0195643695}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father served as the manager of a local tea garden, and was also a landholder, so Pant was never in want financially growing up. He grew up in the same village and always cherished a love for the beauty and flavor of rural India, which is evident in all his major works.

Pant enrolled in Queens College in Banaras in 1918. There he began reading the works of [[Sarojini Naidu]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], as well as English Romantic poets. These figures would all have a powerful influence on his writing.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; In 1919 he moved to [[Allahabad]] to study at Muir College. As an anti-British gesture he only attended for two years. He then focused more on poetry, publishing ''Pallav'' in 1926. This collection established him as a literary giant of the Hindi renaissance that had begun with [[Jaishankar Prasad]]. In the introduction to the book, Pant expressed dissatisfaction that Hindi speakers "think in one language and express themselves in another."&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; He felt that [[Braj Bhasha|Braj]] was out of date and sought to help usher in a new national language.

Pant moved to [[Kalakankar]] in 1931. For nine years he lived an secluded life close to nature. Simultaneously he grew enamored with the works and thinking of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], dedicating several verses to them in the poetry he produced during this time. Pant went to Russia after being invited by Russian government under the impression that his poetic and intellectual prowess was being recognized while he became a tool for Russian propaganda. He was particularly chosen for his creation "Rhapsody to Lenin" in Hindi. The bureaucrats would get them drunk and after about fifteen days the alcohol would be withdrawn as the withdrawal would leave the subjects in a shaky position and the government would then pressure them in giving favorable statements to USSR or recruit them as informants. No guests were ever allowed in USSR without being specially selected for similar purposes. Pant returned to Almora in 1941 where he attended drama classes at the Uday Shankar Cultural Centre. He also read Aurobindo's ''The Life Divine'', which heavily influenced him. Three years later he moved to [[Chennai|Madras]] and then to [[Pondicherry]], attending Aurobindo's ashram. In 1946 he returned to Allahabad to resume his role among the country's other leading writers.

==Literary career==
He is considered one of the major poets of the ''[[Chhayavaad]]i'' school of Hindi literature. Pant mostly wrote in [[Sanskrit]]ized Hindi. Pant authored twenty-eight published works including poetry, verse plays and essays.

Apart from ''Chhayavaadi'' poems, Pant also wrote progressive, socialist and humanist poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTWrBxcysOU|title=Chhayavaadi Poet Sumitranandan Pant|work=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
philosophical (influenced by [[Sri Aurobindo]]). Pant eventually moved beyond this style. As the late scholar and translator of Pant, [[David Rubin (author)|David Rubin]], writes, "In the early forties the new psychological and experimental "schools" were emerging. It was typical of both [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala'|Nirala]] and Pant that they themselves anticipated these trends and, by the time the new approaches were in vogue, they had already moved on to newer areas of experimentation."&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1968, Pant became the first Hindi poet to receive the [[Jnanpith Award]], considered to be India's highest accolade for literature. This was awarded to him for a collection of his most famous poems titled ''Chidambara''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html|title=Jnanpith Laureates Official listings|publisher=[[Jnanpith]] Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013122739/http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html|archivedate=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pant received the "[[Sahitya Academy]]" award, given by India's Academy of Letters, for "Kala Aur Budhdha Chand".

The Indian Government honored him with [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/Year_Wise_main_25042017.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumitra Nandan Pant composed the Kulgeet of the [[Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee]] "Jayati Jayati Vidya Sansthan".

==Death==
Pant died on 28 December 1977, at Allahabad (Prayagraj), [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. His childhood house in [[Kausani]] has been converted into a museum. This museum displays his daily use articles, drafts of his poems, letters, his awards, etc.

'''Union for the International Language Ido''' ([[Ido language|Ido]]: ''Uniono por la Linguo Internaciona Ido'', '''ULI''') is the official union of the [[Ido language|Ido-language]] movement. Based in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], its main functions are the propagation of the language, arranging the yearly [[Ido (language)#International Ido conventions|conferences]] in which Ido speakers gather, and the publishing of the magazine ''Progreso'' (''Progress''), begun in 1908 by [[Louis Couturat]], one of the founders of the movement who died in 1914. Currently there are representatives from 23 countries as official members of the union.

The ULI is to Ido as the [[Universal Esperanto Association]] is to [[Esperanto]].

The 2008 conference was held in [[Wuppertal]], [[Germany]], from 22 to 26 August.

'''Valentyn Ostapovych Rechmedin''' ({{lang-uk|Валентин Остапович Речмедін)}}, 12 February 1916 – 6 June 1986 was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] journalist and writer.

He grew up in the village of Andrushivka in present [[Pohrebyschenskyi Raion]], [[Vinnytsia Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]), where his father was a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Rechmedin, А. P.: ''Sivach krasy i dobra. Rodovid, zhytcha, tvortyist pysmennyka Valentyna Rechmedina'', p.152–156. Kniha-Veha, Vinnytsia 2004. {{ISBN|978-966-2611-69-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After studies at [[Uman]] Cooperative [[Tekhnikum|Technicum]] (Уманський кооперативний технікум) he started his career as a journalist in 1934 at ''Molodyi Bilshovyk'' (Молодий Бiльшовик) in [[Vinnytsia]]. In 1939 he started to work at ''Vilna Ukraïna'' (Вільна Україна) and later at ''Leninska Molod'' (Ленінска Молодь) in [[Lviv]].&lt;ref&gt;Rechmedin, А. P.: ''Sivach krasy i dobra. Rodovid, zhytcha, tvortyist pysmennyka Valentyna Rechmedina'', p.156–159. Kniha-Veha, Vinnytsia 2004. {{ISBN|978-966-2611-69-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentyn remained in [[Ukraine]] also after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in the summer of 1941. Later he became active in the [[Soviet partisan]] movement in the Vinnytsia area. In his partisan group he edited its ''Partyzanska Pravda''. After the war he was awarded the [[Order of the Red Star]].&lt;ref&gt;Rechmedin, А. P.: ''Sivach krasy i dobra. Rodovid, zhytcha, tvortyist pysmennyka Valentyna Rechmedina'', p.160–163. Kniha-Veha, Vinnytsia 2004. {{ISBN|978-966-2611-69-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]] he moved to [[Kiev]] where he worked at the newspapers ''Radianska Ukraïna'', ''Literaturna Ukraïna'' (as deputy chief editor) and ''Kultura i zhyttia'' (as chief editor) and the magazine ''Vitchyzna'' (as deputy chief editor from 1963).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Rechmedin, А. P.: ''Sivach krasy i dobra. Rodovid, zhytcha, tvortyist pysmennyka Valentyna Rechmedina''. Kniha-Veha, Vinnytsia 2004. {{ISBN|978-966-2611-69-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary in ''Literaturna Ukraïna 1986, nr.25''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentyn started to write novels after the war. The stories were often based on his own experiences during the war. He always wrote in the [[Ukrainian language]], but several books have been translated into [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Valentyn was also a well-known drama and literary critic.&lt;ref&gt;Volodymyr Kubijovyč (ed.): ''Ukraine. A Concise Encyclopædia, vol 2'', p.616. University of Toronto Press 1971. {{ISBN|0-8020-3261-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his literary critiques of [[Mykhailo Stelmakh]] published in May 1972, Rechmedin noted:  "The older generation sees itself in the heroes of ''Velyka ridnya'', ''Krov lyudska - ne vodytsia'', ''Pravda i Kryvda'', ''Khlib i sil'' those who had their souls scarred with disaster, poverty, hard work and injustice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://librportal.org.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=517&amp;Itemid=45 Stelmakh, Mykhailo].

The '''''Österreichisches Wörterbuch''''' (English: Austrian Dictionary), abbreviated '''''ÖWB''''', is the official [[dictionary]] of the [[German language]] in the [[Republic of Austria]]. It is edited by a group of linguists under the authority of the Austrian [[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]] (''Bundesministerium für Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur''). It is the Austrian counterpart to the German ''[[Duden]]'' and contains a number of terms unique to [[Austrian German]] or that are more frequently used or differently pronounced there. A considerable amount of this "Austrian" vocabulary is also common in [[Southern Germany]], especially [[Bavaria]], and some of it is used in [[Switzerland]] as well. The most recent edition is the 43rd from 2017. Since the 39th edition from 2001 the orthography of the ''ÖWB'' was adjusted to the [[German spelling reform of 1996]]. This dictionary is also in official use in the [[Italy|Italian]] province of [[South Tyrol]].

==History==
[[Image:ÖWB Auflage36.jpg|thumb|right|The school version of the 36th edition from 1985]]
[[Image:ÖWB Auflage32.jpg|thumb|right|The school version of the 32nd edition from 1972]]
The first edition of the Austrian Dictionary was edited in 1951 on an initiative from the then Austrian minister of education Felix Hurdes. It replaced the old "''Regeln für die deutsche Rechtschreibung nebst Wörterbuch''", a standard work for the German orthography that dated back to pre-[[World War I]] times (1879 and 1902). The first edition had 276 pages and around 20.000 entries and was designed for use in the Austrian educational system.

At that time, only six years after [[World War II]], Austria was still under [[Allied-administered Austria|allied administration]] and the Austrian civilian government tried to cut political ties to Germany, including cultural and linguistic reminiscences to the former [[Nazi regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Utgaard: ''Remembering and Forgetting Nazism''; chapter [https://books.google.com/books?id=PSi792OErrQC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22austrian+dictionary%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U3nRH1PvvddxykOlkP4-S739WHK7Q#PPA32,M1 ''Reversing the Gleichschaltung in Austrian Education'']; Berghahn Books, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-57181-187-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the Austrian dictionary has to be assessed under these circumstances. The [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] into [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] in 1938 had also brought a unified official standard form of the German language, that was now revised by referring to pre-war Austrian standards and by including local vocabulary originating from [[Austro-Bavarian]] dialects, especially but not exclusively typical [[Viennese German|Viennese]] terms.

The Austrian dictionary hence defined the Austrian form of [[Standard German]], making it official and obligatory for use in schools and in public administration. For private persons, the business correspondence of companies, publishing houses and newspapers it remained an orthographic recommendation.

Since then it was republished and expanded in numerous editions, that were each published in three different versions: a reduced version for primary schools (''[[Volksschule]]''), a medium sized version for high schools (''[[Hauptschule]], [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'') and a full version for the general public. The 35th edition from 1979 was considerably expanded in the listed vocabulary and with the 39th edition from 2001 the reformed German orthography was adopted. This new standardized orthography, that was determined by an international group of experts from [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and Austria, lead to considerable debates and refusal in Austria. Most newspapers switched to the reformed orthography but some later revoked their decisions and now use either the old version or a separate in-house orthography (''Hausrechtschreibung'').

The Austrian dictionary remained with the reformed orthography, only at terms that are differently pronounced in Austria, the orthography differs from the German standard. Nevertheless the ÖWB still includes a considerable amount of unique vocabulary, that was even expanded in the newest 40th edition.

==Characteristics==
The full version of the 2006 40th edition contains around 80,000 terms on 1,008 pages. The school version is 864 pages, and the small version has 20,000 terms. The authors of this edition were the [[Linguistics|linguists]] Otto Back, Erich Benedikt, Karl Blüml, Jakob Ebner and Hermann Möcker from the institute of Austrian studies (''Institut für Österreichkunde''), as well as the [[Dialectology|dialectogists]] Maria Hornung, Professor Heinz Dieter Pohl from the [[University of Klagenfurt]] and [[Emeritus professor]] Herbert Tatzreiter from the [[University of Vienna]].

About 3,000 new terms were added to the 39th edition, among them Austrian [[neologism]]s such as „''E-Card''“ for the Austrian social security card, „''Hacklerregelung''“, a legal term for a special retirement law, and „''Pensionsharmonisierung''“. From the colloquial vocabulary new terms were added such as „''Altenbetreuer''“ (geriatric nurse), „''anzipfen''“ (to get fed up), „''ablösefrei''“ (without transfer fee), „''Audiobook''“, „''Afro-Look''“ und „''Alkopops''“ (soft drink with liquor). New technological terms were also added, like: „''skypen''“, „''VoIP''“, „''Blog''“, „''Linux''“ and even „''Wikipedia''“.

New terms might differ from their counterparts in Germany. The Austrian dictionary now sets the term „''smsen''“ (to text message, pronounced as-am-as-an) as standard, whereas the Duden uses „''simsen''“, both derived from the English abbreviation „''SMS''“ for "''short message service''".

Numerous outdated word were removed from the 40th edition, either because their reference in the real world ceased to exist or because they became out of fashion. Examples are „''Absperrkommando''“, „''affengeil''“ und „''Arbeitermittelschule''“. However the terms „''[[Austrian schilling|Schilling]]''“ and „''[[Gendarmerie]]''“ are listed, although their [[Sign (linguistics)|signifiants]] no longer exist. Still included are some typical dialect terms, that continue to be used in the written language, such as the [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] „''Strankerl''“ ([[common beans]]) or the word „''Zöger''“ bzw. „''Zeger''“ for a wicker [[basket]].

Other typically Austrian words in the dictionary are for example: „''Dulliähstimmung''“ ([[drunken]]ness), „''Greißler''“ (grocery shop), „''Gwirkst''“ (complicated situation), „''Jausengegner''“ (easy opponent in sports), „''Käsekrainer''“ (a [[Kranjska klobasa]]), „''klass''“ (terrific), „''Outwachler''“ (a [[Assistant referee (association football)|linesman]]), „''Pfusch''“ ([[wiktionary:moonlighting|moonlighting]]), „''pipifein''“ (fine), „''Roadpricing''“, „''Stockerlplatz''“ (a medal rank in sports), „''Szenebeisl''“ (a hip nightclub), „''tschechern''“ (to booze), „''zach''“ (chewy, tough) and „''zerknautschen''“ (to crumple).

Some parents protested against the 39th edition, arguing that there were too many "dirty words" listed, some of which have subsequently been removed from the school version of the 40th edition.

==Language policy==
The objective of the Austrian dictionary has never been to do classical [[language planning]], but to do a re-codification of the form of the German language used in Austria. New terms were only included to the dictionary, when they had already been in considerable use in newspapers and contemporary literature.

Although the dictionary was originally designed to promote Austrianism and language patriotism, throughout the years the dictionary commission followed a moderate policy of contrastive linguistics and tried to avoid [[language secessionism]]. Nevertheless in the case of conflicting definitions the Austrian dictionary overrules the Duden and remains the sole source for defining the Austrian standard. In post-World War II Austria the German Duden never had any legal authority, although informally it is also widely in use as a work of reference.&lt;ref&gt;Marlis Hellinger, Ulrich Ammon: ''Contrastive Sociolinguistics''; chapter 4: [https://books.google.com/books?id=r-A2y2DKqAcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;vq=austrian+dictionary&amp;dq=%22austrian+dictionary%22&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U0_ZPDlTv8guUS67Dw8_27htDgC4A Comparing the linguistic codices]; Walter de Gruyter, 1996
