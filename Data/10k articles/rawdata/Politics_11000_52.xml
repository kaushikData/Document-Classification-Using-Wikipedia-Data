      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1436">Following the escalation of the [[Darfur conflict]] in the [[Sudan]], [[Chad]] brokered negotiations in [[N'Djamena]] led to the '''Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement''' between the Sudanese government and the two rebel groups, the Sudanese [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) and the [[Sudan Liberation Movement/Army]] (SLM/A) on 8 April 2004, other signatories were Chad and the [[African Union]]. The ceasefire came into effect on 11 April 2004.

The [[National Movement for Reform and Development]] &amp;mdash; a group which splintered from the JEM in April did not participate in the cease-fire talks or the agreement. [[Janjaweed]] and rebel attacks have continued since the ceasefire.

The African Union formed a Ceasefire Commission (CFC) to monitor observance of the ceasefire.

{{Anti-consumerism |Movements}}
The '''anti-globalization movement''', or '''counter-globalisation movement''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]] (May 2004) ''[http://mondediplo.com/2004/11/06derrida Enlightenment past and to come]'', speech at the party for 50 years of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[social movement]] critical of [[economic globalization]]. The movement is also commonly referred to as the [[global justice movement]],&lt;ref name=DDP&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Della Porta | editor-first = Donatella | editor-link = Donatella della Porta | title = The Global Justice Movement: Cross-national And Transnational Perspectives | publisher = Paradigm | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-59451-305-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[alter-globalization]] movement, anti-globalist movement, [[anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] globalization movement,&lt;ref name=Juris&gt;{{cite book | last = Juris | first = Jeffrey S. | title =
Networking Futures: The Movements against Corporate Globalization | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2008 | page = 2 | isbn = 978-0-8223-4269-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or movement against [[neoliberal]] globalization.

Participants base their criticisms on a number of related ideas.&lt;ref&gt;No Logo: No Space, No Choice, No Jobs by Canadian journalist Naomi Klein.&lt;/ref&gt;  What is shared is that participants oppose large, [[multinational corporation]]s having unregulated political power, exercised through [[trade agreements]] and deregulated financial markets. Specifically, corporations are accused of seeking to maximize profit at the expense of work safety conditions and standards, labour hiring and compensation standards, environmental conservation principles, and the integrity of national legislative authority, independence and sovereignty. {{as of|2012|January}}, some commentators have characterized changes in the global economy as "turbo-capitalism" ([[Edward Luttwak]]), "[[market fundamentalism]]" ([[George Soros]]), [[Casino Capitalism|"casino capitalism"]] ([[Susan Strange]]),&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Susan: Casino Capitalism. Oxford: Blackwell, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "McWorld" ([[Benjamin Barber]]).

Many anti-globalization activists do not oppose [[globalization]] in general and call for forms of global integration that better provide [[democratic representation]], advancement of [[human rights]], [[fair trade]] and [[sustainable development]] and therefore feel the term "anti-globalization" is misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Douglas ''[http://www3.fis.utoronto.ca/research/iprp/c3n/CI/DMorris.htm Globalization and Media Democracy: The Case of Indymedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304030415/http://www3.fis.utoronto.ca/research/iprp/c3n/CI/DMorris.htm |date=2009-03-04 }}'' (pre-publication version)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Podobnik, Bruce, ''[http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 Resistance to Globalization: Cycles and Evolutions in the Globalization Protest Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228081453/http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 |date=2008-02-28 }}'', p. 2. Podobnik states that "the vast majority of groups that participate in these protests draw on international networks of support, and they generally call for forms of globalization that enhance democratic representation, human rights, and egalitarianism."  {{cite web|url=http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228081453/http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph &amp; Andrew Charlton. 2005. ''Fair Trade for All: How Trade Can Promote Development''. p. 54 n. 23 (writing that "The anti-globalization movement developed in opposition to the perceived negative aspects of globalization. The term 'anti-globalization' is in many ways a misnomer, since the group represents a wide range of interests and issues and many of the people involved in the anti-globalization movement do support closer ties between the various peoples and cultures of the world through, for example, aid, assistance for refugees, and global environmental issues.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and causes==
{{Main|Criticisms of globalization}}
Supporters believe that by the late 20th century those they characterized as "ruling elites" sought to harness the expansion of world markets for their own interests; this combination of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions, states, and multinational corporations has been called "[[globalization]]" or "globalization from above." In reaction, various social movements emerged to challenge their influence; these movements have been called "anti-globalization" or "globalization from below."&lt;ref&gt;Korzeniewicz, Roberto Patricio &amp; Smith, William C., 2001, ''Protest and Collaboration: Transnational Civil Society Networks and the Politics of Summitry and Free Trade in the Americas'', pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to international financial institutions and transnational corporations===
People opposing globalization believe that international agreements and global financial institutions, such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Trade Organization]], undermine local decision-making. Corporations that use these institutions to support their own corporate and financial interests, can exercise privileges that individuals and small businesses cannot,&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E., "Globalism's Discontents", The American Prospect, 13, 1, January 2002, PP. 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; including the ability to:
# move freely across borders.
# extract desired [[natural resources]].
# use a wide variety of [[human resources]].
The movement aims for an end to the legal status of "[[Juristic person|corporate personhood]]" and the dissolution of [[free market fundamentalism]] and the radical economic privatization measures of the [[World Bank]], the IMF, and the World Trade Organization.
[[File:Antiglob rostock 2 6 07.jpg|thumb|left|Protest against the [[33rd G8 summit|G8-meeting]] in [[Heiligendamm]], 2007.]]

Activists are especially opposed to the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by globalization and the international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards or environmental protection.&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the Trans Pacific Trade Agreement (TPPA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, adherents of the movement claim that free trade without measures to protect the environment and the health and wellbeing of workers will merely increase the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South"). Proponents of this line of thought refer to the process as polarization and argue that current neo-liberal economic policies have given wealthier states an advantage over developing nations, enabling their exploitation and leading to a widening of the global wealth gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Byrne, Hensby|first=Darren J., Alexander|title=Theorizing Global Studies|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=UK|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[Jean Ziegler]], [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on the [[right to food]], notes that "millions of farmers are losing their livelihoods in the developing countries, but small farmers in the northern countries are also suffering" and concludes that "the current inequities of the global trading system are being perpetuated rather than resolved under the WTO, given the unequal balance of power between member countries."&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Jean, 2004, [http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/34441bf9efe3a9e3c1256e6300510e24/$FILE/G0410777.pdf ''Economic, social and cultural rights - The right to food''], page 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Activists point to the unequal footing and power between developed and developing nations within the WTO and with respect to global trade, most specifically in relation to the protectionist policies towards agriculture enacted in many developed countries. These activists also point out that heavy subsidization of developed nations' agriculture and the aggressive use of export subsidies by some developed nations to make their agricultural products more attractive on the international market are major causes of declines in the agricultural sectors of many developing nations.

===Global opposition to neoliberalism===
Through the [[Internet]], a movement began to develop in opposition to the doctrines of [[neoliberalism]] which were widely manifested in the 1990s when the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) proposed liberalization of cross-border investment and trade restrictions through its [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI). This treaty was prematurely exposed to public scrutiny and subsequently abandoned in November 1998 in the face of strenuous protest and criticism by national and international [[civil society]] representatives.

Neoliberal doctrine argued that untrammeled [[free trade]] and reduction of public-sector regulation would bring benefits to poor countries and to disadvantaged people in rich countries. Anti-globalization advocates urge that preservation of the natural environment, human rights (especially workplace rights and conditions) and democratic institutions are likely to be placed at undue risk by globalization unless mandatory standards are attached to liberalization. [[Noam Chomsky]] stated in 2002 that
{{quote|The term "globalization" has been appropriated by the powerful to refer to a specific form of international economic integration, one based on investor rights, with the interests of people incidental. That is why the business press, in its more honest moments, refers to the "free trade agreements" as "free investment agreements" (Wall St. Journal). Accordingly, advocates of other forms of globalization are described as "anti-globalization"; and some, unfortunately, even accept this term, though it is a term of [[propaganda]] that should be dismissed with ridicule. No sane person is opposed to globalization, that is, international integration. Surely not the left and the workers movements, which were founded on the principle of international solidarity—that is, globalization in a form that attends to the rights of people, not private power systems.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky Znet May 07, 2002 / The Croatian Feral Tribune April 27, 2002 {{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/TerrorWar/chomskygab.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807064137/https://www.zmag.org/content/TerrorWar/chomskygab.cfm |archivedate=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Anti-war movement===
{{Main|Anti-war movement}}
By 2002, many parts of the movement showed wide opposition to the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Many participants were among those 11 million or more protesters that on the weekend of February 15, 2003, participated in global [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|protests against the imminent Iraq war]]. Other anti-war demonstrations were [[Community organizing|organized]] by the antiglobalization movement: see for example the large demonstration, organized against the impending war in Iraq, which closed the first [[European Social Forum]] in November 2002 in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1109-01.htm |title="Half-A-Million March in Anti-War Rally in Italy", ''Reuters'', November 9, 2002, Luke Baker |publisher=Commondreams.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK20uY9X?url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1109-01.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-globalization militants worried for a proper functioning of democratic institutions as the leaders of many democratic countries ([[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) were acting against the wishes of the majorities of their populations in supporting the war.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 2003, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/29/spain.iraq .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 2003, https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/18/politics.iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky asserted that these leaders "showed their contempt for democracy". Critics of this type of argument have tended to point out that this is just a standard criticism of [[representative democracy]] — a democratically elected government will not always act in the direction of greatest current public support — and that, therefore, there is no inconsistency in the leaders' positions given that these countries are [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The [[economics|economic]] and [[war|military]] issues are closely linked in the eyes of many within the movement.

===Appropriateness of the term===
Many participants (see Noam Chomsky's quotes above) consider the term "anti-globalization" to be a [[misnomer]]. The term suggests that its followers support [[protectionism]] and/or [[nationalism]], which is not always the case - in fact, some supporters of anti-globalization are strong opponents of both nationalism and protectionism: for example, the [[No Border network]] argues for unrestricted migration and the abolition of all national border controls. S. A. Hamed Hosseini (an Australian sociologist and expert in global social movement studies), argues that the term anti-globalization can be ideal-typically used only to refer to only one ideological vision he detects alongside three other visions (the [[anti-globalist]], the [[alter-globalist]] and the [[alter-globalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hosseini|first=S A Hamed|title=Alternative globalizations: an integrative approach to studying dissident knowledge in the global justice movement|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-49476-2|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415494762/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the three latter ideal-typical visions can be categorized under the title of [[global justice movement]]. According to him, while the first two visions (the alter-globalism and the anti-globalism) represent the reconstructed forms of old and new left ideologies, respectively, in the context of current globalization, only the third one has shown the capacity to respond more effectively to the intellectual requirements of today's [[global complexities]]. Underlying this vision is a new conception of justice, coined [[accommodative justice]] by Hosseini,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hosseini|first=S A Hamed|title=Global Complexities and the Rise of Global Justice Movement: A New Notion of Justice|journal=The Global Studies Journal|year=2009|volume=2|issue=3|pages=15–36|url=http://gsj.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.184/prod.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new approach towards cosmopolitanism ([[transversal cosmopolitanism]]), a new mode of [[activist knowledge]] ([[accommodative consciousness]]), and a new format of solidarity, [[interactive solidarity]].

Some activists, notably [[David Graeber]], see the movement as opposed instead to [[neoliberalism]] or "[[corporate globalization]]". He argues that the term "anti-globalization" is a term coined by the media, and that radical activists are actually more in favor of globalization, in the sense of "effacement of borders and the free movement of people, possessions and ideas" than are the IMF or WTO. He also notes that activists use the terms "globalization movement" and "anti-globalization movement" interchangeably, indicating the confusion of the terminology. The term "alter-globalization" has been used to make this distinction clear.

While the term "anti-globalization" arose from the movement's opposition to [[free-trade]] agreements (which have often been considered part of something called "[[globalization]]"), various participants contend they are opposed to only certain aspects of globalization and instead describe themselves, at least in French-speaking organizations, as "[[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]", "anti-[[plutocracy]]," or "anti-[[corporation|corporate]]." ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'' 's editor, [[Ignacio Ramonet]]'s, expression of "the one-way thought" (''[[pensée unique]]'') became slang against [[neoliberal]] policies and the [[Washington consensus]].&lt;ref name="ramonet"&gt;{{cite news|title=La pensée unique |publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique |date=January 1995 |url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1995/01/RAMONET/1144 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK21qVRY?url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1995/01/RAMONET/1144 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civic and Racial Nationalist opposition against globalization===

[[File:Donald Trump Victory Speech.webm|thumb|[[Donald Trump]] was elected President of the United States on November 8, 2016.]]

The term "anti-globalization" does not distinguish the international [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] anti-globalization position from a strictly nationalist anti-globalization position. Many nationalist movements, such as the [[France|French]] [[National Front (France)|National Front]], [[Freedom Party of Austria|Austrian Freedom Party]], the Italian [[Lega Nord]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Zaslove | first = Andrej | title = Exclusion, community, and a populist political economy: the radical right as an anti-globalization movement | journal = [[Comparative European Politics]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–189 | doi = 10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110126 | date = July 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/the-golden-dawn-a-love-of-power-and-a-hatred-of-difference-on-the-rise-in-the-cradle-of-democracy-8210724.html|title=The Golden Dawn: A love of power and a hatred of difference on the|date=14 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g8-summit-protests-idUSL0720733520070607 | title=German police capsize protesters' boats at G8| newspaper=Reuters| date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; are opposed to globalization, but argue that the alternative to globalization is the protection of the [[nation-state]]. Other groups, influenced by the [[Third Position]], are also classifiable as anti-globalization. However, their overall world view is rejected by groups such as [[Peoples Global Action]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups such as [[Antifa (United States)|ANTIFA]]. In response, the nationalist movements against globalization, argue that the [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] anti-globalization position is actually a support to [[alter-globalization]].

===Influences===

[[File:Anti WEF graffiti Lausanne.jpg|thumb|Anti-[[World Economic Forum|WEF]] graffiti in [[Lausanne]]. The writing reads: ''La croissance est une folie'' ("Growth is madness").]]

Several influential critical works have inspired the anti-globalization movement. ''[[No Logo]]'', the book by the Canadian journalist [[Naomi Klein]] who criticized the production practices of multinational corporations and the omnipresence of brand-driven marketing in [[popular culture]], has become "manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gaby. "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/12/globalisation.politicsphilosophyandsociety Look, no brands...]", ''The Observer'', November 12, 2000. Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; of the movement, presenting in a simple way themes more accurately developed in other works. In India some intellectual references of the movement can be found in the works of [[Vandana Shiva]], an ecologist and feminist, who in her book ''[[Biopiracy]]'' documents the way that the [[natural capital]] of [[indigenous peoples]] and [[ecoregions]] is converted into forms of [[intellectual capital]], which are then recognized as [[exclusive right|exclusive]] commercial property without sharing the private utility thus derived. The writer [[Arundhati Roy]] is famous for her anti-nuclear position and her activism against India's massive hydroelectric dam project, sponsored by the [[World Bank]]. In France the well-known monthly paper ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'' has advocated the antiglobalization cause and an editorial of its director [[Ignacio Ramonet]] brought about the foundation of the association [[ATTAC]]. [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]] of the Transnational Institute has also been a long-term influence on the movement, as the writer of books since 1986 on hunger, debt, international financial institutions and capitalism. The works of [[Jean Ziegler]], [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] have detailed underdevelopment and dependence in a world ruled by the capitalist system. Pacifist and anti-imperialist traditions have strongly influenced the movement. Critics of [[United States foreign policy]] such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Susan Sontag]], and anti-globalist pranksters [[The Yes Men]] are widely accepted inside the movement.

Although they may not recognize themselves as antiglobalists and are pro-capitalism, some economists who don't share the neoliberal approach of international economic institutions have strongly influenced the movement. [[Amartya Sen]]'s ''Development as Freedom'' ([[The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]], 1999), argues that third world development must be understood as the expansion of human capability, not simply the increase in national income per capita, and thus requires policies attuned to health and education, not simply GDP. [[James Tobin]]'s (winner of the [[The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]]) proposal for a tax on financial transactions (called, after him, the [[Tobin tax]]) has become part of the agenda of the movement. Also, [[George Soros]], [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] (another Economic Sciences Nobel prize winner, formerly of the World Bank, author of [[Globalization and Its Discontents]]) and [[David Korten]] have made arguments for drastically improving [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]], for [[debt relief]], [[land reform]], and restructuring [[corporate accountability]] systems. Korten and Stiglitz's contribution to the movement include involvement in [[direct action]]s and street protest.

In some Roman Catholic countries such as [[Italy]] there have been religious influences, especially from missionaries who have spent a long time in the [[Third World]] (the most famous being [[Alex Zanotelli]]).

Internet sources and free-information websites, such as [[Indymedia]], are a means of diffusion of the movement's ideas. The vast array of material on spiritual movements, [[anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]] and the [[Green politics|Green Movement]] that is now available on the Internet has been perhaps more influential than any printed book.

==Organization==
[[File:EdinburghProtests5.jpg|thumb|Anti-globalization protests in [[Edinburgh]] during the start of the [[31st G8 summit]].]]

Although over the past years more emphasis has been given to the construction of grassroots alternatives to (capitalist) globalization, the movement's largest and most visible mode of organizing remains mass decentralized campaigns of direct action and civil disobedience. &lt;!-- These often coincide with meetings of organizations they object to. It wasn't us, Guv? Speculation - activists form a spectrum of views --&gt; This mode of organizing, sometimes under the banner of the [[Peoples' Global Action]] network, tries to tie the many disparate causes together into one global struggle.
&lt;!-- In the process, it also helps to focus global attention both on the institutions of global capitalism (whose policies most movement members feel people would object to if they knew about them) as well as bring attention to the movement itself. Rewrite needed. --&gt;
In many ways the process of organizing matters overall can be more important to activists than the avowed goals or achievements of any component of the movement.

At corporate summits, the stated goal of most demonstrations is to stop the proceedings. Although the demonstrations rarely succeed in more than delaying or inconveniencing the actual summits, this motivates the mobilizations and gives them a visible, short-term purpose. This form of publicity is expensive in police time and the public purse. Rioting has occurred at some protests, for instance in Genoa, Seattle and London - and extensive damage was done to the area, especially targeting corporations, including [[McDonald's]] and [[Starbucks]] restaurants.

Despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of formal coordinating bodies, the movement manages to successfully organize large protests on a global basis, using [[information technology]] to spread information and organize. Protesters organize themselves into "[[affinity group]]s," typically non-hierarchical groups of people who live close together and share a common political goal. Affinity groups will then send representatives to planning meetings. However, because these groups can be infiltrated by law enforcement intelligence, important plans of the protests are often not made until the last minute. One common tactic of the protests is to split up based on willingness to break the law. This is designed, with varying success, to protect the risk-averse from the physical and legal dangers posed by confrontations with law enforcement. For example, in [[Prague]] during the [[Anti-globalization Protests in Prague|anti-IMF and World Bank protests in September 2000]] demonstrators split into three distinct groups, approaching the conference center from three directions: one engaging in various forms of civil disobedience (the Yellow march), one (the Pink/Silver march) advancing through "[[tactical frivolity]]" (costume, dance, theatre, music, and artwork), and one (the Blue march) engaging in violent conflicts with the baton-armed police, with the protesters throwing cobblestones lifted from the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vidal |first1=John |last2=Connolly |first2=Kate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/imf/story/0,7369,373703,00.html |title=Barricades burn in battle of Prague |publisher=Guardian |date=2000-09-27 |accessdate=2010-09-20 |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK23lvLX?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/imf/story/0%2C7369%2C373703%2C00.html |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Most police forces of developed nations do not have water cannons --&gt;
These demonstrations come to resemble small societies in themselves. Many protesters take training in first aid and act as medics to other injured protesters. In the US, some organizations like the [[National Lawyer's Guild]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], provide legal witnesses in case of law enforcement confrontation. Protesters often claim that major media outlets do not properly report on them; therefore, some of them created the [[Independent Media Center]], a collective of protesters reporting on the actions as they happen.

===Berlin88===
{{main|1988 IMF/World Bank protests}}
The Annual Meetings osf the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]], that took place in [[West Berlin]] in 1988, saw strong protests that can be categorized as a precursor of the anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-8060341.html |title=LEFTIST RAMPAGE IN BERLIN HAS 53 HURT, 134 ARRESTED |work=The Boston Globe |date=May 3, 1988 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK24qZbo?url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-8060341.html |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main and failed objectives (as it was to be so many times in the future) was to derail the meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk./berlin.htm |title="We Will Disrupt This Conference", ''Days Of Dissent'' |publisher=Daysofdissent.org.uk. |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK25pjXS?url=http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk./berlin.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris89===
A counter summit against G7 was organized in Paris in July 1989. The event was called "ça suffit comme ça" ("that is enough") and principally aimed at cancelling the debt contracted by southern countries. A demonstration gathered 10,000 people and an important concert was held in la Bastille square with 200 000 people. It was the first anti-G7 event, fourteen years before that of Washington. The main political consequence was that France took position to favor debt cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Japan and the G7/8: 1975-2002 | publisher=Routledge | author=Dobson, Hugo | pages=79–80 | isbn=978-0-415-64933-9| date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madrid94===
The 50th anniversary of the IMF and the [[World Bank]], which was celebrated in [[Madrid]] in October 1994, was the scene of a protest by an ad-hoc coalition of what would later be called anti-globalization movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1994/1003/03041.html | title=IMF and World Bank 50th Birthday Bash: Critics Crash Party | journal=Christian Science Monitor | date=October 3, 1994 | accessdate=13 July 2013 | author=Francis, David R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from the mid-1990s, Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank Group have become center points for anti-globalization movement protests. They tried to drown the bankers' parties in noise from outside and held other public forms of protest under the motto "50 Years is Enough". While Spanish [[King Juan Carlos]] was addressing the participants in a huge exhibition hall, two [[Greenpeace]] activists climbed to the top and showered the attendants with fake dollar bills carrying the slogan "No $s for [[Ozone Layer]] Destruction". A number of the demonstrators were sent to the notorious [[Carabanchel prison]].

===J18===&lt;!-- This section is linked from 1999 --&gt;
One of the first international anti-globalization protests was organized in dozens of cities around the world on June 18, 1999, with those in [[London]] and [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Oregon]] most often noted. The drive was called the [[Carnival Against Capital]], or [[Carnival Against Capital|J18]] for short. The day coincided with the 25th G8 Summit in Cologne, Germany. The protest in Eugene turned into a riot where local [[anarchist]]s drove police out of a small park. One anarchist, [[Robert Thaxton]], was arrested and convicted of throwing a rock at a [[police officer]].&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, [http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/j18.htm ''J18 1999 Our resistance is as transnational as capital''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301100633/http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/j18.htm |date=2007-03-01 }}, ''Days of Dissent'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seattle/N30===
{{Main|World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity}}
The second major mobilization of the movement, known as N30, occurred on November 30, 1999, when protesters blocked delegates' entrance to WTO meetings in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States|USA]]. The protests forced the cancellation of the opening ceremonies and lasted the length of the meeting until December 3. There was a large, permitted march by members of the [[AFL-CIO]], and other unauthorized marches by assorted affinity groups who converged around the Convention Center.&lt;ref&gt;de Armond, Paul, ''Storming Seattle'' &amp; ''Netwar in the Emerald City: WTO Protest Strategy and Tactics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillham, Patrick F. &amp; Marx, Gary T., 2000, ''Complexity and Irony in Policing and Protest: The World Trade Organization in Seattle''.&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters and Seattle riot police clashed in the streets after police fired [[tear gas]] at demonstrators who blocked the streets and refused to disperse. Over 600 protesters were arrested and thousands were injured.&lt;ref&gt;"Orpheus," ''Battle of Seattle'', part 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Three policemen were injured by [[friendly fire]], and one by a thrown rock. Some protesters destroyed the windows of storefronts of businesses owned or franchised by targeted corporations such as a large [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shop and many [[Starbucks]] windows. The mayor put the city under the municipal equivalent of [[martial law]] and declared a [[curfew]]. {{as of|2002}}, the city of Seattle had paid over $200,000 in settlements of lawsuits filed against the [[Seattle Police Department]] for assault and wrongful arrest, with a class action lawsuit still pending.

===Law enforcement reaction===
Although local police were surprised by the size of N30, law enforcement agencies have since reacted worldwide to prevent the disruption of future events by a variety of tactics, including sheer weight of numbers, infiltrating the groups to determine their plans, and preparations for the use of force to remove protesters.

At the site of some of the protests, police have used tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades, rubber and wooden bullets, night sticks, water cannons, [[police dog|dogs]], and horses to repel the protesters. After the November 2000 [[G20]] protest in [[List of demonstrations against corporate globalization#2000|Montreal]], at which many protesters were beaten, trampled, and arrested in what was intended to be a festive protest, the tactic of dividing protests into "green" (permitted), "yellow" (not officially permitted but with little confrontation and low risk of arrest), and "red" (involving direct confrontation) zones was introduced.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In [[Quebec City]], municipal officials built a 3-metre (10&amp;nbsp;ft) high wall around the portion of the city where the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas|Summit of the Americas]] was being held, which only residents, delegates to the summit, and certain accredited journalists were allowed to pass through.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Gothenburg===
[[File:Polisattack.jpg|thumb|Attack of police during the riots in Gothenburg, 15 June 2001]]
{{Main|Protests during the EU summit in Gothenburg 2001}}
On June 15 and 16, 2001, a strong demonstration took place in [[Göteborg]] during the meeting of the European Council in the Swedish town. Clashes between police and protesters were exacerbated by the numerous vandalism of the extreme fringes of the demonstrators, the so-called [[black-bloc]]s. Images of devastation bounced through the mass media, putting a negative shadow on the movement, and increasing a sense of fear through common people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.de/umleitung/2002/deu03/107?lang=de&amp;mimetype=text/html&amp;destination=node%2F3006%3Fpage%3D1|title=Schweden - Amnesty International Deutschland|work=amnesty.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genoa===
{{Main|27th G8 summit#Protests}}
The [[Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest]] from July 18 to July 22, 2001 was one of the bloodiest protests in Western Europe's recent history, as evidenced by the wounding of hundreds of policemen and civilians forced to lock themselves inside of their homes and the death of a young Genoese [[anarchist]] named [[Carlo Giuliani]]—who was shot while trying to throw a fire extinguisher on a policeman—during two days of violence and rioting by groups supported by the nonchalance of more consistent and peaceful masses of protesters, and the hospitalization of several of those peaceful demonstrators just mentioned. Police have subsequently been accused of brutality, torture and interference with the non-violent protests as a collateral damage provoked by the clash between the law enforcement ranks themselves and the more violent and brutal fringes of protesters, who repeatedly hid themselves amongst peaceful protesters of all ages and backgrounds. Several hundred peaceful demonstrators, rioters, and police were injured and hundreds were arrested during the days surrounding the G8 meeting; most of those arrested have been charged with some form of "criminal association" under Italy's anti-[[mafia]] and anti-[[terrorism|terrorist]] laws.

===International social forums===
:{{main|Social forum|European Social Forum|Asian Social Forum|World Social Forum}}
The first [[World Social Forum]] (WSF) in 2001 was an initiative of {{ill|Oded Grajew|pt}}, [[Chico Whitaker]], and [[Bernard Cassen]]. It was supported by the city of [[Porto Alegre]] (where it took place) and the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Worker's Party]]. The motivation was to constitute a counter-event to the [[World Economic Forum]] held in [[Davos]] at the same time. The slogan of the WSF is "Another World Is Possible". An ''International Council'' (IC) was set up to discuss and decide major issues regarding the WSF, while the local organizing committee in the host city is responsible for the practical preparations of the event.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2 International Council]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4_1&amp;cd_language=2 |title=Fórum Social Mundial |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2010-05-18 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2Yzw4g?url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4_1&amp;cd_language=2 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, the IC adopted the World Social Forum Charter of Principles, which provides a framework for international, national, and local Social Forums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2 |title=World Social Forum Charter of Principles |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2ZvbQY?url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WSF became a periodic meeting: in 2002 and 2003 it was held again in Porto Alegre and became a rallying point for worldwide protest against the American invasion of Iraq. In 2004 it was moved to [[Mumbai]], [[India]]), to make it more accessible to the populations of Asia and Africa. This Forum had 75,000 delegates. In 2006 it was held in three cities: [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], [[Bamako]], [[Mali]], and [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. In 2007, the Forum was hosted in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], in 2009 it was in [[Belém]], Brazil, and in 2011 it was in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. In 2012, the WSF returned to Porto Alegre.

The idea of creating a meeting place for organizations and individuals opposed to [[Neoliberalism]] was soon replicated elsewhere. The first [[European Social Forum]] (ESF) was held in November 2002 in [[Florence]]. The slogan was "Against the war, against racism and against neo-liberalism". It saw the participation of 60,000 delegates and ended with a huge demonstration against the war (1,000,000 people according to the organizers). The following ESFs took place in [[Paris]] (2003), [[London]] (2004), [[Athens]] (2006), [[Malmö]] (2008), and the latest ESF in [[Istanbul]] (2010).

In many countries Social Forums of national and local scope were also held.

Recently there has been some discussion behind the movement about the role of the social forums. Some see them as a "popular university", an occasion to make many people aware of the problems of globalization. Others would prefer that delegates concentrate their efforts on the coordination and organization of the movement and on the planning of new campaigns. However it has often been argued that in the dominated countries (most of the world) the WSF is little more than an 'NGO fair' driven by Northern NGOs and donors most of which are hostile to popular movements of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/39464 |title=Pambazuka News |publisher=Pambazuka.org |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2b4Eev?url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/39464 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Korea ===
After the Second World War, North Korea followed a policy of  Anti-Globalization. However, in recent decades have shown a distinctive rise in globalization movements in North Korea. Under the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, Pyongyang(2002), introduced a number of reforms in areas such as technology and trade. The reform that had the most significance to North Korea was trade. North Korea saw a change in trading partnerships. They now not only traded with themselves but also with South Korea and China. North Korea introduced these reforms because they were lacking in areas of technology and trade and they realized that they could not maintain themselves as a society without help from other. But even with these new reforms North Korea still remains the most isolated society in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Chanlett-Avery and Nanto, Dick North Korea: Economic Leverage and Policy Analysis.Congressional Research Service ,2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The anti-globalization movement has been criticized by politicians, members of [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[think tank]]s, and many mainstream [[economists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofi.su.se/wp/WP06-7.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625032200/http://www.sofi.su.se/wp/WP06-7.pdf |date=June 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of evidence===
Critics assert that the empirical evidence does not support the views of the anti-globalization movement. These critics point to statistical trends which are interpreted to be results of globalization, capitalism, and the economic growth they encourage.
* There has been an absolute decrease in the percentage of people in developing countries living below $1 per day in east Asia (adjusted for inflation and purchasing power). Sub Saharan Africa, as an area that felt the consequences of poor governance and was less responsive to globalization, has seen an increase in poverty while all other areas of the world have seen no change in rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp |title=Welcome to PovcalNet |publisher=Iresearch.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2dxCfz?url=http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The increase in [[universal suffrage]], from no nations in 1900 to 62.5% of all nations in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=74 |title=End of Century Survey Finds Dramatic Gains for Democracy |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |date=1999-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2edQkc?url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=74 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are similar trends for electric power, cars, radios, and telephones per capita as well as the percentage of the population with access to clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VC6-4F02KWN-8&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=01%2F01%2F2005&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_cdi=5946&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_artOutline=Y&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=273c9d354f2f52b3b14606a5a3b2d69f#bfn25 |title=Why Are We Worried About Income?

Members of the anti-globalization movement argue that positive data from countries which largely ignored neoliberal prescriptions, notably China, discredits the evidence that pro-globalists present. For example, concerning the parameter of per capita income growth, development economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]] writes that considering the record of the last two decades the argument for continuing neo-liberal policy prescriptions are "simply untenable." Noting that "It depends on the data we use, but roughly speaking, per capita income in developing countries grew at 3% per year between 1960 and 1980, but has grown only at about 1.5% between 1980 and 2000. And even this 1.5% will be reduced to 1%, if we take out India and China, which have not pursued liberal trade and industrial policies recommended by the developed countries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/pdf/papers/SRtrade2003.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709044054/http://www.fpif.org/pdf/papers/SRtrade2003.pdf |date=July 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jagdish Bhagwati]] argues that reforms that opened up the economies of China and India contributed to their higher growth in 1980s and 1990s. From 1980 to 2000 their GDP grew at average rate of 10 and 6 percent respectively. This was accompanied by reduction of poverty from 28 percent in 1978 to 9 percent in 1998 in China, and from 51 percent in 1978 to 26 percent in 2000 in India.&lt;ref&gt;Jagdish N. Bhagwati. ''In Defense of Globalization.'' (2004). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517025-2}} p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Joseph E. Stiglitz, speaking not only on China but East Asia in general, comments "The countries that have managed globalization...such as those in East Asia, have, by and large, ensured that they reaped huge benefits..."&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E., "Globalism's Discontents," The American Prospect, 13, 1, January 2002, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[The Heritage Foundation]], development in China was anticipated by [[Milton Friedman]], who predicted that even a small progress towards economic liberalization would produce dramatic and positive effects. China's economy had grown together with its [[economic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/TradeandForeignAid/upload/wm_1375.pdf wm_1375.fm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626175616/http://www.heritage.org/Research/TradeandForeignAid/upload/wm_1375.pdf |date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of corporate-led globalization have expressed concern about the methodology used in arriving at the World Bank's statistics and argue that more detailed variables measuring poverty should be studied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/truth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/trade_2004_11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] (CEPR), the period from 1980–2005 has seen diminished progress in terms of economic growth, life expectancy, infant and child mortality, and to a lesser extent education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/development_2005_09.pdf |title=trade_2004_01_08-1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2mRYrK?url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/development_2005_09.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorganization===
One of the most common criticisms of the movement, which does not necessarily come from its opponents, is simply that the anti-globalization movement lacks coherent goals, and that the views of different protesters are often in opposition to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, ''The Multidimensional Crisis and Inclusive Democracy'', ch. 4 ''[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/multi_crisis_id/ch4.htm 'Globalisation' and the Left]''&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the movement are also aware of this, and argue that, as long as they have a common opponent, they should march together - even if they don't share exactly the same political vision. Writers [[Michael Hardt]] &amp; [[Antonio Negri]] have together in their books (''Empire'' &amp;'' Multitude'') expanded on this idea of a disunified [[multitude]]: humans coming together for shared causes, but lacking the complete sameness of the notion of 'the people'.

===Lack of effectiveness===
One argument often made by the opponents of the anti-globalization movement (especially by ''[[The Economist]]''), is that one of the major causes of poverty amongst third-world farmers are the trade barriers put up by rich nations and poor nations alike. The [[WTO]] is an organization set up to work towards removing those trade barriers. Therefore, it is argued, people really concerned about the plight of the third world should actually be encouraging free trade, rather than attempting to fight it. Specifically, commodities such as sugar are heavily distorted by subsidies on behalf of powerful economies (the United States, Europe, and Japan), who have a disproportionate influence in the WTO. As a result, producers in these countries often receive 2-3x the world market price. As Amani Elobeid and John Beghin note, the world price might decline by as much as 48% (by 2011 / 2012 baselines) were these distortions to be removed&lt;ref&gt;Elobeid, Amani; Beghin, John. "Multilateral Trade and Agricultural Policy Reforms in Sugar Markets", Journal of Agricultural Economics, 57, 1, 23-48, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many supporters of globalization think that policies different from those of today should be pursued, although not necessarily those advocated by the anti-globalization movement. For example, some see the World Bank and the IMF as corrupt bureaucracies which have given repeated loans to dictators who never do any reforms. Some, like [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando De Soto]], argue that much of the poverty in the Third World countries is caused by the lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized [[property rights]]. De Soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor people in those countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando De Soto. ''The Mystery of Capital''. Basic Books. (2003). {{ISBN|978-0-465-01615-0}} p.210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of widespread "Third World" support===
Critics have asserted that people from poor (the [[Developing country|Developing countries]]) have been relatively accepting and supportive of globalization while the strongest opposition to globalization has come from wealthy "[[First World]]" activists, unions and NGOs. Alan Shipman, author of "The Globalization Myth" accuses the anti-globalization movement of "defusing the Western class war by shifting alienation and exploitation to developing-country sweatshops." He later goes on to claim that the anti-globalization movement has failed to attract widespread support from poor and working people from the developing nations, and that its "strongest and most uncomprehending critics had always been the workers whose liberation from employment they were trying to secure."&lt;ref&gt;Shipman, Alan "The Globalization Myth" Icon Books, 2002, p. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics assert that people from the Third World see the anti-globalization movement as a threat to their jobs, wages, consuming options and livelihoods, and that a cessation or reversal of globalization would result in many people in poor countries being left in greater poverty. [[Jesús F. Reyes Heroles]] the former Mexican Ambassador to the US, stated that "in a poor country like ours, the alternative to low-paid jobs isn't well-paid ones, it's no jobs at all."&lt;ref&gt;Johan Norberg. ''In Defense of Global Capitalism''. {{ISBN|978-1-930865-47-1}} p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's Ambassador to the UN has also stated "The question is why all of a sudden, when third world labor has proved to be competitive, why do industrial countries start feeling concerned about our workers? When all of a sudden there is a concern about the welfare of our workers, it is suspicious."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Veseth, [[Louis Uchitelle]]. ''The Rise of the Global Economy''. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-369-9}} p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there have been notable protests against certain globalization policies by workers in developing nations as in the cause of Indian farmers protesting against patenting seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pro-ch.htm |title=Indian farmers protest against pro-liberalization agricultural policy |publisher=Twnside.org.sg |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2o10S7?url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pro-ch.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years, many developing countries (esp. in Latin America and Caribbean) created alter-globalization organizations as economic blocs [[Mercosur]] and [[Union of South American Nations|Unasur]], political community [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States|CELAC]] or [[Bank of the South]] which are supporting development of low income countries without involvement from [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] or [[World Bank]].

The '''Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research ''' (APN) is an intergovernmental network that promotes policy-oriented research and capacity-building activities related to [[global change]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;APN. “APN E-Lib | Proceedings of the 5th SPG Meeting (2000 Islamabad Pakistan).” Accessed August 12, 2013. http://www.apn-gcr.org/resources/items/show/1825#.UgiTRqwlGVg.&lt;/ref&gt; APN receives financial contribution from the governments of the United States, Japan, Republic of Korea and New Zealand, with in-kind contribution from all it 22 member countries. The APN Secretariat is based in [[Kobe]], Japan, hosted by the [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyogo Prefectural Government]].&lt;ref&gt;APN. “APN Overview.” Accessed August 12, 2013. http://www.apn-gcr.org/apn-overview/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of APN dates back to the 1990 White House Conference on Science and Economics Research Related to Global Change, 17–18 April 1990, at which then US President [[George Bush Sr.|George Bush]] invited countries of the world to join the United States in creating regional networks for North-South scientific cooperation at the intergovernmental level to deal with global environmental change research.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George. “George Bush: Remarks at the Opening Session of the White House Conference on Science and Economics Research Related to Global Change,” April 17, 1990. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=18366.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1992, President Bush and then Prime Minister of Japan [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] signed the 1992 US-Japan Global Partnership Agreement, which, among other things, reaffirmed and strengthened Japan-US commitment to global change research.&lt;ref&gt;USDS and MFA. “1992 Tokyo Declaration on the Japan-U.S. Global Partnership and Its Action Plan,” January 9, 1992. http://www.mac.doc.gov/japan-korea/market-opening/ta920109.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions along these lines ultimately resulted in the establishment of three global change research networks: ENRICH for Europe and Africa, APN for Asia and the Pacific, and [[Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research|IAI]] for the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Fellous, J.-L. and M. Hœpffner. “Global Change Research Networks: The Example of MEDIAS.” Advances in Space Research 17 no. 8 (January 1996): 11–16. doi:10.1016/0273-1177(95)00654-W.&lt;/ref&gt;

APN was formally launched in 1996 at its first intergovernmental meeting held at [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand. In 1997, a competitive process was in place, open to funding applications for scientific research projects relating to global environmental change.

== Membership ==
Starting from 12 countries in 1996, APN membership has grown to 22 as of April 2013. In addition to the 22 full members, institutions and individuals from a number of “approved countries” are eligible for APN funding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7059">[[File:Twierdza brzeska - satyra.jpg|thumb|Satirical drawing from "Hasło Łódzkie" newspaper, 5 October 1930. The text: "From the series: 'Most popular Polish [[spa town]]s' - [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-on-the-Bug]]." The picture is a reference to the Brest trial and the [[Polish legislative election, 1930|"Brest elections"]], when many Polish politicians of the [[Centrolew]] party were imprisoned in the [[Brest Fortress]] (pictured).]]

The '''Brest trials''' ({{lang-pl|Proces brzeski}}) were among the most famous trials conducted under the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Lasting from October 26, 1931 to January 13, 1932, they were held at the [[Warsaw]] Regional Court where leaders of the ''[[Centrolew]]'', a "Center-Left" anti-[[Sanacja|Sanation]]-government political-opposition movement, were tried.

==Overview==
The Polish [[Sanation]] government had invalidated the May 1930 election results by disbanding the parliament in August&lt;ref name="PaczkowskiCave2003"/&gt; and with increasing pressure on the opposition started a new campaign, the new elections being scheduled for November.&lt;ref name="Snyder2005"/&gt; Using anti-government [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] as a pretext, 20 members of the opposition,&lt;ref name="PaczkowskiCave2003"/&gt; including most of the leaders of the ''Centrolew'' alliance (from [[Polish Socialist Party]], [[Polish People's Party "Piast" (1913–31)|Polish People's Party "Piast"]] and [[Polish People's Party "Wyzwolenie"]]) were arrested&lt;ref name="CramptonCrampton1997"/&gt; in September without a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]], only strictly on the order of [[Józef Piłsudski]] and the then Minister of Internal Security, [[Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski]], accusing them of plotting an anti-government [[coup]].&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; The opposition members (who included the former prime minister [[Wincenty Witos]], and [[Wojciech Korfanty]]) were imprisoned in the [[Brest Fortress]], where their trial took place (thus the popular name for the election: the 'Brest election'). A number of less known activists were also arrested throughout the country.&lt;ref name="PaczkowskiCave2003"/&gt; They were released after the end of the election in the same month. The Brest trial ended in January 1932, with 10 accused receiving sentences up to three years of imprisonment; the appeals of 1933 confirmed the sentences. The government however gave the accused the choice of emigrating: five of them did so, the other five stayed on in Poland to serve the prison term instead.&lt;ref name="CramptonCrampton1997"/&gt;

==Honours==
In 2013 Professor Carraro was awarded the decoration of Grand Officer in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.

==Controversies==
In the course of his tenure as Chancellor of Ca Foscari University in Venice, some of his initiatives have been strongly contested by students, faculty and residents.

Chancellor Carraro's decision to invite for the inauguration of 2010-2011 [[Paolo Scaroni]], the managing director of [[Eni|ENI s.p.a]], and recipient of a one-year four months suspended sentence for corruption during "[[tangentopoli]]" occasioned strong protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/cronaca/2010/22-ottobre-2010/ca-foscari-apertura-blindata-tensioni-studenti-polizia-1704008892946.shtml Ca' Foscari, apertura blindata. Tensioni tra studenti e polizia] Corriere del Veneto, 22 October 2010 ('''Italian''')&lt;/ref&gt;

His decision to invite  [[Alessandro Profumo]], former managing director of Italian bank [[Unicredit]] on 23 November 2011, barely a month after the Milan procurators had announced the formulation of charges against Profumo for tax fraud on 27 October 2011, brought renewed protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/875766/Venezia-contestazione-a-Ca-Foscari-studenti-divisi-per-ascoltare-ex-ad-Unicredit.html Venezia: contestazione a Ca Foscari, studenti divisi per ascoltare ex ad Unicredit] Libero, 23 November 2011 ('''Italian''')&lt;/ref&gt;

His decision to swap three buildings owned by Venice university, two of which are grade-listed sixteenth century palaces, with a 1957 office block in 2013 also sparked strong dissent and protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuovavenezia.gelocal.it/cronaca/2013/11/09/news/ca-foscari-cede-i-palazzi-dismesse-le-sedi-di-lingue-1.8087304 Ca’ Foscari cede i palazzi Dismesse le sedi di Lingue] La Nuova de Venezia, 09 November, 2013 ('''Italian''')&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the palaces of the proposed swap is [[Ca Cappello]], the sixteenth century palazzo on the grand Canal that was famously the home of English archeologist and Niniveh discoverer [[Austen Henry Layard]] and his wife Lady Enid Layard.
Together with Ca Cappello the swap would also see the alienation of [[Ca Bembo]] and Palazzo Cosulich.

The language department have in particular objected to the lack of adequate spaces and the lack of transparency over the operation, which was undertaken without their knowledge and participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unive.it/media/allegato/DIP/Management/rassegna-stampa/Il-Gazzettino-VeneziaMestre_1-12-2013.pdf Il Dipartimento Lingue smentisce la delegata del Rettore al sociale] Il Gazzettino, 02 December, 2013 ('''Italian''')&lt;/ref&gt; A student demonstration entered the building while an administrative meeting on the building swap was in session, with considerable controversy ensuing later over whether the chancellor pushed one of the demonstrators or was pushed by one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneziamestre/notizie/cronaca/2013/18-novembre-2013/ca-foscari-scontro-studenti-rettore-video-rete-lettere-solidarieta-2223663928111.shtml Ca' Foscari, scontro studenti-rettore tra video in Rete e lettere di solidarietà] Corriere del Veneto, 18 November 2013 ('''Italian''')&lt;/ref&gt; In an unprecedented move, 115 members of faculty petitioned the chancellor to halt the transfer of property and expressed sympathy with the student protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140127183526/http://www.uninews24.it/news-universita-veneto/11223-ca-foscari,-105-prof-contro-carraro-s-fan.html Ca' Foscari, 115 prof. contro Carraro's fan] Uni News 24, 28 November 2013 ('''Italian''')&lt;/ref&gt; The chancellor's decision to request the police to sue the students for interruption of public service brought even stronger condemnation, and 138 members of faculty expressed solidarity with the students being sued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uninews24.it/news-universita-veneto/11471-ca-foscari,-138-prof-solidali-con-maracchione.html Ca' Foscari, 138 prof. solidali con Maracchione] Uni News 24, 11 December 2013 ('''Italian''')&lt;/ref&gt; Italian investigative weekly L'Espresso has recently noted the problems over the swap, and the apparent mismatch between estimates, and reconstructed the affair from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intranews.sns.it/intranews/20140124/SIK5037.PDF AAA Ca' Foscari Svendesi]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} L'Espresso, January, 2014 ('''Italian''')&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Theodore''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Karl Theodor}}; 11 December 1724 – 16 February 1799) reigned as [[Prince-elector]] and [[Electoral Palatinate|Count Palatine]] from 1742, as [[Duchy of Jülich|Duke of Jülich]] and [[Berg (state)|Berg]] from 1742 and also as prince-elector and Duke of [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] from 1777 to his death. He was a member of the House of [[Palatinate-Sulzbach]], a branch of the [[House of Wittelsbach]].

==Family and ascent==
Charles Theodore was of the [[Wittelsbach]] house [[Palatinate-Sulzbach]].&lt;ref name="Brockhaus"&gt;{{de icon}} Brockhaus Geschichte Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[John Christian, Count of Palatinate-Sulzbach|Johann Christian]], who later became Count Palatine of Sulzbach. His mother was [[Maria Henriette de La Tour d'Auvergne|Marie-Anne-Henriette-Leopoldine de La Tour d'Auvergne, Margravine of Bergen op Zoom]], a grandniece of [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne]]. Charles Theodore was born in [[Drogenbos]] near [[Brussels]] and educated in [[Mannheim]].

Charles Theodore was the [[Lords and margraves of Bergen op Zoom|Margrave of Bergen op Zoom]] from 1728 onwards. He then succeeded his father as Count Palatine of Sulzbach in 1733 and inherited the [[Electoral Palatinate]] and the duchies of Jülich and Berg in 1742, with the death of [[Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine]]. To strengthen the union of all lines of the [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty Charles III Philip had organised a wedding on 17 January 1742 when his granddaughter [[Countess Elizabeth Augusta of Sulzbach|Elizabeth Augusta]] was married to Charles Theodore and her sister Maria Anna to the Bavarian prince [[Duke Clement Francis of Bavaria|Clement]].

As reigning Prince Elector [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatine]], Charles Theodore won the hearts of his subjects by founding an academy of science, stocking up the museums' collections and supporting the arts. When [[Maximilian III, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian III Joseph]] of Bavaria died in 1777, Charles Theodore became also Elector and Duke of Bavaria and moved to [[Munich]].

==Bavarian succession==
Charles Theodore did not immediately take up his new title. He had several mistresses and many illegitimate children. However, these people could inherit neither the Electorate of Bavaria nor that of the Palatine; Charles Theodore needed territory that he could bequeath to his illegitimate children.  Charles Theodore also dreamed of resurrecting the [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian Empire]] of the Middle Ages.{{citation needed|reason=Kingdom of Burgundy or Valois Duchy of Burgundy?|date=October 2010}}

On 3 January 1778, shortly after the death of Max Joseph, Charles Theodore signed an agreement with [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] to exchange southern Bavaria for part of the [[Austrian Netherlands]].

The plan was strongly opposed by [[Maria Anna Sophia of Saxony]], the widow of Max Joseph, and Charles Theodore's cousin [[Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken]], the head of the [[House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld]] and next heir of Bavaria and the Palatinate. They were supported by [[Frederick II of Prussia]], and most of the German minor states.

The ensuing diplomatic crisis led to the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]], which was ended by the [[Peace of Teschen]] (1779). Charles Theodore accepted the Bavarian succession, but agreed that his illegitimate descendants could not inherit Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Marvin E. ''Karl Theodor and the Bavarian Succession''.&lt;/ref&gt; Austria acquired the [[Innviertel]], a part of Bavaria in the basin of the Inn river.&lt;ref&gt;Hochedlinger, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Theodore had only one son with his wife, [[Countess Elizabeth Augusta of Sulzbach]], who died a day after birth. His wife died in 1794. In 1795, he married [[Maria Leopoldine of Austria-Este]], Joseph's niece, but they had no children. A second proposal to exchange Bavaria for the Austrian Netherlands in 1784 also failed as Frederick II of Prussia initiated the [[Fürstenbund]].

When Charles Theodore died, Bavaria and the Electorate passed to his cousin, [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Max Joseph, Duke of Zweibrücken]], the younger brother of Charles August, who had died in 1795.

In 1989, Marvin E. Thomas in '' Karl Theodor and the Bavarian Succession, 1777–1778'' argued that in fact Charles Theodore wanted to maintain possession of his new territory, as is shown in his diplomatic correspondence. Thomas is the only scholar to produce such an analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Marvin E., ''Karl Theodor and the Bavarian Succession, 1777–1778.'' The Edwin Mellen Press: Lewiston/Lampeter/Queenston: 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more widely understood that Charles Theodore continued the despotic and expensive habits he had developed as Elector Palatine.

===Rule as elector of Bavaria===
Charles Theodore never became popular as a ruler in Bavaria according to his critic [[Lorenz von Westenrieder]]. He attempted, without success to exchange the ducal lands of Bavaria, for the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and a royal crown, and he never managed to control the mounting social tensions in Bavaria. After a dispute with Munich's city council, he even moved the electoral residence in 1788 to Mannheim but returned only one year later.&lt;ref&gt;See the Tagebuch of Lorenz von Westenrieder, [https://books.google.com/books?id=h_oAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=westenrieder&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Lorenz von Westenrieder].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, he appointed the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|American Loyalist]] exile [[Benjamin Thompson]] as his aide-de-camp and chamberlain. Over the next 11 years, Thompson reformed the army and many aspects of the state, rising to high ministerial rank with Charles Theodore's backing, and becoming Count von Rumford.

Charles Theodore is also known for disbanding [[Adam Weishaupt]]'s order of the ''[[Illuminati]]'' in 1785.

In 1794, the armies of revolutionary France occupied the [[Duchy of Jülich]], in 1795 they invaded the Palatinate, and in 1796 marched towards Bavaria. Charles Theodore begged [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] for help that would have made Bavaria a puppet state of Austria. When he died of a stroke in Munich in 1799, the population in Munich celebrated for several days. He is buried in the crypt of the [[Theatinerkirche (München)|Theatinerkirche]] in Munich.

Despite the mutual dislike and distrust between the Duke and his Bavarian subjects, Charles Theodore left a distinctive mark on the city of Munich: it was during his reign that the ''[[Englischer Garten (Munich)|English Garden]]'', Munich's largest park, was created, and the city's old fortifications were dismantled to make place for a modern, expanding city. One of Munich's major squares, ''Karlsplatz'', is named after Charles Theodore. Munich natives, however, seldom use that name, calling the square instead ''[[Stachus]]'', after the pub "''Beim Stachus''" that was located there until construction work for Karlsplatz began, mainly because Charles Theodore, as noted above, never enjoyed the popularity in Bavaria that he enjoyed in the Palatinate.

==Character==
Charles Theodore was more interested in arts and philosophy than in politics. Historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] referred to him as a "poor idle creature, of purely egoistical, ornamental, dilettante nature; sunk in theatricals, bastard children and the like; much praised by Voltaire, who sometimes used to visit him; and [[Cosimo Alessandro Collini|Collini]], to whom he [Charles Theodore] is a kind master."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Carlyle]]. ''History of Friedrich II of Prussia called Frederick the great : in eight volumes. Vol. VIII'' in ''The works of Thomas Carlyle in thirty volumes.'' London: Chapman and Hall, 1896–1899,  p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French foreign minister, [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes]], knew him and described his foibles even more succinctly:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although by nature intelligent, he has never succeeded in ruling by himself; he has always been governed by his ministers or by his father-confessor or (for a time) by the [E]lectress [his wife]. This conduct has increased his natural weakness and apathy to such a degree that for a long time he has had no opinions save those inspired in him by his entourage. The void which this indolence has left in his soul is filled with the amusements of the hunt and of music and by secret liaisons, for which ''His Electoral Majesty'' has at all times had a particular penchant.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Easton. "Charles Theodore of Bavaria and Count Rumford." ''The Journal of Modern History.'' Vol. 12, No. 2 (Jun., 1940), pp. 145–160, pp. 145–146 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the course of his career, Charles Theodore acquired a celebrated secretary when the [[Florence|Florentine]] noble, [[Cosimo Alessandro Collini]] (1727–1806), who had been [[Voltaire]]'s secretary, accepted his patronage and remained in the Palatine.&lt;ref&gt;See {{de icon}} [[:de:Cosimo Alessandro Collini|Collini]], found in {{de icon}} Jörg Kreutz: ''Cosimo Alessandro Collini (1727–1806). Ein europäischer Aufklärer am kurpfälzischen Hof.'' Mannheimer Altertumsverein von 1859 – Gesellschaft d. Freunde Mannheims u. d. ehemaligen Kurpfalz; Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen Mannheim; Stadtarchiv&amp;nbsp;— Institut f. Stadtgeschichte Mannheim (Hrsg.). Mannheimer historische Schriften Bd. 3, Verlag Regionalkultur, 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-89735-597-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Charles Theodore certainly wished to acquire more territory, he had only [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural]] sons, thus he preferred territory that he could dispose of through his [[Will and testament|testament]], rather than territory encumbered by a legal [[fee tail|entailment]] that could only pass to a legitimate son.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Smith Williams]]. ''The Historians' History of the World: a comprehensive narrative of the rise and development of nations as recorded by the great writers of all ages.'' London: The Times, 1908, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
Charles Theodore was a great lover of the arts, including drama and especially music. His Mannheim court orchestra was considered one of the finest in its time. The [[Mannheim School]] (including composer [[Christian Cannabich]] and conductor [[Johann Stamitz]]) did groundbreaking work that the celebrated [[Wiener Klassik]] would later draw upon. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] applied for a position with the Mannheim orchestra in 1777, but was turned down, as the court was about to move to Munich. In 1780, Charles Theodore commissioned ''[[Idomeneo]]'' from the composer. Mozart quotes him as saying "No music has ever made such an impression on me. It is magnificent."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Cairns (writer)|David Cairns]], ''Mozart and his operas'', 2006, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the customs of the time, an Italian opera company as well as a troupe of French actors were employed at Mannheim, each performing in their respective tongues. Later, the ''Nationaltheater'' (national theatre) was established, one of the first theatres in Germany to exclusively showcase plays in the native tongue (most notably, the first staging of [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller's]] [[The Robbers|"Die Räuber"]] in 1782).

In the visual arts, a massive collection of plaster casts taken from celebrated antique works was assembled at Mannheim. The preexisting [[Düsseldorf]] gallery, including many works by [[Rubens]], was first transferred to Mannheim, then to Munich, where it was later incorporated in the [[Alte Pinakothek]]. While none of the Mannheim painters are particularly notable today (with the possible exception of Kobell, primarily a master of landscapes), the elector had several highly talented sculptors at his disposal, among them [[Peter Anton von Verschaffelt|Verschaffelt]], Simon Peter Lamine and Konrad Linck. Linck also distinguished himself as a designer of porcelain figurines at [[Frankenthal]].&lt;ref&gt;see The Catalogue of the paintings in the Old pinakothek, Munich https://books.google.com/books?id=d6hJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=karl+theodore+alte+pinakothek+catalogue&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Theodore’s  chief architect Nicolas de Pigage was charged to complete the [[Mannheim Palace]], design the [[Schlosstheater Schwetzingen|Schlosstheater]] and the gardens at [[Schwetzingen Castle|Schwetzingen Palace]] ( including numerous pavilions, among them several artificial "Roman" ruins and a "mosque") as well as [[Schloss Benrath|Benrath palace]]. While these works are in a pure contemporary French style (marked by the transition from late Baroque to early classicism), some of the other architects employed by Charles Theodore were proponents of a more Italianate style. This mixture of influences is, in fact, typical of many German courts of the period.  Charles Theodore was also responsible for the construction of the [[Old Bridge (Heidelberg)|Old Bridge]] in Heidelberg, which bears his name as the ''Karl-Theodor-Brücke''.

Charles Theodore liked to style himself as a prince of peace, in contrast to other princes like his chief political opponent, the great warrior [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] of [[Prussia]]. Allegorically, [[Minerva]], the Roman goddess of wisdom and protectress of the arts, is often depicted as a stand-in for the elector himself. This self-view is best summed up in the inscription of a small monument at Schwetzingen:

''“A field of war and death of  Romans and Germans has been discovered, through the unearthing of weapons, urns and bones, in the year 1765.  –  To the arts of peace, which are the sole joys of his life, the elector Charles Theodore has dedicated this spot, excavated to the height of seven feet, and had this monument erected in 1768.”''

'''Clann na Talmhan''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈkl̪ˠan̪ˠ n̪ˠə t̪ˠal̪ˠuːnˠ|}}, "Family/Children of the land"; formally known as the ''National Agricultural Party'') was an Irish [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] political party active between 1939 and 1965.

==Formation and growth==
Clann na Talmhan was founded on 29 June 1939 in [[Athenry]], County Galway, in the wake of the breakdown of unification talks between the Irish Farmers Federation (IFF) and representatives of farmers in [[Connacht]] on the [[Rates (tax)|rate-paying]] issue. While the IFF supported full derating, the western view was that the largest farmers should not be relieved of all their rate-paying obligations. Were this to happen, the western opinion was that [[indirect tax]]ation would inevitably increase, and small farmers and workers would find themselves appreciably worse-off.

The party was led initially by Galway farmer [[Michael Donnellan (politician)|Michael Donnellan]]. Its foundation represented a revival of agrarian politics in Ireland; from 1922 to 1933 a series of parties had represented farming interests, namely the [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] and the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]]. However, these groups mostly attracted large farmers in the east. In contrast, Clann na Talmhan appealed explicitly to the more numerous small farmers of the west of Ireland. The party's objectives included the promotion of the interests of small farmers, government support for [[land reclamation]], lowering of taxes on farmland, a more progressive system of land rates that would help small farmers, and more intensive [[afforestation]]. During the 1940s it began to adopt [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policies. It supported free secondary education and subsidised university education, as well as state investment in a public healthcare system.

In contrast to the earlier Farmers' Party, Clann na Talmhan emphasised grass-roots campaigning and political agitation. It also developed an efficient electoral machine, largely owing to the advice and skills it gained from former members of [[Fianna Fáil]]. Although the party was hindered to a degree by [[The Emergency (Ireland)|wartime]] restrictions on public meetings and the press, it did have five years to prepare for its first election. Clann na Talmhan first entered national politics when it contested the [[Irish general election, 1943|1943 general election]]. On that occasion, the party won ten seats. This was reduced to nine at the [[Irish general election, 1944|1944 general election]]. Donnellan resigned as leader following the election and was replaced by [[Joseph Blowick]], another western farmer.

==In government and decline==
The party became a prominent participant in the [[Government of the 13th Dáil|first inter-party government]] (1948&amp;ndash;1951), with Blowick serving as [[Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources|Minister for Lands]] and Donnellan becoming a [[List of Parliamentary Secretaries of Ireland|Parliamentary Secretary]]. Clann na Talmhan also went on to become a component of the [[Government of the 15th Dáil|second inter-party government]], with Blowick and Donnellan reprising their ministerial roles. However, this period saw a retrenchment rather than expansion of the party, which did not expand its support beyond western and southern small farmers. Like its spiritual predecessors, Clann na Talmhan could not unite small and large farmers in one party, and this restricted its electoral appeal.

The party began to lose its position after its spells in government. A lack of improvement in the economy during this period led to disillusionment with Clann na Talmhan, and people again began to vote for Fianna Fáil and [[Fine Gael]] rather than small parties. During the 1950s many activists had departed, and the party became little more than a collection of personal electoral machines. By 1961, Donnellan and Blowick were the only party [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s remaining, and the party ceased to exist as an organisation independent of those men. When Donnellan died in 1964 his son [[John Donnellan]] was elected in his place, but for Fine Gael rather than his father's party. Blowick decided not to contest the [[Irish general election, 1965|1965 general election]], and Clann na Talmhan was formally wound up.

The '''Community Courts of Eritrea''' are the foundation of the [[judicial]] system in [[Eritrea]]. The courts typically hear cases regarding minor infractions, typically involving sums of less than approximately $7,300 (100 thousand nakfa).

Individual cases are heard by an individual [[magistrate]]. Defense counsels are permitted to present cases but are typically appointed by the court because [[defendants]] are rarely able to meet the cost of private representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2006-08-01|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61568.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (2005)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community magistrates are elected from the [[communities]] which they will serve. These courts are supervised by the [[Ministry of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2006-08-01 |url=http://www.shabait.com/articles/publish/article_2417.html |title=Minister of Justice conducts seminar in Massawa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207165224/http://www.shabait.com/articles/publish/article_2417.html |archivedate=December 7, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The community courts tend to promote out-of-court settlements and have a small (2.9%) appeal rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Issues ==
The CWA identifies itself as an organization in opposition of [[feminism]] that speaks for evangelical women who feel that the national feminist movement does not support their interests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The CWA has taken strong conservative stances on several highly debated matters. The CWA has publicly stated its opposition to issues such as [[abortion]], [[sex education]], [[same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwfa.org/about/issues/defense-of-family/|accessdate=2015-01-04|title=Defense of Family|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104123900/http://www.cwfa.org/about/issues/defense-of-family/|archivedate=2015-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwfa.org/core-issues-biblical-foundations/|accessdate=2015-01-04|title=Core Issues: Biblical Foundations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104114515/http://www.cwfa.org/core-issues-biblical-foundations/|archive-date=2015-01-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[euthanasia]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[embryonic stem cell research]], [[needle exchange programs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Concerned Women for America of Illinois |title=Drug Needles: Bad Policy, Bad Results |url=http://www.cwfa.org/images/content/drug_needles.pdf |access-date=2016-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061204161902/http://www.cwfa.org/images/content/drug_needles.pdf |archive-date=2006-12-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pornography]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From suffrage to the Senate.

=== Sanctity of life ===
A few years prior to the organization's founding, the Supreme Court released its decisions regarding ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', which granted women the right to attain an abortion, and disbanded all state laws restricting such action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|isbn=978-0-520-05597-1|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|pages=126–7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many of the CWA's members were supporters of the [[Right to life|Right to Life]] Movement and strongly opposed these rulings,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Concerned Women for America is recognized as a [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]] organization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the time of its founding, the CWA, along with similar organizations which spawned during this era, identified itself as part of the "[[Family values|pro-family]] movement,"&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; arguing that [[abortion]] defied both Christian morality and traditional family values.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Christian Right, the Far Right and the Boundaries of American Conservatism|last=Durham|first=Martin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=37–8, 85–6, 94–5|quote=|via=Google Books Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America|last=Rosen|first=Ruth|publisher=Tantor eBooks|year=2000|via=Google Books Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CWA was a proponent of the [[welfare]] revisions set out by the 1994 "[[Contract with America]]", which aimed to reduce the frequency and acceptance of [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] (out of wedlock) births.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These revisions suggested (1) incentivizing states to "reduce illegitimate births without...increas[ing] abortions" by way of [[block grant]]s; (2) denying monetary assistance to "children born to unmarried minor mothers;" and (3) establishing a "family cap" in which unwed mothers could only be compensated for one child,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; all of which the CWA supported due to its strong opposition to abortion and its defense of the traditional family, as discussed below.

Currently, the CWA strives to inform the public of the harm it claims that abortion has on men, women and their families.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The CWA  began using the common pro-life movement's rhetoric of protecting women and their health in the mid-1990s, as a way to promote interest in the pro-life movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reproductive Rights in the Age of Human Rights|last=Hagel|first=Alisa Von|last2=Mansbach|first2=Daniela|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-53951-9|pages=87–140|language=en|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-53952-6_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA lobbies for defunding domestic and international family planning programs, especially those that perform abortions or provide Norplant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The CWA supports crisis pregnancy centers and post-abortion counseling services.

The CWA opposes emergency contraception, such as Plan B, on the grounds that it "blurs the line" between contraception and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynn|first=L.

=== Defense of the family ===
As a supporter of traditional gender roles,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the CWA publicly defends the ideologies of the "traditional family" {{Synthesis inline span|(heterosexual family)|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; and traditional sexual division of labor.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Susan E.|date=1991-05-01|title=Who Speaks for American Women?

Regarding the defense of the family, the CWA was a latecomer to the opposition of the [[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The CWA believes that the woman's place is within the home, therefore the rights set forth by the ERA threatened the traditional nuclear family.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The CWA built a national network of prayer chains in opposition to the ERA.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Splintered sisterhood : gender and class in the campaign against woman suffrage|last=1950-|first=Marshall, Susan E.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-15464-6|oclc=44961722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA was a supporter of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; as the DOMA declared homosexual marriages to be illegal, thus supporting the CWA's ideals of both heterosexuality and marriage.

The CWA believes it is a Christian's duty to start a family, explaining their general disapproval of those who do not wish to have children.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; More specifically, these familial ideals tie into the CWA's understanding of women and motherhood; as expressed by founder, Beverly LaHaye, women have a "natural" desire to be mothers, leading to the organization's encouragement of women's domesticity through stay-at-home motherhood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

The CWA opposed the 1988 Act for Better Child Care (H.R. 3660), which would have provided government-sponsored child care for families in which both parents are working.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunter|1991|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA also testified against the Family and Medical Leave Act on the premise that it was biased against those who could not afford to take leave.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In support of these ideals, the CWA opposes pornography,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; for it believes that consumption of such media can disrupt traditional family values, as well as promote domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; More specifically, the CWA "contends that pornography persuades men to demean their wives, to ruin their marriages, and to engage in illicit sexual behaviors".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, the CWA claims that the proliferation of and lack of regulation for pornography promotes gay rights and premarital sex, both of which it strongly opposes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Education ===
Being a Christian organization, Concerned Women for America is known to promote Christian teachings in schools.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The CWA believes that they must defend "God's truth,"&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and to do so, they advocate against "[[Secular humanism|secular humanist]]" teachings and influence in public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women of the new right|last=E.|first=Klatch, Rebecca|date=1987-01-01|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-4399-0648-4|location=|pages=86–89|oclc=669516615|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is for these reasons that the CWA initially gained recognition as a public policy organization, for it publicly opposed the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in 1962 and 1963, which banned religious teachings and practices, such as prayers and Bible readings, in public schools.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

To provide a more historical context of the organization's educational efforts, in 1983, the CWA's desire for a combination of fundamental and religious teachings was concretely displayed through a lawsuit, known today as ''Mozert'' v. ''Hawkins County Board of Education'', which arose between parents (members of the CWA) and a local Tennessee school board''.''&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The case began when a local mother, Vicki Frost, reprimanded the administration at her daughter's school for providing students with books that discussed evolution, feminism, and telepathy, which she contended "could turn children away from God."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Battleground: One mother's crusade, the religious right, and the struggle for control of our classrooms|last=Bates|first=Stephen|publisher=Poseidon Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|quote=|via=Google Books Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute quickly escalated as a group of likeminded parents joined Frost and filed a federal lawsuit, resulting in the CWA's public support against the school and [[People for the American Way]], one of its many liberal counterparts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fearing the growth of the "Religious New Right,"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the CWA claimed that students should have the right to freely exercise their religion, parents should have a voice in their child's education, and there should be greater control over schools as a whole, arguments which gained favor in the trial court in 1986.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; To the CWA's dismay, however, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed this decision in 1987.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Concerned Women for America believes that [[Sex education in the United States|sex education]] should not be taught in school, and that parents should be empowered to teach their own children about sex.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calterone Williams|first=J.|date=2011-08-15|title=Battling a 'sex-saturated society': The abstinence movement and the politics of sex education|journal=Sexualities|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=416–443|doi=10.1177/1363460711406460}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also concede that if it is taught in school, then it needs to be [[abstinence-only sex education]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many "sexual conservatives," as Lisa McGirr refers to them in her research regarding sex education, have relied on the CWA to help them implement such ideology into the development or modification of sex education programs in schools, as well as to provide educational speakers.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Religious liberty ===
CWA supports [[Creationism and evolution in public education|teaching intelligent design in public schools]] and advocates [[school prayer]], saying in a 1988 book titled ''America: To Pray or Not To Pray?'', that since the ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' Supreme Court case of 1962 outlawed government-directed prayer, morality has declined in public schools and in society in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunter|1991|pp=203–204, 368}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described above, the CWA aided the plaintiff in the 1983 case ''[[Mozert v. Hawkins|Mozert v. Hawkins County School Board]]'', by arguing it is unconstitutional for public schools to require reading material that conflicts with the religious values of parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunter|1991|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/mozert.htm|title=Mozert v.

In similar fashion to the ''Mozert'' case, Concerned Women for America was recognized for its support of Nathan Bishop Middle School and the [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence, RI]] school district in the 1992 ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' case.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fourth R: Conflicts Over Religion in America's Public Schools|last=DelFattore|first=Joan|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Haven, CT|pages=255–261, 288–9|quote=|via=Google Books Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to ''Mozert v. Hawkins County School Board'', in which the CWA protested against the school's nonsecular teaching, ''Lee v. Weisman'' resulted in support from conservative Christian organizations, such as the CWA, who fought to defend the maintenance of religious practices in public schools, such prayer at graduation.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Along with its support of the welfare revisions in the Contract with America, the CWA advocated for other amendments, such as the reinstitution of state-sponsored school prayer and "the eligibility of religious programs for public funding."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Appearing on Fox News, CWA CEO Penny Nance was critical of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] Mayor [[Anthony Foxx]]'s call for a [[National Day of Reason]] in addition to the [[National Day of Prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2318919/Anthony-Foxxs-National-Day-Reason-type-thinking-led-Holocaust-says-Penny-Nance.html|title=Right-wing womens' group says Obama's transportation nominee's National Day of Reason is 'an example of the type of thinking that led to the Holocaust'|last=Daily Mail Reporter|date=2013-05-03|publisher=[[UK Online]]|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504005651/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2318919/Anthony-Foxxs-National-Day-Reason-type-thinking-led-Holocaust-says-Penny-Nance.html|archive-date=2013-05-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National sovereignty ===
The CWA originally opposed the U.S. involvement in the [[United Nations]], but have since accepted the UN and instead focus on the alleged dangers of conferences and treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=J.|date=2000-04-01|title=The christian right coalition and the UN special session on children: prospects and strategies|journal=The International Journal of Children&amp;apos;s Rights|volume=8|issue=4|pages=351–371|doi=10.1163/15718180020494749|issn=1571-8182|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA has more influence in international affairs than many other conservative organizations because they are active in the UN.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The CWA opposed [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]], The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which was adopted by the UN in 1979.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=For God's sake : the Christian right and US foreign policy|last=Lee.|first=Marsden|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84277-885-2|oclc=560612720}}&lt;/ref&gt; They view CEDAW as a tool to undermine the traditional family and guarantee global abortion and prostitution.

=== Sexual exploitation ===
The CWA sees a problem with men becoming addicted to pornography asserting that it leads to the exploitation and victimization of women .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=mantilla|first=karla|date=1997-01-01|title=Workshop: Women and the Religious Right|jstor=25775926|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=27|issue=8|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to pornography, the CWA opposes prostitution.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weitzer|first=R.|title=The Social Construction of Sex Trafficking: Ideology and Institutionalization of a Moral Crusade|journal=Politics &amp; Society|volume=35|issue=3|pages=447–475|doi=10.1177/0032329207304319|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA believes that legalizing prostitution would increase sex trafficking, not decrease it as other organizations have proposed.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Concerned Women for America has been actively involved in the prevention of [[sex trafficking]]; working closely with the [[National Organization for Women]], the [[Family Research Council]], [[Catholics for Choice|Catholics for a Free Choice]], [[Gloria Steinem]], and [[Charles Colson|Chuck Colson]], the CWA has increased awareness of this issue, and was a major contributor in the establishment of The [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|Trafficking Victims Protection Act]] (TVPA) in 2000.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Support for Israel ===
On 8 May 2013 CWA's board of directors voted unanimously to include support for [[Israel]] as part of its core mission. CWA says it will support "laws and policies that strengthen the ties between Israel and the U.S." and "Policies enacted by our [[United States Department of State|State Department]], [[Ministry of Defence|Department of Defense]] and others that encourage the development of our relationship with Israel.” Penny Nancy said that support from CWA's founder, Beverly LaHaye, was the biggest driver behind the group formalizing its support for Israel.&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/06/05/a-strong-new-player-in-the-pro-israel-community/|title=A strong new player in the pro-Israel community|last=Rubin|first=Jennifer|date=5 June 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|location=Washington, D.C.|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053016/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/06/05/a-strong-new-player-in-the-pro-israel-community/|archive-date=2017-12-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is backed by a long history of conservative Christians' support for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Christian Support for Israel: Standing with the Chosen People, 1948–1975|last=Crouse|first=Eric C.|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2015|isbn=978-0-7391-9718-9|location=Lanham, Maryland|page=1|via=Google Books Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working through the media ==
In the late 1990s, the CWA garnered attention by way of its midday broadcasts on [[KFAX]], a San Francisco-based Christian radio station.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Not By Politics Alone|last=Diamond|first=Sara Rose|publisher=Guilford Press|year=1998|location=New York|pages=21–2|via=Google Books Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; These broadcasts often featured ''Beverly LaHaye Live'', a popular talk-show segment which spoke about the CWA's mission, morals, and aspirations for society.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Today, the CWA continues to produce a daily radio show, however it is now entitled ''Concerned Women Today'', and focuses primarily on calling members and other listeners to action by encouraging them to "lobby senators".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Concerned Women for America publishes a monthly magazine called ''Family Voice'', which chronicles their current events as well as ways in which members can become more involved with the organization.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Beverly LaHaye Institute ==
The Beverly LaHaye Institute (BLI) is the research arm of Concerned Women for America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beverlylahayeinstitute.org/bli/ |title={title} |access-date=2014-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803220143/http://www.beverlylahayeinstitute.org/bli/ |archive-date=2004-08-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BLI is considered one of the CWA's official think tanks.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The BLI has a variety of research style essays and briefs that cover a wide variety of topics the CWA is interested in, most of which is published or featured on the CWA website.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

BLI filed an amicus brief in January 2014 in ''[[Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby|Sebelius vs. Hobby Lobby]]''. Most of the amicus briefs in the [[Hobby Lobby]] case focused on religious freedom issues. BLI's brief had a unique focus on rebutting the government's argument that the birth control mandate imposed by [[Affordable Care Act]] would improve women's health and prevent unintended pregnancies. The BLI brief rejected a clear-cut notion of "intended" and "unintended" pregnancies. BLI argued that the government's evidence, based mostly on a 2011 [[Institute of Medicine]] report, did not prove the birth control mandate would increase use rates for birth control or that unintended pregnancies harm women's health. The brief also argued against the government's claim that the mandate promotes "gender equity."&lt;ref name="Amicus"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/obamacare-birth-control-mandate-does-not-promote-womens-health-conservative-womens-group-argues-113718/|title='Obamacare' Birth Control Mandate Does Not Promote Women's Health, Conservative Women's Group Argues|last=Nazzworth|first=Napp|date=31 January 2013|newspaper=The Christian Post|accessdate=31 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202101347/http://www.christianpost.com/news/obamacare-birth-control-mandate-does-not-promote-womens-health-conservative-womens-group-argues-113718/|archive-date=2014-02-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and Family Institute ==
The Culture and Family Institute is one of two of the CWA's research facilities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Culture and Family Institute, founded in 2001, is a think tank that focuses exclusively on opposition to gay rights activism.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

'''Corruption in the Czech Republic''' is considered to be widespread by a majority of the [[Czech Republic|Czech public]], according to [[Transparency International]]’s [[Global Corruption Barometer]] 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 42nd place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas ==

===Political corruption===
A series of political corruption cases has damaged the image of Nečas’ administration (see corruption cases below), which is reflected in Transparency International’s Global Corruption Barometer 2013, which reveals that 73% of the surveyed Czechs consider political parties to be “corrupt” or “extremely corrupt”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business corruption===
In the World Economic Forum’s [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014, surveyed business executives cite corruption as the most problematic factor for doing business in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ernst &amp; Young’s 2012 Global Fraud Survey, 80% of surveyed companies perceive bribery and corruption to be widespread in the business sector, and fewer than 10% state that between 2009 and 2011 their companies “very frequently/always” conducted due diligence on fraud and corruption-related risks before or after acquiring a new business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Beyond:  a place for integrity 12th Global Fraud Survey|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Global-Fraud-Survey-a-place-for-integrity-12th-Global-Fraud-Survey/$FILE/EY-12th-GLOBAL-FRAUD-SURVEY.pdf|publisher=Ernst &amp; Young|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the business environment is characterised by a clear set of rules and little interference, corruption remains an obstacle to doing business in public procurement, awarding of subsidies and direct interactions between public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Integrity System Assessment 2011|url=http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/pub/national_integrity_system_assessment_czech_republic|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption cases===
A case in 2009 involved [[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|Defence Minister]] [[Vlasta Parkanová]] overpaying for four aeroplanes in a 3.5 billion [[Czech koruna|crown]] military contract. As a Member of Parliament, Parkanová was immune from criminal prosecution however. Finance Minister [[Miroslav Kalousek]] was also implicated in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/07/czech-politics|title=Czech corruption continued|work=The Economist|date=9 July 2012|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, a former director of the entity in charge of allocating EU funds in the Liberec and Usti and Labem regions was sentenced to 7.5 years imprisonment and a USD 40,000 fine after being convicted of bribery in connection with the granting of EU funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Report 2012- Czech Republic|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204278|publisher=The US Department of State|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2013 Czech political corruption scandal]] involved an anti-corruption raid, launched by the organised crime unit. It resulted in the arrest of the prime minister’s chief of staff, Jana Nagyova, and seven others. The unit also confiscated approximately GBR 5 million in cash and 10&amp;nbsp;kg of gold found in government offices, banks and private properties. The crimes are suspected to include bribery and abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Czech PM Petr Necas to resign: 'Mr Clean Hands' to quit in effort to end political turmoil over aide spying and corruption scandal|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/czech-pm-petr-necas-to-resign-mr-clean-hands-to-quit-in-effort-to-end-political-turmoil-over-aide-spying-and-corruption-scandal-8661418.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=16 December 2013|location=London|first=Charlotte|last=McDonald-Gibson|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhancing Civil Society Participation ===
Citizens participation and the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption. It is important to develop programs and actions to change the cultural understanding of corruption and helped citizens to act against abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00460|title=Increase in the number of civil complaints against acts of corruption.

{{Elections}}
This article discusses criticisms of political systems, specifically [[representative democracy]] and [[direct democracy]], that use elections as a tool for selecting representatives and/or deciding policy through a formal voting process as well as the act of voting itself.  While [[representative democracy]] (and [[electoral system]]s in general) have become the modern [[civics]] global-standard, many of the below criticisms describe alternatives that existed before and/or independently of electoral systems. This includes but is not limited to the actions and political movements that stem from [[anti-electoralism]], which describes activism around encouraging people not to vote for ethical or ideological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Flanagan, “Resistance from the Right: François de La Rocque and the Réseau Klan,” intersections 11, no. 2 (2010): 108-206.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to differentiate between criticisms of representative government and elections. Several of the following criticisms can be applied to both; however, the election of representatives and the consequences of the process on accountability of elected officials are the main focuses. This article does not address criticisms of neither "[[electoralism]]", the term coined by [[Terry Karl]] nor [[voter suppression]], which is the act of discouraging or preventing people from voting in order to influence the outcome of an election in your favor.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitter, Philippe and Terry Karl. ''What Democracy Is...and Is Not''. http://www.ned.org/docs/Philippe-C-Schmitter-and-Terry-Lynn-Karl-What-Democracy-is-and-Is-Not.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of electoral politics range from cons of specific electoral mechanisms such as legislating by elected officials, [[initiative]], [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] to theoretical opposition to [[voting]]. These criticisms are relevant to discussions around [[electoral reform]] in both democratizing countries in the less developed world as well as most developed countries that espouse some form of electoral democracy.

 the popularity of electoral systems in the Western hemisphere has made them a widely accepted benchmark for democracy and citizen participation around the world. For that reason, scholarly work surrounding alternatives to electoral politics or ideologies in opposition to voting are either fairly limited or not legitimatized by accepted studies or empirical work. Scholarly work from universities surrounding electoral politics tends to focus on improvements, especially electoral reform, based on the assumption that a completely separate alternative could not function in modern society.

== Ideological criticisms ==
=== Libertarian ===
Anarchists and some other [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] typically argue against the legitimacy of political representation although most libertarians accept the concept of [[delegation]]. This is primarily due to their belief that [[majority rule]] [[voting systems]] will erode the [[liberty]] of social and political minorities. Libertarians argue that any truly [[justice|just]] political system must include [[voluntary association]] to prevent the [[oppression|oppressive]] enforcement of law. Additionally, libertarians argue that the election of representatives creates a priest-class of political administrators while disempowering and [[Social alienation|alienating]] the general public, for which voting is a highly mediated form of political engagement that diverts energy away from more effective means of political and social reform (or, for some anarchists, [[revolution]] in the form of [[Direct Action]]). Some libertarians argue that representation is philosophically impossible due to the unique nature of each individual, distinct from social, political, and economic [[social class|class]] interests.

=== Anarchist ===
Many anti-statists believe that the act of voting itself symbolizes delegate power that they themselves cannot possess.&lt;ref&gt;"Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?" http://www.spunk.org/texts/groups/bad/sp000227.txt&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anarchism|Social anarchists]] support [[consensus]]-based [[direct democracy]] as an alternative to an electoral system, and direct action as a means to implement decisions made individually or collectively. Mainstream evolutionary anarchists typically oppose participation in elections or democratic institutions.&lt;ref name=organise&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Vote, Organise!|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/vote.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe in the effectiveness of efforts outside of the electoral process, such as mass demonstrations, strikes, occupations, resistance against laws, virtual participatory-based campaigns, etc.&lt;ref name=organise /&gt;  Notorious 20th century anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] was famously quoted as saying, "If voting changed anything, they’d make it illegal."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman's actual writings expressed a distinct sentiment: "There is no hope even that woman, with her right to vote, will ever purify politics." {{citation|chapter=The Tragedy of Women's Emancipation|last=Goldman|first=Emma|title=Anarchism and Other Essays|pages=219–231|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/goldman/aando/emancipation.html|publisher=Mother Earth Publishing Association|year=1911|edition=Second revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary Marxist/communist ===
Revolutionary communists generally argue against elections under [[capitalism]] as being, at best, insufficient for revolutionary change, and at worst as diverting the personal, economic, and mental resources of the [[working class]] individual towards [[Cul-de-sac|dead end]] politics when that same energy could be used to foment a [[communist revolution]] and create a [[proletarian dictatorship]]. Communists see the global-standard status of elections in the current world as clear evidence that [[market society]] has entrenched itself and been, for the moment, completely victorious over [[armed struggle]] and other truly [[grassroots]] forms of change. For [[Marxists]], the [[wikt:overthrow|overthrow]] of the entire [[ruling class]] means not just a seizure of their [[Political power|state power]], but the establishment of an entirely different sort of state, one structured to protect working class control of [[means of production|production]]—such a fundamental change, it is usually argued, cannot take place within the electoral system of a state designed foremost for the protection of [[private property]].

This is not, however, a critique of elections ''in general,'' and most communists hold that elections of some sort are compatible or even necessary for workers' democracy. [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that a Communist society could only exist with a representative constitution.&lt;ref&gt;"Principles of Communism, The," by Engels, section 18, http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Election of leaders at the local level and, in turn, for wider leadership on the global level, would to a communist undoubtedly make fully [[participatory democracy|participatory]] elections absolutely necessary. However, the difference under such circumstances as compared to capitalism would be that communist elections would reject the representative democracy model as a residual of capitalism; that model, in the view of communists, would make it more likely for the new society to revert to [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and the [[market economy|market]] if fully participatory democracy were not pursued.

It is also not the case that Marxists necessarily shun capitalist elections altogether. The question of whether fighting for reforms is worthwhile and, if so, how much energy should be devoted to them has been an ongoing debate within Marxism from the beginning, and a broad spectrum of positions has resulted. Communists may consider some reforms within capitalism to be tactically important—a [[civil rights]] struggle, for instance, may help to overcome divisions that hurt and weaken all workers. In the most extreme cases of "reformism", a party may actively work to curb more "revolutionary" activity, whether out of momentary caution or genuine commitment to other methods—during the 1968 General Strike of France, Marxist and Communist Parties urged workers to return to their jobs, and express their dissatisfaction with the power of voting. On the other hand, groups such as the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] make a point of abstaining completely from elections. Finally, many Marxist parties run candidates without regard to their chances of winning, purely as a means of disseminating their message.

== Theoretical criticisms ==
{{cquote|text=Even in advanced democracies, there are concerns about electoral systems being inadequately free, competitive, or fair. Complaints are made about financial barriers to running for office; electoral advantages that come with incumbency; systemic difficulties of mounting viable third-party candidates; the role that corporate money and inadequately-regulated television advertising play in determining who is elected; the hurdles erected to keep poor, marginalized, and unsophisticated citizens from successfully registering and voting; the intentional, competition-reducing gerrymandering of districts; and even inadequacies in the mechanics of casting and counting ballots.|author=Alex Guerrero|source="Against Elections: The Lottocratic Alternative," (4)}}
=== Lack of meaningful accountability ===
The promotion of good governance and responsiveness are often cited as the two main justifications for a system of elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Alex. "Against Elections: The Lottocratic Alternative." University of Pennsylvania.

University of Pennsylvania. Phd diss.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that in order for these to exist, elections must be free, regular, competitive and fair. Without this perfect system, officials are likely to be able to avoid accountability mechanisms that should be built into the democratic system.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Alex. "Against Elections: The Lottocratic Alternative." University of Pennsylvania. Phd diss. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens' ability to monitor the behaviors of their representatives and therefore vote or protest in line with their own values is also diminished by conduct, issue, and broad and narrow evaluative ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Alex.

Phd diss. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrero argues that political power is actually more important for interest groups the less it is connected to constituent preferences; therefore, less accountability to constituents may be the easier and cheaper option for representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Alex.

=== Rational voter ignorance ===
[[Rational ignorance]] is a theory based on the idea that there is not adequate enough incentive for voters to educate themselves fully on political issues. The theory explains that the expected benefits of this information are so small, that, for at least some voters, the reward of informed elections is not worth the cost.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Bryan. "Rational Ignorance versus Rational Irrationality." http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/pdfs/rationalignorancevs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is an inherent flaw in mass popular elections, when the majority of constituents have a reason not to vote in a manner that holds elected official completely accountable.

=== Voter fraud ===
In many developing and transitioning countries, [[electoral fraud]] is at least anecdotally present. More recently, in developed countries, especially in the Western Hemisphere, voter fraud has become a hot-button political issues. In several circumstances, however, the broader ideological concerns surrounding voter fraud focus on the idea that fraud or any form of misrepresentation is inherent in the electoral system.

=== Displacement of creative citizenship ===
For several scholars who oppose the electoral system, the existence of [[democratic deficient]] organizations that do not aid in fulfilling the participatory conditions of representative democracy is a driving factor in their criticism. [[Colin Crouch]] argues in ''Post Democracy'' that focus on electoral politics detracts from the power of issue- and cause-based outside groups like large international organizations and smaller grassroots coalitions.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crouch|first1=Colin|title=Post-Democracy|page=15-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He states that citizens engaging with these organizations provides more means to become involved in the political process than simply helping politicians get elected.&lt;ref name=post /&gt; This is especially true in the era of modern technology.&lt;ref name=post /&gt; This speaks to larger issues with the American pluralist system and the impact of lobbying groups on elections.&lt;ref name=post /&gt;

The '''Curtis Culwell Center attack''' was carried out by two Americans from Arizona who attacked officers with gunfire at the entrance to an exhibit featuring cartoon [[images of Muhammad]] at the [[Curtis Culwell Center]] in [[Garland, Texas]] on May 3, 2015.&lt;ref name="cbslocal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2015/05/03/breaking-shooting-in-garland|title=BREAKING: Shooting At Muhammad Art Exhibit In Garland &amp;laquo; CBS Dallas/Fort Worth|publisher=dfw.cbslocal.com|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers shot a [[Garland Independent School District]] (GISD) security officer in the ankle.&lt;ref name="GunmenFire"/&gt; Shortly after the attackers pulled up and opened fire, both were promptly shot and killed by an off duty Garland police officer working as mall security.&lt;ref name="PoliceOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.policeone.com/active-shooter/articles/419451006-Cop-shares-gunfight-lessons-from-ISIS-inspired-Draw-the-Prophet-terrorist-attack/|title=Cop shares gunfight lessons from ISIS-inspired 'Draw the Prophet' terrorist attack

An online ISIL persona run by [[internet troll]] [[Joshua Ryne Goldberg]] had posted maps to the exhibition, and urged his followers to attack the event. Goldberg pled guilty to federal charges in December 2017. His persona was retweeted by one of the attackers on the morning of the attack, and Goldberg claimed responsibility for inciting the attack to multiple news outlets and in his plea agreement.&lt;ref name="goldbergPlea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goldbergCriminalComplaint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCGoldberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsComAuGoldbergGuiltyPleaIncitement"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnGoldberg2015/&gt;

===Location===
The "First Annual Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest" event was hosted at the [[Curtis Culwell Center]], rented from the [[Garland Independent School District]]. The center previously hosted a fundraiser in January called "Stand With the Prophet in Honor and Respect", which was organized to combat negative stereotypes of Islam.&lt;ref name="wash_‘Sta"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Stand With Prophet’ event in Texas draws thousands of protesters|last=Chasmar|first=Jessica|work=The Washington Times|date=January 18, 2015|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/18/stand-with-prophet-event-in-texas-draws-thousands-|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geller had spearheaded about 1,000 picketers at that event.&lt;ref name="seat_City"&gt;{{cite web|title=City: 2 gunmen killed outside Muhammad cartoon contest |last1=Merchant |first1=Nomaan |last2=Stengle |first2=Jamie |work=The Seattle Times |date=May 3, 2015 |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/officer-shooting-at-muhammad-cartoon-contest-in-texas |accessdate=May 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521162524/http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/officer-shooting-at-muhammad-cartoon-contest-in-texas/ |archivedate=May 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GraduationsNear"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/garland-mesquite/headlines/20150504-some-fear-culwell-center-now-a-target-as-busy-graduation-season-nears.ece|title=As graduations near, some fear Garland ISD's Culwell Center now a target|work=The Dallas Morning News|date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of the "First Annual Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest", concerns were expressed by Garland citizens about the center hosting the event due to potential backlash and retaliation, a sentiment that had also been voiced prior to the "Stand With the Prophet in Honor and Respect" event. However, officials allowed both events to proceed as planned, since the school district was bound by a nondiscriminatory leasing policy. Garland ISD board president Rick Lambert said in January, "The Culwell Center is available for rental as long as you comply with the law. Because it is a public facility, the district is not allowed to discriminate based upon viewpoint."&lt;ref name="GraduationsNear"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/garland-mesquite/headlines/20150427-islam-debate-returns-to-garland-isds-culwell-center-with-muhammad-art-event.ece|title=Islam debate returns to Garland ISD’s Culwell Center with Muhammad art event|work=The Dallas Morning News|date=April 27, 2015|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
Minutes prior to the attack, a man, identified by police as one of the gunmen, posted a tweet with the hashtag #texasattack: "May [[Allah]] accept us as [[mujahideen]]." In his tweet, he said he and an accomplice had pledged allegiance to "[[Amirul Mu'mineen]]", which Paul Cruickshank of CNN said probably referred to ISIL leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]]. The user also asked his readers to follow [[Junaid Hussain]] on Twitter. After the shooting occurred, Hussain tweeted: "[[Takbir#Jihadist usage|Allahu Akbar]]!!!! 2 of our brothers just opened fire."&lt;ref name="Yan"/&gt;

Simpson was the subject of an FBI investigation starting in 2006, during which he stated his intent to travel to [[Somalia]] and join fellow [[jihadist]]s.

Abdul Kareem was born and raised in [[Philadelphia]] as Decarus Lowell Thomas. In 2013, he changed his name to Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem and converted to Islam. He occasionally attended the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix since at least 2011 and cleaned carpets there. Kareem had a criminal record in Arizona, including two aggravated drunken driving convictions and an aggravated assault charge in 1997. In the latter incident, a woman told police that he pointed a gun in her direction; Abdul Kareem claimed he instead took the weapon away from his brother during an argument and wasn't pointing it at anyone.&lt;ref name="ManHelped"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/06/16/indictment-phoenix-area-man-helped-plan-provided-guns-for-texas-cartoon-contest/|title=Man allegedly helped plan Texas cartoon contest shooting|work=FOX News|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been arrested a total of eleven times between 1991 and 2004, and also served jail time twice.&lt;ref name="TrialSet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/abdul-malik-abdul-kareem-update-trial-set-for-phoenix-man-tied-to-texas-shooting|title=Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem update: Trial set for Phoenix man tied to Texas shooting|work=ABC 15|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the attack, he lied to FBI investigators several times and said he was not asked by Simpson or Soofi to directly participate in the attack.&lt;ref name="ManIndicted"/&gt; However, according to a confidential informant, Kareem was indeed planning on participating with them and had been angry at the informant for not selling him [[suppressor]]s and [[bulletproof vest]]s.&lt;ref name="TrialSet"/&gt; He allegedly attempted to fund the attack by feigning injuries inflicted after being struck by a car and then making an insurance claim based on the injuries.&lt;ref name=CNN.Linked/&gt; Previously, Abdul Kareem was investigated by the FBI in 2012 for having a terrorism training document on his computer and developing a plot to attack the [[Super Bowl XLIX]] game in [[Glendale, Arizona]] with pipe bombs.&lt;ref name=CNN.Linked&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/26/us/arizona-isis-super-bowl-attack-indictment/|title=Arizona man linked to cartoon contest attack faces new charges|work=CNN|date=December 26, 2015|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ManHelped"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TrialSet"/&gt; He had also reportedly accessed a list released by ISIL, which contained the names and addresses of U.S. service members.&lt;ref name=DallasMorningNews.List&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20151225-charge-links-garland-shooters-trainer-to-isis-list-of-u.s.-troops.ece|title=Charge links Garland shooters’ trainer to ISIS list of U.S. troops|work=Dallas Morning News|date=December 25, 2015|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was arrested on June 11 and charged with "conspiracy, making false statements and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a felony."

==ISIL claim of responsibility==
In addition to the gunman's tweet pledging allegiance to ISIL, the jihadist group claimed responsibility for the attack, stating on its Al Bayan radio station that "two soldiers of the Caliphate executed an attack on an art exhibit in Garland, Texas.... This exhibit was portraying negative pictures of the Prophet Mohammed."&lt;ref name="ISISGarland"/&gt; It marked the first time ISIL took credit for an attack in the mainland U.S.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt; ISIL promised to launch further attacks in the future.&lt;ref name="MaamounYoussef"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/claims-responsibility-texas-cartoon-attack-090629845.html|title=Islamic State claims responsibility for Texas cartoon attack|work=Yahoo!

In December 2017, a Florida Jewish American [[internet troll]], [[Joshua Ryne Goldberg]], was convicted of planning the bombing of a 2015 [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] memorial event in [[Kansas City]].&lt;ref name="goldbergPlea"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://claytodayonline.com/stories/clay-county-man-enters-guilty-plea-to-bomb-charge,9711|title=Clay County man enters guilty plea to bomb charge|work=Clay Today|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his communications with an FBI informant, Goldberg claimed credit for inspiring the Garland attack.&lt;ref name="goldbergPlea"/&gt; Goldberg's fake Twitter persona using the name "Australi Witness" had posted a map of the Curtis Culwell Center and urged any in the area to attack "with your weapons, bombs, or knives". News reports about Goldberg's online persona calling for the Garland attack first brought Goldberg to the attention of the FBI. The FBI also found that Elton Simpson retweeted a message from Goldberg's Twitter handle on the morning of the attack.&lt;ref name="retweetDailyTelegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/aussie-jihadi-behind-911-memorial-threat-is-actually-a-jewish-american-internet-troll/story-fni0xqrc-1227524374297|title = ‘Aussie jihadi’ behind 9/11 memorial threat is actually a Jewish-American internet troll|date = September 13, 2015|accessdate = September 13, 2015|publisher = The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretzGoldberg"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.675698|title = Australian Online ISIS Jihadist Turns Out to Be Florida Jew|date = September 13, 2015|accessdate = September 13, 2015|publisher = Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeOfIsraelGoldberg"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/florida-jew-arrested-for-posing-as-online-jihadist-encouraging-terrorism/|title = Florida Jew arrested for posing as online jihadist, encouraging terrorism|date = September 13, 2015|accessdate = September 13, 2015|publisher = Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldbergCriminalComplaint"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/file/769491/download|title = United States v.

==Reactions and aftermath==
Following the attack, [[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[Greg Abbott]] released a statement, calling the attack "senseless" and promising there was an investigation underway. He also issued his gratitude to the Garland police officers for their swift action against the assailants.&lt;ref name="2Gunmen"/&gt; [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Jeh Johnson]] said

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The attack] serves as a reminder that free and protected speech, no matter how offensive to some, never justifies violence of any sort. This attack also underscores the importance of close collaboration between federal, state and local authorities in our Nation's homeland security efforts, as well as public awareness and vigilance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Johnson urged American citizens to not "misdirect" their anger at Muslims.&lt;ref name="TrafficCop"/&gt; Texas Republican Senator [[John Cornyn]] said the contest was an expression of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/14ac9186cb9447aea63b8a4f974980ef/US--Prophet-Cartoon-Contest-Shooting-The-Latest |title=Cornyn: Contest an expression of Free Speech |work=The Daily Journal |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530142403/http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/14ac9186cb9447aea63b8a4f974980ef/US--Prophet-Cartoon-Contest-Shooting-The-Latest |archivedate=May 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|U.N. Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] also condemned the attack in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/The-Latest-on-Texas-attack-FBI-searches-2nd-6240858.php |title=The Latest on prophet cartoon case: SWAT helped kill gunmen |work=Chron |date=May 4, 2015 |accessdate=May 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505030701/http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/The-Latest-on-Texas-attack-FBI-searches-2nd-6240858.php |archivedate=May 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim organizations also reacted to the attack. The [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] issued a statement condemning the attack and saying, "Bigoted speech can never be an excuse for violence."&lt;ref name="TrafficCop"/&gt; Dr. Nasim Rehmatullah, National Vice President of the U.S. chapter of the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], also said in a statement: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence is never an acceptable response to hate speech, no matter how inflammatory and uncivilized that speech is. While we do not yet know what motivated these shooters, we urge calm and defer to local, state, and federal authorities to peaceably and justly resolve this.&lt;ref name="SuspectsThere"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the attack, ISIL supporters expressed their support online with postings on ISIL-affiliated websites.&lt;ref&gt;MAAMOUN YOUSSEF, [https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/05/05/is-claims-responsibility-for-texas-cartoon-attack U.S. News &amp; World Report: "Islamic State Says Cartoon Attack Our Work Islamic State group claims responsibility for Texas attack targeting cartoon contest center"], usnews.com, May 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosch Fawstin, the winner of the cartoon contest, has received numerous death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/muhammad-cartoon-contest-winner-retreats-into-hiding-1430852911|title=Muhammad Cartoon Contest Winner Retreats Into Hiding|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=May 5, 2015|author=Nathan Koppel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] plans to discuss the incident in its 2016 report on hate in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/05/us-usa-shooting-texas-cartoonist-idUSKBN0NP1ZS20150505|title=Mohammad cartoonist says U.S. police killing of two gunmen 'justice'|date=May 5, 2015|work=Reuters|author1=Letitia Stein|author2=Colleen Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the attack, the Garland Independent School District announced it would begin reviewing its policy for hosting events at the Curtis Culwell Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khou.com/story/news/local/texas/2015/05/05/garland-isd-to-review-policies-for-booking-event-centers/26911501|title=Garland ISD to review policies for booking event centers|work=KHOU|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 2015, protesters staging a "Freedom of Speech" rally outside of the [[Islamic Community Center of Phoenix]], the same mosque where Simpson and Soofi had attended, were met with counter-protests. [[Jon Ritzheimer]], a former U.S. Marine, organized the protest to take place during Friday evening prayers as a "response to the recent attacks in Texas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/29/us/mohammed-cartoon-contest/|title=Mohammed cartoon contest: Protest held outside Phoenix mosque|date=May 30, 2015|work=CNN|author=Sara Sidner|author2=Ed Payne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with CNN, Geller denied that the event was intentionally provocative, criticized the media for not defending the First Amendment, and pointed out that other religions have been similarly offended but do not react violently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/05/04/pamela_geller_vs_cnn_host_on_mohammed_cartoon_contest_shooting_were_abridging_our_freedoms_so_as_not_to_offend_savages.html|title=Pamela Geller vs. CNN Host on Mohammed Cartoon Contest Shooting: "We're Abridging Our Freedoms So As Not To Offend Savages"|work=Real Clear Politics|date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geller later told [[CNN]] that the shooting would not stop her and the AFDI from organizing similar events in the future. She said regarding the attack, "Freedom of speech is under violent assault here."&lt;ref name="wfaa.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/local/dallas-county/2015/05/04/garland-shooting-stirs-debate-about-art-gathering/26896663|title=Garland shooting stirs debate about cartoon contest|work=WFAA|date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that the shooting showed how "needed our event really was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Garland-Officer-Saved-Lives-at-Prophet-Muhammad-Art-Contest-Police-Say-302436191.html|title=Garland Officer Saved Lives at Muhammad Art Contest, Police Say|work=NBC DFW|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported on August 1 that Soofi, despite his long rap sheet, purchased a [[9mm]] gun in 2010 at Lone Wolf Trading Co., one of the private companies encouraged by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) to sell weapons to persons who normally would not be legally allowed such purchases, an action that would later become the [[ATF gunwalking scandal]]. The ''Tribune'' wrote that Soofi's purchase was initially put on a seven-day hold but that "for reasons that remain unclear, the hold was lifted after 24 hours, and Soofi got the 9-millimeter." The day after the attack, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] sent an urgent firearms disposition request to Lone Wolf Trading Co. As of the date of the ''Tribune''{{'}}s report, the FBI has not released any details of the guns used by Simpson and Soofi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-na-garland-gun-20150801-story.html#page=1|title=Garland, Texas, shooter bought gun in 2010 during Fast and Furious|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=August 1, 2015|accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuit against the FBI ===
The injured security guard, Bruce Joiner, filed a lawsuit in Oct 2017 against the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]. His suit argues the bureau "solicited, encouraged, directed and aided members of ISIS in planning and carrying out the May 3 attack," and is asking for just over $8 million damages.  Evidence submitted to court confirm that an FBI undercover agent, dressed in middle eastern attire,  followed the attackers to the attack site.  When he saw the attack underway he attempted to flee and was nearly killed himself by police at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/victim-of-draw-muhammad-isis-inspired-terror-attack-sues-fbi-accuses-james-comey-of-cover-up/article/2636321 Lawsuit accuses FBI of not stopping Garland Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit alleges that the FBI knew about the attack, and allowed it to proceed, so that their undercover agent can earn "street cred" with ISIS directly.  The suit asks for damages because the FBI knew about the attack but made no effort to stop it, or to warn the intended victims that danger was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freebeacon.com/national-security/fbi-doj-argue-dismissal-suit-garland-texas-attack/ FBI attempts to dismiss lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and criticism of event==

===Support for Geller and AFDI===
In an interview with [[Fox News]] Channel's ''[[The Kelly File]]'', [[UCLA]] School of Law professor [[Eugene Volokh]] said

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]his kind of discussion has value in debate about Islam and about the role of Islam and about the reaction of some Muslims, fortunately only a small portion of Muslims do these kinds of things. But beyond that it has value as a reaffirmation of our free speech rights. It has value as an act of defiance. It has value as people saying: look, we are not going to be shut up. When you tell us that we cannot draw pictures of Mohammed, when you tell us we cannot say these things or else you'll kill us, that just means that we're going to do it again and again to show that you cannot threaten Americans into submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/07/eugene-volokh-interviewed-about-free-speech-by-megyn-kelly/|title=Eugene Volokh interviewed about free speech by Megyn Kelly|date=May 7, 2015|accessdate=May 23, 2015|author=Randy Barnett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Victor Davis Hanson]] wrote in an article in the ''[[National Review]]'' online magazine that "radical Islam has already cut a huge swathe out of American free speech through more than a decade of death threats."

[[Bret Stephens]], [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning columnist for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', put Geller's speech in the same category as [[Bill Maher]] or the writers of ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' — legitimate speech against Islamism — and commented, "I say Islamist because there is a rich history of Muslim depictions of Muhammad." He also added that "those [who] blame Geller for the provocation are [[blaming the victim]] just as those who say rape victims are asking for it." Stephens went on to argue that a "society that rejects the notion of a heckler's veto cannot accept the idea of a murderer's veto..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-defense-of-pamela-geller-1431386626|title=In Defense of Pamela Geller: A society that rejects the notion of a heckler’s veto cannot accept the idea of a murderer’s veto|work=Wall Street Journal|date=May 11, 2015|author=Bret Stephens|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rich Lowry]], writing in ''[[Politico]]'', defended Geller's idea that the contest and exhibit's purpose was about freedom of speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Respectable opinion can't bear the idea that she has become a symbol of free speech, which once upon a time was — and still is, when convenient — one of the highest values of the media and the left. If Geller were a groundbreaking pornographer like the loathsome Larry Flynt, someone would already be planning a celebratory biopic of her life. If she were a gadfly sticking it to a major Western religion rather than to Islam, she might be considered more socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/05/why-wont-pamela-geller-shut-up-117716.html#ixzz3boU8sLpY|title=Why Won't Pamela Geller Shut Up?|work=Politico|author=Rich Lowery|date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticism of Geller and AFDI===
On the day after the shooting, [[Donald Trump]], appearing on ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'', questioned Geller's motives. He said, "It looks like she's just taunting everybody. What is she doing? Drawing Mohammed and it looks like she's actually taunting people. (...) You know, I'm one that believes in free speech, probably more than she does. But what's the purpose of this?" In response to Trump's remarks, [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] said in his program ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', "Mr. Trump is correct. By setting up a contest and awarding $10,000 for a depiction of the Prophet Mohammed, the American Freedom Defense Initiative spurred a violent attack. (...) Insulting a religion with more than a billion followers does not advance the cause of defeating the fanatical jihadists. It hurts the cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-lambasts-disgusting-pam-geller-for-baiting-muslims-with-draw-the-prophet-contest-in-texas-10226027.html|title=Donald Trump lambasts 'disgusting' Pam Geller for baiting Muslims with 'draw the prophet' contest in Texas|newspaper=The Independent|date=May 5, 2015|author=Jenn Selby|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billoreilly.com/b/Defeating-the-Jihad-by-Not-Being-Dumb/250143775297720127.html|title=Defeating the Jihad by Not Being Dumb|newspaper=billoreilly.com|date=May 5, 2015|author=Bill O'Reilly|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fox News]]' ''[[On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren|On the Record]]'' host [[Greta Van Susteren]] criticized Geller for putting police officers' lives in danger. She said, "It's one thing for someone to stand up for the First Amendment and put his own you-know-what on the line, but here, those insisting they were defending the First Amendment were knowingly putting officers' lives on the line — the police."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/05/06/fox-newss-greta-van-susteren-scolds-pamela-geller/|title=Fox News’s Greta Van Susteren scolds Pamela Geller|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 6, 2015|author=Erik Wemple|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geller and [[Islamist]] [[Anjem Choudary]] appeared on ''[[Hannity]]'' on Fox News to debate the merits of AFDI's contest. In response to host [[Sean Hannity]]'s question about whether Choudary supported an unverified ISIL [[fatwa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/05/06/isis_claims_to_have_71_soldiers_in_15_states_ready_to_kill_pam_geller_and_any_who_defend_her|title=ISIS Claims to Have 71 Soldiers in 15 States Ready to Kill Pam Geller and Any Who Defend Her|last1=Kaufman|first1=Scott Eric|date=May 6, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2015|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and posted on an anonymous message board calling for Geller's death, he replied, "This isn't Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck they were drawing. This is the prophet. This woman wants to have people draw cartoons that insult the prophet knowing full well that carries the death penalty in Islam. So definitely, she's asking people to attack." When Hannity asked whether he thought Geller should die, Choudary said, "She should be tried in a [[sharia]] court, be found guilty, and, of course, she would face capital punishment." After Hannity reminded Choudary that Geller is not a Muslim, he continued, "You can't go down that road, insulting Muslims, and think the Muslims aren't going to retaliate back. I would attack someone if they insult my mother, let alone the prophet who I love 100 times more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/05/07/you_want_her_to_die_watch_pam_geller_and_anjem_choudary_brawl_on_hannity|title="You Want Her to Die!": Watch Pam Geller and Anjem Choudary Brawl on "Hannity"|last1=Kaufman|first1=Scott Eric|date=May 7, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2015|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland Mayor Douglas Athas said he wished Geller had not chosen his town for her event and explained, "Her actions put my police officers, my citizens and others at risk. Her program invited an incendiary reaction. She picked my community, which does not support in any shape, passion or form, her ideology. (...) But at the end of the day, we did our jobs, we protected her freedoms and her life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20150505-islamic-state-claims-garland-attack-white-house-says-possible-link-being-investigated.ece|title=Islamic State claims Garland attack; White House says possible link being investigated|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date=May 6, 2015|author=Ray Leszcynski, Todd J. Gillman and Michael E. Young|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', the editor of ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'', Gérard Biard, rejected "attempts by right-wing activists to exploit that attack for their own agendas". He also added, "We have nothing to do with Pamela Geller's work. When Islam or the Prophet Muhammad jump out of the news, we comment on it, we mock it, maybe. But we are not obsessed about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-editor-seeks-to-distance-newspaper-from-anti-islam-causes.html|title=Charlie Hebdo Editor Seeks to Distance Newspaper From Anti-Islam Causes|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 5, 2015|author=Rick Gladstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers Party in the Republic of Austria''' ({{lang-cs|Československá sociálně demokratická strana dělnická v republice Rakoúské}}) was a [[political party]] in [[Austria]], working amongst the [[Czechs|Czech]] minority.&lt;ref name="kow"/&gt; The party was founded on December 7, 1919, as the Vienna branch of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers Party]] separated itself from the party centre in [[Prague]] (with the break-up of the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] the party branches in Vienna and Prague were now parts of two different states).&lt;ref name="wien"&gt;Brousek, Karl M. ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=sv&amp;id=U1yMS8ozHOoC Wien und seine Tschechen: Integration und Assimilation einer Minderheit im 20. Jahrhundert]''. Schriftenreihe des Österreichischen Ost- und Südosteuropa-Instituts, Bd. 7. München: Oldenbourg, 1980. pp. 74-75&lt;/ref&gt; The party worked closely together with the [[Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria]] (SDAPÖ), and cooperated with the Austrian Social Democrats on all political issues. The party contested parliamentary elections on joint lists together with SDAPÖ.&lt;ref name="kow"/&gt;

==History==
The first, and constituent, party congress was held in 1921. The congress adopted a party programme, which included demands such as the right to education in mother language, the unification of the Vienna urban and rural areas into a single electoral constituency, judicial reform, lowering the voting age to 18 years, full press freedom and direct popular intervention in the legislative. Most of the social demands of the party were similar to those raised by SDAPÖ.&lt;ref name="wien"/&gt;

In May 1927 the party congress adopted a new party programme, following the lines of the SDAPÖ ''[[Linzer Programm|Linz Programme]]''.&lt;ref name="kow"/&gt;

The party was banned in February 1934.&lt;ref name="kow"/&gt; The party then began to operate as an underground organization. Publications were printed in neighbouring [[Czechoslovakia]], and smuggled into Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Brousek, Karl M. ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=sv&amp;id=U1yMS8ozHOoC Wien und seine Tschechen: Integration und Assimilation einer Minderheit im 20. Jahrhundert]''. Schriftenreihe des Österreichischen Ost- und Südosteuropa-Instituts, Bd. 7. München: Oldenbourg, 1980. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The party was organized on the principle of individual membership.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OhqESAAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 1940]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1928, the party claimed a membership of around 14,200, out of whom 3,700 were women.&lt;ref name="kon"&gt;[[Labour and Socialist International]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bqElQQAACAAJ Kongress-Protokolle der Sozialistischen Arbeiter-Internationale - B. 3.1 Brüssel 1928]''. Glashütten im Taunus: D. Auvermann, 1974. p. IV. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The highest organ of the party was the party congress, held every two years. The congress elected a Party Presidium and Secretariat. The activists of the party were active in the Austrian [[trade union]] movement.&lt;ref name="kow"&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OhqESAAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 1940]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; The youth wing of the party had, as of 1928, 2,825 members.&lt;ref name="kon"/&gt; In close connection to the party was the educational association, ''Máj'', the Workers Gymnastics Union (DTJ) and cycling clubs. There was also a Czech section of the ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]'', connected to the party.&lt;ref name="wien"/&gt;

The party had offices almost all of the [[Districts of Austria|districts of the country]]. These offices also served as offices for the district branches of the youth and women's wings of the party.&lt;ref name="wien"/&gt;

==Leadership==
As of 1925, Lesak was Chairman of the Party Presidium. In 1928 he had been replaced by W. Filar and in 1931 by Čeněk Sahanek.&lt;ref name="kow"/&gt; Other prominent leaders of the party included the parliamentarian František Dvořák, Antonín Machát (municipal councillor on behalf of the Czech minority in Vienna during the [[Second World War]]), František Strnad, Bedřich Čepelka and Josef Petrů.&lt;ref name="wien"/&gt;

As of 1928, the Party Presidium consisted of Filar (chairman), Drahozal, Kopecká, Skranc, Zedniček, Čižek, Strnad, Skřivan (secretary), Adámek, Hajn, Pechowá and Kohl.&lt;ref name="kon"/&gt;

==Press==
The central organ of the party was ''Vídeňské dělnické listy'' ('Viennoise Workers' Paper').&lt;ref name="kow"/&gt;

==International affiliation==
The party was affiliated to the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1923 and 1940.&lt;ref name="kow"/&gt; Alois Wawrousek represented the party in the Executive of the Labour and Socialist International between August 1925 to 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OhqESAAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 1940]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Democratic Liberal Party (Armenia)''' (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] Ռամկավար Ազատական Կուսակցություն (Հայաստան) pronounced Ramgavar Azatakan Kusaktsutyun (Hayastan) ) is a new political party formed on 3 June 2012 in [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.am/arm/news/108034.html Կազմավորվել է նոր կուսակցություն՝ Ռամկավար ազատական կուսակցություն (Հայաստան)] (in Armenian)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2011, [[Democratic Liberal Party of Armenia]] and [[Armenakan-Democratic Liberal Party]] had signed an initial agreement for launching a unification process between the two parties. The agreement materialized in the organization of general assemblies by the two formation to approve on unification moves.

On 3 June 2012, a joint general constituting assembly was held and union and official declaration of the new party made. Twenty five members were elected as the party's pan-republican Central Committee with Hakob Avetikyan being elected as the general secretary of the party.&lt;ref name=tert&gt;[http://www.tert.am/am/news/2012/06/05/hrak/ tert.com: Միավորված ռամկավար ազատական կուսակցություն–Հայաստանը խոստանում է առավել ակտիվ լինել] (in Armenian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The new party Democratic Liberal Party (Armenia) is made up of the result of the merger of two existing (and initially rival) liberal democratic parties:
*'''[[Democratic Liberal Party of Armenia]]''' (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] Հայաստանի Ռամկավար Ազատական Կուսակցություն (ՀՌԱԿ) ). The party had been established in July 1991 in Armenia after the independence of the new republic. The laws governing establishment of parties in the newly established republic had stipulations regarding political activities by Diasporan political organizations with head offices outside the republic as was the case of the historical ADL, thus the decision to form a distinct Republic of Armenia party as distinct from the pan-Diasporan historical [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party]] (ADL) (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] Ռամկավար Ազատական Կուսակցութիւն (ՌԱԿ) ),&lt;ref name=tert/&gt; although the two parties mostly remained allies throughout the period 1991 until 2012, the date of dissolving of the party.   
*'''[[Armenakan-Democratic Liberal Party]]''' (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] Արմենական -Ռամկավար Ազատական Կուսակցություն ) was established in 2009 as a pan-Armenian and pan-Diasporan political party with head office in Armenia, as a splinter group from the historical Armenian Democratic Liberal Party, as a result of deep internal divisions in the party. Armenakan-Democratic Liberal Party had also taken control of some Diapsoran ADL party organs in the Diaspora. The party was considered as a rival grouping to ADL throughout its existence 2009 until the dissolution of the party in 2012.

The two parties declared in their last respective general assemblies held the decision to liquidate their parties and join in forces in the new party. They also declared in their joint meeting held at the Tekeyan Center in [[Yerevan]] that the Democratic Liberal Party (Armenia) is the rightful historic continuation of the two earlier parties.

The Democratic Liberal Party (Armenia) also made friendly declarations toward the historical '''[[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party]]''' (ADL) in the Diaspora for relationship between the two for very close cooperation in the interest of forming a possible global union in the future.

'''Disabled, Not Half a Human Being''' is an Israeli [[Non-governmental organization]] ([[Voluntary association]]) which works for the rights of [[Disability|people with disabilities]] in the State of [[Israel]]. Its main goals are raising the general [[disability pension]] and equalizing it to the [[minimum wage]], advancing the issue of [[accessibility]], advancing the [[Right to housing]] for disabled people, [[nursing]], proper medical treatment and integration of people with disabilities into [[society]] and [[employment]].

== History ==
The organization was established in April 2016, as a part of a national campaign whose name was "Disabled, Not Half a Human Being", which had begun in January 2015, as a protest to the wear of the disability pension in Israel for more than 15 years. The association is a member of several social forums as "The Forum for the Struggle Against Poverty",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Niv Elis|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Forum-for-Combating-Poverty-says-budget-plans-fall-short-464089|title=Forum for Combating Poverty says budget plans fall short|website=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|language=en|date=2016-08-14|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Forum for the health advancement of people with disabilities", and the national committee for advancing the rights of people with disabilities in the [[Israel Bar Association]].

'''''Eclipse of Reason''''' is a 1987 [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] [[documentary]] video directed, filmed, and narrated by [[Bernard Nathanson]], with an introduction by  [[Charlton Heston]]. ''Eclipse of Reason'' is a follow up to Nathanson’s first film ''[[The Silent Scream]]''. The film is perhaps most known for its controversial depiction of a dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) abortion.&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;Pickering, B., &amp; Lake, R. 1999. "Visual Images as (opposed to?) Reason: The Argument of Eclipse of Reason." Conference Proceedings -- National Communication Association/American Forensic Association (Alta Conference on Argumentation), 253-261. Retrieved from Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete database.{{Verify source|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter of this film focuses more on the moral implications of abortion. It served as Nathanson’s call to the women of the world to end the practice of abortion.&lt;ref name="Pickering"/&gt; This film, as well as ''The Silent Scream'', was instrumental in the Right to Life Committee's garnering the attention of the United States public regarding the issue of abortion.&lt;ref name="Petchesky"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=3177802 |pages=263–292 |last1=Petchesky |first1=Rosalind Pollack |title=Fetal Images: The Power of Visual Culture in the Politics of Reproduction |volume=13 |issue=2 |journal=Feminist Studies |year=1987 |doi=10.2307/3177802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Eclipse of Reason'' represented the argument that the [[fetus]] is human, and therefore abortion is [[murder]].&lt;ref name="Pickering"/&gt; The film also serves to combat critics to ''[[The Silent Scream]]'' who argue that, although Nathanson claimed the film relied only on imagery and not pejorative speech, the film was heavily reliant on upon the language of the narrator. Therefore, ''Eclipse of Reason'' delivers the same message that abortion is murder, with similar imagery as its predecessor ''[[The Silent Scream]]''; however, to avoid the previous appropriation of language over imagery ''Eclipse of Reason'' asks it viewers to consider reason rather than using emotionally charged narration.&lt;ref name="Pickering"/&gt;

==Overview==
{{expand section|date=September 2011}}
''Eclipse of Reason'' shows a late term abortion occurring sometime after the fourth month of [[pregnancy]]. The film focuses on the limbs of the [[fetus]] while in the womb then proceeds to show the abortion in graphic detail. While the fetus in Nathanson’s previous [[The Silent Scream|film]] was little more than a black and white pulsating image, the fetus in ''Eclipse of Reason'' was shown vividly in full color.

Different women who have had abortions and suffered harmful effects from the procedure give testimony later in the film.

Nathanson concludes ''Eclipse of Reason'' with a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of photographs that depicts his idea of opposing worlds, one filled with abortions and one without abortions. He argues that we cannot achieve a “World of Reason” without completely eliminating abortions.&lt;ref name="Pickering"/&gt;

==Critical reception==

According to Newsweek, the film is "harder for critics to dismiss as misleading" than was ''The Silent Scream''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=eZ6Tmr2PaHcC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22eclipse+of+reason%22+newsweek&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OL2cVWT4SJ&amp;sig=Pvf-RcupinDwQ1GSJf2E16SgTEw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0EhtTu-ZA4rSiALzsaGrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22eclipse%20of%20reason%22%20newsweek&amp;f=false{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Eclipse of Reason'' is most heavily criticized for its [[idealization]] of the “World of Reason” and for creating a [[dichotomy]] that may not exist in between the two hypothetical worlds. According to one set of critics Nathanson created a world of good (pro-life) versus evil ([[Abortion-rights movement|pro-choice]]), which directly opposed his intention of creating a film devoid of any sort of emotionally charged language.&lt;ref name="Pickering"/&gt;

The '''electoral roll''' (also called an '''electoral register''', '''voters roll''' or '''poll book''') is a list of persons who are eligible to vote in a particular [[electoral district]] and who are [[Voter registration|registered to vote]], if required in a particular jurisdiction. An electoral roll has a number of functions, especially to streamline voting on election day. Voter registration is also used to combat [[electoral fraud]] by enabling authorities to verify an applicant's identity and entitlement to a vote, and to ensure a person doesn't vote multiple times. In jurisdictions where voting is compulsory, the electoral roll is used to indicate who has failed to vote. Most jurisdictions maintain permanent electoral rolls while some jurisdictions compile new electoral rolls before each election. In some jurisdictions, people to be selected for [[jury]] or other civil duties are chosen from an electoral roll.

Electoral rolls, under various names, are used in, for example, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, but not all jurisdictions require voter registration as a prerequisite for voting, such as in the State of North Dakota in the United States. Most jurisdictions close updating of electoral rolls some period, commonly 14 or 28 days, before an election, but some American jurisdictions allow registration at the same time as attending a polling station to vote, and Australia closes the rolls 7 days after an election is called, rather than with reference to election day.

Traditionally, electoral rolls were maintained in paper form, either as loose-leaf folders or in printed pages, but nowadays [[electronic pollbook|electronic electoral roll]]s are increasingly being adopted. Similarly, the number of countries adopting [[biometric voter registration]] has steadily increased. As of 2016, half of the countries in [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] use biometric technology for their electoral rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/icts-elections|title=ICTs in Elections Database {{!}} International IDEA|website=www.idea.int|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2007}}
A permanent [[Electoral system of Australia#Electoral rolls|Commonwealth electoral roll]], first compiled in 1908 and now maintained by the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC), is used for federal elections and referendums. It also forms the basis of state (except in Western Australia, which compiles its own) and local electoral rolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eca.gov.au/systems/australia/by_category/joint_rolls.htm Joint Rolls Arrangement between Commonwealth, State and Territories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120003728/http://eca.gov.au/systems/australia/by_category/joint_rolls.htm |date=20 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrolment has been compulsory for all eligible voters since 1911 (with the exception of [[Norfolk Island]], where enrolment is voluntary). Eligible voters are [[Australian citizen]]s over the age of 18 years. Residents in Australia who had been enrolled as British subjects in 1984, though not Australian citizens, can continue to be enrolled. (These comprise about 9% of the electoral roll.) Since 2009, New South Wales has drawn information from various government departmental sources to automatically enroll eligible electors onto the state roll, but not the federal roll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/enrol_to_vote/smartroll SmartRoll: The NSW Electoral Commission's Automatic Enrolment Project] at Electoral Commission NSW&lt;/ref&gt; State civil registrars are required to supply information, for example relating to death of a person, to enable names of deceased persons to be removed from electoral rolls.

Currently, the electoral roll records just the name and address of the voter, although in previous years occupation was also recorded. Since 21 July 2004 the Commonwealth electoral roll cannot be sold in any format. It has not been produced in printed format since 1985, when it changed to publication on [[microfiche]]. Today it is only produced in an electronic format, and can only be viewed at an AEC office, each of which holds a copy of the electoral roll for the entire country. These arrangements try to strike a balance between privacy of the voters and the publication of the roll, which is integral to the conduct of free and fair elections, enabling participants to verify the openness and accountability of the electoral process and object to the enrolment of any elector.

== Hong Kong ==
The electoral roll in Hong Kong is maintained by the Registration and Electoral Office (REO). The final register is available every year on 25 July, except for years in which elections for the territory's district councils are held, when the final register is available on 15 September. All permanent residents of the territory, a status which required seven years of continuous residence, are eligible to be registered voters regardless of nationality or citizenship.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voterregistration.gov.hk|title=Voter Registration - 選民登記|author=|date=|website=www.voterregistration.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
The electoral register in Ireland is maintained by the local authorities and all residents that have reached 18 years of age in the state may register at the address in which they are 'ordinarily resident'. Each November a draft register is published after house-to-house enquiries. The register then comes into force the following February after time for appeals and additions. A supplementary register is published which allows voters to make alterations (usually change of address or becoming 18 years of age) prior to voting day. Postal votes are restricted to certain occupations, students and the disabled or elderly resident away from their home. There is also provision for special voters that are usually physically disabled.

While all residents can be registered voting in Ireland depends on citizenship. All residents are entitled to vote in local authority elections. Irish and EU citizens may vote in European parliament elections. Irish and UK citizens may vote in elections to Dáil Éireann. Only Irish citizens may vote in elections for the President and in constitutional referendums.

The electoral register for elections to the six university seats in Seanad Éireann is maintained by the National University of Ireland and University of Dublin. Irish citizens that are graduates of these universities over 18 years of age may register. Voting is by postal vote and residence in the state is not required.

==New Zealand==
Electoral rolls have been used in New Zealand since the late nineteenth century, and some are available in public libraries for [[genealogy|genealogical research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.christchurch.org.nz/FamilyHistory/ElectoralRolls/ Electoral Rolls] at the Christchurch City Libraries website&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the [[Māori people|Māori]] indigenous people have had separate electoral registration; electoral rolls for the Māori were introduced in 1948. In 1975 electors of Māori descent were given the choice of whether to register on the Maori or "general" electoral registers, a choice which allows those who wish for the former to vote for MPs from [[Māori electorates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.org.nz/study/history/maori-vote.html History of the vote in New Zealand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429093638/http://www.elections.org.nz/study/history/maori-vote.html |date=29 April 2007 }} at the Elections New Zealand official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{update|individual voter registration|date=June 2016}}
{{main|Electoral registration in the United Kingdom}}
Within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, the right to register for voting extends to all [[British citizen|British]], [[Irish nationality law|Irish]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and [[European Union]] citizens. British citizens{{clarify|reason=What about British nationals who aren't British citizens and have in the past voted in the UK?|date=July 2013}} living overseas may register for up to 15 years after they were last registered at an address in the UK. Citizens of the European Union (who are not Commonwealth citizens or Irish citizens) can vote in European and local elections in the UK, elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies (if they live in those areas) and some referendums (based on the rules for the particular referendum); they are not able to vote in UK Parliamentary general elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/faq/registering_to_vote.aspx|title=Home - Your Vote Matters|first=Your Vote|last=Matters|date=|website=Your Vote Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for someone to register before their 18th birthday as long as they will reach that age before the next revision of the register.

The register is compiled for each polling district, and held by the electoral registration office. In the United Kingdom, this office is located at the local council (district, borough, or unitary level). In Scotland, the offices are sometimes located with councils, but may also be separate. Northern Ireland has a central Electoral Office run by the government.

At present, the register is compiled by sending an annual canvas form to every house (a process introduced by [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]). A fine of up to £1,000 (level 3 on the [[Standard scale]]) can be imposed for giving false information. Up to 2001, the revised register was published on 15 February each year, based on a qualifying date of 10 October, and a draft register published on 28 November the previous year. From 2001 as a result of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]], the annual 'revised' register is published on 1 December, although it is possible to update the register with new names each month between January and September.

The register has two formats. The full version of the register is available for supervised inspection by anyone, by legal right. It is this register that is used for voting and its supply and use is limited by law. Copies of this register are available to certain groups and individuals, such as credit reference agencies and political parties.

An 'edited' or 'open' version of the register, which omits those people who have chosen to 'opt out', can be purchased by anyone for any purpose. Some companies provide online searchable access to the edited register for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/faq/registering_to_vote.aspx|title=Home - Your Vote Matters|first=Your Vote|last=Matters|date=|website=Your Vote Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Information Commissioner's Office, Electoral Commission, Local Government Association and the Association of Electoral Administrators have called for the abolition of the edited register. The organisations believe that the register should only be used for purposes related to elections and referendums and that the sale of voters' personal details is a practice that may discourage people from registering to vote. The Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee recommended the abolition of the edited register in its report on the Government’s proposals for individual electoral registration and other electoral administration provisions. Other organisations, including credit reference agencies, debt collection agencies and direct marketing companies have argued for the retention of the edited register. However, notwithstanding the above, Mark Harper MP, as Minister for Political and Constitutional Affairs, announced during the committee stage of the Electoral Registration and Administration Bill 2012-13 on 25 June 2012 that the edited register will be retained.

The full register contains the following information:
* elector number (one or more characters indicating the polling district, followed by a number)
* elector's name and address
* date of birth (if 18th birthday falls within a year of the register is published)
* if the elector has requested a postal vote

A 'Marked Register' is a copy of the register that has a mark by the name of each elector who has voted.&lt;ref name="Walsall"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cms.walsall.gov.uk/index/council_and_democracy/elections/electoral_registration_faq.htm#65771 | title=Electoral Registration FAQ | publisher=Walsall Council | accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the record of who has voted in the election, and it is kept for a year after the election.&lt;ref name="BBCNews_3Feb09"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7867022.stm | title=By-election registers go missing | publisher=BBC News | date=3 February 2009 | accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an election anyone can inspect the marked register, and certain people can purchase a copy of it.&lt;ref name="Walsall" /&gt; The marked register does not indicate who electors voted for, nor does it contain ballot paper numbers.&lt;ref name="Tewkesbury"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tewkesbury.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1811 | title=Voting once you are registered | publisher=Tewkesbury Borough Council | accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for a [[Coordinated Online Register of Electors]] (CORE) are underway; the intention being to standardise local registers and permit central data access.

It was suggested that the register data could be taken from the data that was to be held on the proposed [[Citizen Information Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813173356/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmhaff/uc130-vi/uc13002.htm|title=UNCORRECTED TRANSCRIPT OF ORAL EVIDENCE|author=|date=13 August 2004|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on the [[National Identity Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmconst/uc243-i/uc24302.htm|title=Uncorrected Evidence 243|author=|date=|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005 the [[Constitutional Affairs Committee]] and the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] began a joint inquiry into reforming the registration system. In January 2010 the [[Identity Documents Act 2010]] repealed the [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] which set up the National Identity Register.

Despite widespread calls for its introduction, the [[Electoral Administration Act 2006]] did not provide for individual elector registration, on the justification that registration levels would fall. However, the [[Political Parties and Elections Act 2009]] introduced a move from a system of household registration to a system of individual electoral registration in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/elections/voter-registration|title=The Electoral Commission : Voter registration and the electoral roll&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=electoralcommission.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
In the [[United States]] electoral rolls are commonly referred to as poll books. They have been used since the founding to determine voting eligibility. Today, poll books are a list of persons who are eligible to vote in an election. In the United States, the roll is usually managed by a local entity such as a county or parish. However, the data used for electoral rolls may be provided by statewide sources. While traditional poll books are printed voter rolls, more recently [[electronic pollbook]]s have come into favor. Computerized electoral rolls allow for larger numbers of voters to be handled easily and allows for more flexibility in poll locations and the electoral process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1290">An '''extra-parliamentary opposition''' is a [[political movement]] opposed to a ruling [[government]] or [[political party]] that chooses not to engage in [[election]]s. Many [[social movement]]s could be categorized as an extra-parliamentary opposition. 

==Europe==
The [[Germany|German]] [[New Left]] movement ''[[Außerparlamentarische Opposition]]'' (APO, Extraparliamentary Opposition) is one of the best known examples of this phenomenon. The APO challenged the [[grand coalition]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], which controlled 95 percent of the seats in the [[Bundestag]] between 1966 and 1969.

The [[Italy|Italian]] [[Far Left]] movement [[Lotta Continua]] (LC - Continuous Struggle) is one of the best known examples of this phenomenon in Italy.

== America ==
The [[Argentine]] [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] [[Radical Civic Union]] was an extra-parliamentary opposition from 1904 to 1916, when the first [[Secret ballot|secret and compulsory ballot]] took place.

'''The Fishing Party''' (TFP) is a minor [[Australia]]n political party whose primary support base is found among [[Recreational fishing|recreational]] fishers. The party was founded by [[Robert Smith (Australian political figure)|Robert Smith]] in July 2000 and it has branches in several Australian states. It is headquartered in [[Singleton, New South Wales]] (NSW).

The party’s major platform is the  challenging of laws which it considers to be inappropriate to recreational fishing practices. The party’s motto is 'I fish I vote'. TFP has protectionist leanings, in that it wishes to control risk to flora and fauna from infections carried by imports. It sees itself as an 'environmentalist' group with a priority on management and access rather than preservation. It therefore seeks to promote sustainable recreational fishing, with an emphasis on humans as being part of the eco-system, not apart from it.

After enlisting 500 members, the party achieved federal official party status on 25 September 2001. On enlisting 750 members, it achieved NSW official party status on 29 January 2002. On 10 March 2004 the [[Queensland]] branch was launched, and on 13 May 2004 the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] branch came into being. The Fishing Party (Queensland branch) (TFPQ) achieved party registration in 2006, but not until after the 2006 Queensland State election. Nevertheless, the TFP(Qld) endorsed four candidates as independents, and they averaged 8% of the vote, within their respective electorates. The Qld party broke away from the NSW based Federal organisation, using the deregistration of all small parties to register a new name and attempt to widen its appeal and voter base and is now registered with the AEC as [[Australian Fishing &amp; Lifestyle Party]] and no longer has any connection with the Fishing Party. This registration is a current matter before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the federal court.

The federal party membership comes from NSW, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Australian Capital Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania.

The Fishing Party contested their first NSW election in 2003 and in March 2007 campaigned heavily with their preferences responsible to oust the Australian Liberal Party in the seat of Port Stephens on Marine Park regulations. The party contested both those Upper House elections and gained 1.5% of votes for the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (Upper House). The party has not achieved parliamentary representation. The party has also contested the federal elections of 2001, 2004 and 2007 in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and local government council ballots

Founder Robert Smith is a past Australian Anglers Association President General, and is the President of the NSW Fishing Clubs' Association.

Robert Smith contested the [[Lyne by-election, 2008|2008 Lyne by-election]], receiving about 3.5 per cent of the vote.

==History==

===First flash mob===
[[Image:First Sydney flash mob, August 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Flash mobbing was quickly imitated outside of the United States. This picture is of "sydmob", the first flashmob held in Sydney, Australia]]
The first flash mobs were created in [[Manhattan]] in 2003, by [[Bill Wasik]], senior editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="fibre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wasik2"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Bill | last = Wasik | title = #Riot: Self-Organized, Hyper-Networked Revolts—Coming to a City Near You | url = https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_riots/all/1 | journal = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=January 2012 | accessdate =January 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first attempt was unsuccessful after the targeted retail store was tipped off about the plan for people to gather.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Lauren | last = Goldstein | title = The Mob Rules | date = August 10, 2003 | journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time Europe]]  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,474547,00.html | accessdate =March 14, 2007 | volume = 162 | issue = 7 - April 18, 2003 | issn = 0040-781X | oclc = 1767509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wasik avoided such problems during the first successful flash mob, which occurred on June 17, 2003 at [[Macy's]] department store, by sending participants to preliminary staging areas—in four Manhattan bars—where they received further instructions about the ultimate event and location just before the event began.&lt;ref name="Wasik"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Bill | last = Wasik | title = My Crowd, or, Phase 5: A report from the inventor of the flash mob | url = http://harpers.org/archive/2006/03/my-crowd/1/ | format = Subscription | journal = [[Harper's Magazine]] | pages = 56–66 |date=March 2006 | accessdate =February 2, 2007 | issn = 0017-789X | oclc = 4532730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 130 people converged upon the ninth floor rug department of the store, gathering around an expensive rug. Anyone approached by a sales assistant was advised to say that the gatherers lived together in a warehouse on the outskirts of New York, that they were shopping for a "love rug", and that they made all their purchase decisions as a group.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, Doug. "E-mail Communication Facilitates New 'Flash Mob' Phenomenon", Knight Ridder Tribune Business News, July 23, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, 200 people flooded the lobby and mezzanine of the [[Hyatt]] hotel in synchronized applause for about 15 seconds, and a shoe boutique in [[SoHo]] was invaded by participants pretending to be tourists on a bus trip.&lt;ref name="cnn3" /&gt;

Wasik claimed that he created flash mobs as a [[social experiment]] designed to poke fun at [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] and to highlight the cultural atmosphere of [[conformity]] and of wanting to be an insider or part of "the next big thing".&lt;ref name="cnn3" /&gt; ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' wrote, "It may have backfired on him&amp;nbsp;... [Wasik] may instead have ended up giving conformity a vehicle that allowed it to appear nonconforming."&lt;ref name="VCS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=f4b1b51f-1340-46b3-8c14-97405c63b5fe |title=Waterfight in Stanley Park, but are flash mobs starting to lose their edge? |publisher=[[Canwest Publishing Inc]] |last=McMartin |first=Pete |date=July 12, 2008 |accessdate=July 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714033940/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=f4b1b51f-1340-46b3-8c14-97405c63b5fe |archivedate=July 14, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview he said "the mobs started as a kind of playful social experiment meant to encourage spontaneity and big gatherings to temporarily take over commercial and public areas simply to show that they could".&lt;ref name="FMR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/us/25mobs.html|title=Mobs Are Born as Word Grows by Text Message|author=Ian Urbina|date=March 24, 2010|work=The New York Times| accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precedents and precursors===
In 19th-century [[Tasmania]], the term ''flash mob'' was used to describe a subculture consisting of female prisoners, based on the term ''flash language'' for the jargon that these women used. The 19th-century Australian term ''flash mob'' referred to a segment of society, not an event, and showed no other similarities to the modern term ''flash mob'' or the events it describes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Flash Mob | url = http://www.femalefactory.com.au/FFRG/convicts.htm#Flash | work = Cascades Female Factory Historic Site | publisher = Female Factory Historic Site Ltd. | accessdate = October 23, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006203135/http://www.femalefactory.com.au/FFRG/convicts.htm#Flash | archivedate = October 6, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the story "[[Flash Crowd]]" by [[Larry Niven]] described a concept similar to flash mobs.&lt;ref&gt;Nold, Christian (2003). [http://www.softhook.com/legible.htm "Legible Mob"]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of popular and very inexpensive [[teleportation]], an argument at a shopping mall—which happens to be covered by a news crew—quickly swells into a riot. In the story, broadcast coverage attracts the attention of other people, who use the widely available technology of the teleportation booth to swarm first that event—thus intensifying the riot—and then other events as they happen. Commenting on the social impact of such mobs, one character (articulating the police view) says, "We call them flash crowds, and we watch for them." In related short stories, they are named as a prime location for illegal activities (such as pickpocketing and looting) to take place.

Flash mobs began as a form of [[performance art]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]].  In the 1960s, groups such as the Yippies used street theatre to expose the public to political issues.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmic Trigger III, Robert Anton Wilson, 1995, New Falcon Publications&lt;/ref&gt;  Flash mobs can be seen as a specialized form of smart mob,&lt;ref name="fibre"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue6/issue6_nicholson.html| author=Judith A. Nicholson|title=Flash! Mobs in the Age of Mobile Connectivity|publisher=Fibreculture Publications/Open Humanities Press|accessdate=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term and concept proposed by author [[Howard Rheingold]] in his 2002 book ''[[Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution]]''.&lt;ref name="cnn2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/03/timep.smart.mobs.tm/| title=Day of the smart mobs|author=Chris Taylor|date=March 3, 2003|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==
The first documented use of the term ''flash mob'' as it is understood today was in 2003 in a blog entry posted in the aftermath of Wasik's event.&lt;ref name="Wasik2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wasik"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.com/2014/06/the-new-york-times-magazine-names-bill-wasik-deputy-editor/|title=The New York Times Magazine Names Bill Wasik Deputy Editor|publisher=''[[The New York Observer]]''|date=10 June 2014|author=Kara Bloomgarden-Smoke|accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was inspired by the earlier term ''smart mob''.&lt;ref name=wordspy &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wordspy.com/words/flashmob.asp | title = flash mob | first = Paul | last = McFedries | authorlink = Paul McFedries | publisher = Logophilia Limited | work = WordSpy.com | date = July 14, 2003 | accessdate =March 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flash mob was added to the 11th edition of the ''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'' on July 8, 2004 where it noted it as an "unusual and pointless act" separating it from other forms of smart mobs such as types of performance, protests, and other gatherings.&lt;ref name="COED"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/3876017.stm|title=Henry inspires English dictionary|publisher=BBC|date=July 8, 2004|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also recognized noun derivatives are flash mobber and flash mobbing.&lt;ref name="COED"/&gt; ''[[Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English]]'' defines ''flash mob'' as "a group of people who organize on the Internet and then quickly assemble in a public place, do something bizarre, and disperse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English, Preview Edition (v 0.9.6) | title = flash mob | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/flash%20mob | accessdate =April 27, 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition is consistent with the original use of the term; however, both news media and promoters have subsequently used the term to refer to any form of smart mob, including political protests;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3496030.stm | title = Putin protest by flash mob |work=BBC News | date = February 28, 2004 | accessdate =May 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a collaborative Internet [[denial of service]] attack;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Steven | last = Musil | title = This week in Web threats: The Internet is always good for a little fear and loathing | url = http://news.cnet.com/This+week+in+Web+threats/2100-7349_3-5572700.html | work = CNET News | publisher = [[CNET]] | date = February 11, 2005 | accessdate =May 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a collaborative [[supercomputing]] demonstration;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Celeste | last = Biever | title = A Flash mob to attempt supercomputing feat | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4826 | work = [[New Scientist]] | issn=0262-4079|oclc= 2378350 | date = March 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotional appearances by pop musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Elysa | last = Gardner | title = Avril Lavigne, in the flesh, at 'flash mob' appearances | url = http://www.mywire.com/pubs/USATODAY/2004/02/27/384917?extID=10051 |work=USA Today | date = February 27, 2004 | accessdate =May 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The press has also used the term ''flash mob'' to refer to a practice in China where groups of shoppers arrange online to meet at a store in order to drive a collective bargain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/FindDealsOnline/ChinasNewShoppingCrazeTeamBuying.aspx | title = China's new shopping craze: 'Team buying' | work = Christian Science Monitor | date = December 5, 2007 | accessdate =February 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
The city of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], Germany has stopped flash mobs by strictly enforcing the already existing law of requiring a permit to use any public space for an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thelocal.de/society/20090728-20875.html|title=Flash mobs banned in Braunschweig|date=July 28, 2009 | publisher=The Local Europe|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, a number of flash mobs have been stopped over concerns for public health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-world/2008/05/19/videos-police-step-in-to-prevent-facebook-flash-mob-events-115875-20423056/|title=Videos: Police step in to prevent Facebook flash mob events|author=Robert Leigh|work=Daily Mirror |date=May 19, 2008|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Transport Police]] have urged flash mob organizers to "refrain from holding such events ([[silent disco]]) at railway stations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7913034.stm|title=Rail police criticise flash mobs|publisher=BBC News| date=February 26, 2009|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
{{main article|Flash rob}}

He was forced to abdicate both roles, and the brevity of his reign in Bohemia earned him the derisive nickname of "'''the Winter King'''" ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Zimní král''; German: ''Winterkönig'').

Frederick was born at the ''{{lang|de|[[Jagdschloss]]}}'' {{lang|de|[[Deinschwang]]}} (a hunting lodge) near [[Amberg]] in the [[Upper Palatinate]]. He was the son of [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine|Frederick IV]] and of [[Countess Louise Juliana of Nassau|Louise Juliana of Orange-Nassau]], the daughter of [[William the Silent]] and [[Charlotte of Bourbon|Charlotte de Bourbon-Montpensier]]. An intellectual, a [[Mysticism|mystic]], and a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], he succeeded his father as [[Prince-Elector]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Rhenish Palatinate]] in 1610. He was responsible for the construction of the famous ''[[Hortus Palatinus]]'' gardens in [[Heidelberg]].

In 1618 the largely Protestant estates of [[Bohemia]] rebelled against their Catholic King [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], triggering the outbreak of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Frederick was asked to assume the crown of Bohemia. He accepted the offer and was crowned on 4 November 1619,&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;  as '''Frederick I''' ({{lang-cs|Fridrich Falcký}}; the adjective means "of Oberpfalz" or "of the [[Upper Palatinate]]").  The [[estate (land)|estate]]s chose Frederick since he was the leader of the [[Protestant Union]], a military alliance founded by his father, and hoped for the support of Frederick's father-in-law, [[James VI of Scotland and I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England]]. However, James opposed the takeover of Bohemia from the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] and Frederick's allies in the Protestant Union failed to support him militarily by signing the [[Treaty of Ulm (1620)]]. His brief reign as [[King of Bohemia]] ended with his defeat at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] on 8 November 1620 – a year and four days after his coronation.

After this battle, the [[Palatinate campaign|Imperial forces invaded]] Frederick's Palatine lands and he had to flee to his uncle [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice]], Stadtholder of the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1622. An Imperial edict formally deprived him of the Palatinate in 1623. He lived the rest of his life in exile with his wife and family, mostly at [[The Hague]], and died in [[Mainz]] in 1632.

His eldest surviving son [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine]], returned to power in 1648 with the end of the war. Another son was [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], one of the most colorful figures of his time.  His daughter [[Sophia of Hanover|Princess Sophia]] was eventually named [[heiress presumptive]] to the [[British throne]], and is the founder of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] line of kings.

==Youth, 1596–1610==
[[Image:Locator Electoral Palatinate within the Holy Roman Empire (1618).svg|thumb|right|200px|Map showing the [[Electoral Palatinate]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. As son and heir of [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine]] (1574–1610), Frederick was the hereditary ruler of the Palatinate.]]
Frederick was born on 26 August 1596&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leibnitiana"/&gt; at the ''{{lang|de|[[Jagdschloss]]}}'' {{lang|de|[[Deinschwang]]}} (a hunting lodge) near [[Amberg]] in the [[Upper Palatinate]]. His father, [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine|Frederick IV]], was the ruler of [[Electoral Palatinate]]; his mother was [[Louise Juliana of Nassau]], the daughter of [[William I of Orange]] and [[Charlotte of Bourbon|Charlotte de Bourbon-Monpensier]]. Frederick was related to almost all of the ruling families of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and a number of diplomats and dignitaries attended his baptism at Amberg on 6 October 1596. The [[House of Palatinate-Simmern|Palatine Simmerns]], a [[cadet branch]] of the [[House of Wittelsbach]], were noted for their attachment to [[Calvinism]]; this was in marked contrast to the other main line of Wittelsbachs, headed by Duke [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian]], which was deeply devoted to the Roman Catholic Church.

The capital of the Palatinate, [[Heidelberg]], was suffering from an outbreak of [[Bubonic plague]] at this time, so Frederick spent his first two years in the [[Upper Palatinate]] before being brought to Heidelberg in 1598. In 1604, at his mother's urging, he was sent to [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]] to live in the [[Court (royal)|court]] of his uncle [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon]]. During his time at Sedan, Frederick was a frequent visitor to the court of [[Henry IV of France]]. His tutor was Calvinist theologian [[Daniel Tilenus]], a professor of theology at the [[Academy of Sedan]]. During the [[Eighty Years' War]] and the [[French Wars of Religion]], Tilenus called for the unity of Protestant princes, and taught that it was their Christian duty to intervene if their brethren were being harassed. These views are likely to have shaped Frederick's future policies.

==Controversy over guardianship, 1610–1614==
[[Image:Der junge Friedrich V. C-B 011.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of Frederick by [[Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt]], 1613.]]
On 19 September 1610, Frederick's father, Frederick IV, died from "extravagant living"; his son being 14 years old at the time. Under the terms of the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], Frederick's closest male relative would serve as his [[Legal guardian|guardian]] and as [[regent]] of the Palatinate until Frederick reached the age of majority. However, his nearest male relative, [[Wolfgang William, Count Palatine of Neuburg]], was a Catholic, so, shortly before his death, Frederick IV had named another Wittelsbach, [[John II, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken]], as his son's guardian. Frederick V welcomed John to Heidelberg, whereas Wolfgang William was denied entry. This led to a heated dispute among the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1613, [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor]] intervened in the dispute, with the result being that Frederick V was able to begin his personal rule in the Palatinate even though he was still underage. The dispute ended in 1614, when Frederick attained his eighteenth birthday. However, much bad blood among the houses was caused by this dispute.

==Marriage to Elizabeth Stuart==
Frederick IV's marriage policy had been designed to solidify the Palatinate's position within the Reformed camp in Europe. Two of Frederick V's sisters were married to leading Protestant princes: his sister Luise Juliane to his one-time guardian [[John II, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken]], and his sister [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate (1597–1660)|Elizabeth Charlotte]] to [[George William, Elector of Brandenburg]]. Frederick IV had hoped that his daughter Katharina would marry the future [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]], although this never came to pass.
[[Image:Elisabeth Stuart Winterkoenigin 1613 von Anonymus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]] (1596–1662), 1613.]]
In keeping with his father's policy, Frederick V sought a marriage to [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]], daughter of [[James VI of Scotland and I of England]]. James had initially considered marrying Elizabeth to [[Louis XIII of France]], but these plans were rejected by his advisors. Frederick's advisors in the Palatinate were worried that if Elizabeth were married to a Catholic prince, this would upset the confessional balance of Europe, and they were thus resolved that she should marry Frederick V. [[Hans Meinhard von Schönberg]], who had served as Frederick V's ''[[Hofmeister (office)|Hofmeister]]'' since his return to Heidelberg, was sent to London to court the princess in spring 1612. After intense negotiations, a marriage contract was signed on 26 May 1612, over the objection of her mother, [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]].

Frederick travelled to London to collect his bride, landing on English soil on 16 October 1612.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Anne Everett Green and S. C. Lomas, Elizabeth, Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia, 2nd edn (Methuen &amp; Company, 1909).&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick and Elizabeth, who had previously corresponded in French, now met each other for the first time, and got on well together. They were formally engaged in January 1613 and married on 14 February 1613 at the royal chapel at the [[Palace of Whitehall]]. The event was celebrated in [[John Donne|John Donne's]] poetic masterpiece ''Epithalamion, or Mariage Song on the Lady Elizabeth, and Count Palatine being married on St. Valentines Day''. Shortly before the ceremony, Frederick was inducted into the [[Order of the Garter]] and he wore the Order's chain during the wedding ceremony. Elaborate celebrations, organised by [[Francis Bacon]], followed the ceremony; these included a performance of ''[[The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn]]'' by [[Francis Beaumont]] and ''[[The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn]]'' by [[George Chapman]].

On their return trip to Heidelberg, Frederick and Elizabeth travelled to [[The Hague]] to visit [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange]] before leaving for Germany on 5 May 1613. The couple entered Heidelberg on 12 June 1613, amidst widespread celebration. Elizabeth was popular with her new subjects, and this popularity grew when, on 1 January 1614, she gave birth to a son, [[Henry Frederick, Hereditary Prince of the Palatinate|Frederick Henry]].

As part of the marriage negotiations, Frederick had agreed to expand [[Heidelberg Castle]]. These renovations were completed in 1615 and the "Elizabeth Entrance" to Heidelberg Castle was dedicated.

==Electoral reign before the Thirty Years' War, 1614–1618==
[[Image:Hortus Palatinus und Heidelberger Schloss von Jacques Fouquiere.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Heidelberg Castle]] and the ''[[Hortus Palatinus]]'' commissioned by Frederick, and designed by English architect [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652) and French engineer [[Salomon de Caus]] (1576–1626).]]
One of Frederick's first acts upon taking the reins of government was attendance at a meeting of the [[Protestant Union]], during which he was struck by fever and nearly died. Subsequently contemporaries described him as changed, melancholy and possibly depressed. As such, Frederick transferred much responsibility to his [[chancellor]], [[Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Anhalt's political aims and his secret diplomacy against the House of Habsburg see: Walter Krüssmann, ''[http://www.walter-kruessmann.de/ Ernst von Mansfeld] (1580–1626); Grafensohn, Söldnerführer, Kriegsunternehmer gegen Habsburg im Dreißigjährigen Krieg''; Berlin 2010 (Duncker &amp; Humblot, ''Historische Forschungen'', 94; {{ISBN|978-3-428-13321-5}}), especially pp. 81–86, 98–100, 134–139, 170–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick undertook a large building campaign, designed to glorify his regime. In addition to the renovations to [[Heidelberg Castle]] mentioned above, he commissioned a courtyard garden, the ''[[Hortus Palatinus]]'', designed by English gardener [[Inigo Jones]] and French engineer [[Salomon de Caus]]. Frederick was depicted therein as [[Apollo]] and as [[Hercules]].

Politically, Frederick positioned himself as a leader of the Protestant princes in the Holy Roman Empire, and as a defender of the liberty of the German nobles against the Catholic [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Since the [[Peace of Augsburg]], the Empire had been delicately balanced between Catholic, [[Lutheran]], and Calvinist principalities (although Calvinism was not recognised in the Peace of Augsburg). The conflicts between princes of these three faiths developed into a deep struggle over the Empire's constitution. Furthermore, the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], a hiatus in the [[Eighty Years' War]], was set to expire in 1621, and was likely to lead to renewed fighting between the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Spanish Empire]].
[[Image:Frederick V, King of Bohemia by Gerrit van Honthorst.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frederick in Roman garb.]]
With its central location in Germany, the Palatinate was vulnerable to incursions of imperial troops from the [[Habsburg hereditary lands]]. Unlike many principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, the Electoral Palatinate was not a solid dominion, but instead consisted of two unconnected provinces surrounded by foreign lands. The [[Lower Palatinate]] centred on [[Heidelberg]], while the [[Upper Palatinate]] centred on [[Amberg]]. The Lower Palatinate's economy was dominated by agriculture, while the Upper Palatinate was a mining region with one of the most successful economies in Europe.

==King of Bohemia, 1619–20==
===Background and plans===
The [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was an [[elective monarchy]], and despite being a kingdom, was a part of the Empire. Since 1526, the kings of Bohemia had all been members of the [[House of Habsburg]]; since 1555, these kings had also been Holy Roman Emperors. In the early seventeenth century, however, Bohemia faced a political crisis. The [[Estates of the realm]] of Bohemia became worried that the Habsburgs were planning to transform Bohemia into an [[absolute monarchy]]. A large number of Bohemian nobles were Protestant and feared that a Catholic emperor would attempt to impose Catholicism on Bohemia. Thus, a substantial opposition movement developed to the rule of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Rudolf had waged the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1593 to 1606. Dissatisfied with the outcome, Rudolf sought to launch a new war against the Ottomans. To gain Bohemian support, Rudolf agreed to guarantee Bohemia's [[religious liberty]], issuing his so-called [[Letter of Majesty]] in 1609. Still, the Bohemian nobles remained suspicious of Rudolf and in contact with the [[Protestant Union]].

The Bohemian Estates elected the Habsburg [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] as Rudolf's heir, and Matthias became King of Bohemia in 1611 and Emperor in 1612. Yet in the latter year there was discussion within the Protestant Union about fielding a Protestant candidate to supplant Matthias as King of Bohemia, and Frederick's name was discussed in this regard. Strategists in the Palatinate believed that if Frederick became king, this would lead [[John George I, Elector of Saxony]], to break his alliance with the Habsburgs and come fully to the Protestant cause. This assumption proved unfounded.
[[Image:Christian I Anhalt Bernburg.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick's chancellor [[Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg]] (1568–1630).]]
Meanwhile, the sectarian conflicts in Bohemia continued. In 1617, Matthias prevailed on the Bohemian Estates to elect the Habsburg [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand, Duke of Styria]], as heir to the throne of Bohemia. Ferdinand was an intensely loyal Catholic, and many Protestant noblemen believed that Ferdinand intended to withdraw the protections of Rudolf II's Letter of Majesty. These suspicions were further aroused when Imperial officials ordered Protestants to stop erecting Protestant churches on the "''Stifts''", lands held by [[prince bishop|ecclesiastical lords]] who were not subject to the Bohemian Estates. The Protestants claimed the status of these lands fell under the term "royal land", and thus were subject to Bohemia's authority by the Letter of Majesty – a very disputed legal interpretation which the Austrian government rejected. On 23 May 1618, an assembly of Protestant noblemen, led by Count [[Jindřich Matyáš Thurn]], stormed [[Prague Castle]], and seized two Imperial governors, [[Vilem Slavata of Chlum]] and [[Jaroslav Borzita of Martinice]]. The rebels charged them with violating the Letter of Majesty, found them guilty, and threw them and their scribe Philip Fabricius out of the windows of the Bohemian Chancellery. This event – known as the [[Second Defenestration of Prague]] – marked the beginning of the [[Bohemian Revolt]], and with it, the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]].

In these circumstances [[Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg]], Frederick V's governor of the Upper Palatinate, moved to intervene in Bohemia. He did not initially propose nominating Frederick as king because the young elector was still seen as politically inexperienced, and was a Calvinist, while there were virtually no Calvinists in Bohemia. At any rate, Frederick was not initially eager to defy the Emperor, who had praised Frederick's loyalty. Frederick did not publicly break with the Emperor, but in a letter to his father-in-law, [[James I of England]], he placed the blame for the Bohemian vote on the [[Jesuits]] and the Spanish party at the Habsburg court. This was a questionable evasion of the role played by Frederick's own agents.

The first mention in [[Prague]] of Frederick's name as a possible candidate as king of Bohemia came in November 1618. It is not known if Frederick's agents played a role in talking up his possible candidacy. Palatine diplomat [[Christoph von Dohna]] approached [[James I of England]] with the possibility of Frederick becoming king, but James reacted negatively to this idea. The princes of the [[Protestant Union]] similarly rejected the idea, fearing it might lead to religious war and the Elector of Saxony was staunchly opposed.

Behind the scenes, Frederick authorised sending a force under Count [[Ernst von Mansfeld]] to support the Bohemian rebels. In August 1618, forces under Mansfeld entered Bohemia and led the [[Siege of Pilsen]], which saw Pilsen fall to rebel forces on 21 November 1618, leaving the entire kingdom in Protestant hands.
[[Image:Justus Sustermans 028.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1578–1637), who was elected [[King of Bohemia]] in 1617 and who would later claim that Frederick had usurped his rightful claim to the throne of Bohemia.]]
[[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor]] died on 20 March 1619. Although his successor, the future Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], had previously been crowned King of Bohemia, the Estates of Bohemia now refused to recognise him as their king. Fearing an invasion by Imperial forces, the Estates sought an alliance with the other members of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] ([[Silesia]], [[Lusatia]], [[Moravia]]) and on 31 July 1619 at Prague, these states formed the Bohemian Confederacy, dedicated to opposing the Habsburgs; under the terms of this agreement, Protestantism became virtually the state religion of the Bohemian lands. In August 1619, the general parliament of all the Bohemian lands declared that Ferdinand had forfeited the Bohemian throne. This formally severed all ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs and made war inevitable. [[Ferdinand of Bavaria]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]] predicted this decision would lead to twenty, forty, or sixty years of war.&lt;ref&gt;Zitiert nach Golo Mann: ''Wallenstein'', S. 146M&lt;/ref&gt;

The preferred candidate of Bohemians as their new king was the Elector of Saxony, but he let it be known he would not accept the throne. This left Frederick as the most senior Protestant prince available, since no one else was willing to risk conflict with the emperor. In August 1619, the chances of Frederick becoming King of Bohemia became greater when [[Gabriel Bethlen]] launched an anti-Habsburg revolt in [[Royal Hungary]]. This was also precisely the period when Ferdinand was travelling to [[Frankfurt]] for his coronation.

===Frederick in Prague===
On 26 August 1619, the states of the Bohemian Confederacy elected Frederick as the new King of Bohemia, Frederick receiving news of his election on 29 August in Amberg.&lt;ref&gt;s. hierzu s. unter Literaturangabe: Berning ... S. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, Ferdinand II [[Imperial election of 1619|was elected]] Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick was the only [[Prince-elector|elector]] who voted against Ferdinand; even the Protestant prince-electors John George I of Saxony and [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg|John Sigismund of Brandenburg]] adhered to the tradition of supporting the Habsburg Imperial candidate. The electoral college also condemned the Bohemian Confederation's attempt to remove Ferdinand from the throne of Bohemia and declared that the 1617 vote of the Estates of Bohemia, making Ferdinand King of Bohemia, was binding.
[[Image:Kurfyrst Frederik V af Pfalz.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Frederick]]
Frederick's decision to accept the Bohemian crown has been the subject of much historical speculation. Later Catholic propaganda, in a view accepted by [[Friedrich Schiller]], portrayed the decision as based mainly on Elizabeth Stuart's desire to be a queen.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Schiller: ''Geschichte des 30jährigen Kriegs'', Teil 1&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, historians have concluded that Frederick's decision was based primarily on a sense of his duty to fellow Protestants, although Frederick wavered between his duty to the emperor and his sense of duty to his religious brethren. There also seems to have been economic considerations: the Upper Palatinate was at that time Europe's center for iron production, while Bohemia was a focal point for the tin and glass trade: [[Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg]], told Frederick that a union of the two areas could be commercially advantageous.

On 12 September 1619, the Protestant Union met at [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] and called on Frederick not to intervene in Bohemian affairs. Other possible allies – the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Republic of Venice]] – sent letters saying they would not be able to offer Frederick assistance if he accepted the Bohemian offer. Only [[Gabriel Bethlen]] offered words of encouragement.

Between 24 September and 28, Frederick reached his decision "not to resist the will of the Almighty" and thus decided to accept the Bohemian crown.&lt;ref&gt;Zitiert nach Peter Bilhöfer in ''Der Winterkönig. Friedrich von der Pfalz. Bayern und Europa im Zeitalter des Dreißigjährigen Krieges'', S. 24 24&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dutch Republic, the Republic of Venice, [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]] recognised Frederick as King of Bohemia.

On 29 September 1619, Frederick left Heidelberg for Prague. He travelled through [[Ansbach]], Amberg, Neumarkt, and [[Waldsassen]], where he was met by representatives from the Bohemian Estates. Together, they then travelled through [[Cheb]], [[Sokolov (Sokolov District)|Sokolov]], [[Žatec]], [[Louny]], and [[Slaný]]. Finally on 31 October 1619, Frederick entered Prague, along with 568 people and 100 cars, and was greeted enthusiastically.

===Coronation===
[[Image:Winterkönig Friedrich von Böhmen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coronation of Frederick V in [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], 4 November 1619.]]
Frederick donned the [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]] in [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] on 4 November 1619. The [[coronation]] was conducted not by the [[Archbishop of Prague]] but by the [[Utraquist]] administrator of the diocese, Georg Dicastus, and a Protestant elder, Johannes Cyrill von Třebič. The [[liturgy]] was modelled on that used at the coronation of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], with only a few parts altered. The [[litany]] was sung – per the Catholic tradition – rather than spoken as was normally done by the Calvinists. Frederick was [[Anointing|anointed]] with little objection. At the end of the coronation, the Estates paid [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] to Frederick.

Although a large part of the country was already devastated by war, and many refugees were encamped in the town, the coronation was celebrated with lavish parties.&lt;ref&gt;Für eine zeitgenössische Darstellung des Einzugs und die Krönung siehe Krönung Friedrichs von der Pfalz zum böhmischen König&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reign===
Frederick assumed a weak crown and a state torn with internal divisions. The state's finances had been disrupted for years, and, at any rate, Bohemian kings had only very limited ability to raise funds, being primarily dependent on the goodwill of the nobility and the tax allocations of the [[Diet (assembly)|diets]]. The Protestant nobles felt that higher taxes were necessary to pay for war against the [[Catholic League (German)|German Catholic League]], but the country already felt overburdened in the wake of the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]]. Further limiting Frederick's ability to manoeuvre was the need to distribute royal bounty to supporters in order to ensure their loyalty to his regime.

In Prague, Frederick soon came to be alienated from a portion of the nobility and the clergy. Neither Frederick nor his wife spoke [[Czech language|Czech]], so court offices were staffed primarily with foreigners, while the administration of the localities was left to the local nobles. This made an alliance of the royal family with the corporate bodies of the realm difficult.

Further alienation was caused by Frederick V's court preacher, [[Abraham Scultetus]], who was determined to use his new post to advance the cause of [[Calvinism]] in Bohemia. The [[Utraquist]] churches had retained the use of [[relics]] and images in church, but Scultetus now launched an [[iconoclastic]] crusade against images: beginning on 21 December 1619, images were removed from [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], and on 27–28 December, a famous [[altarpiece]] by [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]] depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] was destroyed. There was even a rumour that the grave of [[St. Wenceslaus]] was to be desecrated. Scultetus' iconoclasm was deeply unpopular, and Frederick attempted to distance himself from it, claiming that his orders were not being carried out by his followers.
[[Image:Chronogramm Winterkönig C-L 032.jpg|thumb|left|200px|This 1619 Imperial pamphlet, containing a [[chronogram]], was the first to dub Frederick "The Winter King".]]
The nickname "The Winter King" appeared shortly after the beginning of Frederick's reign and our first printed reference using the term came in a 1619 Imperial pamphlet that presented the phrase in the context of a royal [[chronogram]]. Frederick's propagandists attempted to respond to the phrase by arguing that Frederick was in fact a "Winter Lion" who defended the crown of Bohemia against troublemakers and liars, and that he would also be a "Summer Lion."

Meanwhile, Ferdinand II rallied his forces against Frederick. On 21 October 1619, he signed a treaty with [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria]], leader of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]]. This treaty provided that Maximilian would be commander of the forces against Frederick, promised that Maximilian would retain all of the occupied Bohemian lands for himself and that he would be granted Frederick's electoral title as well. The Emperor was also able to obtain the support of Elector John George I of Saxony; John George's court preacher, [[Matthias Hoe von Hoenegg]], encouraged the Emperor to smash Frederick and the Bohemians.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Wedgwood, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick's chancellor, Christian  of Anhalt, urged Frederick to call a meeting of Protestant princes at [[Nuremberg]] in December 1619. This conference was a fiasco, as few princes bothered to send representatives. John George of Saxony declined to send a representative. Those who did attend half-heartedly promised to secure Frederick's [[Rhineland]] territories during Frederick's absence in Bohemia.

In March 1620, during a meeting of the Imperial party at [[Mulhouse]], Frederick despatched a legal defense of his actions. He argued that he had not broken the [[public peace|imperial peace]] because Bohemia was located outside of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and there was not, therefore, a conflict between an imperial prince and the emperor. Frederick argued that it would therefore be illegal for Ferdinand to use imperial power against him. This meeting, which included John George of Saxony and Maximilian of Bavaria, rejected Frederick's argument, finding that Bohemia was an indivisible part of the Empire.
[[Image:Reiterbild Friedrichs V. C-J 171.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frederick V on horseback with [[Prague]] in the background.]]
On 1 April 1620, the Imperial party issued an ultimatum calling on Frederick to leave Bohemia by 1 June. If Frederick did not comply by this date, Ferdinand threatened to use force to enforce his right as Holy Roman Emperor and rightful King of Bohemia to overthrow the [[usurper]].

A little later, John George of Saxony signed a treaty with Ferdinand in which Ferdinand guaranteed the practice of [[Lutheranism]] in Bohemia and recognized the secular areas in the Netherlands. Ferdinand also agreed to give John George [[Lusatia]], thus cementing John George's dominance of the [[Upper Saxon Circle]].

This was the context when the parliament of the Bohemian Confederacy met on 25 March 1620. Frederick called for massive tax increases and [[conscription]] to fight the impending Imperial threat. To raise money for the Bohemian forces, Frederick used his private funds, pawned his jewels and, in May 1620, drove the Palatinate into insolvency when he decided to move two tons of gold to Bohemia.

Bad news continued to arrive for Frederick. [[James VI of Scotland and I of England]] refused to support his son-in-law militarily. The Netherlands sent only a small force and promised only 50,000 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] a month for Frederick. Worst of all for Frederick, on 3 July 1620, the [[Protestant Union]] signed the [[Treaty of Ulm (1620)]], thereby withdrawing their support for Frederick and declaring neutrality in the conflict between Frederick and the Catholic League.

====Battle of White Mountain, 8 November 1620====
With the signing of the Treaty of Ulm [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases]], began raising Imperial troops in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and in the [[Alsace]] region.

In early August 1620, 25,000 troops, under the command of Spinola, marched into Bohemia. In the third week of August, they shifted their focus and marched into the nearly unarmed Electoral Palatinate, occupying [[Mainz]]. The Electoral Palatinate was defended by only 2,000 English volunteers and the country was easily taken. Imperial troops set up camp in [[Frankenthal]] and [[Mannheim]]. Spinola crossed the [[Rhine]] on 5 September 1620 and proceeded to capture [[Bad Kreuznach]] on 10 September and [[Oppenheim]] on 14 September. From Bohemia, Frederick was powerless to stop the occupation of his ancestral homeland.
[[Image:Schlacht am Weißen Berg C-K 063.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depiction of the [[Battle of White Mountain]] by [[Peter Snayers]] (1592–1667), 1620.]]
After capturing [[Linz]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria]] crossed the Bohemian border on 26 September 1620. At [[Rokycany]], Maximilian's forces first met with the 15,000 ragtag, poorly paid, poorly equipped troops that Frederick had managed to raise. Frederick visited his army on 28 September 1620, but, lacking a military background, left the conduct of the war to his generals. Frederick focused his attention on organizing supplies and preparing fortifications.

After a series of skirmishes, on 5 November 1620, Frederick drew his forces back towards Prague and Imperial troops followed them. On 7 November, Bohemian forces determined to make a stand at [[Battle of White Mountain|White Mountain]], just outside Prague. The day before King Frederick had ridden down the lines, and exhorted the soldiers. He then rushed to Prague to implore the Bohemian Estates to raise money for his troops and to receive the envoys of the English king. However, it was too late. When, on 8 November 1620, Frederick wanted to ride back to the troops, he was met at the gate of Prague by fleeing soldiers of his army and his chancellor, Anhalt, who informed him of the disaster: the Bohemian army had received a crushing defeat that morning in the [[Battle of White Mountain]].

===Escape===
Anhalt could recommend only one option to Frederick: immediate flight. As such, on 9 November, Frederick fled to the [[Silesia]]n capital of [[Wrocław|Breslau]], along with his wife and child, some advisers, and not much more baggage than the [[Bohemian Crown Jewels]].

Maximilian took Prague shortly after Frederick's departure. From Silesia, Frederick wanted to plan revenge for the Battle of White Mountain, but the Silesian Estates refused to support this project, and he was forced to leave Silesia in early 1621.
[[Image:Eigentliche Abbildung des Winterkönigs 8.5-29.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1620 pamphlet mocking Frederick's flight from [[Prague]].]]
Contemporary pamphleteers – both Catholic and Protestant – were merciless in their portrayal of Frederick's flight from Prague. After Frederick's [[Order of the Garter|Garter]] was found in Prague, pamphleteers routinely portrayed him with his stockings falling down.

On 21 January 1621, Ferdinand issued a decree against Frederick and Anhalt, accusing them of breach of peace, supporting rebels, and treason. Ferdinand decreed that Frederick's lands and titles within the Holy Roman Empire were now forfeited. On 6 February 1621, representatives of the Protestant Union met with Ferdinand at [[Heilbronn]] to protest, but they soon agreed to support the settlement in the Palatinate, and the Palatinate remained occupied by Spanish troops. At this point, the Protestant Union had essentially ceased to exist.

The [[Twelve Years' Truce]] ended on 9 April 1621. On 14 April, Frederick joined his wife at The Hague. The Dutch Republic and Frederick signed a contract in which he accepted the support of the Netherlands for the reconquest of his dominions.

In Bohemia, the crushing of the Bohemian Revolt had terrible consequences. Twenty-eight Bohemian nobles were killed in the [[Old Town Square execution]]s on 21 June 1621. Afterwards, the heads of twelve nobles, along with the hand of [[Joachim Andreas von Schlick]], were nailed to the Old Town Tower of [[Charles Bridge]], where they remained for ten years. The elective monarchy was now abolished; the role of the Estates greatly curtailed; and the Letter of Majesty was torn by Ferdinand himself. Only [[Lutheranism]] remained tolerated in Bohemia, and in the coming years, the rest of the population would be actively re-Catholicized. Bohemia would remain part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] until 1918.

==Fall of Frederick's ancestral lands, 1621–22==
[[Image:PeterErnstIIofMansfield02.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Ernst von Mansfeld]] (1580–1626), soldier who held on to Frederick's Palatine inheritance until 1622.]]
In summer 1621, [[John II, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken]], Frederick's former guardian who had served as regent of the Electoral Palatinate when Frederick left for Prague, resigned.

However, [[Ernst von Mansfeld]] continued to occupy a portion of the [[Upper Palatinate]] and had successfully resisted efforts by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]] to dislodge him. Mansfeld crossed into the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] in early 1622, and on 21 April 1622, Frederick joined Mansfeld there. Frederick attempted to convince other Protestant princes to reconstitute the Protestant Union, but met with limited success. Frederick's cause was boosted by a 27 April 1622 victory over Tilly's forces at the [[Battle of Mingolsheim|Battle of Wiesloch]], but this boost was short lived. Frederick's forces under the command of [[Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden-Durlach]] were defeated at the [[Battle of Wimpfen]] on 6 May 1622; and then forces under [[Christian the Younger of Brunswick]] were soundly defeated at the [[Battle of Höchst]] on 20 June 1622.

Frederick was increasingly under Mansfeld's influence at this time, and was growing disillusioned with the Protestant cause. With Frederick's knowledge, Mansfeld raided [[Darmstadt]] and captured [[Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt]] and his son [[Johann Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt|Johann]] as hostages. This was clearly a violation of Imperial law, and cost Frederick whatever remaining sympathy he still had in Europe. During his retreat into [[Alsace]], Mansfeld burned a city and thirty villages.
[[Image:Heidelberg während des 30jährigen Krieges 1622.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Heidelberg]] is taken by the forces of [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]] (1559–1632) on 19 September 1622.]]
Frederick dismissed Mansfeld after he became convinced he would be unable to reconquer his hereditary lands. Frederick then spent the summer with his uncle, [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon]], in [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]].

Shortly thereafter, troops under Tilly and [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (1585–1645)|Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]] completed the Spanish conquest of the Electoral Palatinate. After an [[Siege of Heidelberg (1622)|eleven-week siege]], [[Heidelberg]] fell on 19 September 1622; [[Mannheim]] similarly fell on 5 November 1622. Only the British garrison in [[Frankenthal]] now held out. After the conquest of Heidelberg, the Protestant churches were closed, the university was closed, and at the request of Maximilian, the great library, the famous ''[[Bibliotheca Palatina]]'' (3500 manuscripts), was presented as a gift of thanks to [[Pope Gregory XV]] in appreciation of the 620,000 guilders he had provided for financing the campaigns of the Catholic League.
[[Image:Reichsacht gegen Friedrich V..jpg|thumb|left|150px|1623 edict by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1578–1637) awarding Frederick's lands and titles to [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]] (1573–1651).]]
On 23 February 1623, Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor awarded Frederick's electoral title to Maximilian of Bavaria, who now became [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]]. Maximilian was also awarded the conquered territory of Upper Palatinate as a [[fief]]. Other territories of the Electoral Palatinate ([[Parkstein]], [[Weiden in der Oberpfalz]], and [[Peilstein im Mühlviertel]]) were awarded to [[Wolfgang William, Count Palatine of Neuburg]].

==Exile, 1622–1632==
In late 1622 and early 1623, Frederick organised a Palatinate [[government-in-exile]] at The Hague. This Palatinate Council was headed by [[Ludwig Camerarius]].

During the negotiations for the [[Spanish Match]], Frederick urged his father-in-law not to go through with the Match.

There were attempts at reconciling Frederick with the emperor in 1624–25 and in 1627, but these came to naught. Frederick was willing to compromise with the emperor, but he wanted the restoration of his lands and electoral title, and the emperor was not inclined to restore these to Frederick. Frederick held out some hope that his lands might be retaken militarily, but these hopes were crushed on 27 August 1626, when the forces of [[Christian IV of Denmark]] were crushed by Tilly at the [[Battle of Lutter]].

Frederick left most of the day-to-day business of his government-in-exile to his counselors, although he did take some interest in his finances. Frederick was very stingy in funding his administration, and yet, in order to maintain the dignity of a royal court, he spent vast sums on building and entertainment, quickly blowing through donations from the English and Dutch governments. For example, in 1629, Frederick commissioned Bartholoeus van Bassen to build him a large winter palace in [[Rhenen]]. When completed in 1631, this palace had a large central residence, a courtyard, a two-storey main building with two wings projecting to the south, and was surrounded by large gardens. Frederick spent much of his time there in hunting and long walks.
[[Image:Königshaus Rhenen C-P 038.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The winter palace constructed for Frederick V at [[Rhenen]] between 1629 and 1631.]]
Frederick suffered a personal tragedy on 17 January 1629. He was traveling to [[Amsterdam]] to view the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] captured by the [[Dutch West India Company]] when his boat capsized while crossing the [[Haarlemmermeer]], a body of water near [[Haarlem]]. Frederick survived the accident, but his eldest son, the fifteen-year-old [[Frederick Henry of the Palatinate]], did not. Frederick himself sustained serious physical injuries in the accident, and would not fully recover for 15 months.

At the [[Diet of Regensburg (1630)]], Frederick formally petitioned to be forgiven for having accepted the crown of Bohemia and admitted his wrongdoing. But nothing came of this. In March 1631, Frederick despatched diplomat Sir Robert Anstruther to hold discussions with [[Ernst Egon VIII, Count of Fürstenberg]], president of the Imperial [[Privy Council]], about restoring Frederick's lands, but Frederick died before these could bear any fruit.

==Death, 1632==
On 4 July 1630, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] intervened in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. On 16 September 1631, Gustavus Adolphus' forces defeated Tilly's forces at the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)]]. Tilly was defeated the following year, and Gustavus Adolphus' forces swept into southern Germany. When [[Oppenheim]] was captured in December 1631, Frederick believed the time was ripe for him to reestablish himself in the Palatinate, and he left for [[Heidelberg]].
[[Image:Friedrich V. von der Pfalz bis.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Frederick V, ca. 1630.]]
In February 1632, Frederick met Gustavus Adolphus at [[Frankfurt]], with Gustavus Adolphus paying Frederick full royal honours. However, Gustavus Adolphus was not prepared to offer Frederick support for restoring him in the Palatinate because England and the Netherlands had not signed off on such a proposal.

Frederick subsequently took part in Gustavus Adolphus' march into the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], and was present for the march into [[Munich]] on 17 May 1632. Upon Frederick's pressing his case with Gustavus Adolphus, Gustavus Adolphus told Frederick that he would accept Frederick's restoration without Dutch/British support only if Frederick would agree to hold the Palatinate as a [[fief]] of the King of Sweden. The lands of the Palatinate were simply too important strategically for Gustavus Adolphus to hand them over to Frederick. Gustavus Adolphus also insisted that Frederick would have to agree to establish equal rights for [[Lutherans]] in his territories. Frederick refused Gustavus Adolphus' conditions and they parted, with Frederick travelling to Swedish-occupied [[Mainz]], intending to return to [[The Hague]].

Gustavus Adolphus was killed at the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)]] on 16 November 1632. About this time, the English finally determined to send an expeditionary force to participate in the Thirty Years' War. Unfortunately for Frederick, it was too late. Beginning in October 1632, he had suffered from an infection that got worse in the following weeks. The famed physician [[Peter Spina]] was summoned from Darmstadt to Mainz, but nothing could be done for Frederick. Frederick died on the morning of 29 November 1632, of a "pestilential fever".

Frederick's son and heir, [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine|Charles Louis]], was only 15 years old. Therefore, Frederick's brother (Charles Louis' uncle), Ludwig Philipp, [[Louis Philip, Count Palatine of Simmern-Kaiserslautern]], served as regent. Frederick's internal organs were buried at St. Catherine's in [[Oppenheim]] and his embalmed body was taken to [[Frankenthal]]. On 9 June 1635, with Spanish troops approaching, Ludwig Philipp of Pfalz-Simmern-Kaiserslautern fled to [[Kaiserslautern]] with Frederick's body. It is believed that Ludwig Philipp of Pfalz-Simmern-Kaiserslautern transferred Frederick's body to the [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]] in September 1637, but Frederick's final resting place is unknown.

[[File:Flag of the Iron Division Freikorps.svg|thumb|Flag of the Iron Division.]]
After 1918, the term '''[[Freikorps]]''' was used for the [[anti-communist]] [[paramilitary]] organizations that sprang up around the [[German Empire]], including in the [[Baltic states]], as soldiers returned in defeat from World War I. It was one of the many [[Weimar paramilitary groups]] active during that time.

== 1917 - Russia cedes the Baltic to Germany ==
In 1918 the Russian [[Bolshevik]]s ceded the Baltic areas to Germany under the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. The Imperial German government established occupation governments in [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] and granted independence to a [[puppet government]] in Lithuania on March 25, 1918{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. The German [[Ober Ost]] occupation authorities under command of [[Prince Leopold of Bavaria]] favored the [[Baltic Germans]], who had been the dominant social, economic, and political class in [[Courland]], [[Livonia]], and [[Estonia]] since the 13th century{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. On March 8 and April 12, 1918 the local [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]]-dominated Land Council of Courland and the United Land Council of Livonia, Estonia, [[Riga]] and [[Saaremaa|Ösel]] had declared themselves independent states, known as the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|Duchy of Courland]] and the Baltic State (''Baltischer Staat''), respectively. Both states proclaimed themselves to be in [[personal union]] with [[Prussia]], although the German government never responded and acknowledged that claim.

The Baltic lands were nominally recognized as a sovereign state by [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II]] on September 22, 1918, half a year after the newly Soviet Russia had formally relinquished all authority over its former [[Imperial Russia|Imperial]] Baltic provinces in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. On November 5, 1918, a temporary Regency Council (''Regentschaftsrat'') for the [[United Baltic Duchy]], led by [[Baron]] [[Adolf Pilar von Pilchau]], was formed on a joint basis from the two local Land Councils.

== 1918 - Germany loses World War I, Red Army threatens ==
{{Main|Estonian War of Independence}}
Under the terms of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|November 11, 1918 Armistice]] the German Army was required to withdraw its troops from all other countries on a timetable established by the [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Allied Control Commission]]. As elsewhere, pro-socialist [[Soldiers' Councils]] controlled many German troop units in the Baltic area, but the Allied Control Commission insisted that the German troops remain to prevent the region from occupation by the Russian [[Red Army]]. The Red Army, led by the [[Latvian Riflemen]], was making serious inroads into Estonia and Latvia. The Estonians offered tough resistance to the Red Army and refused to ask for, or accept, German Army support. Instead, Scandinavian soldiers from Finland, Sweden and Denmark came to their support. The Estonians, with this help and naval support from the British, were able to prevail over the Red Army after a year-long fight.&lt;ref name=maide/&gt;
 
Meanwhile, the Latvian People's Council ([[Tautas Padome]]) proclaimed Latvia's independence from Russia on November 18, 1918. Latvian leader [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] requested German Freikorps support for assistance against the Bolsheviks. The British observer, General Sir [[Hubert Gough]], invoked Article 12 of the Armistice Agreement, which provided that German troops must evacuate all territories belonging to the Russian Empire, but only "as soon as the Allies shall consider this desirable, having regard to the interior conditions of these territories."

== 1919 - Iron Brigade ==
{{side_box|text=Wonderful Settlement Opportunity! Anyone who wants to own his own estate in the beautiful Baltic, report to one of the following recruitment offices. . . .|below=Advert in a newspaper for German soldiers, 1919 (quoted in Waite's ''Vanguard of Nazism'')&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p.105 quoting ''Reichswehr'', Jun 18 1919&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As many of the demoralized German soldiers were being withdrawn from Latvia, Major Josef Bischoff, an experienced German officer, formed a Freikorps unit called the Eiserne Brigade (translated: "Iron Brigade"). This unit was deployed to Riga and used to delay the Red Army advance. Meanwhile, volunteers were recruited from Germany, with promises of land, a chance to fight Bolshevism, and other enticements of dubious veracity.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; These soldiers, along with remnants of the German 8th Army and the Eiserne Brigade, were reconstituted into the Eiserne (Iron) Division. Also, the Baltic Germans and some Latvians formed the [[Baltische Landeswehr]]. The official mission assigned to this force was to prevent any Red Army advance into East Prussia, but its real mission was to help the Baltic Germans re-establish their own state or dominance in Latvia.&lt;ref name=maide/&gt;

Initially, the Iron Division was commanded by Bischoff, and the Baltische Landeswehr by Major [[Alfred Fletcher]], a German of Scottish ancestry. In late February, only the seaport of [[Liepāja]] and surroundings remained in the hands of the German and Latvian forces. In March 1919, the Iron Brigade helped the German detachments win a series of victories over the Red forces. The main blow in the campaign was delivered by the ''Baltische Landeswehr'', which first occupied the port of [[Ventspils]] and then drove south to Riga.&lt;ref name=maide&gt;{{cite book|title=Ülevaade Eesti Vabadussõjast (1918–1920) (Overview on Estonian War of Independence)|language=Estonian|author=Colonel Jaan Maide|url=http://www.ksk.edu.ee/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/5.Pohja-Lati_operatsioonid_1919_kevad-suvi.pdf|year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attack appears to have been coordinated with the Estonians who drove the Bolsheviks from the northern part of Latvia.

The Allies ordered the German government to withdraw its troops from the Baltic after defeat of Bolsheviks. The German forces attempted to seize control of Latvia with the assistance of the local ethnic German population. On April 16 he organised a coup d'état in Liepāja, the provisional national government of Latvia took refuge aboard steamship "Saratow". A new [[puppet government]] headed by Pastor [[Andrievs Niedra]] was proclaimed. Pastor Niedra was a Latvian Lutheran minister with pro-German sympathies. The Germans convinced the British to postpone the withdrawal of the German Freikorps units because this would give the Bolsheviks a free hand. Britain backed down after recognizing the gravity of the military situation, and the Freikorps moved on and captured Riga on May 23, 1919.&lt;ref name=maide/&gt;

== Conflict with Estonia and Latvia ==
{{side_box|text=We were a band of fighters drunk with all the passions of the world; full of lust, exultant in action. What we wanted, we did not know. And what we knew, we did not want! War and adventure, excitement and destruction. An indefinable, surging force welled up from every part of our being and flayed us onward.|below=Ernst von Salomon, ''[[The Outlaws (novel)|The Outlaws]]'' (''Die Geächteten'') quoted in Waite's ''Vanguard of Nazism''&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p.106 quoting a translation&lt;/ref&gt;|position=right}}

After the capture of Riga, the Freikorps were accused of killing 300 Latvians in [[Jelgava]], 200 in [[Tukums]], 125 in [[Daugavgrīva]], and over 3,000 in Riga. The Latvian nationalists had turned against the German Freikorps and sought assistance from the Estonian troops who had occupied Latvian territory north of the [[Daugava River]]. The German forces advanced north towards the Latvian city of [[Cēsis]]. The objective of the German forces had now clearly become the establishment of German supremacy in the Baltic by eliminating the Estonian military and Latvian national units, not the defeat of the Bolsheviks. The Estonian commander General [[Johan Laidoner]] insisted the Germans withdraw to a line south of the [[Gauja]] river. He also ordered the Estonian 3rd division to seize the [[Gulbene]] railroad station.&lt;ref name=maide/&gt;

On June 19, 1919, the Landeswehr and the Iron Division launched an [[Battle of Cēsis (1919)|attack to capture Cēsis]]. Initially, the Freikorps captured the town of [[Straupe]] and continued their advance toward the town of [[Limbaži]]. The Estonians launched a counterattack and drove the Freikorps out of the town. On June 21, the Estonians received reinforcements and immediately attacked the Landeswehr under Fletcher, who was forced to withdrawn from an area to the northeast of Cēsis. The Iron Division attacked from Straupe towards Stalbe in an effort to relieve pressure on the Landeswehr. On the morning of June 23, the Germans began a general retreat toward Riga.&lt;ref name=kork&gt;''Estonian War of Independence 1918&amp;ndash;1920''. Jyri Kork (Ed.). Esto, Baltimore, 1988 (Reprint from ''Estonian War of Independence 1918&amp;ndash;1920''. Historical Committee for the War of Independence, Tallinn, 1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies again insisted that the Germans withdraw their remaining troops from Latvia, and on June 3 intervened to impose an [[Strazdumuiža armistice|armistice]] between Estonia, Latvia, and the Landeswehr and Freikorps when the Latvians and Estonians were about to march into Riga. Major Bischoff created a German Legion from over a dozen Freikorps units and turned the units over to the [[West Russian Volunteer Army]]. In all, the Iron Division transferred over 14,000 men, 64 aircraft, 56 artillery pieces, and 156 machine guns. Six cavalry units and a field hospital also went over. The offensive by the reformed German army was subsequently defeated by the Latvian Army, which received assistance from British and French warships and Estonian armoured trains.&lt;ref name=maide/&gt;

== Retreat ==
The Freikorps had saved Latvia from capture by the Red Army in the spring of 1919. However, the Freikorps' goal of creating a German dominated state in Courland and Livonia failed. Many of the German Freikorps members who served in the Baltic left Latvia with the belief that they had been "stabbed in the back" by the [[Weimar Republic]] under president [[Friedrich Ebert]]. Hundreds of Baltic Freikorps soldiers had planned to settle in Latvia, and for those who had fought there, the land made a lasting impression and many of them longed for the day that they could return there. The Baltic Freikorps characterized their struggle against the Reds as the "[[Drang nach Osten]]", (the drive towards the East), and more than one Freikorps unit returned to Germany and planned for the day of their return.

According to historian Robert GL Waite, while retreating from the Baltic, discipline amongst the Freikorps broke down and many fighters "ran wild through the country side marauding in complete disorder" &lt;ref&gt;Waite, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst von Salomon]], who was in a Freikorps, fictionalized it as follows. They drove the Latvians 'like rabbits across the fields'. They burned houses, destroyed bridges and telephone poles. They threw bodies into wells, followed by hand grenades:

{{quote|We killed what fell into our hands, ... We saw red, we had nothing in the heart of human emotions ... what were earlier houses, were rubble, ash and smoldering beams, like festering sores in the bare field ... We had lit a bonfire, there was burning more than dead material, there also was burning our hopes, our desires, ... the laws and values of the civilized world ... We retreated, bragging, intoxicated, loaded with booty|Ernst von Salomon, ''[[The Outlaws (novel)|The Outlaws]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/38733378/Ernst-von-Salomon-Die-Geächteten Ernst von Salomon, Die Geachteten], 1930, scribd.com, translated by google translate, while also consulting G.L. Waite's Vanguard of Nazism, WW Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Reviewing ''The Vanquished: Why The First World War Failed to End, 1917-1923'' by [[Robert Gerwarth]] in [[the Sunday Times]] (7 August 2016), [[Max Hastings]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A german Freikorps soldier, [[:de:Erich Balla|Erich Balla]], described almost gleefully in his memoirs how his Freikorps comrades roamed the streets of Riga killing teenage girls, "mostly beautiful things", whom the murderers claimed "spent their nights in sexual orgies and their days in orgies of violence… They did not see their youth or their charm. They saw only the face of the devil as they were beating, shooting, stabbing them to death. {nb - the ''[[:de:Erich Balla|Erich Balla]]'' link is to the ''German'' wikipedia page.}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Freikorps members, like Otto Zeltiņš-Goldfelds, stayed in Latvia, joined the Latvian Army and got citizenship.

'''Hollaback!''' is a [[photoblog]] and [[grassroots]] initiative to raise awareness about and combat [[street harassment]] by posting [[photograph]]s and narrative accounts of individuals' encounters. Altogether, Hollaback! is run by local activists in 79 cities, 26 countries, and operates in 14 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollaback! official website|url=http://www.ihollaback.org/#|publisher=Word Press|accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, co-founder Emily May became Hollaback!'s first full-time executive director, and the organization successfully raised close to $15,000 on the internet fundraising platform, [[Kickstarter]], to fund the development and release of the Hollaback! [[iPhone]] application. Since then, the organization has received funding from New York Women's Foundation, the Ms. Foundation, Voqal, the Knight Foundation, Ashoka, and the New York City Government.

Seven New York City residents, four women and three men, founded the organization in 2005 after a well-publicized occurrence of street harassment prompted them to discuss their own encounters.&lt;ref Name=NotReliableSourceHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihollaback.org/about/history/|title=Hollaback! History and Values - You Have the Power to End Harassment|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being ignored by the police, a woman named Thao Nguyen uploaded a photo she had taken of the man who had masturbated across from her on the subway.&lt;ref name="wloe.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wloe.org/Holla-Back-to-End-Stree.340.0.html|title=Women and Life on Earth: 'Holla Back' to End Street Harassment|website=www.wloe.org|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This photo appeared on the front page of the New York Daily News, and inspired the seven New York City residents to apply this same method to all forms of street harassment.&lt;ref name="wloe.org"/&gt;  The women told story after story of their experiences with street harassment, experiences that were surprising to the men in the group because they had never dealt with harassment of that kind.&lt;ref Name=NotReliableSourceHistory /&gt; They collectively decided to do something about the issue of street harassment, an issue that affects women, girls, and [[LGBTQ]] individuals every day.&lt;ref Name=NotReliableSourceHistory /&gt;

Hollaback! has held many events around the world designed to raise awareness about street harassment, including film screenings, lectures, demonstrations, and book talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyc.ihollaback.org/past-events/|title=Past Events - New York City Hollaback!|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2010, the New York City Council held the first hearing ever on street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emily May, Harassment Avenger|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2091589_2092033_2097270,00.html|accessdate=2012-08-19|newspaper=Time|date=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Council Member [[Julissa Ferreras]], who chairs the Women's Issues Committee, called the hearing in order to stress the importance of joining forces in order to take action specifically in New York City. Each panelist recommended three steps towards eliminating street harassment: 1) A citywide study, focusing on the impact of street harassment and girls; 2) a citywide public information campaign that educates all genders and ages that harassment is unacceptable is the second point of action proposed; and 3) establishing "harassment-free zones" in schools in order to raise awareness and support of the movement. Emily May was among the speakers at the hearing; she encouraged women to speak out against street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bibi|first=Sarah|title=Street Harassment Finally Gets City Council's Attention|url=http://gothamist.com/2010/10/28/first_city_council_hearing_on_stree.php|accessdate=2012-08-19|newspaper=Gothamist|date=2010-10-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201711/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/28/first_city_council_hearing_on_stree.php|archivedate=2015-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this hearing, New York City legislators invested $28,500 in Hollaback!. This investment gave the organization the infrastructure needed to report street harassment incidents to the New York City Council, via their platform "Councilstat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=May, Carter|first=Emily, Samuel|title=State of the Streets 2011 Annual Report|url=http://www.ihollaback.org/blog/2011/12/21/introducing-our-first-annual-state-of-the-streets-report/|work=Report|publisher=ISSUU|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2012, multiple branches of the Hollaback! blog exist in other U.S. cities including Atlanta, Baltimore, Berkeley, Houston, Des Moines, Chicago, Columbia, Philadelphia and Portland.

In 2013, the London branch was involved in [[Project Guardian]], a police initiative to reduce sexual harassment on public transport, including assisting in training of police officers to respond to complaints of sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="gruniad II"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/oct/01/project-guardian-public-transport-safer-women|title=Project Guardian: making public transport safer for women|last=Bates|first=Laura|authorlink=Laura Bates|date=1 October 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Illyrian movement''' ({{lang-hr|Ilirski pokret}}, {{lang-sl|Ilirsko gibanje}}) was a pan-[[South Slavs|South-Slavist]] cultural and political campaign with roots in the [[early modern period]], and revived by a group of young [[Croatia]]n intellectuals during the first half of the 19th century, around the years of 1835–1849 (there is some disagreement regarding the official dates).&lt;ref&gt;Despalatovic, Elinor Murray. Ljudevit Gaj and the Illyrian Movement. New York: East European Quarterly, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  This movement aimed to create a Croatian national establishment in [[Austria-Hungary]] through linguistic and ethnic unity, and through it lay the foundation for cultural and linguistic unification of all [[South Slavs]] under the revived umbrella term ''Illyrian''.

Aspects of the movement pertaining to the development of Croatian culture are considered in Croatian historiography to be part of the '''Croatian national revival''' (''Hrvatski narodni preporod'').

==Name==
In the 19th century, the name ''Illyrian'' was chosen by the members of the movement as a reference to the theory according to which [[South Slavs]] descend from ancient [[Illyrians]]. Fearing provincial particularism, reformers believed that the Illyrian name would make it easier to implement literary unity.&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=26455 |contribution=hrvatski narodni preporod |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
{{Culture of Croatia}}

In 19th-century Europe, [[liberalism]] and [[nationalism]] were ideologies which came to the forefront of political culture. In Central Europe, where the [[Habsburg Empire]] had long asserted control over a variety of ethnic and cultural groups, nationalism appeared in a standard format. The beginning of the 19th century "was the period when the smaller, mostly Slavic nationalities of the empire - Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Ukrainians - remembered their historical traditions, revived their native languages as literary languages, reappropriated their traditions and folklore, in short reasserted their existence as nations."&lt;ref&gt;Sperber, Jonathan. The European Revolutions, 1848-1851. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. page 99.&lt;/ref&gt; This revival of national heritage encompasses the Illyrian Movement in Croatia.

In 1813, the bishop of Zagreb, [[Maksimilijan Vrhovac]], issued a plea for the collection of "national treasures" (''Poziv na sve duhovne pastire svoje biskupije''), thereby heralding the national revival movement. Influenced by his father Josip, who was the first major in French controlled Karlovac and one of its first Freemasons, [[Juraj Šporer]] attempted to publish the first newspaper in the Illyrian language ({{lang-hr|domorodnom}}). His project was aborted because of the complete lack of interest for a newspaper published in his native language.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
 
Just as Croatia felt nationalistic stirrings at this time, so did its larger neighbors, Hungary and Austria. Croats were uneasy with rising [[Hungarian nationalism]], which pursued reduction of the Croatian autonomy and increased [[Magyarization]]. In order to preserve their autonomy, Croats pursued a deepening of their culture and a revival of their heritage.

In the beginning of the 1830s, a group of young Croatian writers initially led by [[Ljudevit Gaj]] gathered in [[Zagreb]] and established a movement for national renewal and unity of all South Slavs within the Habsburg Monarchy. The city of Zagreb had become an important center of political, economic, and cultural activity, so it was the center of the movement. Count [[Janko Drašković]] published his ''Dissertation'' in 1832, a pamphlet that later came to be considered the political, economic, social and cultural program of the movement, as it promoted the native language as official, more autonomy from central government, and better education and enlightenment for the common people. Gaj served as the leader of the movement as a whole in the beginning for eight or nine years, at which point the leadership changed hands.&lt;ref&gt;Despalatovic, Elinor Murray. Ljudevit Gaj and the Illyrian Movement. New York: East European Quarlerly, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest issue for Illyrians was the establishment of a [[standard language]] as a counter-weight to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and the promotion of Croatian written literature and official culture. Illyrians envisioned a single literary language and [[orthography]] to serve as a means of cultural and national unification, paving the way for a general national revival.{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=26}}

==Illyrian language conceptions==
In 1830 Ljudevit Gaj published ''Kratka osnova horvatsko-slavenskoga pravopisanja'' ("Brief basics of the Croatian-Slavic orthography"), which was the first linguistic work to be published during the movement. In it he presented his proposal for a reform of the Illyrian alphabet, which included the introduction of [[diacritics]]. This was motivated by the alphabets of other Slavic peoples who wrote in the [[Latin script]] (Czechs, Slovaks and Poles), as well as by earlier domestic practices such as the alphabet used by [[Pavao Ritter Vitezović]]. After Vitezović's letters ''l&amp;#771;'' and ''n&amp;#771;'' Gaj introduced [[tilde]] as a diacritic in the letters ''c&amp;#771;'', ''z&amp;#771;'', ''s&amp;#771;'', ''l&amp;#771;'', ''n&amp;#771;'', ''d&amp;#771;'' and ''g&amp;#771;''. However, for tactical reasons that notation has not been thoroughly applied. Even though the alphabetic reform was originally intended for the speakers of the [[Kajkavian dialect]], in his work Gaj put forward the idea of a common alphabet for all South Slavs using Latin script, which would lay the foundation for the common literary language.{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=27}}

In 1835 Gaj started publishing ''Novine Horvatzke'' ("Croatian newspapers") and ''Danicza Horvatzka, Slavonzka i Dalmatinzka'' in Kajkavian and using old Kajkavian alphabet. But since the very beginning Gaj's magazines also contained pieces from older [[Štokavian dialect|Štokavian]] literature, namely Dubrovnikan, to pave the way for the introduction of a common literary language on Štokavian basis. The tenth issue of his ''Danicza'' is already using the new alphabet and Štokavian in some of the published pieces, and since the 29th issue the new alphabet is dominant.{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=27}}

On December 5, 1835 Gaj published a Proclamation announcing the publication of ''Ilirske narodne novine'' ("Illyrian folk newspapers") and ''Danica ilirska'', abandoning old alphabet and introducing the Štokavian dialect. The terminological shift from "Croatian" to "Illyrian" more accurately reflected the ideological goals of the Illyrian movement, as well as the usage of the Štokavian dialect which was at that period the most widely spoken dialect. Illyrians' goal was to make that language more accessible to the Kajkavian and [[Čakavian]] speakers.{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=27}} In that spirit, Gaj's 1835 Proclamation states:

{{quotation|There can only be one true literary language in Illyria... It is not found in a single place, or a single country, but in the whole of Illyria... Our grammar and our dictionary is the whole of Illyria. In that huge garden there are beautiful flowers everywhere: let us gather everything of the best in one wreath, which will never wither.|Ljudevit Gaj|Proclamation, 1835&lt;ref&gt;In original: ''U Ilirii može samo jedan jezik pravi književni biti... njega netražmo u jednom městu, ili u jednoj deržavi, nego u cěloj velikoj Ilirii... Naša slovnica i naš rěčnik jest čitava Iliria. U tom velikom vertu (bašči) imade svagdi prekrasnoga cvětja: saberimo sve što je najboljega u jedan věnac, i ov naroda našega věnac nigda nepovene.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beside the fundamental Illyirian ethnological notion of South Slavs as the descendants of ancient Illyrians, awareness of national distinctiveness was also present. Thus Gaj writes in 1839 in ''Danica'': "''Our intention is not to abolish individual names, but unify them under a general name, because each of the individual names carries its own individual history, which gathered together comprise a more general history of the Illyrian nation.''"&lt;ref&gt;In original: ''Naměra naša nije posebna imena ukinuti, nego ih samo pod skupnim imenom sjediniti, jer su sa svakim posebnim imenom skopčani posebni događaji koji skupljeni čine dogodovštinu obćenite narodnosti ilirske.''&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to overcome regional fragmentation and achieve unification, followers of the movement promote Illyrian name, making concessions in language and orthography. Drawing on existing literary traditions in three different dialects, and in an attempt to ease the linguistic and cultural unification, Illyrians advocate the usage of some archaic forms in grammar, and some Kajkavian and Čakavian words. Such changes were hoped to be acceptable to everyone using the Illyrian language.{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=27-28}}

===Orthography and alphabet===
Acting on the intention of Illyrians to create a common literary language and orthography for all South Slavs, Gaj in his 1835 article ''Pravopisz'' abandons his original alphabet. Of letters with diacritics, only the letters ''č'', ''ž'', ''š'' and ''ě'' are retained.&lt;ref&gt;''ě'' was used to mark any of the possible reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] [[yat]] sound.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to printing difficulties, carons are used instead of tildes. Digraphs ''lj́'', ''nj́'', ''dj́'' and ''dž'' are used instead of the former ''l&amp;#771;'', ''n&amp;#771;'', ''d&amp;#771;'' and ''g&amp;#771;'', while what is today's ''ć'' is written as both ''ć'' and ''tj́''. Letter ''j́'' is soon replaced by ''j''. Digraphs with ''j'' were already known from [[Slavonia]]n alphabet, which was the most widespread alphabet in pre-Illyrian times. The alphabet system introduced by Gaj was used until the late 19th century, when [[Đuro Daničić]] finally introduced the letter ''đ'' for ''dj'', and generalized the usage of ''ć'', yielding the [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|modern Croatian alphabet]].{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=28}}

With respect to a set of orthographic issues, Illyrians endorsed the so-called etymological (also called ''morphonological'') orthography, spelling words according to their morphology and etymology. This was opposed to the contemporary phonological orthography "write as you speak, and speak as you write"&lt;ref&gt;In original: ''Piši kao što govoriš, a čitaj kako je napisano!''&lt;/ref&gt; advocated by [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] and his [[Croatian Vukovians|followers]]. Illyrians justified such spellings as being more comprehensible, easier to learn, and reflecting the orthographic practices of other Slavic peoples. They pitted Karadžić's adage against their own: "speak for the ears, write for the eyes".&lt;ref&gt;In original: ''Govori za uši, a piši za oči!''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=28}}

===Language characteristics===
Gaj's main associates and followers were [[Vjekoslav Babukić]] and [[Antun Mažuranić]]. In their linguistic manuals (Babukić's 1836 ''Osnova slovnice slavjanske narěčja ilirskoga'' "The basics of Slavic grammar of the Illyrian dialect", extended edition as 1854 ''Slovnica ilirska'' "Illyrian grammar"; Mažuranić's 1839 ''Temelji ilirskoga i latinskoga jezika'' "The foundation of the Illyrian and Latin language") they were led by the ideological goals of the Illyrian movement, building upon the language supported by the movement's adherents, and which was later advocated by the so-called [[Zagreb Philological School]].{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=28}}

Two of the most important grammatical traits advocated by Illyrians were old inflectional endings for the dative, locative and instrumental plural of nouns, as well as the ending ''-ah'' in genitive plural of nouns, which earned them a derisive nickname "Ahavians" (''ahavci''). For example:
* genitive plural: ''momakah'', ''kraljah'',  ''selah'', ''poljah'', ''ženah'', ''kostih''
* dative plural: ''momkom'', ''kraljem'', ''selom'', ''poljem'', ''ženam'', ''kostim''
* locative plural:  ''momcih'', ''kraljih'', ''selih'', ''poljih'', ''ženah'', ''kastih''
* instrumental plural: ''momci'', ''kralji'', ''seli'', ''polji'', ''ženami'', ''kostmi''

A different set of issues were involved in writing reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] [[yat]] sound, as well as the syllabic /r/. All of the possible [[yat]] reflexes (''i'', ''e'', ''je'' or ''ije'', depending on the dialect) were covered by the letter ''ě'', which was derisively called "horned e" (''rogato e''). Initially it was suggested that everyone reads ''ě'' according to their local pronunciation, though it would be preferable to publicly pronounce it as [je] or [ije]&lt;ref&gt;Babukić 1836: "''u čitanju priučavati se ilirski ''ě'' razložno kao ''je'' izgovarati''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mažuranić 1839: "''u čitanju i u školah ... kano ''ié'' ili ''je'' izgovarati  ga''"&lt;/ref&gt; For syllabic /r/ they were convinced that the pronunciation differs from non-syllabic /r/, so they introduced spelling of the accompanying vowel as well (''àr'', ''èr'': e.g. ''kàrv'', ''dèrvo'').{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=28}}

===Impact===
As opposed to the alphabet which is in a slightly modified form used to this day for [[Croatian language|Croatian]], grammatical and orthographic practices advocated by Illyrians provoked resentment and opposition by some contemporaries as well as by future generations of linguists. Illyrians were criticized from different points of view, and their practices were attacked more often individually rather than as a system, and had a different lifespan, eventually suffering the same fate: disappearance from the language. The so-called etymological orthography survived the longest, until the turn of the century.{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=29}}

==Cultural development==
The most influential writers within the movement were [[Ivan Mažuranić]] and [[Petar Preradović]].&lt;ref name="Eterovich, Francis H 1964"&gt;Eterovich, Francis H. and Christopher Spalatin, ed. Croatia: Land, People, Culture. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Mažuranić contributed his epic ''[[Smrt Smail-age Čengića]]'' during this time, and Preradović published love lyrics.

Other notable literary contributions were made by [[Antun Mihanović]] (notably ''Horvatska Domovina'' which later became [[Our Beautiful Homeland]]), [[Stanko Vraz]] (satiric lyrics), [[Ljudevit Vukotinović]] (romantic lyrics), [[Dimitrija Demeter]] (prose, notably ''Grobničko polje'', and drama), [[Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski]] (prose), [[Antun Nemčić]] (prose and itineraries). There was also the first notable itinerary ''Pogled u Bosnu'' by [[Matija Mažuranić]].

After the government allowed the publishing of newspapers in Croatian in 1834, the Gaj issued the first Croatian newspaper, "Novine hrvatsko-slavonsko-dalmatinske", in 1835, establishing Croatian [[journalism]]. The paper was edited by Ljudevit Gaj and it also had a literary magazine "[[Danica (magazine)|Danica]]" attached, both of which printed in Gaj's "National print" (''Narodna tiskara''). Each issue of Danica began with the motto ''"people without a nation/Is like a body without bones''."&lt;ref&gt;Despalatović, Elinor Murray. ''Ljudevit Gaj and the Illyrian Movement''. East European Quarterly, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; These literary successes "ultimately won intellectual, linguistic, and educational...independence for Croatia."&lt;ref&gt;Eterovich, Francis H. and Christopher Spalatin, ed. Croatia: Land, People, Culture. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1964. page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1836, the papers were renamed to use the Illyrian name (''Ilirske novine'', ''Danica ilirska''). In 1838, [[Janko Drašković]] helped found a reading room in Zagreb which served as a meeting place for the first "Illyrians".

In another cultural success, in 1846 the composer [[Vatroslav Lisinski]] wrote the first opera in [[Croatian language|Croatian]], "''Ljubav i zloba''" (''Love and malice'').

The Illyrian movement, while concentrating on Croatian lands, was quite nationally inclusive, as it included many non-Croats. For example, Petar Preradović was an ethnic Serb, as was [[Josif Runjanin]], Stanko Vraz was an ethnic Slovene, and Dimitrija Demetar was either ethnic Greek or Aromanian.

==Struggles==
In 1840, the Illyrian movement suffered an internal setback when [[Stanko Vraz]], [[Joakim Rakovac]] and [[Ljudevit Vukotinović]] split off from the movement due to creative differences in poetry. In 1842 they started publishing their own literary newspaper named ''[[Kolo (magazine)|Kolo]]''.

Political disputes in the Croatian [[Sabor]] were so fierce they caused unrest in the streets of Zagreb. On July 29, 1845, violent clashes erupted at [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb|St. Marko's Square]], the casualties of which were to become known as the "[[July victims]]". Notwithstanding these events, Hungarian officials were unable to crush the movement.

[[File:Slava saboru Trojedne kraljevine, 1847.jpg|right|thumb|Leaflet praising the Sabor of the ''[[Triune Kingdom]]'' for elevating the "people's language" to the "honor of diplomacy".]]
Speaking in front of the Sabor on 23 October 1847, [[Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski]] advocated [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as the official language instead of Latin and the deputies subsequently voted unanimously in favor of said proposition.

The movement practically ceased to exist due to the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. In 1849, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph]] imposed a new constitution, all political dissent was censored, and the ''Danica'' went out of print.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Vlaho Bukovac, Hrvatski preporod (svecani zastor Hrvatskog narodnog kazalista u Zagrebu).jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Vlaho Bukovac]]:&lt;br&gt; ''Hrvatski narodni preporod'',&lt;br&gt;Curtain at [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|HNK]] in [[Zagreb]]]]

The movement's plea for unity among the Slavs, particularly South Slavs, also found supporters among prominent [[Serbs]] of the time, most notably [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], the reformer of [[Serbian language]].  Ljudevit Gaj had, in fact, appealed to Serbia (along with Dalmatia and Russia) for moral and financial support given their ethnic and cultural connections.&lt;ref name="Eterovich, Francis H 1964"/&gt;

In 1850, a small group of Illyrian and Serbian representatives signed the "[[Vienna agreement]]" which in effect proclaimed the southern [[Shtokavian dialect]] to be the standard, common language of Serbs and Croats, with [[Serbian Cyrillic]] and [[Gajica|Croatian Latin alphabet]] as equal letters. The agreement was the basis of standardizing the [[Serbo-Croatian language]].

==Assessment and criticism==
The Illyrian movement was the first and most prominent [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] movement in Croatian history.

The Illyrian movement was successful in its goals for culture. "Where there was no precedent for nineteenth-century concepts like Czechoslovak or Illyrian nationhood these projects failed.  Nationalism took hold insofar as it built on existing realities, historical, linguistic or social."&lt;ref&gt;Ingrao, Charles W. The Habsburg Monarchy 1618–1815. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000. page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The period of the Illyrian movement is today referred to as the "Croatian [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]]".

The movement formed the basis for a common Serbo-Croatian language, and it fostered support in Croatia for its ultimate goal of creating an Illyrian state, but the movement itself had failed to achieve that goal. Increasing Croatian nationalism shifted towards [[pan-Slavic]] ideals because the Croatian identity superseded the "Illyrian" hopes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11720">{{Anarchism sidebar}}Over the past 150 years, [[Anarchism|anarchists]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]] have held many '''congresses, conferences and international meetings''' in which organizations, trade unions, groups and individuals with libertarian views have participated.

== The First International ==
The original [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWMA), often known today as the '''First International''', grouped together workers' societies of various socialist tendencies, including [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualists]], [[Blanquists]], [[Owenism|Owenites]] and [[republicanism|republicans]], though the most prominent were undoubtedly the [[Collectivism|Collectivists]], grouped around [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and the [[Communism|Communists]], led by [[Karl Marx]]. Towards the end of the First International, the Collectivists adopted Communist positions, but differed from the Marxists in their absolute rejection of authority, both within the International and in their strategic vision for the social revolution, which must immediately abolish the State and not, as with the Marxists, use it in order to gradually establish a communist society.

In these early years of the international [[Socialism|socialist]] movement, the IWMA held 5 congresses attended by both these latter tendencies, at which the differences between the various ideologies clearly emerged. After the 5th Congress, the movement split, with the anarchist communists establishing an anti-authoritarian International. The IWMA was dissolved after its 6th Congress.

=== Conferences and Congresses of the IWMA ===
* Preliminary Conference in [[London]] ([[United Kingdom]]), 25–29 September 1865. Preparation for the 1st Congress.
* 1st Congress of [[Geneva]] ([[Switzerland]]), 3–8 September 1866.
* 2nd Congress of [[Lausanne]] (Switzerland), 2–8 September 1867.
* 3rd Congress of [[Brussels]] ([[Belgium]]), September 1868.
* 4th Congress of [[Basel]] (Switzerland), September 1869.
* Conference of London (United Kingdom), 7–23 September 1871. Called as a result of the impossibility of holding the annual Congress because of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[Paris Commune]] in 1870 and 1871.
* 5th [[Hague Congress (1872)|Congress of The Hague]] ([[Netherlands]]), 2–7 September 1872.
* 6th Congress of Geneva (Switzerland), 8 September 1873.
* International Convention of [[Philadelphia]] ([[United States|USA]]), 15 July 1876. It was decided to disband the International.

== The first anarchist congresses ==
After the [[Hague Congress (1872)]], which saw the expulsion of the anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]], it was decided to hold a Congress of the anti-authoritarian Sections and Federations of the International in [[Saint-Imier|St. Imier]], Switzerland. The Congress was attended by delegates of the International federations in [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Belgium]], the [[United States]], [[France]] and French-speaking [[Switzerland]]. It should be remembered that many sections of the International around this time had membership figures running into the thousands and tens of thousands.

This congress was not considered by the anarchists as the first of a new international organization, but rather the continuation of the old International. It rejected the modifications to the General Rules of the IWMA that had been decided at the London Conference (1871) and the Hague Congress (1872).

=== Congresses of the Anti-authoritarian IWMA ===
*[[International Congress of St. Imier (Switzerland)]], 15–16 September 1872.
* (6th) Congress of [[Neuchâtel]] (Switzerland), 27 September 1873. Abolition of the General Council and autonomy of federations.
* (7th) Congress of Brussels (Belgium), 7–12 September 1874.
* (8th) Congress of [[Bern]] (Switzerland), 26–29 October 1876.
* (9th) Congress of [[Verviers]] (Belgium), 6–8 September 1877.

After 1877, the anti-authoritarian International continued to function in certain areas (such as [[Spain]], [[Tuscany]] and Switzerland) on a local level. A number of local or regional congresses were held, including an important congress of the Jura Federation (Switzerland) in September 1880 which was attended by a number of international delegates and observers. It was at this congress that the anarchist movement adopted anarchist communism as its goal.

=== Other Anarchist congresses until 1922 ===
* International Anarchist Congress of London, 14–20 July 1881.
* [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]], 26–31 August 1907.

There were various other unsuccessful attempts to call international congresses, in Geneva (1882), Paris (1889), [[Chicago]] (1890) and again Paris (1900). A number of anarchists also attended the World Socialist Congress, which took place in [[Ghent]] (Belgium) from 9–15 September 1877. The [[Second International]] was set up in 1889, and many anarchists participated in it. Although they were expelled from the [[Zurich Socialist and Labour Congress, 1893|3rd Congress]], the [[International Socialist Workers and Trade Union Congress, London 1896|4th Congress]] in London in 1896 saw a continuation of the clash between libertarian and authoritarian socialism, with a number of anarchists, such as [[Errico Malatesta|Malatesta]] and [[Christiaan Cornelissen|Cornelissen]], in attendance.

== The rebirth of the IWA ==
Following the [[First World War]] and the [[Russian Revolution]], anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists once again sought to rebuild the IWA. Initially intending to join with other revolutionary syndicalist organizations in the [[Bolshevik]]-led [[Profintern]], libertarian unions became increasingly worried about the authoritarianism of the Bolsheviks and the subordination of Profintern to the [[Comintern]]. So, after two conferences in [[Berlin]], the first from 16–21 December 1920 and the second from 16–18 June 1922, the new [[International Workers Association|International Workingmen's Association]] (later to be known as the International Workers' Association) was born at its first congress in December 1922.

The IWA still exists today.

== Post-World War II Anarchist Congresses ==
Anarchists continued to hold specifically anarchist congresses and conferences after the war, mostly focused on theoretical/ideological discussion. The objective was often the same: to create an international organization which would group together the various non-syndicalist anarchist organizations, i.e. those that were not already members of the IWA.

A stable international organization was finally established in 1968 at a congress in [[Carrara]], Italy - the '''[[International of Anarchist Federations]]''' (IFA), which still exists today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13619">{{Politics of Iraq}}
The '''Iraqi Interim Government''' was created by the [[Multinational force in Iraq|United States and its coalition allies]] as a [[caretaker government]] to govern [[Iraq]] until the drafting of the [[Constitution of Iraq|new constitution]] following the [[Iraqi parliamentary election, January 2005|National Assembly election conducted on January 30, 2005]]. The Iraqi Interim Government itself took the place of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (and the [[Iraq Interim Governing Council]]) on June 28, 2004, and was replaced by the [[Iraqi Transitional Government]] on May 3, 2005.

==Organization==
[[Image:Allawi1.jpg|frame|left|Interim Prime Minister [[Iyad Allawi]].]]
It was recognized by the U.S., the [[United Nations]], the [[Arab League]] and several other countries as being the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[government]] of Iraq (see [[Iraqi sovereignty]] for more information). The U.S. retained significant [[de facto]] power in the country and critics contend that the government existed only at the pleasure of the United States and other coalition countries, whose military forces still remain in Iraq. The coalition did promise that its troops would leave if the new sovereign government requested it, but no such request was made.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===The law and the head of government===
The government's [[head of government]] was [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Iyad Allawi]] and his [[Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq|deputy]] was the influential and charismatic [[Barham Salih]]. The ceremonial [[head of state]] was [[President of Iraq|President]] [[Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer]]. They were all sworn in at a second and more public ceremony on June 28, 2004, shortly after the small private one at which [[L. Paul Bremer]], the Coalition Provisional Authority's administrator, formally gave chief justice [[Midhat Mahmoud]] the legal documents instituting the hand-over.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Absent a permanent constitution, the new government operated under the [[Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period]].

Allawi was a former member of the [[Iraq Interim Governing Council]] and was chosen by the council to be the Interim [[Prime Minister of Iraq]] to govern the country beginning with the United States' handover of sovereignty (June 28, 2004) until national elections, scheduled for early 2005. Although many believe the decision was reached largely on the advice of [[United Nations]] special envoy to Iraq, [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that Brahimi only endorsed him reluctantly after pressure from U.S. officials, including [[Paul Bremer]], the former US Iraqi Administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2004/585/585p15.htm | title=IRAQ: US still calls the shots | work=[[Green Left Weekly]] | date=29 June 2004 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008044238/http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2004/585/585p15.htm | archivedate=8 October 2008 | first=Doug | last=Lorimer | accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Brahimi announced his resignation, due to "great difficulties and frustration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/brahimi-quits-post-as-un-envoy-in-iraq-1.125060|title=Brahimi quits post as UN envoy in Iraq|last=Shamir|first=Shlomo|date=13 June 2004|work=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allawi is often described as a moderate [[Shia Islam|Shia]] (a member of Iraq's majority faith) chosen for his secular background and ties to the United States. However, his image has been undermined with the media suggesting that Allawi was Washington's [[puppet government|puppet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Iraq's New S.O.B. | work=[[Newsweek]] | date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/opinion/26dowd.html?_r=0|title=Dance of the Marionettes|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|authorlink=Maureen Dowd|date=26 September 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions of the Interim Government==
After his interim government assumed legal custody of Saddam Hussein and re-introduced [[capital punishment]], Allawi gave assurances that he would not interfere with the trial and would accept any court decisions. In an interview with [[Dubai]]-based TV station [[al-Arabiya]] he said: "As for the execution, that is for the court to decide—so long as a decision is reached impartially and fairly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Airstrike on Fallujah House Kills 10 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=6 July 2004 |publisher=ABC News |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/wire/World/ap20040706_164.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820005539/http://www.abcnews.go.com/wire/World/ap20040706_164.html |archivedate=20 August 2004 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Precedents" and accusations===
In early July 2004, Allawi issued an unprecedented statement claiming that the Iraqi interim government had provided intelligence for the U.S. air strikers with 500 and 1000 pound (220 and 450&amp;nbsp;kg) bombs on Fallujah in July.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Later he announced new security measures, including the right to impose [[martial law]] and [[curfew]]s, as well as a new [[counter-terrorist]] intelligence unit, the [[General Security Directorate (Iraq)|General Security Directorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/16/1089694556435.html|title=Allawi sets up spy agency|last=Yates|first=Dean|date=17 July 2004|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allawi vowed to crush the Iraqi insurgency, saying he would "annihilate those terrorist groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3896853.stm|title=Iraqi PM vows to crush insurgents|date=15 July 2004|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' alleged that one week before the handover of sovereignty, Allawi himself summarily executed six suspected insurgents at a Baghdad police station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/16/1089694568757.html?oneclick=true|title=Allawi shot prisoners in cold blood: witnesses|last=McGeough|first=Paul |date=17 July 2004|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations are backed up by two independent sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1155990.htm|title=Iraqs interim PM executed six insurgents: witnesses|last=McKew|first=Maxine|publisher=[[ABC Online]]|date=16 July 2004|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the execution is said to have taken place in presence of about a dozen Iraqi police, four American security men and Interior Minister [[Falah al-Naqib]]. Allawi reportedly said that the execution was to "send a clear message to the police on how to deal with insurgents." Both Allawi's office and Naqib have denied the report. US ambassador [[John Negroponte]] did not clearly deny the allegations. On July 18, Iraqi militants offered a $285,000 reward for anyone who could kill Iyad Allawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3904151.stm|title=Fourteen killed in Falluja strike|date=18 July 2004|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allawi's policies===
In August, Allawi closed the Iraqi office of [[Al Jazeera]] for thirty days. His minister [[Hoshiyar Zebari]] deplored the "one-sided and biased coverage" and declared that the interim government "will not allow some people to hide behind the slogan of freedom of the press and media."{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Allawi also appointed ex-Baathist and former Saddam intelligence officer [[Ibrahim Janabi]] as the head of the Higher Media Commission, a regulator of Iraq's media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemID=17458 |title=Iraq's Prime Minister suppresses media |first=Bill |last=Berkowitz |publisher=[[Working Assets]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110034931/http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemID=17458 |archivedate=November 10, 2006 |accessdate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; The banning of Al Jazeera was widely criticised in the Arab world and the West, for example by [[Reporters Sans Frontières]] who called it "a serious blow to press freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1279412,00.html|title=Al-Jazeera closure 'a blow to freedom' |last=O'Carroll|first=Lisa|date=9 August 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/533359.htm |title=Banning bad news in Iraq |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=11 August 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815040759/http://www.iht.com/articles/533359.htm |archivedate=15 August 2004 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negotiations that followed the fighting between [[Muqtada al-Sadr|Muqtada al-Sadr's]] [[Mahdi Army|militia]] and joint US/Iraqi forces in [[Najaf]] ended when Allawi withdrew his emissary Mouwaffaq al-Rubaie on August 14. An al-Sadr spokesman alleged that they "had agreed with Rubaie on all points but  Allawi called him back and he ended the issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3565200.stm|title=Talks collapse in Iraqi holy city|date=14 August 2004|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Allawi has been heavily criticised by members of his own government.  Justice minister [[Malik Dohan al-Hassan]] resigned over the issue of an arrest warrant of [[Ahmed Chalabi]]. Vice president [[Ibrahim al-Jafari]] commented on the attacks against al-Sadr: "War is the worst choice, and it is only used by a bad politician." Another Iraqi official said: "There are brush fires burning out of control all over the place from terrorists and insurgents, and he starts a new bonfire in Najaf."{{cite this quote|date=June 2013}}

While the strategy of "eliminat[ing] Moqtada Sadr's political movement" by "crushing his military power" instead of integrating him into the political process received mostly praise in the West,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3555284.stm|title=Analysis: Will Najaf strategy work?|date=11 August 2004|publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Arab press levelled harsh criticism of Allawi's handling of the Najaf situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3564706.stm|title=Press round on Iraq's new leaders|date=14 August 2004|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces''' (KPNLAF) was the military component of the [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front]] (KPNLF) a political front organized in 1979 in opposition to the Vietnamese-installed [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK) regime in [[Cambodia]]. The KPNLAF was loyal to [[Son Sann]], a former Prime Minister under Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] and the founder of the KPNLF political movement.

==Establishment==
The KPNLAF was formed in March 1979 from various [[anti-communist]] groups that had concentrated on the Thai-Cambodian border and which were opposed to the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]], the Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA726&amp;lpg=PA726&amp;dq=Khmer+People%27s+National+Liberation+Armed+Forces&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3VqXIh8bTV&amp;sig=pIBmHLg-raV0pTJ7NqY1Dn_uZ6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Keat Gin Ooi, ''Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia,'' ABC-CLIO, 2004] {{ISBN|1-57607-770-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Bultmann (2015) 'Inside Cambodian Insurgency. A Sociological Perspective on Civil Wars and Conflict', Ashgate: Burlington, VT/Farnham, UK, {{ISBN|9781472443076}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these groups were essentially warlord bands, engaging more in smuggling and in internecine fighting than in combat operations. They were brought together by General [[Dien Del]], a former career officer of the [[Khmer Republic]] who became chief of the KPNLAF General Staff. By mid-1979 there were 1,600 armed soldiers in the KPNLAF.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The KPNLF was proclaimed on October 9, 1979 at [http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/camps/Site-K-Sok-San.html Sok Sann], a camp in the jungles of the [[Cardamom Mountains]] that contained barely 2,000 men&lt;ref&gt;Bekaert, J., "Kampuchea: The Year of the Nationalists?" ''Southeast Asian Affairs,'' Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore (1983), pp. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a merger of 13 armed groups, some of them remnants of the [[Khmer National Armed Forces]]. The following month the first shipment of 3,000 [[rifles]] arrived from [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Corfield JJ. ''A History of the Cambodian Non-Communist Resistance, 1975-1983.'' Clayton, Vic., Australia: Centre of Southeast Asian Studies, Monash University, 1991, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 overall command was given to General [[Sak Sutsakhan]], another prominent member of the Republic's former army.

==Expansion 1981–82==
General Dien Del opened an officer's training school at Ampil Refugee Camp (Ban Sangae) in January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield, P. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The first graduating class of 82 cadet officers, 68 company-level commanders and 76 platoon-level commanders immediately took up posts in the field. This was further helped by the arrival of some 3000 Chinese weapons in March.&lt;ref&gt;Heder, S. "KPNLF's Guerrilla Strategy Yields Mixed Results," ''Indochina Issues'' 45 (April 1984), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Son Sann's non-communist credentials, the KPNLAF offered an alternative to those Cambodians who supported neither Sihanouk, [[Hanoi]] nor the [[Khmer Rouge]], and it quickly became the second largest [[guerrilla]] force in Thailand, second only to the remnants of the Khmer Rouge. By mid-1981, with about 7,000 personnel under arms, it was able to protect its [[refugee]] camps and occasionally to conduct forays into Cambodia.

In June 1982 the KPNLF joined the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]], although military operations between the three partner organizations never achieved any degree of coordination.

[[Nong Chan Refugee Camp]] became the KPNLAF's military headquarters at the end of 1982, although Ampil Camp remained the administrative headquarters until it was destroyed in early 1985. Nong Chan housed the KPNLAF's 3rd, 7th and 9th battalions and a [[Special Forces]] [[commando]] unit, while the 1st Battalion was at [[Nong Samet Refugee Camp]] and the 2nd at Ampil.&lt;ref&gt;Radu, M. and Arnold, A. ''The New Insurgencies: Anticommunist Guerrillas in the Third World'' New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1990, p. 218-19.&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1984 Son Sann claimed that his KPNLF army "…had 12,000 fully armed fighters, with an additional 8,000 trained but still without weapons."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Quinn-Judge, "Hanoi's Headache: Son Sann's Anti-Vietnamese Coalition Faction is Gaining Strength, Militarily and Politically." ''Far Eastern Economic Review,'' Jan 19, 1984 p. 32. Two months earlier William Branigan reported similar numbers: "…the Khmer People's National Liberation Front numbers 10,000 to 12,000 armed fighters, with another 6,000 unarmed recruits, diplomats said." ''The Washington Post,'' Nov 22, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
The KPNLAF favored strike-and-retreat guerrilla tactics and tended to operate in small, lightly armed, highly mobile units of 6 to 12 soldiers.

*The Chinese-made [[Type 56 assault rifle]] was the weapon of choice, supplied by the [[People's Republic of China]] or captured in combat but also occasionally bought or traded from KPRAF troops.&lt;ref&gt;Morris J. ''The Devil's Secret Name.'' Canton, Ohio: Daring Books, 1989, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The folding stock version came into common use in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/085045851X Conboy K, Bowra K. ''The War in Cambodia, 1970-75''. Osprey Publishing, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[M79 grenade launcher]]s and the B-40 variant of the [[RPG-2]] were used both in attack and in the defense of the border camps.&lt;ref&gt;"A Rebel Camp In Cambodia Awaits Attack," ''New York Times'', Jan 6, 1985, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Soviet-made 82mm [[B-10 recoilless rifle]]s were the KPNLAF's only form of [[artillery]] and were used primarily in defensive positions. 
*A small number of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] was supplied by China during 1985.&lt;ref&gt;"A Rebel Camp In Cambodia Awaits Attack," ''New York Times'', Jan 6, 1985, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of weapons, many KPNLAF troops carried their own guns, including American [[M16 rifle|M16]]s which had been supplied by the US military to [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] troops prior to 1975. A few soldiers even carried hunting rifles or [[shotgun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bekaert J. ''Kampuchean Diary, 1983-1986.'' Bangkok, Thailand: DD Books, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

KPNLAF forces were adept at the use of [[landmines]], particularly [[Anti-personnel mine|blast mines]] such as the [[PMN mine|PMN-2]] and [[M14 mine|M14]], as well as [[Bounding mine|bounding fragmentation mines]] such as the [[M16 mine|M16A2]] and the [[M2 mine|M2A4]].&lt;ref&gt;Arms Project (Human Rights Watch), Physicians for Human Rights (U.S.). ''Landmines: A Deadly Legacy.'' New York: Human Rights Watch, 1993, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Vietnamese offensive of 1984-85==
{{main article|Vietnamese border raids in Thailand}}
Two developments in the mid-1980s greatly diminished KPNLAF capabilities as a fighting force. The first of these was the [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand|Vietnamese dry season offensive]] of November 1984 to March 1985, which weakened the KPNLAF's numbers and forced them to abandon several fortified border encampments (such as [[Nong Samet Refugee Camp|Nong Samet]] and [[Nong Chan Refugee Camp|Nong Chan]]) on the Thai-Cambodian border. The other [[insurgent]] forces, the [[Khmer Rouge]] and the [[Military history of Cambodia#Arm.C3.A9e Nationale Sihanoukiste|Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste]], were also affected by this offensive, which reduced the number of camps on the border from [http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/maps/Border-camps-1979-1984.jpg 21] to [http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/maps/UNBRO-camps-1985-1989.jpg 11]. The [[Government of Thailand]] and the international community viewed the quartering of KPNLAF troops in civilian camps as a recipe for disaster, and [[United Nations Border Relief Operation]], the UN agency responsible for security on the border, relocated the camps inside Thailand with troops in separate camps from refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websitesrcg.com/border/documents/Refugee-Warriors-on-the-Thai-Cambodian-Border.pdf Refugee Warriors at the Thai-Cambodian Border." ''Refugee Survey Quarterly'' 2000;19(1):23-37]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second development, equally harmful to the KPNLAF cause, was the dispute that broke out among the top leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB727B1192F84F5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "Rebel Leaders fight for Power in Cambodia," ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', January 4, 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the loss of the border camps, contemporary reports noted that "open revolt" had broken out among guerrilla commanders over the "dictatorial ways" of Son Sann, who had continued as president of the KPNLF, and his "interference in military matters."&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/58454577.html?dids=58454577:58454577&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+05%2C+1986&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Leadership+Rebellion+Splits+Group+in+Cambodian+Rebel+Coalition&amp;pqatl=google "Leadership Rebellion Splits group in Cambodian Rebel Coalition", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', January 5, 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis resulted in the virtual paralysis of the KPNLAF until leadership issues were resolved in late 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2231.html Country Studies Series by Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commando operations inside Cambodia==
Partly as a result of leadership disputes that prevented the development of a coordinated military strategy, the KPNLAF turned to [[sabotage]] and [[demolition]] in order to wage a war of attrition.&lt;ref&gt;Crossette, Barbara, "Cambodian Rebels are Pushed into Thailand, and a Corner: Guerrillas Try to Regroup for a Summer Offensive," ''New York Times,'' Feb 24, 1985, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1983 the [[Special Air Service]] of the [[United Kingdom]] secretly provided training to a 250-man KPNLAF [[commando]] battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Karniol R. "KPNLF Steps Up Guerrilla War." ''Jane's Defence Weekly'' 1986;6(16):850.&lt;/ref&gt; Commandos were trained to operate independently in enemy territory in six-man units that attacked bridges, railways, trains, office buildings, artillery, power lines, transformers, and [[radar]] stations,&lt;ref&gt;Asia Watch Committee (U.S.), Physicians for Human Rights (U.S.). ''Land Mines in Cambodia: The Coward's War.'' New York: Asia Watch / Human Rights Watch, 1991, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; using small group tactics, [[booby-traps]], [[landmines]] and [[improvised explosive devices]]&lt;ref&gt;''Landmines: A Deadly Legacy'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; manufactured from commercial products or conventional ordnance. Students were also trained in tactics, weapons, navigation, [[first aid]], radio communications, and unarmed combat.&lt;ref&gt;''Land Mines in Cambodia,'' p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; At least six training courses of six to ten weeks were conducted between 1986 and 1989. The training was provided in [[Thailand]] at a Thai military facility near the [[Burma|Burmese]] border, and in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;Yu Lee Kwan.

"Year Zero" in ''Tell Me No Lies: Investigative Journalism and Its Triumphs''], Random House UK, 2004, {{ISBN|0-224-06288-3}} p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; of these activities  caused considerable debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in July 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm199091/cmhansrd/1991-07-22/Debate-10.html Hansard (House of Commons Daily Debates) July 22, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurt Adams''' (15 December 1889 – 7 October 1944) was a [[Hamburg]] [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician and an educationalist.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verfolgte.spd-hamburg.de/dokumente/Wegweiser-Widerstand-internet.pdf|work=Wegweiser zu den Stätten von Verfolgung und sozialdemokratischem Widerstand in Hamburg|title=Teil I: Die innere Stadt   ...

==Life==
Kurt Adams was born at the tail end of 1889.   His father was a merchant.   He attended two secondary schools, first the "Vor dem Lübeckertor [[Realschule]]" and then the "auf der Uhlenhorst [[Realschule]]", before progressing to university.   His university level studies took him to universities in [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|the Humboldt (Berlin)]] and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]].   Subjects studied were [[German studies|German]], [[French culture|French]] and [[History]].&lt;ref name=KAlautWR&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M5h8XPCzenMC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=%22Kurt+Adams%22+%22Aktion+Gitter%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VLMrf9zxau&amp;sig=f2WrckXiQihApSTh8UqrvUg54SQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBWoVChMIvMKG-tmPyQIVjOkUCh2bwAz4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kurt%20Adams%22%20%22Aktion%20Gitter%22&amp;f=false|work=Sozialdemokraten im Konzentrationslager Buchenwald 1937-1945|title=Aktion Gitter: Die Einlieferung der ehemaliger sozialdemokratischer Abgeordniter und  Funktionäre im August/September 1944:  Kurt Adams|author=Wolfgang Röll |pages=180–184|date=2000|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|isbn=3-89244-417-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He received his doctorate in 1912 for a dissertation entitled "[[Otto Ludwig (writer)|Otto Ludwig´s]] Theories on Drama".&lt;ref name=KurAdalautHolMar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stolpersteine-hamburg.de/index.php?&amp;LANGUAGE=DE&amp;MAIN_ID=7&amp;BIO_ID=4183|title=Kurt Adams MdHB|publisher=Dr. Rita Bake &amp; Peter Hess iA Erinnerungs-Projekt Stolpersteine in Hamburg|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The next year he took a job with the Hamburg City Schools Service, also teaching at the Albrecht-Thaer School, and became committed to the cause of [[Progressive education|education reform]].&lt;ref name=KAlautWR/&gt;   Adams remained an energetic member of the city Schools Service till 1929.&lt;ref name=KAlautWR/&gt;   In October 1928 he took over headship of the Hamburg [[Folk high school|People's Academy]] from [[Rudolf Roß]].&lt;ref name=KAlautArbeitsgemeinschaft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lebensgeschichten.avs-hh.de/index.php?id=27|title=Adams, Kurt   ...

Kurt Adams joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (SPD)]] while still a student.   Between 1924 and 1933 he was a member of the [[Hamburg Parliament]].   More than  once he stood for election to the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|national Reichstag]], but his name was towards the bottom of the SPD party list and he was never elected.&lt;ref name=KAlautArbeitsgemeinschaft/&gt;

He took a particular interest in education and was a member of various education related committees and grouings including the "Working Group of SPD Teachers" (''"Arbeitsgemeinschaft sozialdemokratischer Lehrer"'') of which he was chairman locally,&lt;ref name=KAlautWR/&gt; becoming known as one of the Hamburg SPD's leading education experts.   He also headed up the  Hamburg "Kinderfreundebewegung" (''literally "Children's friends' movement"'').&lt;ref name=KAlautArbeitsgemeinschaft/&gt;

==Politics==
Following [[Machtergreifung|Régime change]] in January 1933, the [[Nazi Germany|new government]] lost little time in [[Gleichschaltung|moving towards]] [[One-party state|one-]][[Nazi Party|party government]].   Adams was threatened with the loss of his position in the Schools Service as a result of the so-called [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed in April 1933.   He therefore announced his resignation from the SPD to the local party leadership, but he nevertheless lost his job on 232 June 1933.   He faced a call from the newly appointed Hamburg [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] [[Gauleiter]], [[Karl Kaufmann]] to renounce his political convictions, but did not do so.   Kurt Adams was succeeded as head of the Hamburg [[Folk high school|People's Academy]] by {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrich Haselmayer|de}}.&lt;ref name=HasellautMarlis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epub.sub.uni-hamburg.de/epub/volltexte/2009/2730/pdf/2_1_Der_Ausschluss_der_jdischen_Mitglieder_1935.pdf| page=51|title=Die »kulturelle SA« und die Zusammenarbeit mit den staatlichen und parteiamtlichen Kulturstellen|work=Der Ausschluss der jüdischen Mitglieder 1935 Die Patriotische Gesellschaft im Nationalsozialismus|author=Marlis Roß}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing his public service employment Adam worked briefly for a cinema news-sheet, before taking on a small coffee distribution business in Hamburg's [[Nikolaifleet]] (in the city's old harbour quarter).   The coffee business brought him into contact with a number pf politically like-minded individuals, and his little trading office quickly became a Hamburg meeting point for [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[Communist party of Germany|Communists]], whose party activities had become illegal in 1933.  Adams was able to help fellow victims of Nazi persecution, including {{Interlanguage link multi|Hermann Hoefer|de}} and [[Rudolf Klug]].   In addition to coffee, the little business became a distribution point for illegal political leaflets, some of which Adams himself distributed, using his bicycle.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens/&gt;

==Death==
On 20 July 1944 an [[20 July plot|assassination attempt]] was made against [[Adolf Hitler]].   The dictator survived, but his regime had already prepared a list of several thousand names, to be used in the event of an escalation in political tension on the home front, and the name of Kurt Adams was on it.   In the context of the wave of arrests known as "[[Aktion Gitter]]", on 24 August 1944 Kurt Adams was arrested at [[Greiz]], where he was staying with relatives while recuperating from a serious operation earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens/&gt;   He was taken to [[Gera]] nearby.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens/&gt;   Four days later he was taken to the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], which was already overcrowded, with approximately 84,000 detainees.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens/&gt;   On his arrival he was immediately recognized by other inmates, whose reactions to his arrival identified him to the guards.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens/&gt;   He was separated out and placed in a sub-camp where the condition of the accommodation, food and hygiene were massively worse than in the main camp.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens/&gt;   He quickly weakened and became ill:  from later reports provided by fellow detainees he appears to have caught [[pneumonia]], and was taken, on 15 September 1944, to the camp hospital where he received treatment and his condition may have improved.   However, he was soon discharged back to the camp.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens/&gt;   The family received two more letters from him, in the second of which, dated 26 September 1944, he wrote that he was getting better.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens/&gt;   However, on 5 October 1944 he lost consciousness, and he died, probably of [[meningitis]], on 7 October 1944.&lt;ref name=AdamslautMartens/&gt;&lt;ref name=KAlautFAZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/politik/rezension-sachbuch-opfer-zweiter-klasse-117260.html|title=Opfer zweiter Klasse |work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Feiulleton|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|volume=33/2001|page=10|author=Johannes Hürter|date=8 February 2001|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''League Against Usury''' ({{lang-ro|Liga contra Cametei}}, LCC, or ''Liga împotriva Cametei'') was a [[Single-issue politics|single-issue]], mainly [[Agrarianism|agrarian]], political party in [[Romania]]. Formed as a political answer to the [[Great Depression]], it involved itself in the fight against "[[usury]]" (or [[predatory lending]]), bringing together politicians on all sides of the political spectrum. Its prominent backers and activists included leftists such as [[Nicolae L. Lupu]] and [[Ion D. Isac]], independents such as [[Pantelimon Erhan]], [[Stefan Frecôt]], [[George Tutoveanu]] and [[Eraclie Sterian]], and some affiliates of the interwar far-right. The LCC channeled protest votes, and competed in this with fascist movements such as the [[Iron Guard]], ambiguously supporting [[economic antisemitism]].

Although perceived as an upsetting contender, the LCC effectively seconded the [[Democratic Peasants' Party–Stere]]. Under its auspices, it managed to obtain one seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly]] in the [[Romanian general election, 1931|election of June 1931]]. The League's fiscal proposals were embraced by the government of [[Nicolae Iorga]], which also drew in former LCC cadres, while other activists left the League to openly embrace fascism. After involving itself in support of continued [[debt relief]] policies, and failing to win any seats in later elections, the LCC finally dissolved itself in late 1932.

==History==

===Creation===
The LCC was created by the jurist Eftimie "Volică" Antonescu with support from various politicians and journalists. Its constitutive congress was held at Antonescu's home in [[Bucharest]] on Saturday, August 17, 1929.&lt;ref name="adev1929"&gt;"Liga contra cametei", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', August 18, 1929, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, the movement may have had roots that predated the Great Depression: a League of the same name (later LCC chapter) was reportedly formed in 1928 by the [[Gorj County]] landowner Alexandru A. Magherescu.&lt;ref name="p&amp;pp477"&gt;''Politics and Political Parties...'', p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Voted in as LCC president, Antonescu had first stirred controversy in 1918, when he acted as a prosecutor selectively investigating wartime abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandru Marghiloman]], ''Note politice. Vol. 3. 1917–1918'', pp. 309, 412. Bucharest: Editura Institutului de Arte Grafice Eminescu, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; His career in politics saw him crossing the floor: he had been a member of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative]] and [[Romanian National Party|National Parties]],&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, pp. 129, 259, 282&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards defected to the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]]. Elected for the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] seat in Gorj, he had criticized the governing [[National Peasants' Party]] for its handling of the Depression, and also for its passage of multiple and conflicting laws.&lt;ref&gt;Roșca &amp; Vlad, pp. 77, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The LCC's generic goal was the fight against "usury", structured into three lesser objectives: phasing out interest rates, canceling [[foreclosure]]s, and auditing the "usurers".&lt;ref name="is155"&gt;Ioan Scurtu (ed.), ''Enciclopedia partidelor politice din România, 1859-2003'', p. 155. Bucharest: Editura Meronia, 2003.  {{ISBN|973-8200-54-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of it manifestos, the LCC demanded quick [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] and the reevaluation of interest at 1%;&lt;ref name="Clapa, p. 7"&gt;Clapa, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; according to the peasants' own claims, interest rates could climb as high as 40% or even 100% in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;"Où va la Roumanie?", p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Antonescu sent out a public notification to the Romanian Regents, who were looking after [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]]. The text, which later became the LCC's [[Producerism|producerist]] platform, spoke of bankers, civil administrators, and industrialists as "parasites", and called for [[tax cut]]s on the less wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Roșca &amp; Vlad, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; A peasant militant from [[Dolj County|Dolj]] detailed that agenda and proposed measures against the state apparatus, noting that a functionary could earn as much as 50 agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;Pandrea, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Armin Heinen explains the economic mechanism leading to the establishment of the LCC as follows: "The [[Land reform in Romania|agrarian reform of 1917–1921]] created a need for currency, which could only be supplied by bank loans. Agriculturists had contracted high-interest loans, either to compensate the former landowner or to furnish their new or extended property with basic supplies, or merely—given the entirely too small plots they were left for production—to ensure their living income. As an effect of the economic crisis, produce prices fell [...]. The peasants could no longer make their payments, and consequently their properties were put up for sale."&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; These issues were aggravated by Western [[protectionism]], which prevented exports, and by Soviet [[predatory pricing]], which reduced [[demand]].&lt;ref&gt;"Où va la Roumanie?", pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Antonescu program was met with skepticism by various other specialists. A ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economist, Al. D. Neagu, argued that the League presented "inefficient, unjust and momentary palliatives" to a systemic crisis, none of which could reactivate demand.&lt;ref&gt;Neagu, pp. 337–339&lt;/ref&gt; Neagu also notes that the LCC's claims about usurers were largely dealt with by laws which limited [[repossession]], and that its program was "economically and morally unjustified".&lt;ref&gt;Neagu, pp. 334–335&lt;/ref&gt; Jurist [[Nicolae Dașcovici]] also suggested that measures such as those endorsed "by the League against Usury agitators" meant "a continuous and quickened fall of trust by the capital [market]—and as such implicitly the worsening of credit ratings." The "one cure", he proposed, was "liquidating the insolvent".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Dașcovici]], "Insănătoșirea creditului în România", in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 17–18/1930, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and eclecticism===
The LCC was a complex and eclectic movement. The left-wing journalist [[Petre Pandrea]], who attended LCC meetings, saw the party as a "provisional alliance" of "the ''[[kulak]]'' and the hired hand".&lt;ref&gt;Pandrea, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Its sympathizers included [[Nicolae L. Lupu]], leader of the [[Peasants' Party–Lupu]] (PȚ–L) and a left-wing critic of National Peasantist economic policies. According to historian Pompiliu Tudoran, both Lupu and Antonescu's parties should be regarded as "center-left".&lt;ref&gt;Tudoran, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Lupu played a noted part in setting up the League,&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Scurtu, "Întemeierea și activitatea Partidului Țărănesc — dr. N. Lupu (1927—1934)", in ''Revista de Istorie'', Nr. 5/1976, p. 705&lt;/ref&gt; but was not present for its constitutive congress, being held up by partial elections in [[Hunedoara County]].&lt;ref name="adev1929"/&gt; According to Pandrea, he had created around him a "popular myth" as a savior, but had never promised his peasant constituents any concrete form of [[debt relief]].&lt;ref&gt;Pandrea, pp. 116, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Lupu's faction within the LCC was represented by [[Ion D. Isac]]. An educationist and decorated veteran, Isac was both the organizer of the League's branch in Gorj and chair of the national secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, pp. 233–239&lt;/ref&gt; Also joining the LCC in 1929 was a politically independent poet, [[George Tutoveanu]], who published denunciations of the bankers and stated that his party's mission was "to fight against suffering."&lt;ref name="Clapa, p. 7"/&gt; In May 1930, the LCC inaugurated in Bucharest its own political newspaper, ''Jos Camăta'' ("Down with Usury"). From November 14, it had Constantin C. Iarca as its editor.&lt;ref&gt;Ileana-Stanca Desa, Dulciu Morărescu, Ioana Patriche, Cornelia Luminița Radu, Adriana Raliade, Iliana Sulică, ''Publicațiile periodice românești (ziare, gazete, reviste). Vol. IV: Catalog alfabetic 1925-1930'', p. 546. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 2003.  {{ISBN|973-27-0980-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From October, it had a chapter in [[Bessarabia]], supervised by [[Pantelimon Erhan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Enciu, "Structura socio-profesională a populației Basarabiei interbelice între tradiţionalism și modernitate", in ''Hyperion. Revistă de Cultură'', Vol. 36, Issues 1–2–3, 2018, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, the League also won the adherence of Sterie Ionescu, who founded in [[Caracal, Romania|Caracal]] the newspaper ''Desrobirea'' ("Emancipation"), "at the service of plowmen, traders, and the League against Usury".&lt;ref&gt;Ileana-Stanca Desa, Elena Ioana Mălușanu, Cornelia Luminița Radu, Iuliana Sulică, ''Publicațiile periodice românești (ziare, gazete, reviste). Vol. V: Catalog alfabetic 1930–1935'', pp. 243, 374. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 2009.  {{ISBN|978-973-27-1828-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, 1930, the LCC had absorbed into it ranks [[Eraclie Sterian]]'s Association of Mortgaged Owners and Debtors.&lt;ref&gt;"Intrunirea Ligii contra cametei și proprietarilor ipotecați", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', November 4, 1930, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; By 1931, it had a branch in [[Năsăud County]], with the mechanic Mihai Buta as one of its prominent members.&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

With its specific attacks on [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] creditors, the LCC also had radical-right tinges: Heinen sees it as an "antisemitic and markedly right-wing" party, or "protest movement".&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 153, 199, 379&lt;/ref&gt; The LCC's branch in [[Bukovina]] included a Colonel Ioan Niculcea, who also sympathized with the [[National-Christian Defense League]] (LANC).&lt;ref&gt;Bruja, pp. 241–242; Heinen, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1930, the latter movement had instigated "agrarian troubles of an antisemitic character",&lt;ref&gt;"Où va la Roumanie?", p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; with Niculcea as an active instigator. In mid 1930, Niculcea was arrested alongside the LANC's [[Nichifor Robu]] and Dumitru Scriculeac, a measure which only resulted in more confrontations between their supporters and [[Romanian Police]].&lt;ref name="rfb241"&gt;Bruja, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted at the time by ''La Revue Slave'', the LCC also challenged the core antisemitic tenets, by showing publicly that the "usurers" were highly active in [[Oltenia]], where Jews were virtually non-present.&lt;ref&gt;"Où va la Roumanie?", pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; In that region, the LCC was especially focused on denouncing the National Liberal banking monopoly.&lt;ref name="scrut"&gt;Scrutator, "Situația actuală și roadele campaniei contra partidelor. Nihilism politic în mase, mari nemulțumiri în cadrele politice. Greșelile guvernului au creat o situație intenabilă", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', May 21, 1931, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in 1931, a LANC newspaper warned voters that the League was a "wolf in sheep's clothing", and merely a front for Lupu's party.&lt;ref&gt;"Partidele, ca să mai aibă crezare, se ascund sub diferite nume", in ''Înfrățirea Românească'', Nr. 13/1931, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

In other contexts, the LCC was regarded as a quasi-socialist movement or a front for the banned [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCdR). As Pandrea notes, Lupu was suspected of being a "[[Bolshevik]]" by the banking lobby, but was merely a Romanian "[[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]]", his policies ones of compromise with the lenders.&lt;ref&gt;Pandrea, pp. 116–119&lt;/ref&gt; In one such report of January 1931, [[Argeș County]] authorities denounced the LCC as a front for both the PCdR and the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927–48)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR).&lt;ref&gt;Dumitrescu &amp; Dumitrescu, pp. 265–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Such charges were disregarded by members of both groups. In its manifestos, the PSDR, which sided with the National Peasantists, dismissed the League and the PȚ–L as opportunistic movements, "created for the love of [[pork barrel]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Titel Petrescu]], ''Socialismul în România. 1835 – 6 septembrie 1940'', p. 418. Bucharest: Dacia Traiana, [n. y.]&lt;/ref&gt; A more radical position was taken by the PCdR, whose 1931 congress listed LLC among the "fascist and semi-fascist" organisations used by the bourgeoisie and landowners in order to channel the discontent of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;"Congresul al V-lea al Partidului Comunist din Romînia", in ''Documente din istoria Partidului Comunist din Romînia. 1929–1933'', pp. 35, 270, 370. Bucharest: Editura de stat pentru literatură politică, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; With Communists [[Communist Romania|taking power after World War II]], this view became replicated in official historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1960s, party historians such as Gheorghe Ioniță also reclaimed the League as one of the "democratic organizations created, steered, and influenced by the [communist party]".&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Diac, "O cotitură a destinului. Procesul lui Nicolae Ceaușescu din 1936", in Adrian Cioroianu (ed.), ''Comuniștii înainte de comunism: procese și condamnări ale ilegaliștilor din România'', p. 261. Bucharest: [[Editura Universității București]], 2014.  {{ISBN|978-606-16-0520-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers C. and F. Dumitrescu reached a similar conclusion, namely that the PCdR had a "tight connection" with the League.&lt;ref&gt;Dumitrescu &amp; Dumitrescu, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being joined by antisemites, the LCC was also open to members of various [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minorities]]. Its regional chapter in the [[Banat]] was led by [[Stefan Frecôt]], a dissident and French-speaking member of the [[Danube Swabians|Danube Swabian]] community,&lt;ref&gt;Smaranda Vultur, ''Francezi în Banat, bănățeni în Franța'', pp. 48–49. Timișoara: Editura Marineasa, 2012.  {{ISBN|978-973-631-698-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was also briefly the national LCC's Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;Vasile Dudaș, "Ștefan Frecot", in ''Analele Banatului. Arheologie–Istorie'', Vol. XVI, 2008, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; In Bukovina, where the LCC formed itself under the presidency of [[Dorimedont Popovici|Dorimedont "Dori" Popovici]] from May 1930, its affiliates included non-Romanians such as Carol Weltman, Victor Orobko, and Rudolf Müller.&lt;ref&gt;Florin-Răzvan Mihai, "Dinamica electorală a candidaților minoritari din Bucovina la alegerile generale din România interbelică", in Vasile Ciobanu, Sorin Radu (eds.), ''Partide politice și minorități naționale din România în secolul XX'', Vol. V, pp. 94, 100. Sibiu: TechnoMedia, 2010.  {{ISBN|978-973-739-261-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukrainians in Romania|Ukrainian]] peasants were noted participants in Niculcea's anti-Jewish riot at [[Seliatyn|Seletin]].&lt;ref name="rfb241"/&gt;

===1931 election and later history===
The League acknowledged [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]'s return to the Romanian throne, and "appealed to the sovereign that he take debtors under his protection."&lt;ref&gt;"Intrunirea Ligii contra cametei", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', March 22, 1932, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; By March, the League and the Association of Mortgage Debtors were proselytizing with large-scale awareness campaigns, often developed around [[agricultural show]]s. These offered venues for airing LCC slogans, including: ''Dobânda este un furt ce nu trebuie plătit'' ("Interest is theft that we should not cover").&lt;ref&gt;Dumitrescu &amp; Dumitrescu, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Carol toppled the National Peasantist cabinet in April, assigning [[Nicolae Iorga]] as his [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]]. As the latter noted, the appointment coincided with great turmoil, during which the LCC was preparing "an actual peasants' revolt" at Gorj.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Doi ani de restaurație. Ce a fost, ce am vrut, ce am putut'', pp. 29–30. Vălenii de Munte: Datina Românească, 1932.  {{OCLC|45882093}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also suggested by Pandrea, who recalled the "[[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 atmosphere]]" and "pre-revolutionary" feel of the LCC congress in [[Craiova]].&lt;ref&gt;Pandrea, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Calman Blumenfeld-Scrutator, the "extraordinarily energetic" League was also especially strong in the Banat, where it looked like a real threat to the establishment.&lt;ref name="scrut"/&gt;

In the [[Romanian general election, 1931|June 1931 general elections]], convened by Iorga, the LCC ran under a [[sun cross]] logo (⊕).&lt;ref&gt;"Haosul electoral", in ''[[Realitatea Ilustrată]]'', Nr. 285, July 1935, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; It formed a loose alliance with the left-wing agrarian [[Democratic Peasants' Party–Stere]] (PȚD–S). The latter registered on separate lists, but only put up candidates in Bessarabia.&lt;ref name="scrut"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 152, 153&lt;/ref&gt; By then, however, some members of the far-right wing had left the League: Col. Niculcea set up a Beetroot Cultivators' Collective (''Obștea Cultivatorilor de Sfeclă''), which caucused with the fascist [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 153, 195&lt;/ref&gt; Far-right groups were nominally repressed during the election, with both Niculicea and Robu returning to jail,&lt;ref&gt;Bruja, pp. 241–242&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Internal Affairs]], then under [[Constantin Argetoianu]], failed to take significant action on that front. At the time, the bulk of its surveillance activity was still focused on the LCC, the PCdR, and the [[Peasant Workers' Bloc]].&lt;ref name="np316"&gt;N. Petrescu, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scrutator, the LCC policy of presenting in peasant candidates "makes insomniacs from both the leaders of government organizations as well as those of the opposition."&lt;ref name="scrut"/&gt; As noted by historian Niculae Petrescu, the Democratic Peasantists had more to gain from their partnership with the LCC, increasing its share of the vote nationally.&lt;ref name="np316"/&gt; However, the alliance only received 2.8% of the vote nationally, winning them six seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]]. The LCC took one seat and the PȚD–S took five.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]], Philip Stöver, ''Elections in Europe: A Data Handbook''. Baden-Baden: Nomos, 2010, p. 1601.  {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}. See also ''Politics and Political Parties...'', p. 57. See also N. Petrescu, p. 315; Moldovan, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; The party also formed a cartel with the PȚ–L, which granted it as a favor an extra seat, representing Gorj.&lt;ref name="ddrlupu"&gt;"Electorale. D. dr. Lupu despre denunțarea cartelului de către Liga contra cametei", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', June 17, 1932, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the two groups had gathered 3,940 votes between them.&lt;ref&gt;Tudoran, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; The courtesy seat went to Isac, who had been arrested for sedition during the campaign, forcing the authorities to release him.&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]] (PND) and its allies emerged victorious from the campaign, returning Iorga as Prime Minister. His new administration incorporated former LCC cadres, appointing Tutoveanu as the [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] of [[Tutova County]].&lt;ref&gt;Clapa, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The LCC also ran in the partial elections for the Assembly seat in that county (April 1932), separate from Lupu's own PȚ–L. The seat was taken by the Iron Guard's [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], who won 26% of the vote; the LCC had 13.7%, and the PȚ–L 6.2%.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 199–200, 379&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heinen, the League still managed to draw votes away from the Iron Guard's niche, upsetting its growth.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;

The LCC opted to present its own candidates in the [[Romanian general election, 1932|elections of July 1932]]. It thus denounced the PȚ–L alliance, allegedly because Lupu had refused to assign an eligible position in [[Alba County]] to Antonescu.&lt;ref name="ddrlupu"/&gt; The group failed to win any seats, but its leadership still met in August 1932, when it presented a new set of political demands.&lt;ref&gt;"Intrunirea Ligei contra cametei", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', August 9, 1932, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Largely rendered ineffectual by the adoption of debt relief and anti-usury legislation under the Iorga cabinet,&lt;ref name="is155"/&gt; it supported the application of such laws once they were placed in peril by the National Peasantist government of [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]]. At the time, it was speculated that the LCC would form a "spontaneous" alliance with the PND and other parties.&lt;ref&gt;T. L., "Acțiunea pentru apărarea conversiunii", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', August 9, 1932, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, the LCC voted to dissolve itself later in 1932.&lt;ref name="is155"/&gt;

An association called League Against Usury still existed in 1934 in Bucharest, collaborating with the Association of Mortgaged Owners and Debtors on a Front for Urban Reclamation (''Frontul Asanării Urbane'').&lt;ref name="ghidof64"/&gt; The LCC's Gorj chapter, presided upon by Magherescu, had merged into Argetoianu's [[Agrarian Union Party]],&lt;ref name="p&amp;pp477"/&gt; while Sterie Ionescu founded a Front of Debtors, and, in 1935, sought to reestablish the [[National Agrarian Party (Romania)|National Agrarian Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumitru Botar, "Din presa romanațeană de altădată (III)", in ''Memoria Oltului și Romanaților'', Issue 4/2017, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Romanian general election, 1937|general election of December 1937]], the sun cross logo was taken up by a [[Radical Peasants' Party]], under [[Grigore Iunian]].&lt;ref&gt;See list published alongside N. Papatansiu, "Războiul electoral", in ''[[Realitatea Ilustrată]]'', Issue 569, December 1937, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Antonescu himself set up another group, the (allegedly fascist) League for the Defense of Private Property.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; By the start of World War II, he reemerged as a right-wing critic of the Iron Guard, whom he accused of fomenting violent dissent among his students.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Săndulescu, "Convertiri și reconvertiri: elite academice și culturale și schimbare politică în România anilor 1930–1960", in Cristian Vasile (ed.), ''"Ne trebuie oameni!".

The '''Ministry of Culture''' of Brazil ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Ministério da Cultura, MinC) is a [[Cabinet of Brazil|cabinet]]-level [[federal government of Brazil|federal]] [[list of federal institutions of Brazil|ministry]] created in 1985, in the first month of president's [[José Sarney]] government.

==Dissolution and reinstatement==
In April, 1990, it was dissolved by president [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] and transformed into a Culture Secretary, directly linked to the presidency. This situation was reverted two years later, but, in the meantime, in 1991, the law called popularly ''Lei Rouanet'' was created by the secretary of Culture, Sérgio Paulo Rouanet. It is a law that allows companies and individuals  to sponsor cultural products, up to respectivally 4% and 6% of their income tax. It is a law of incentive to the culture, the most important instrument of the ministry, frequently contested. 

In 1999, president [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] expanded the scope of the law, with more financial resources and a reorganization of its structure. Again, in 2003, president Luís Inácio Lula da Silva reestructured the ministry. 

The Ministry of Culture was dissolved again on May 12, 2016 by the [[acting president]] of [[Brazil]], [[Michel Temer]]. Its functions were merged into a new  Ministry of Education and Culture. The dissolution of the ministry immediately sparked protests in numerous Brazilian cities, and included the occupation of the [[Gustavo Capanema Palace]] in Rio de Janeiro, and [[National Foundation of the Arts]] (FUNARTE) offices in Belo Horizonte, Brasília and São Paulo. Artists such as the singer [[Otto (singer)|Otto]] and [[Arnaldo Antunes]] participated in the protests. The Ministry of Culture was reinstated by the Temer government on May 23, 2016.&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

'''Ministry of Health''' ({{lang-ar|وزارة الصحة}}) is the ministry responsible for the health of the citizens of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The current minister is Dr. [[Tawfiq Al Rabiah]].

==History and profile==
In 1925, Saudi Arabia's first public health department was established in [[Makkah]].&lt;ref name=oracle&gt;{{cite web|title=Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health Detects System Threats and Policy Violations 25% Faster with Fewer Analysts|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/customers/customersearch/moh-1-audit-vault-ss-2145224.html|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department was responsible for building hospitals and healthcare centers and issuing and enforcing regulations to provide necessary standards for practicing [[medicine]] and [[pharmacology]].&lt;ref name=oracle/&gt; A public health council was also established to address the growing need for healthcare services and it was the highest-level supervisory board, overseeing all aspects of the country’s healthcare services.&lt;ref name=oracle/&gt;

Then, these health-care institutions were transformed into a ministerial body in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Long|title=Culture and Customs of Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKisHwiTxJQC&amp;pg=PR15|accessdate=25 January 2014|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32021-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdullah bin Faisal Al Saud]] was the first health minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahmad|first=Mahmoud|title=Abdullah Al-Faisal Passes Away|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/298147|accessdate=25 March 2012|newspaper=Arab News|date=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry is based in [[Riyadh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s-ge.com/de/filefield-private/files/2816/field_blog_public_files/4865 Basic addresses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224033210/http://www.s-ge.com/de/filefield-private/files/2816/field_blog_public_files/4865 |date=24 February 2014 }} OSCE. September 2011. Retrieved 5 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health-care services in Saudi Arabia are provided by several public and private agencies. However, the ministry is the major planner and provider of these services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammed H.

'''Morena Herrera''' is a Salvadoran feminist and social activist, noted for her work against her country's ban on abortion. During the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], which ended in 1992, Herrera served as a left-wing freedom fighter for the [[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) against the United States-supported government. She has been particularly active against abortion since it was abolished in 1997, and in 2009 began working with the Citizen’s Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion, which she now heads. Herrera was named one of the [[BBC 100 Women]] in 2016 for her contributions to women's rights in El Salvador.

She fought for over ten years with the [[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) against the United States-supported government.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/el-salvador-morena-herrera-meet-the-former-marxist-guerrilla-fighting-for-reproductive-rights-in-a-a7119711.html|title= El Salvador: Meet the former Marxist guerrilla fighting for reproductive rights in a country where there are none|publisher=''The Independent''|date=5 July 2016|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrera was outspoken on the Peace Accords, signed in 1992, which she saw as deeply problematic for women's rights in El Salvador. She has said of them: "Those accords left big holes when it came to women’s rights. I realized I had to fight another way. Women’s rights are human rights and they have to be a priority." The situation for women and abortion has worsened since 1997, when changes in the penal code made abortion completely illegal, when it had previously been acceptable in severe cases where a woman's life was at risk or she had been raped.&lt;ref name="Am"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/01/defying-el-salvador-s-total-ban-on-abortion/|title=Defying El Salvador’s total ban on abortion|publisher=Amnesty International|date=15 January 2015|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the country being strictly Catholic, abortion is considered unacceptable, even for pregnant teenage girls who face many problems.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; 

Since the ban on abortion in El Salvador was passed in 1998, over 600 women accused of having an abortion have been sent to jail for up to forty years. The worst part of this unfortunate circumstance is that in most of these cases, the women had a miscarriage. Now they must deal with the sorrow of losing their child while being jailed for a 'crime' they did not commit. "Las 17" is a group of jailed women whose freedom Herrera and her colleagues have fought for. Although a few these women have been freed, despite all the efforts by Herrera and her colleagues, many more women have been convicted and sent to jail for the same crime. Herrera says that the government does not recognize women's reproductive rights, despite the risks a pregnancy places on the mother. Currently, a third of pregnancies in El Salvador come from teenage mothers, this could be partly due to young women being raped by the horrendous gangs that are prominent near San Salvador, the nation's capital. Therefore, these young women are more subject to having pregnancy complications since they are still growing and maturing themselves. Political figures don't want to discard the ban on abortion because they fear the church and certain organizations such as the "Yes to Life Foundation", will not elect them back to office. The idea of 'a woman's sole purpose is to be a mother and take care of the house' is a main one for the church and society of El Salvador, leading to the lack of support for a woman to be in control of her body. To make matters worse, contraception is very hard to obtain for most women and if they do obtain some, it usually does not work properly. Herrera hopes to have make change in the legal rights for women while Salvador Sanchez Céren is still president (until 2019), but while his job and life are on the line facing the gangs and society, the changes towards women's rights has been an incredibly slow process. Despite the plethora of obstacles Herrera still has to overcome and the frequent threats on her life and the life of her family members, she continues to work tediously each day towards a better, consented life for all women in El Salvador. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/el-salvador-morena-herrera-meet-the-former-marxist-guerrilla-fighting-for-reproductive-rights-in-a-a7119711.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/01/defying-el-salvador-s-total-ban-on-abortion/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, Herrera has worked with the Citizen’s Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion, which she now heads.&lt;ref name="Am"/&gt; In 2013 she was outspoken when the [[Supreme Court of El Salvador]] denied an abortion to a terminally ill woman, who stood no chance of surviving the birth, calling them "irresponsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22712756|title=El Salvador court denies seriously ill woman abortion|publisher=BBC|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Her work was subject to a report by [[Amnesty International]] in January 2015,&lt;ref name="Am"/&gt; and in 2016 she was named one of the [[BBC 100 Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-38012048|title=BBC 100 Women 2016: Who is on the list?|publisher=BBC|date=21 November 2016|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nationalization of the [[means of production]] was a measure taken by [[Romania]]'s new [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist]] authorities in order to lay the foundation of socialism. The act that allowed this measure to take place was Law 119, adopted by the [[Great National Assembly]] on June 11, 1948. Article 1 decreed subject to nationalization "all the wealth of the soil not in the property of the state at the time of entry into force of the [[1948 Constitution of Romania|Constitution of the Romanian People's Republic]], as well as individual enterprises, societies of any type and private industrial, bank, insurance, mining, transport and telecommunications associations". Nationalized (generally without any form of compensation) were 8,894 industrial, mining, transport, banking and insurance companies, followed in November 1948 by 383 cinemas and medical-sanitary facilities. By 1950, the measure was applied to chemical enterprises, pharmacies and remaining economic entities.

The nationalization&lt;ref&gt;mostly thanks to Decrees 92/1950, 111/1951, 224/1951, 513/1953, and 409/1955 - [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/legis/legis_pck.htp_act_text?idt=8797 direct link to the 92/1950 decree (Romanian Chamber of Deputies)]&lt;/ref&gt; also included a significant number of homes. The figure of around 400,000 buildings is regularly mentioned. According to Societatea Academică din România (SAR) between 241.000 and 600.000 properties&lt;ref&gt;SAR Brief Policy n°34, September 2008, page 5 : [http://www.sar.org.ro/files/330_Policy%20memo34EN.pdf direct link to the survey]&lt;/ref&gt; were affected by the measure.

The nationalization begun in 1948, together with the [[Collectivization in Romania|collectivization of agriculture]] (1949–62), were decisive in undoing the capitalist economy and establishing a socialist economy based on state-owned or cooperative property.

After the fall of communism in Romania, the state has tried to compensate homeowners and enterprise owners who could not recover their houses, industries, or lands. A special fund dedicated to compensation was created in 2005: [[Fondul Proprietatea]].

The '''Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Socialiştilor din Republica Moldova}}, '''PSRM'''; {{lang-ru|Партия социалистов Республики Молдова}}, ''Partija socialistov Respubliki Moldova'') is a [[Russophilia|pro-Russian]] [[democratic socialist]],&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt;&lt;ref name=scribd/&gt; [[nationalist]] and [[populist]] [[List of political parties in Moldova|political party]] in [[Moldova]]. Between 2005 and 2011 it was known as the Party of Socialists of Moldova "Motherland" (''Partidul Socialiştilor din Moldova «Patria-Rodina»'', PSMPR). The party has now largely succeeded the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] (PCRM) in terms of election results and opinion polling, winning 20.5% against 17.5% in the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2014]] and currently{{When|date=April 2018}} polling at around 50% against PCRM's 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timpul.md/articol/rezultate-sondaj-socio-politic-fop---daca-duminica-ar-avea-loc-alegeri-psrm---503-pas--259-pdm---62-ppda---41-i-pcrm-37-123209.html|publisher=Ziarul Timpul și Fondul Opiniei Publice|language=Moldovan|title=DOC / Rezultatele sondajului socio-politic FOP. Dacă duminică ar avea loc alegeri: PSRM - 50,3%, PAS -25,9%, PDM - 6,2%, PPDA - 4,1 și PCRM 3,7%}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The PSRM was founded in 1997 by members of the [[Socialist Party of Moldova]]. The Founding Congress took place on 29 June 1997 in [[Chişinău]]. Veronica Abramciuc and Eduard Smirnov were elected as co-chairmen of the new party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-democracy.md/parties/psmpr/|title=Partidul Socialiştilor din Republica Moldova (PSRM) / partide.md|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party obtained 0,59% of votes in [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 1998|1998 election]], failing to elect any representative.

In [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2001|2001 election]] the party formed the electoral bloc "Unity", together with the [[Republican Party of Moldova]]: the bloc obtained 0,46% of votes, failing to elect any representative. In 2006 elections the party formed the [[Electoral Bloc Motherland|electoral bloc "Motherland"]], together with the [[Socialist Party of Moldova]]: the bloc obtained 4,9% of votes and did not elect any representatives.

The party did not participate in 2009 and 2010 elections, endorsing the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Party of Communists of Moldova]] (PCRM) instead; party chairman Veronica Abramciuc was included in PCRM list and elected to the Parliament.

In 2011, [[Igor Dodon]], former member of the PCRM, joined the party, and was elected as its chairman on 18 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120802030117/http://www.infoprut.ro/2011/noul-presedinte-al-partidului-socialistilor-este-igor-dodon.html Infoprut.ro]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently a Socialist Group, which included Dodon, Veronica Abramciuc and [[Zinaida Greceanîi]], was set up in the [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regnum.ru/news/fd-abroad/1469079.html&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbkWYaNReUgpwfDLsky3FVTifItg|title="Ãðóïïà Äîäîíà" ñîçäàëà â ïàðëàìåíòå Ìîëäàâèè ôðàêöèþ ñîöèàëèñòîâ|work=ÈÀ REGNUM|accessdate=25 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225152505/http://www.regnum.ru/news/fd-abroad/1469079.html%26usg%3DALkJrhhbkWYaNReUgpwfDLsky3FVTifItg|archivedate=25 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party won the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2014|2014 general election]] with over 20% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; The party remained in opposition, as two pro-EU center-right parties managed to form a [[Minority government|minority]] [[Gaburici Cabinet|cabinet]] with the external support of the PCRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Timuş|first1=Natalia|title=A democratic and European stern test for Moldovan political elite|url=http://whogoverns.eu/a-democratic-and-european-stern-test-for-moldovan-political-elite/|website=Party Systems and Governments Observatory|accessdate=30 March 2015|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Moldovan presidential election, 2016|Moldovan presidential elections of 2016]] party leader Igor Dodon was elected as new President of Moldova. Following the election, Dodon stepped down as party chairman and was replaced by [[Zinaida Greceanîi]].

== Political positions ==
The party has an anti-[[NATO]], anti-[[European Union]], anti-[[Romania|Romanian]], and pro-[[Russia|Russian]] stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/russias-new-moldovan-favorite-igor-dodons-socialist-party/|title=Russia’s New Moldovan Favorite: Igor Dodon’s Socialist Party|last=Socor|first=Vladimir|date=|website=Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timpul.md/articol/psrm-patria-noastra-este-moldova--limba-noastra-este-moldoveneasca--122904.html|title=PSRM: „Patria noastră este Moldova. Limba noastră este moldovenească ”|last=|first=|date=|website=Timpul.md|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Party members have a [[USSR]] nostalgia and support the so-called ″Moldovan language and Moldovan [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]", a thesis constructed by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/438e9bc3-a592-4200-99da-b6b89af0c1dc.pdf|title=The Construction, Deconstruction and Conflict of National Identities in 
Moldova|last=Cojocaru|first=Lee|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the party is anti-Romanian, party members have [[Romania|Romanian]] citizenship, for example members of [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova|Parliament]] [[Alla Dolinţă]], [[Anatolie Labuneţ]], [[Adrian Lebedinschi]], [[Corneliu Furculiţa]], [[Ghenadi Mitriuc]], [[Radu Mudreac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jurnal.md/ro/politic/2018/1/5/doc-deputatii-psrm-cu-pasaport-romanesc-care-acum-jumatate-de-an-ca-au-depus-cereri-sa-li-se-retraga-cetatenia-romana-au-mintit/|title=DOC: Deputaţii PSRM cu paşaport românesc, care acum jumătate de an spuneau că au depus cereri să li se retragă cetăţenia română, au MINŢIT|last=|first=|date=|website=Jurnal.md|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party strongly opposes [[LGBT rights in Moldova]]. Despite officially associating itself with the left wing movement, the party is working with nationalist, right wing and religious movements to counter the "promotion of vice spread with the help of the US in Moldova."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moldova.org/en/lgbt-solidarity-march-held/ LGBT solidarity march in Moldova stopped due to fear of clashes with orthodox counter protesters]&lt;/ref&gt; The party has links to [[right-wing populist]] political parties across Europe, including the [[Europe of Nations and Freedom]] parliamentary group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onPJiMxOZnw ENF Group invited to the new Moldovan president's investiture]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite labeling itself as socialist, PSRM is not affiliated to socialist international organizations, like the [[Socialist International]], the [[Progressive Alliance]] or the [[Party of European Socialists]] (all positions held by the [[Democratic Party of Moldova]]).

==Electoral results==

In the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 legislative elections]] the party contested as part of the [[Electoral Bloc Motherland]] and received 4.97% votes, which was not sufficient to enter parliament, as it did not pass the electoral threshold of 6.0%. At the 2009 legislative elections in [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|April]] and [[Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009|July]] and at the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2010|2010 legislative election]] it supported the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">'''Psychic driving''' was a psychiatric procedure of the 1950s and 1960s in which patients were subjected to a continuously repeated audio message on a looped tape to alter their behaviour. In psychic driving, patients were often exposed to hundreds of thousands of repetitions of a single statement over the course of their treatment. They were also concurrently administered muscular paralytic drugs such as [[curare]] to subdue them for the purposes of exposure to the looped message(s). The procedure was pioneered by [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Dr. D. Ewen Cameron]], and used and funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA's]] [[Project MKUltra]] program in [[Canada]].

==Psychiatry and MKUltra==

The psychic driving procedure was a chronological precursor to Cameron's ''depatterning'', the latter involving massive doses of [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) combined with similarly large doses of [[psychedelic drug]]s (such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]). The intent was to break down the subject's personality—theoretically ''psychic driving'' could then be used with some efficacy in establishing a new personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0010-440X(62)80015-7 |vauthors=Cameron DE, Lohrenz JG, Handcock KA |title=The depatterning treatment of schizophrenia |journal=Compr Psychiatry |date=April 1962 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=65–76 |pmid=13875932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cameron's depatterning, the ECT would often continue to be administered despite the manifestation of convulsive fits, which were consensually considered to be contraindications to normal and safe ECT procedure. Such biologically and psychologically devastating procedures, adopted internationally by the psychiatric establishment, were largely abolished by the time the CIA was brought before a Senate Hearing (1977)&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of the 1977 Senate Hearing can be found [http://glownavy.com/senate%20hearing%201977.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501020528/http://glownavy.com/senate%20hearing%201977.pdf |date=2011-05-01 }}, [http://www.saferchildren.net/print/senate01.pdf here] or [http://prernalal.com/banned%20books/1977%20Senate%20Hearing%20on%20MKULTRA.pdf here]{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its involvement and funding of Cameron's experimental activities&amp;mdash;as part of the MKULTRA program.&lt;ref&gt;For information on the 1977 Court Action against the CIA see: {{cite journal |title=Anatomy of A Public Interest Case Against the CIA |vauthors=Rauh Jr JL, Turner JC |journal=Hamline Journal of Public Law &amp; Policy |year=1990 |volume=11 |page=307 |url=https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=info:WUJ6bgb97PsJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=viewport&amp;pg=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic of Cameron's psychic driving is dealt with in some detail in the docudrama entitled ''[[The Sleep Room (1998 film)|The Sleep Room]]'' (1998) directed by [[Anne Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0138104|The Sleep Room}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==

Similar techniques are alleged to have been used in the kidnapping and death of CIA operative [[William Francis Buckley]] by [[Aziz al-Abub]], a medical doctor from Beirut who was seen as epitomizing medical torture. Aziz al-Abub, also known as Ibrahim al-Nadhir, was known for using his medical training to refine torture techniques. His techniques were shown to be closely connected to the CIA-developed torture techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Journey into Madness: Medical Torture and the Mind Controllers |author=[[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]] |publisher=Bantam Press |date=1988-08-01 |isbn=0593011422}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the CIA, he used drugs to make it easier to handle those he tortured, carefully determined how long to keep a prisoner hooded and when to isolate them and other techniques seen as medical torture.

==In popular culture==

Initially, in the hit [[NBC]] TV series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', [[Dr. Frederick Chilton|Dr. Chilton]] uses psychic driving on a patient of the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Dr. Abel Gideon (played by [[Eddy Izzard]]), to convince him that he is the main antagonist of the series, the Chesapeake ripper. Later in the series psychic driving is alluded to by the main character [[Hannibal Lecter|Dr. Hannibal Lecter]] as a means to convince FBI profiler [[Will Graham (Character)|Will Graham]] that he has committed a string of brutal murders during a bout of encephalitis, to throw him off the trail and keep himself safe. Dr. Lecter uses psychic driving by purposely inducing trance-like states during therapy session, using [[Will Graham (Character)|Will Graham's]] encephalitis, then reinforcing his delusions that he has killed during episodes of lost time where he can't remember his own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjZYDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT329&amp;lpg=PT329&amp;dq=psychic+driving+hannibal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=02qst3vgab&amp;sig=gBilnFmIISNgU0jG0Qm4YdhIqro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwinisOJ2PLaAhXmllQKHS_nCWc4ChDoATABegQIABAt#v=onepage&amp;q=psychic%20driving%20hannibal&amp;f=false|title=Deleuze and the Animal|last=Gardner|first=Colin|date=2017-04-01|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9781474422765|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Race}}
{{Anthropology}}

A '''race''' is a grouping of [[human]]s based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society.{{refn|name=Barnshaw}} First used to refer to speakers of a common [[language]] and then to denote [[nation]]al affiliations, by the 17th century the term ''race'' began to refer to physical ([[phenotypical]]) traits. Modern scholarship regards race as a [[social construct]], that is, a symbolic identity created to establish some cultural meaning. While partially based on physical similarities within groups, race is not an inherent physical or biological quality.{{refn|name=Barnshaw}}{{refn|name=Britannica}}

Social conceptions and [[Racial grouping|groupings of races]] vary over time, involving [[Folk taxonomy|folk taxonomies]]&lt;ref name="montagu"&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Montagu|1962}}
* {{harvnb|Bamshad|Olson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that define [[Wikt:essentiality|essential types]] of individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists consider biological [[essentialism]] obsolete,&lt;ref name="Sober" /&gt; and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.&lt;ref name="Lee, Mountain; et al. 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keita2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keita |last2=Kittles |first2=R A | title=Conceptualizing human variation |journal=Nature Genetics|date=2004|volume=36|issue=11s|pages=S17–S20|doi=10.1038/ng1455|url= http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/box/ng1455_BX1.html|quote=Modern human biological variation is not structured into phylogenetic subspecies ('races'), nor are the taxa of the standard anthropological 'racial' classifications breeding populations.

The clinal, gradually changing nature of geographic genetic difference is complicated further by the migration and mixing that human groups have engaged in since prehistory. Human beings do not fit the zoological definition of race. A mountain of evidence assembled by historians, anthropologists, and biologists proves that race is not and cannot be a natural division of human beings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there is a broad scientific agreement that essentialist and typological conceptualizations of race are untenable, scientists around the world continue to conceptualize race in widely differing ways, some of which have essentialist implications.&lt;ref name="nih10" /&gt; While some researchers use the concept of race to make distinctions among [[fuzzy set]]s of traits or observable differences in behaviour, others in the [[scientific community]] suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive&lt;ref name="Lee, Mountain; et al. 2008" /&gt; or simplistic way,&lt;ref name="Graves 2001" /&gt; and argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same [[species]], [[human|''Homo sapiens'']], and (as far as applicable) [[human subspecies|subspecies]], ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''.&lt;ref name="Keita2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAPA" /&gt;

Since the second half of the 20th century, the association of race with the ideologies and theories of [[scientific racism]] has led to the use of the word ''race'' itself becoming problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/opinion/sunday/should-medicine-discard-race.html|title=Opinion {{!}} What Doctors Should Ignore|date=8 December 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still used in general contexts, ''race'' has often been replaced by less ambiguous and [[Loaded language|loaded]] terms: ''[[populations]]'', ''[[people]](s)'', ''[[ethnic groups]]'', or ''[[communities]]'', depending on context.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dict. race2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/race--2|title=Race&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=5 October 2012|quote='''1.'''

==Defining race==

Modern scholarship views racial categories as [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]], that is, race is not intrinsic to human beings but rather an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] created, often by socially dominant groups, to establish meaning in a social context. This often involves the subjugation of groups defined as racially inferior, as in the [[one-drop rule]] used in the 19th-century United States to exclude those with any amount of African ancestry from the dominant racial grouping, defined as "[[White people|white]]".&lt;ref name="Barnshaw"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnshaw |first=John |editor-last=Schaefer |editor-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society, Volume 1 |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-45-226586-5 |pages=1091–3 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&amp;pg=PT1217&amp;dq=race+social+construction |chapter=Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such racial identities reflect the cultural attitudes of imperial powers dominant during the age of [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]].{{refn|name=Britannica}} This view rejects the notion that race is [[biologically]] defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=Jonathan |title=What it means to be 98% chimpanzee apes, people, and their genes |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |date=2003 |isbn=9780520930766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Templeton |first1=A.

Although commonalities in physical traits such as facial features, skin color, and hair texture comprise part of the race concept, the latter is a social distinction rather than an inherently biological one.{{refn|name=Barnshaw}} Other dimensions of racial groupings include shared history, traditions and language. For instance, [[African-American English]] is a language spoken by many [[African Americans]], especially in areas of the United States where racial segregation exists. Furthermore, people often self-identify as members of a race for political reasons.{{refn|name=Barnshaw}}

When people define and talk about a particular conception of race, they create a [[social reality]] through which social categorization is achieved.&lt;ref name="Lee 1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, races are said to be social constructs.&lt;ref name="Blank; Smaje"&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Blank|Dabady|Citro|2004}}
* {{harvnb|Smaje|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constructs develop within various legal, economic, and [[sociopolitical]] contexts, and may be the effect, rather than the cause, of major social situations.&lt;ref name="Lee; Nobles; Morgan"&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Lee|1997}}
* {{harvnb|Nobles|2000}}
* {{harvnb|Morgan|1975}} as cited in {{harvnb|Lee|1997|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; While race is understood to be a social construct by many, most scholars agree that race has real material effects in the lives of people through [[Institutionalization|institutionalized]] practices of preference and [[discrimination]].

Socioeconomic factors, in combination with early but enduring views of race, have led to considerable suffering within disadvantaged racial groups.&lt;ref name="Morgan; Smedley; et al." /&gt; [[Racial discrimination]] often coincides with racist mindsets, whereby the individuals and ideologies of one group come to perceive the members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] as both racially defined and morally inferior.&lt;ref name="Lee 1997, citing M&amp;A" /&gt; As a result, racial groups possessing relatively little power often find themselves excluded or oppressed, while [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] individuals and [[institution]]s are charged with holding racist attitudes.&lt;ref name="sivanandan" /&gt; Racism has led to many instances of tragedy, including [[slavery]] and [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

In some countries, [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] uses race to [[Offender profiling|profile]] suspects. This use of racial categories is frequently criticized for perpetuating an outmoded understanding of human biological variation, and promoting stereotypes. Because in some societies racial groupings correspond closely with patterns of [[social stratification]], for [[social scientists]] studying social inequality, race can be a significant [[Dependent and independent variables|variable]]. As [[Sociology|sociological]] factors, racial categories may in part reflect [[Subjectivity|subjective]] attributions, [[Self-identity|self-identities]], and social institutions.&lt;ref name="King 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schaefer" /&gt;

Scholars continue to debate the degrees to which racial categories are biologically warranted and socially constructed.&lt;ref name="Brace; Gill; Lee" /&gt; For example, in 2008, John Hartigan, Jr. argued for a view of race that focused primarily on culture, but which does not ignore the potential relevance of biology or genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartigan|first1=John|title=Is Race Still Socially Constructed? The Recent Controversy over Race and Medical Genetics|journal=Science as Culture|date=June 2008|volume=17|issue=2|pages=163–193|doi=10.1080/09505430802062943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the racial [[paradigm]]s employed in different disciplines vary in their emphasis on [[Biological reductionism|biological reduction]] as contrasted with societal construction.

In the social sciences, theoretical frameworks such as [[racial formation theory]] and [[critical race theory]] investigate implications of race as social construction by exploring how the images, ideas and assumptions of race are expressed in everyday life. A large body of scholarship has traced the relationships between the historical, social production of race in legal and criminal language, and their effects on the policing and disproportionate incarceration of certain groups.

Groups of humans have always identified themselves as distinct from neighboring groups, but such differences have not always been understood to be natural, immutable and global. These features are the distinguishing features of how the concept of race is used today. In this way the idea of race as we understand it today came about during the historical process of exploration and conquest which brought Europeans into contact with groups from different continents, and of the ideology of classification and typology found in the natural sciences.&lt;ref name="Marks 2008" /&gt;  The term ''race'' was often used in a general [[Race (biology)|biological taxonomic sense]],&lt;ref name="Oxford Dict. race2" /&gt; starting from the 19th century, to denote [[Genetic divergence|genetically differentiated]] human [[population]]s defined by phenotype.&lt;ref name="Lie; Thompson; et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keita1"/&gt;

===Colonialism===
According to Smedley and Marks the European concept of "race", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the [[scientific revolution]], which introduced and privileged the study of [[natural kind]]s, and the age of [[European imperialism]] and [[colonization]] which established political relations between Europeans and peoples with distinct cultural and political [[traditions]].&lt;ref name="Marks 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smedley 1999" /&gt; As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the [[world]], they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups. The rise of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], which gradually displaced an earlier [[slave trade|trade in slaves]] from throughout the world, created a further [[incentive]] to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of African [[slave]]s.&lt;ref name="meltzer" /&gt;

Drawing on sources from [[classical antiquity]] and upon their own internal interactions&amp;nbsp;– for example, the hostility between the [[English people|English]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] powerfully influenced early European thinking about the differences between people&lt;ref name="takaki" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Europeans began to sort themselves and others into groups based on physical appearance, and to attribute to individuals belonging to these groups behaviors and capacities which were claimed to be deeply ingrained. A set of [[folk belief]]s took hold that linked inherited physical differences between groups to [[Race and intelligence|inherited intellectual]], [[behavioral]], and [[moral]] qualities.&lt;ref name="banton" /&gt; Similar ideas can be found in other cultures,&lt;ref name="Lewis; Dikötter" /&gt; for example in [[China]], where a concept often translated as "race" was associated with supposed common descent from the [[Yellow Emperor]], and used to stress the unity of ethnic groups in China. Brutal conflicts between ethnic groups have existed throughout history and across the world.&lt;ref name="REGWG" /&gt;

===Early taxonomic models===
The first post-[[Graeco-Roman]] published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be [[François Bernier]]'s ''Nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui l'habitent'' ("New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it"), published in 1684.&lt;ref name="todorov" /&gt;  In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the White, European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of [[Carl Linnaeus]], inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human species ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' into continental varieties of ''europaeus'', ''asiaticus'', ''americanus'', and ''afer'', each associated with a different [[humorism|humour]]: [[sanguine]], [[Melancholia|melancholic]], [[choleric]], and [[phlegmatic]], respectively.&lt;ref name="brace2" /&gt;{{sfn|Slotkin|1965|page=177}} ''Homo sapiens europaeus'' was described as active, acute, and adventurous, whereas ''Homo sapiens afer'' was said to be crafty, lazy, and careless.&lt;ref name="Graves 2001 p. 39" /&gt;

The 1775 treatise "The Natural Varieties of Mankind", by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] proposed five major divisions: the [[Caucasoid race]], the [[Mongoloid race]], the Ethiopian race (later termed ''[[Negroid]]''), the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian race]], and the [[Malayan race]], but he did not propose any hierarchy among the races.&lt;ref name="Graves 2001 p. 39" /&gt;  Blumenbach also noted the graded transition in appearances from one group to adjacent groups and suggested that "one variety of mankind does so sensibly pass into the other, that you cannot mark out the limits between them".&lt;ref name="Marks 1995" /&gt;

From the 17th through 19th centuries, the merging of folk beliefs about group differences with scientific explanations of those differences produced what Smedley has called an "[[ideology]] of race".&lt;ref name="Smedley 1999" /&gt; According to this ideology, races are primordial, natural, enduring and distinct. It was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations, but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups.&lt;ref name="REGWG" /&gt; Subsequent influential classifications by [[Georges Buffon]], [[Petrus Camper]] and [[Christoph Meiners]] all classified "Negros" as inferior to Europeans.&lt;ref name="Graves 2001 p. 39" /&gt; In the [[United States]] the racial theories of [[Thomas Jefferson]] were influential. He saw Africans as inferior to Whites especially in regards to their intellect, and imbued with unnatural sexual appetites, but described [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] as equals to whites.&lt;ref name="Graves 2001 pp. 43–43" /&gt;

===Polygenism vs monogenism===
In the last two decades of the 18th century, the theory of [[polygenism]], the belief that different races had evolved separately in each continent and shared no common ancestor,&lt;ref name="stocking" /&gt; was advocated in England by historian [[Edward Long]] and anatomist [[Charles White (physician)|Charles White]], in [[Germany]] by ethnographers [[Christoph Meiners]] and [[Georg Forster]], and in [[France]] by [[Julien-Joseph Virey]]. In the US, [[Samuel George Morton]], [[Josiah Nott]] and [[Louis Agassiz]] promoted this theory in the mid-nineteenth century. Polygenism was popular and most widespread in the 19th century, culminating in the founding of the [[Anthropological Society of London]] (1863), which, during the period of the American Civil War, broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] and its [[monogenism|monogenic stance]], their underlined difference lying, relevantly, in the so-called "Negro question": a substantial racist view by the former,{{r|Hunt1863_3}} and a more liberal view on race by the latter.{{r|Desmond09_332}}

===Models of human evolution===
{{See also|Multiregional hypothesis|Recent single origin hypothesis}}

Today, all [[humans]] are classified as belonging to the species ''Homo sapiens''. However, this is not the first species of [[homininae]]: the first species of genus ''Homo'', ''[[Homo habilis]]'', evolved in East Africa at least 2 million years ago, and members of this species populated different parts of Africa in a relatively short time. ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved more than 1.8 million years ago, and by 1.5 million years ago had spread throughout Europe and Asia. Virtually all [[physical anthropologist]]s agree that ''[[Anatomically modern human|Archaic Homo sapiens]]'' (A group including the possible species ''[[Homo heidelbergensis|H. heidelbergensis]]'', ''H. rhodesiensis'' and ''H. neanderthalensis'') evolved out of African ''Homo erectus'' (''sensu lato'') or ''[[Homo ergaster]].''&lt;ref&gt;Camilo J.

Fifth edition. p. 159. Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists support the idea that [[anatomically modern humans]] (''Homo sapiens'') evolved in North or East Africa from an [[archaic human]] species such as ''H. heidelbergensis'' and then migrated out of Africa, mixing with and replacing ''H. heidelbergensis'' and ''H. neanderthalensis'' populations throughout Europe and Asia, and ''H. rhodesiensis'' populations in Sub-Saharan Africa (a combination of the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa]] and [[Multiregional origin of modern humans|Multiregional]] models).&lt;ref name="StringerSurvivors"&gt;{{Cite book |date=2012 |first=Chris |last=Stringer |title=Lone Survivors: How We Came to Be the Only Humans on Earth |place=London |publisher=Times Books |isbn=978-0805088915 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=January 2013}}

===Biological classification===
{{further|Race (biology)|Species|Subspecies|Systematics|Phylogenetics|Cladistics}}
In the early 20th century, many [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] taught that race was an entirely biologically phenomenon and that this was core to a person's behavior and identity, a position commonly called [[racial essentialism]].&lt;ref name="cravens" /&gt;  This, coupled with a belief that [[linguistics|linguistic]], cultural, and social groups fundamentally existed along racial lines, formed the basis of what is now called [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref name="currell" /&gt; After the [[Nazi eugenics]] program, along with the rise of anti-colonial movements, racial essentialism lost widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirschman|first=Charles|date=2004|title=The Origins and Demise of the Concept of Race|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2004.00021.x/abstract|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=30|issue=3|pages=385–415|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2004.00021.x|issn=1728-4457|accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; New studies of [[culture]] and the fledgling field of [[population genetics]] undermined the scientific standing of racial essentialism, leading race anthropologists to revise their conclusions about the sources of phenotypic variation.&lt;ref name="cravens" /&gt; A significant number of modern anthropologists and [[biology|biologists]] in the West came to view race as an invalid genetic or biological designation.&lt;ref name="Cravens; Angier; et al." /&gt;

The first to challenge the concept of race on empirical grounds were the [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Franz Boas]], who provided evidence of phenotypic plasticity due to environmental factors,&lt;ref name="Smedley; Boas" /&gt; and [[Ashley Montagu]], who relied on evidence from genetics.&lt;ref name="Marks; Montagu" /&gt; [[E. O. Wilson]] then challenged the concept from the perspective of general animal systematics, and further rejected the claim that "races" were equivalent to "subspecies".&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt;

[[Human genetic variation]] is predominantly within races, continuous, and complex in structure, which is inconsistent with the concept of genetic human races.&lt;ref name=goodman&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=A. H.|date=November 2000|title=Why genes don't count (for racial differences in health)|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=90|issue=11|pages=1699–1702|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1446406|pmid=11076233|doi=10.2105/ajph.90.11.1699}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jonathan Marks,&lt;ref name="Marks 2008" /&gt;

{{quote|By the 1970s, it had become clear that (1) most human differences were cultural; (2) what was not cultural was principally polymorphic&amp;nbsp;– that is to say, found in diverse groups of people at different frequencies; (3) what was not cultural or polymorphic was principally clinal&amp;nbsp;– that is to say, gradually variable over geography; and (4) what was left&amp;nbsp;– the component of human diversity that was not cultural, polymorphic, or clinal&amp;nbsp;-was very small.

A consensus consequently developed among anthropologists and geneticists that race as the previous generation had known it&amp;nbsp;– as largely discrete, geographically distinct, gene pools&amp;nbsp;– did not exist.
}}

==== Subspecies ====
[[Race (biology)|The term ''race'' in biology]] is used with caution because it can be ambiguous. Generally, when it is used it is effectively a synonym of ''[[subspecies]]''.&lt;ref name="Keita; Templeton; Long" /&gt; (For animals, the only taxonomic unit below the [[species]] level is usually the subspecies;&lt;ref name="conservation" /&gt; there are narrower [[Infraspecific name|infraspecific ranks in botany]], and ''race'' does not correspond directly with any of them.) Traditionally, [[subspecies]] are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations.&lt;ref name="Templeton 1998" /&gt; Studies of human genetic variation show that human populations are not geographically isolated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Templeton|first=Alan R.|date=1998|title=Human Races: A Genetic and Evolutionary Perspective|jstor=682042|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=100|issue=3|pages=632–650|issn=0002-7294|quote=Genetic surveys and the analyses of DNA haplotype trees show that human "races" are not distinct lineages, and that this is not due to recent admixture; human "races" are not and never were "pure."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their genetic differences are far smaller than those among comparable subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Relethford|first=John H.|date=23 February 2017|title=Biological Anthropology, Population Genetics, and Race|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190236953-e-20|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Race|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.013.20|accessdate=2018-03-27|quote="Human populations do not exhibit the levels of geographic isolation or genetic divergence to fit the subspecies model of race."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Sewall Wright]] suggested that human populations that have long inhabited separated parts of the world should, in general, be considered different subspecies by the criterion that most individuals of such populations can be allocated correctly by inspection. Wright argued that, "It does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of Englishmen, West Africans, and Chinese with 100% accuracy by features, skin color, and type of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every individual can easily be distinguished from every other."&lt;ref name="Wright 1978" /&gt; While in practice subspecies are often defined by easily observable physical appearance, there is not necessarily any evolutionary significance to these observed differences, so this form of classification has become less acceptable to evolutionary biologists.&lt;ref name="Keita; Templeton" /&gt;  Likewise this [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] approach to race is generally regarded as discredited by biologists and anthropologists.

====Ancestrally differentiated populations (clades)====
Some researchers{{Who|date=March 2018}} have tried to clarify the idea of race by equating it to the biological idea of the [[clade]]. A [[clade]] is a taxonomic group of organisms consisting of a single common ancestor and all the descendants of that ancestor (a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] group). Every creature produced by sexual reproduction has two immediate lineages, one maternal and one paternal.&lt;ref name="Anth. News 2006" /&gt; Whereas [[Carl Linnaeus]] established a taxonomy of living organisms based on anatomical similarities and differences, [[cladistics]] seeks to establish a taxonomy&amp;nbsp;– the [[phylogenetic tree]]&amp;nbsp;– based on genetic similarities and differences and tracing the process of acquisition of multiple characteristics by single organisms.

Philosopher Robin Andreasen (2000) proposes that cladistics can be used to categorize human races biologically, and that races can be both biologically real and socially constructed.&lt;ref name="Andreasen 2000" /&gt; Andreasen cites tree diagrams of relative [[genetic distance]]s among populations published by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Luigi Cavalli-Sforza]] as the basis for a phylogenetic tree of human races: "Cavalli-Sforza's research illustrates that it is possible to reconstruct human evolutionary history, and this means that it is possible to provide a cladistic definition of race" (p. S661). Evolutionary biologist Alan Templeton (2013) argues that while "Much of the recent scientific literature on human evolution portrays human populations as separate branches on an evolutionary tree," multiple lines of evidence falsify a phylogenetic tree structure, and confirm the presence of gene flow among populations.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Jonathan Marks (2008) argues that Andreasen has misinterpreted the genetic literature: "These trees are phenetic (based on similarity), rather than cladistic (based on based on monophyletic descent, that is from a series of unique ancestors)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marks|2008}}, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Marks, Templeton, and Cavalli-Sforza all conclude that genetics does not provide evidence of human races.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marks|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists Lieberman and Jackson (1995) also critique the use of cladistics to support concepts of race. They claim that "the molecular and biochemical proponents of this model explicitly use racial categories ''in their initial grouping of samples''". For example, the large and highly diverse macroethnic groups of East Indians, North Africans, and Europeans are presumptively grouped as Caucasians prior to the analysis of their DNA variation. This is claimed to limit and skew interpretations, obscure other lineage relationships, deemphasize the impact of more immediate clinal environmental factors on genomic diversity, and can cloud our understanding of the true patterns of affinity. They suggest that the authors of these studies find support for racial distinctions only because they began by assuming the validity of race. "For empirical reasons we prefer to place emphasis on clinal variation, which recognizes the existence of adaptive human hereditary variation and simultaneously stresses that such variation is not found in packages that can be labeled ''races''."&lt;ref name="Lieberman 1995" /&gt;

Human population groups are not monophyletic, as there appears to always have been considerable gene flow between human populations.&lt;ref name="Templeton 1998" /&gt; Keith Hunley, Graciela Cabana, and Jeffrey Long analyzed the [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] sample of 1,037 individuals in 52 populations.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hunley|first1=Keith L.|last2=Cabana|first2=Graciela S.|last3=Long|first3=Jeffrey C.|date=1 December 2015|title=The apportionment of human diversity revisited|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.22899/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=160|pages=561–569|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22899|issn=1096-8644|pmid=26619959|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that non-African populations are a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] subgroup of African populations, that "some African populations are equally related to other African populations and to non-African populations," and that "outside of Africa, regional groupings of populations are nested inside one another, and many of them are not monophyletic."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Rachel Caspari (2003) has argued that since no groups currently regarded as races are monophyletic, none of those groups can be clades.

==== Morphologically differentiated populations ====
Population geneticists have debated whether the concept of ''population'' can provide a basis for a new conception of race. To do this, a working definition of population must be found. Surprisingly, there is no generally accepted concept of population that biologists use. Although the concept of population is central to ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation biology, most definitions of population rely on qualitative descriptions such as "a group of organisms of the same species occupying a particular space at a particular time".&lt;ref name="waples" /&gt; Waples and Gaggiotti identify two broad types of definitions for populations; those that fall into an ''ecological paradigm'', and those that fall into an ''evolutionary paradigm''. Examples of such definitions are:
* ''Ecological paradigm'': A group of individuals of the same species that co-occur in space and time and have an opportunity to interact with each other.
* ''Evolutionary paradigm'': A group of individuals of the same species living in close-enough proximity that any member of the group can potentially mate with any other member.&lt;ref name="waples" /&gt;

Sesardic argues that when several traits are analyzed at the same time, [[Forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] can classify a person's race with an accuracy of close to 100% based on only skeletal remains.&lt;ref name="Sesardic 2010" /&gt; Sesardic's claim has been disputed by [[Massimo Pigliucci]], who accused Sesardic of "cherry pick[ing] the scientific evidence and reach[ing] conclusions that are contradicted by it." Specifically, Pigliucci argues that Sesardic misrepresented a paper by Ousley et al. (2009), and neglected to mention that they identified differentiation not just between individuals from different races, but also between individuals from different tribes, local environments, and time periods.&lt;ref name="Pigliucci 2013"/&gt; This is discussed in a later section.&lt;!--needs work. "accuracy close to 100%" is meaningless without identifying what definition of race is used to match remains up to--&gt;

=====Clines=====
One crucial innovation in reconceptualizing genotypic and phenotypic variation was the anthropologist [[C. Loring Brace]]'s observation that such variations, insofar as it is affected by [[natural selection]], slow migration, or [[genetic drift]], are distributed along geographic gradations or [[cline (biology)|clines]].&lt;ref name="Brace 1964" /&gt; For example, with respect to skin color in Europe and Africa, Brace writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;To this day, skin color grades by imperceptible means from Europe southward around the eastern end of the Mediterranean and up the Nile into Africa. From one end of this range to the other, there is no hint of a skin color boundary, and yet the spectrum runs from the lightest in the world at the northern edge to as dark as it is possible for humans to be at the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution in an Anthropological View|last=Brace|first=C. Loring|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=|isbn=978-0-7425-0263-5|location=|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In part this is due to [[isolation by distance]]. This point called attention to a problem common to phenotype-based descriptions of races (for example, those based on hair texture and skin color): they ignore a host of other similarities and differences (for example, blood type) that do not correlate highly with the markers for race. Thus, anthropologist Frank Livingstone's conclusion, that since clines cross racial boundaries, "there are no races, only clines".&lt;ref name="Livingstone" /&gt;

In a response to Livingstone, [[Theodore Dobzhansky]] argued that when talking about race one must be attentive to how the term is being used: "I agree with Dr. Livingstone that if races have to be 'discrete units', then there are no races, and if 'race' is used as an 'explanation' of the human variability, rather than vice versa, then the explanation is invalid." He further argued that one could use the term race if one distinguished between "race differences" and "the race concept". The former refers to any distinction in gene frequencies between populations; the latter is "a matter of judgment". He further observed that even when there is clinal variation, "Race differences are objectively ascertainable biological phenomena&amp;nbsp;... but it does not follow that racially distinct populations must be given racial (or subspecific) labels."&lt;ref name="Livingstone" /&gt; In short, Livingstone and Dobzhansky agree that there are genetic differences among human beings; they also agree that the use of the race concept to classify people, and how the race concept is used, is a matter of social convention. They differ on whether the race concept remains a meaningful and useful social convention.

In 1964, the biologists Paul Ehrlich and Holm pointed out cases where two or more clines are distributed discordantly&amp;nbsp;– for example, melanin is distributed in a decreasing pattern from the equator north and south; frequencies for the haplotype for [[HBB#Sickle cell disease|beta-S hemoglobin]], on the other hand, radiate out of specific geographical points in Africa.&lt;ref name="ehrlich" /&gt; As the anthropologists Leonard Lieberman and Fatimah Linda Jackson observed, "Discordant patterns of heterogeneity falsify any description of a population as if it were genotypically or even phenotypically homogeneous".&lt;ref name="Lieberman 1995" /&gt;

Patterns such as those seen in human physical and genetic variation as described above, have led to the consequence that the number and geographic location of any described races is highly dependent on the importance attributed to, and quantity of, the traits considered. Scientists discovered a skin-lighting mutation that partially accounts for the appearance of Light skin in humans (people who migrated out of Africa northward into what is now Europe) which they estimate occurred 20,000 to 50,000 years ago. The East Asians owe their relatively light skin to different mutations.&lt;ref name="weiss" /&gt; On the other hand, the greater the number of traits (or [[allele]]s) considered, the more subdivisions of humanity are detected, since traits and gene frequencies do not always correspond to the same geographical location. Or as {{harvtxt|Ossorio|Duster| 2005}} put it:{{quote|1=Anthropologists long ago discovered that humans' physical traits vary gradually, with groups that are close geographic neighbors being more similar than groups that are geographically separated. This pattern of variation, known as clinal variation, is also observed for many alleles that vary from one human group to another. Another observation is that traits or alleles that vary from one group to another do not vary at the same rate. This pattern is referred to as nonconcordant variation. Because the variation of physical traits is clinal and nonconcordant, anthropologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries discovered that the more traits and the more human groups they measured, the fewer discrete differences they observed among races and the more categories they had to create to classify human beings. The number of races observed expanded to the 1930s and 1950s, and eventually anthropologists concluded that there were no discrete races.&lt;ref name="Marks 2002" /&gt; Twentieth and 21st century biomedical researchers have discovered this same feature when evaluating human variation at the level of alleles and allele frequencies. Nature has not created four or five distinct, nonoverlapping genetic groups of people.}}

====Genetically differentiated populations====
{{main|Race and genetics|Human genetic variation}}
Another way to look at differences between populations is to measure genetic differences rather than physical differences between groups. The mid-20th-century anthropologist [[William C. Boyd]] defined race as: "A population which differs significantly from other populations in regard to the frequency of one or more of the genes it possesses. It is an arbitrary matter which, and how many, gene loci we choose to consider as a significant 'constellation'".&lt;ref name="boyd" /&gt; Leonard Lieberman and Rodney Kirk have pointed out that "the paramount weakness of this statement is that if one gene can distinguish races then the number of races is as numerous as the number of human couples reproducing."&lt;ref name="lieberman" /&gt; Moreover, the anthropologist Stephen Molnar has suggested that the discordance of clines inevitably results in a multiplication of races that renders the concept itself useless.&lt;ref name="molnar" /&gt; The [[Human Genome Project]] states "People who have lived in the same geographic region for many generations may have some alleles in common, but no allele will be found in all members of one population and in no members of any other."&lt;ref name="project" /&gt; [[Massimo Pigliucci]] and Jonathan Kaplan argue that human races do exist, and that they correspond to the genetic classification of [[ecotype]]s, but that real human races do not correspond very much, if at all, to folk racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pigliucci|first1=Massimo|last2=Kaplan|first2=Jonathan|title=On the Concept of Biological Race and Its Applicability to Humans|journal=Philosophy of Science|date=December 2003|volume=70|issue=5|pages=1161–1172|doi=10.1086/377397}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Walsh &amp; Yun reviewed the literature in 2011 and reported that "Genetic studies using very few chromosomal loci find that genetic polymorphisms divide human populations into clusters with almost 100 percent accuracy and that they correspond to the traditional anthropological categories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=Anthony|last2=Yun|first2=Ilhong|title=Race and Criminology in the Age of Genomic Science|journal=Social Science Quarterly|pages=n/a|date=October 2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00818.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some biologists argue that racial categories correlate with biological traits (e.g. [[phenotype]]), and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations, some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings. For this reason, there is no current consensus about whether racial categories can be considered to have significance for understanding human genetic variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bamshad |first1=M. |last2=Wooding |first2=S. |last3=Salisbury |first3=B.

===== Distribution of genetic variation =====
The distribution of genetic variants within and among human populations are impossible to describe succinctly because of the difficulty of defining a population, the clinal nature of variation, and heterogeneity across the genome (Long and Kittles 2003). In general, however, an average of 85% of statistical genetic variation exists within local populations, ~7% is between local populations within the same continent, and ~8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents.&lt;ref&gt;Lewontin 1972; Jorde ''et al.'' 2000a&lt;/ref&gt; The [[recent African origin]] theory for humans would predict that in Africa there exists a great deal more diversity than elsewhere and that diversity should decrease the further from Africa a population is sampled. Hence, the 85% average figure is misleading: Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 60% of human genetic diversity exists in the least diverse population they analyzed (the Surui, a population derived from New Guinea).&lt;ref name="LongKittles2"&gt;[[Race (human categorization)#CITEREFLongKittles2003|Long &amp;#x26; Kittles 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis that takes this difference into account confirms previous findings that, "Western-based racial classifications have no taxonomic significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hunley|first1=Keith L.|last2=Cabana|first2=Graciela S.|last3=Long|first3=Jeffrey C.|date=1 December 2015|title=The apportionment of human diversity revisited|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.22899/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=|pages=–|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22899|issn=1096-8644|accessdate=2016-01-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study of random biallelic genetic loci found little to no evidence that humans were divided into distinct biological groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Romualdi |first=Chiara |last2=Balding |first2=David |last3=Nasidze |first3=Ivane S. |last4=Risch |first4=Gregory |last5=Robichaux |first5=Myles |last6=Sherry |first6=Stephen T. |last7=Stoneking |first7=Mark |last8=Batzer |first8=Mark A. |last9=Barbujani |first9=Guido |date=April 2002 |title=Patterns of human diversity, within and among continents, inferred from biallelic DNA polymorphisms  |journal=Genome Research |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=602–612 |doi=10.1101/gr.214902 |issn=1088-9051 |pmid=11932244 |pmc=187513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2003 paper, "[[Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy]]", [[A. W. F. Edwards]] argued that rather than using a locus-by-locus analysis of variation to derive taxonomy, it is possible to construct a human classification system based on characteristic genetic patterns, or ''clusters'' [[Race and genetics#Genetic variation is structured by geographic origin|inferred from multilocus genetic data]].&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins &amp; Wong"/&gt; Geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic clusters can be derived from analyzing of a large number of loci which can assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental racial groups.&lt;ref name="Harpending; et al." /&gt; Joanna Mountain and [[Neil Risch]] cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between groups, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and [[complex traits]] remains poorly understood.&lt;ref name="mountain" /&gt; However, Risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless: "Perhaps just using someone's actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age. Does that mean we should throw it out? ... Any category you come up with is going to be imperfect, but that doesn't preclude you from using it or the fact that it has utility."&lt;ref name="gitschier" /&gt;

Early human genetic cluster analysis studies were conducted with samples taken from ancestral population groups living at extreme geographic distances from each other. It was thought that such large geographic distances would maximize the genetic variation between the groups sampled in the analysis, and thus maximize the probability of finding cluster patterns unique to each group. In light of the historically recent acceleration of human migration (and correspondingly, human gene flow) on a global scale, further studies were conducted to judge the degree to which genetic cluster analysis can pattern ancestrally identified groups as well as geographically separated groups. One such study looked at a large multiethnic population in the United States, and "detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race/ethnicity group. Thus, ancient geographic ancestry, which is highly correlated with self-identified race/ethnicity&amp;nbsp;– as opposed to current residence&amp;nbsp;– is the major determinant of genetic structure in the U.S. population." ({{harvtxt|Tang|Quertermous|Rodriguez|Kardia|2005}})

{{harvtxt|Witherspoon|Wooding|Rogers|Marchani|2007}} have argued that even when individuals can be reliably assigned to specific population groups, it may still be possible for two randomly chosen individuals from different populations/clusters to be more similar to each other than to a randomly chosen member of their own cluster. They found that many thousands of genetic markers had to be used in order for the answer to the question "How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?" to be "never". This assumed three population groups separated by large geographic ranges (European, African and East Asian). The entire world population is much more complex and studying an increasing number of groups would require an increasing number of markers for the same answer. The authors conclude that "caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes."&lt;ref name="Witherspoon, et al. 2007" /&gt; Witherspoon, et al. concluded that, "The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them. It is also compatible with our ﬁnding that, even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used, individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population."&lt;ref name="Witherspoon, et al. 2007" /&gt;

Prisoners of Abstraction? The Theory and Measure of Genetic Variation, and the Very Concept of 'Race' ''Biological Theory'' http://philpapers.org/archive/KAPPOA.14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the geneticist [[Joseph L. Graves|Joseph Graves]],&lt;ref name="Graves 2001" /&gt; have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as "continental races", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials.&lt;ref name="evolutionary" /&gt; Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one [[Lumpers and splitters|wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers)]]. Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998&lt;ref&gt;Mills CW (1988) "But What Are You Really? The Metaphysics of Race" in ''Blackness visible: essays on philosophy and race'', pp. 41–66. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt;) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In earlier work, Winther had identified "diversity partitioning" and "clustering analysis" as two separate methodologies, with distinct questions, assumptions, and protocols.  Each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences vis-a-vis the metaphysics of race.&lt;ref&gt;Winther, Rasmus Grønfeldt (2014/2011). The Genetic Reification of Race? A Story of Two Mathematical Methods. ''Critical Philosophy of Race'' http://philpapers.org/archive/WINTGR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Lisa Gannett has argued that [[biogeographical ancestry]], a concept devised by [[Mark Shriver]] and [[Tony Frudakis]], is not an objective measure of the biological aspects of race as Shriver and Frudakis claim it is. She argues that it is actually just a "local category shaped by the U.S. context of its production, especially the forensic aim of being able to predict the race or ethnicity of an unknown suspect based on DNA found at the crime scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gannett|first1=Lisa|title=Biogeographical ancestry and race|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|date=September 2014|volume=47|pages=173–84|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2014.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Clines and clusters in genetic variation =====
Recent studies of [[human genetic clustering]] have included a debate over how genetic variation is organized, with clusters and clines as the main possible orderings. {{harvtxt|Serre|Pääbo| 2004}} argued for smooth, clinal genetic variation in ancestral populations even in regions previously considered racially homogeneous, with the apparent gaps turning out to be artifacts of sampling techniques. {{harvtxt|Rosenberg|Mahajan|Ramachandran|Zhao|2005}} disputed this and offered an analysis of the Human Genetic Diversity Panel showing that there were small discontinuities in the smooth genetic variation for ancestral populations at the location of geographic barriers such as the [[Sahara]], the Oceans, and the [[Himalayas]]. Nonetheless, {{harvtxt|Rosenberg|Mahajan|Ramachandran|Zhao|2005}} stated that their findings “should not be taken as evidence of our support of any particular concept of biological race... Genetic differences among human populations derive mainly from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive 'diagnostic' genotypes." Using a sample of 40 populations distributed roughly evenly across the Earth's land surface, {{harvtxt|Xing|et. al.|2010|p=208}} found that "genetic diversity is distributed in a more clinal pattern when more geographically intermediate populations are sampled."

[[Guido Barbujani]] has written that human genetic variation is generally distributed continuously in gradients across much of Earth, and that there is no evidence that genetic boundaries between human populations exist as would be necessary for human races to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Barbujani|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, human genetic variation has formed a nested structure that is inconsistent with the concept of races that have evolved independently of one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunley|first1=Keith L.|last2=Healy|first2=Meghan E.|last3=Long|first3=Jeffrey C.|date=18 February 2009|title=The global pattern of gene identity variation reveals a history of long-range migrations, bottlenecks, and local mate exchange: Implications for biological race|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=139|issue=1|pages=35–46|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20932|pmid=19226641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social constructions===
{{Main|Race and society|Racialism}}

As anthropologists and other evolutionary scientists have shifted away from the language of race to the term ''population'' to talk about genetic differences, [[History|historians]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] and other [[social sciences|social scientists]] re-conceptualized the term "race" as a cultural category or [[social construct]], i.e., a way among many possible ways in which  a society chooses to divide its members into categories.

Many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word "[[Ethnic group#Ethnicity and race|ethnicity]]" to refer to self-identifying groups based on beliefs concerning shared culture, ancestry and history.{{dubious|date=October 2016}} Alongside empirical and conceptual problems with "race", following the [[Second World War]], evolutionary and social scientists were acutely aware of how beliefs about race had been used to justify discrimination, apartheid, slavery, and genocide. This questioning gained momentum in the 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States and the emergence of numerous anti-colonial movements worldwide. They thus came to believe that race itself is a [[Social construction|social construct]], a concept that was believed to correspond to an objective reality but which was believed in because of its social functions.&lt;ref name="Gordon 1964" /&gt;

Craig Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institute of Health jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000. Upon examining the data from the genome mapping, Venter realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1–3% (instead of the previously assumed 1%), the types of variations do not support notion of genetically defined races. Venter said, "Race is a social concept. It's not a scientific one. There are no bright lines (that would stand out), if we could compare all the sequenced genomes of everyone on the planet." "When we try to apply science to try to sort out these social differences, it all falls apart."&lt;ref name="FORA.tv 2008" /&gt;

Stephan Palmié asserted that race "is not a thing but a social relation";&lt;ref name="Palmie 2007" /&gt; or, in the words of [[Katya Gibel Mevorach]], "a metonym", "a human invention whose criteria for differentiation are neither universal nor fixed but have always been used to manage difference."&lt;ref name="Mevorach 2007" /&gt; As such, the use of the term "race" itself must be analyzed. Moreover, they argue that biology will not explain why or how people use the idea of race: History and social relationships will.

[[Imani Perry]] has argued that race "is produced by social arrangements and political decision making."&lt;ref&gt;Imani Perry, More Beautiful and More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2011), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perry explains race more in stating, "race is something that happens, rather than something that is. It is dynamic, but it holds no objective truth."&lt;ref&gt;Imani Perry, More Beautiful and More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2011), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have challenged the notion that race is primarily a social construction by arguing that race has a biological basis.&lt;ref name="Tang2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tang|first1=H. |last2=Quertermous|first2=T. |last3=Rodriguez|first3=B. |title=Genetic Structure, Self-Identified Race/Ethnicity, and Confounding in Case-Control Association Studies |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=268–75 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15625622 |pmc=1196372 |doi=10.1086/427888|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the researchers, [[Neil Risch]], noted: "we looked at the correlation between genetic structure [based on microsatellite markers] versus self-description, we found 99.9% concordance between the two. We actually had a higher discordance rate between self-reported sex and markers on the X chromosome! So you could argue that sex is also a problematic category. And there are differences between sex and gender; self-identification may not be correlated with biology perfectly. And there is sexism."&lt;ref name="Gitschier2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Risch |first=N. |title=The whole side of it&amp;nbsp;– an interview with Neil Risch by Jane Gitschier |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=e14 |date=July 2005 |pmid=17411332 |pmc=1183530 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
{{Main|Race in Brazil}}
[[File:Redenção.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Portrait "Redenção de Cam" (1895), showing a Brazilian family becoming "whiter" each generation.]]
Compared to 19th-century United States, 20th-century [[Demographics of Brazil|Brazil]] was characterized by a perceived relative absence of sharply defined racial groups. According to anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], this pattern reflects a different history and different [[social relations]].

Basically, race in Brazil was "biologized", but in a way that recognized the difference between ancestry (which determines [[genotype]]) and [[phenotypic]] differences. There, racial identity was not governed by rigid descent rule, such as the [[one-drop rule]], as it was in the United States. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only a very limited number of categories to choose from,&lt;ref name="Harris 1980" /&gt; to the extent that full [[sibling]]s can pertain to different racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=140919 | pmid=12509516 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0126614100 | volume=100 | issue=1 | title=Color and genomic ancestry in Brazilians | date=January 2003 | journal=Proc.

Over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with all the possible combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred preferentially to appearance, not heredity, and appearance is a poor indication of ancestry, because only a few genes are responsible for someone's skin color and traits: a person who is considered white may have more African ancestry than a person who is considered black, and the reverse can be also true about European ancestry.&lt;ref name="BBC delves into Brazilians' roots"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6284806.stm BBC delves into Brazilians' roots] accessed 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil reflects the extent of [[miscegenation]] in [[Brazilian society]], a society that remains highly, but not strictly, [[social stratification|stratified]] along color lines. These [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic]] factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines, because a minority of ''[[pardo]]s'', or brown people, are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward,&lt;ref&gt;RIBEIRO, Darcy. O Povo Brasileiro, Companhia de Bolso, fourth reprint, 2008 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and being seen as relatively "whiter" as their perceived social status increases (much as in other regions of Latin America).&lt;ref&gt;Levine-Rasky, Cynthia. 2002. "Working through whiteness: international perspectives. SUNY Press (p. 73) "Money whitens" If any phrase encapsulates the association of whiteness and the modern in Latin America, this is it. It is a cliché formulated and reformulated throughout the region, a truism dependant upon the social experience that wealth is associated with whiteness, and that in obtaining the former one may become aligned with the latter (and vice versa)"."&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluidity of racial categories aside, the "biologification" of race in Brazil referred above would match contemporary concepts of race in the United States quite closely, though, if Brazilians are supposed to choose their race as one among, Asian and Indigenous apart, three IBGE's census categories. While assimilated [[Amerindians]] and people with very high quantities of Amerindian ancestry are usually grouped as ''[[caboclo]]s'', a subgroup of ''pardos'' which roughly translates as both [[mestizo]] and [[hillbilly]], for those of lower quantity of Amerindian descent a higher European genetic contribution is expected to be grouped as a ''pardo''. In several genetic tests, people with less than 60-65% of European descent and 5–10% of Amerindian descent usually cluster with [[Afro-Brazilian]]s (as reported by the individuals), or 6.9% of the population, and those with about 45% or more of Subsaharan contribution most times do so (in average, Afro-Brazilian DNA was reported to be about 50% Subsaharan African, 37% European and 13% Amerindian).&lt;ref name="plosone.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afrobras"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101124105905/http://www.afrobras.org.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2112&amp;Itemid=2 Negros de origem européia]. afrobras.org.br&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetic signatures of parental contribution in black and white populations in Brazil |doi=10.1590/S1415-47572009005000001|date=2009|last1=Guerreiro-Junior|first1=Vanderlei|last2=Bisso-Machado|first2=Rafael|last3=Marrero|first3=Andrea|last4=Hünemeier|first4=Tábita|last5=Salzano|first5=Francisco M.|last6=Bortolini|first6=Maria Cátira|journal=Genetics and Molecular Biology|volume=32|pages=1–11|pmid=21637639|issue=1|pmc=3032968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetic heritage variability of Brazilians in even regional averages, 2009 study |doi=10.1590/S0100-879X2009005000026|date=2009|last1=Pena|first1=S.D.J.|last2=Bastos-Rodrigues|first2=L.|last3=Pimenta|first3=J.R.|last4=Bydlowski|first4=S.P.|journal=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research|volume=42|issue=10|pages=870–876|pmid=19738982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a more consistent report with the genetic groups in the gradation of miscegenation is to be considered (e.g. that would not cluster people with a balanced degree of African and non-African ancestry in the black group instead of the multiracial one, unlike elsewhere in Latin America where people of high quantity of African descent tend to classify themselves as mixed), more people would report themselves as white and ''pardo'' in Brazil (47.7% and 42.4% of the population as of 2010, respectively), because by research its population is believed to have between 65 and 80% of autosomal European ancestry, in average (also &gt;35% of European mt-DNA and &gt;95% of European Y-DNA).&lt;ref name="plosone.org"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017063 |title=The Genomic Ancestry of Individuals from Different Geographical Regions of Brazil Is More Uniform Than Expected |date=2011 |first1=Sérgio D.

From the last decades of the [[Empire of Brazil|Empire]] until the 1950s, the proportion of the white population increased significantly while Brazil welcomed 5.5 million immigrants between 1821 and 1932, not much behind its neighbor Argentina with 6.4 million,&lt;ref name="whitaker"&gt;''Argentina''. by Arthur P.

====European Union====
According to [[European Council]]:
{{quote|The European Union rejects theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.|''Directive 2000/43/EC''&lt;ref name="Council Directive 2000/43/EC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Council of the European Union |author-link=European Council |title=Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin |work=Official Journal |publisher=[[European Union]] |date=19 July 2000&lt;!--date of actual publication--&gt; |pp=22–26 |id=CELEX: 32000L0043 |url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0043:en:HTML |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[European Union]] uses the terms racial origin and ethnic origin synonymously in its documents and according to it "the use of the term 'racial origin' in this directive does not imply an acceptance of such [racial] theories".&lt;ref name="Council Directive 2000/43/EC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrights.is/human-rights-and-iceland/equality--non-discrimination/ |title=European Union Directives on the Prohibition of Discrimination |work=HumanRights.is |publisher=Icelandic Human Rights Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724051826/http://www.humanrights.is/human-rights-and-iceland/equality--non-discrimination |archivedate=24 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}} Haney López warns that using "race" as a category within the law tends to legitimize its existence in the popular imagination. In the diverse geographic context of [[Europe]], ethnicity and ethnic origin are arguably more resonant and are less encumbered by the ideological baggage associated with "race". In European context, historical resonance of "race" underscores its problematic nature. In some states, it is strongly associated with laws promulgated by the [[Nazi]] and [[Fascist]] governments in Europe during the 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, in 1996, the [[European Parliament]] adopted a resolution stating that "the term should therefore be avoided in all official texts".&lt;ref name="fds.oup.com"&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Bell |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/13/9780199297849_chapter1.pdf |title=Racism and Equality in the European Union |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2009 |isbn=9780199297849 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297849.001.0001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202235619/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/13/9780199297849_chapter1.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of racial origin relies on the notion that human beings can be separated into biologically distinct "races", an idea generally rejected by the scientific community. Since all human beings belong to the same species, the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance|ECRI]] (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) rejects theories based on the existence of different "races". However, in its Recommendation ECRI uses this term in order to ensure that those persons who are generally and erroneously perceived as belonging to "another race" are not excluded from the protection provided for by the legislation. The law claims to reject the existence of "race", yet penalize situations where someone is treated less favourably on this ground.&lt;ref name="fds.oup.com" /&gt;

====France====
Since the end of the Second World War, [[France]] has become an ethnically diverse country. Today, approximately five percent of the French population is non-European and non-white. This does not approach the number of non-white citizens in the United States (roughly 28–37%, depending on how Latinos are classified (see [[Demographics of the United States]]). Nevertheless, it amounts to at least three million people, and has forced the issues of ethnic diversity onto the French policy agenda. France has developed an approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of many advanced, industrialized countries. Unlike the United States, Britain, or even the Netherlands, France maintains a "[[Color blind (race)|color-blind]]" model of public policy. This means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic groups. Instead, it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of social inequalities. It has, however, developed an extensive anti-racist policy repertoire since the early 1970s. Until recently, French policies focused primarily on issues of hate speech&amp;nbsp;– going much further than their American counterparts&amp;nbsp;– and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs, housing, and in provision of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2001/05/france-bleich Race Policy in France] by Erik Bleich, Middlebury College, 2012-05-01&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Race and ethnicity in the United States}}
{{See also|Miscegenation#Admixture in the United States|Historical racial and ethnic demographics of the United States}}

In the United States, there is disagreement on the nature of race within the biological sciences, whereas the social constructionist view is dominant in the social sciences; over time, biological views on race have become more controversial across all disciplines, with clear divides along generational, cultural, and racial lines.&lt;ref name="morning"&gt;{{cite book |title=How Scientists Think and Teach about Human Difference |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zXc1lgMQoQkC |publisher=University of California Press |last=Morning |first=Ann |date=2011 |pages=47 |isbn=9780520950146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immigrants to the [[Americas]] came from every region of Europe, Africa, and Asia. They [[miscegenation|mixed]] among themselves and with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous inhabitants of the continent]]. In the [[United States]] most people who self-identify as [[African American|African–American]] have some [[European ethnic groups|European ancestors]], while many people who identify as [[European American]] have some African or Amerindian ancestors.

Since the early history of the United States, Amerindians, African–Americans, and European Americans have been classified as belonging to different races. Efforts to track mixing between groups led to a proliferation of categories, such as [[mulatto]] and [[octoroon]]. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with "[[one-drop theory|one drop]]" of known "Black blood" to be Black, regardless of appearance. By the early 20th century, this notion was made statutory in many states. [[Amerindians]] continue to be defined by a certain percentage of "Indian blood" (called ''[[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]]''). To be White one had to have perceived "pure" White ancestry. The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African ancestry.  This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible African ancestry were defined as black.  The one-drop rule is specific to not only those with African ancestry but to the United States, making it a particularly African-American experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sexton|first=Jared|title=Amalgamation Schemes|date=2008|publisher=Univ of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Census|decennial censuses]] conducted since 1790 in the United States created an incentive to establish racial categories and fit people into these categories.&lt;ref name="nobles" /&gt;

The term "[[Hispanic]]" as an [[ethnonym]] emerged in the 20th century with the rise of migration of laborers from the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]] of [[Latin America]] to the United States. Today, the word "Latino" is often used as a synonym for "Hispanic". The definitions of both terms are non-race specific, and include people who consider themselves to be of distinct races (Black, White, Amerindian, Asian, and mixed groups).&lt;ref name="OMB 1997" /&gt; However, there is a common misconception in the US that Hispanic/Latino is a race&lt;ref&gt;Horsman, Reginald, ''Race and Manifest Destiny: The Origins of American Radial Anglo-Saxonism'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts,  1981 p. 210.  This reference is speaking in historic terms bt there is not reason to think that this perception has altered much&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes even that national origins such as Mexican, Cuban, Colombian, Salvadoran, etc. are races. In contrast to "Latino" or "Hispanic", "[[Anglo]]" refers to non-Hispanic [[White American]]s or non-Hispanic [[European American]]s, most of whom speak the English language but are not necessarily of [[English people|English]] descent.

==Views across disciplines over time==
One result of debates over the meaning and validity of the concept of race is that the current literature across different disciplines regarding human variation lacks [[scientific consensus|consensus]], though within some fields, such as some branches of anthropology, there is strong consensus. Some studies use the word race in its early [[essentialism|essentialist]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] sense. Many others still use the term race, but use it to mean a population, [[clade]], or [[haplogroup]]. Others eschew the concept of race altogether, and use the concept of population as a less problematic unit of analysis.

[[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]], Sociology professor at Duke University, remarks,&lt;ref&gt;Race, Class, and Gender in the United States (text only) 7th (Seventh) edition by P. S. Rothenberg p131&lt;/ref&gt; "I contend that racism is, more than anything else, a matter of group power; it is about a dominant racial group (whites) striving to maintain its systemic advantages and minorities fighting to subvert the racial status quo."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Racism Without Racists (Second Edition) (2006), Rowman and Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt; The types of practices that take place under this new color-blind racism is subtle, institutionalized, and supposedly not racial. Color-blind racism thrives on the idea that race is no longer an issue in the United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006" /&gt; There are contradictions between the alleged color-blindness of most whites and the persistence of a color-coded system of inequality. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}In [[Poland]], the race concept was rejected by 25 percent of anthropologists in 2001, although: "Unlike the U.S. anthropologists, Polish anthropologists tend to regard race as a term without taxonomic value, often as a substitute for population."&lt;ref name="Kaszycka, Strziko 2003" /&gt;

===Anthropology===
{{Refimprove science|section|date=August 2017}}

The concept of typological race classification in physical anthropology lost credibility around the 1960s and is now considered untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A companion to Biological Anthropology|editor1-last=Larsen|editor1-first=Clark Spencer|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-8900-2|pages=13, 26|quote='Race' as a typological characterization of human variation was to become a dominant theme in physical anthropology until the mid-twentieth century. ...

Wagner et al. (2017) surveyed 3,286 American anthropologists' views on race and genetics, including both cultural and biological andthropologists. They found a consensus among them that biological races do not exist in humans, but that race does exist insofar as the social experiences of members of different races can have significant effects on health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Yu|first2=Joon-Ho|last3=Ifekwunigwe|first3=Jayne O.|last4=Harrell|first4=Tanya M.|last5=Bamshad|first5=Michael J.|last6=Royal|first6=Charmaine D.|date=February 2017|title=Anthropologists' views on race, ancestry, and genetics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=162|issue=2|pages=318–327|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23120|pmid=27874171|last1=Wagner|first1=Jennifer K.|pmc=5299519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang, Štrkalj et al. (2003) examined the use of race as a biological concept in research papers published in China's only biological anthropology journal, ''Acta Anthropologica Sinica''. The study showed that the race concept was widely used among Chinese anthropologists.&lt;ref name="racechina1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wang|first2=Qian|date=2003|title=On the Concept of Race in Chinese Biological Anthropology: Alive and Well|url=http://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/on-the-concept-of-race-in-chinese-biological-anthropology-alive-and-well.pdf|journal=Current Anthropology|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=44|issue=3|page=403|doi=10.1086/374899|last1=Štrkalj|first1=Goran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="racechina3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=306ruTniZmcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Forensic Anthropology: 2000 to 2010|last2=Ferguson|first2=Elidh|date=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-439-84588-3|page=125|last1=Black|first1=Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 review paper, Štrkalj suggested that the stark contrast of the racial approach between the United States and China was due to the fact that race is a factor for social cohesion among the ethnically diverse people of China, whereas "race" is a very sensitive issue in America and the racial approach is considered to undermine social cohesion&amp;nbsp;– with the result that in the socio-political context of US academics scientists are encouraged not to use racial categories, whereas in China they are encouraged to use them.&lt;ref name="racechina2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Štrkalj|first=Goran|date=2007|title=The Status of the Race Concept in Contemporary Biological Anthropology: A Review|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T-Anth/Anth-09-0-000-000-2007-Web/Anth-09-1-000-000-2007-Abst-PDF/Anth-09-1-073-078-2007-422-%20%8Atrkalj-G/Anth-09-1-073-078-2007-422-%20%8Atrkalj-G-Tt.pdf|journal=Anthropologist|publisher=Kamla-Raj|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieberman et al. in a 2004 study researched the acceptance of race as a concept among anthropologists in the United States, Canada, the Spanish speaking areas, Europe, Russia and China. Rejection of race ranged from high to low, with the highest rejection rate in the United States and Canada, a moderate rejection rate in Europe, and the lowest rejection rate in Russia and China. Methods used in the studies reported included questionnaires and content analysis.&lt;ref name="nih10" /&gt;

Kaszycka et al. (2009) in 2002–2003 surveyed European anthropologists' opinions toward the biological race concept. Three factors, country of academic education, discipline, and age, were found to be significant in differentiating the replies. Those educated in Western Europe, physical anthropologists, and middle-aged persons rejected race more frequently than those educated in Eastern Europe, people in other branches of science, and those from both younger and older generations." The survey shows that the views on race are sociopolitically (ideologically) influenced and highly dependent on education."&lt;ref name="anthropologists" /&gt;

====United States====
Since the second half of the 20th century, [[physical anthropology]] in the United States has moved away from a typological understanding of human biological diversity towards a genomic and population-based perspective. Anthropologists have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors, as the concept is understood in the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Caspari, Lieberman et al"/&gt; Since 1932, an increasing number of [[college]] [[textbook]]s introducing physical anthropology have rejected race as a valid concept: from 1932 to 1976, only seven out of thirty-two rejected race; from 1975 to 1984, thirteen out of thirty-three rejected race; from 1985 to 1993, thirteen out of nineteen rejected race. According to one academic journal entry, where 78 percent of the articles in the 1931 ''Journal of Physical Anthropology'' employed these or nearly synonymous terms reflecting a bio-race paradigm, only 36 percent did so in 1965, and just 28 percent did in 1996.&lt;ref name="Lieberman, Kirk, et al. 2003" /&gt;

The "Statement on 'Race'" (1998) composed by a select committee of anthropologists and issued by the executive board of the [[American Anthropological Association]] as a statement they "believe [...] represents generally the contemporary thinking and scholarly positions of a majority of anthropologists", declares:&lt;ref name="AAAonRace" /&gt;

{{quote|In the United States both scholars and the general public have been conditioned to viewing human races as natural and separate divisions within the human species based on visible physical differences. With the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, however, it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups. Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic "racial" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes. This means that there is greater variation within "racial" groups than between them. In neighboring populations there is much overlapping of genes and their phenotypic (physical) expressions. Throughout history whenever different groups have come into contact, they have interbred. The continued sharing of genetic materials has maintained all of humankind as a single species. [...]

With the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, ... it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups. [...] Given what we know about the capacity of normal humans to achieve and function within any culture, we conclude that present-day inequalities between so-called "racial" groups are not consequences of their biological inheritance but products of historical and contemporary social, economic, educational, and political circumstances.}}

A [[Statistical survey|survey]], taken in 1985 {{harv|Lieberman|Hampton|Littlefield|Hallead|1992}}, asked 1,200 American scientists how many '''disagree''' with the following proposition: "There are biological races in the species ''Homo sapiens''." The responses were for anthropologists:
* '''[[physical anthropologist]]s 41%'''
* '''[[cultural anthropologist]]s 53%'''&lt;ref name="presentations2005" /&gt;
The figure for physical anthropologists at [[PhD]] granting departments was slightly higher, rising from 41% to 42%, with 50% agreeing. Lieberman's study also showed that more women reject the concept of race than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Larry T. |last2=Lieberman |first2=Leonard |title=Race and Other Misadventures: Essays in Honor of Ashley Montagu in His Ninetieth Year |publisher=Altamira Press |date=1996 |isbn=1-882-28935-8 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survey, however, did not specify any particular definition of race (although it did clearly specify ''biological race'' within the ''species'' ''Homo sapiens''); it is difficult to say whether those who supported the statement thought of race in taxonomic or population terms.

The same survey, taken in 1999,&lt;ref name="Lieberman 2001" /&gt; showed the following changing results for anthropologists:
* '''[[physical anthropologist]]s 69%'''
* '''[[cultural anthropologist]]s 80%'''

However, a line of research conducted by Cartmill (1998) seemed to limit the scope of Lieberman's finding that there was "a significant degree of change in the status of the race concept". [[Goran Štrkalj]] has argued that this may be because Lieberman and collaborators had looked at all the members of the American Anthropological Association irrespective of their field of research interest, while Cartmill had looked specifically at biological anthropologists interested in human variation.&lt;ref name="Štrkalj 2007" /&gt;

According to the 2000 edition of a popular physical anthropology textbook, [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] are overwhelmingly in support of the idea of the basic biological reality of human races.&lt;ref name="Gill 2000" /&gt; Forensic physical anthropologist and professor [[George W. Gill]] has said that the idea that race is only skin deep "is simply not true, as any experienced forensic anthropologist will affirm" and "Many morphological features tend to follow geographic boundaries coinciding often with climatic zones. This is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of the nose, cheekbones, etc. (For example, more prominent noses humidify air better.)" While he can see good arguments for both sides, the complete denial of the opposing evidence "seems to stem largely from socio-political motivation and not science at all". He also states that many biological anthropologists see races as real yet "not one introductory textbook of physical anthropology even presents that perspective as a possibility. In a case as flagrant as this, we are not dealing with science but rather with blatant, politically motivated censorship".&lt;ref name="Gill 2000" /&gt;

In partial response to Gill's statement, Professor of Biological Anthropology [[C. Loring Brace]] argues that the reason laymen and biological anthropologists can determine the geographic ancestry of an individual can be explained by the fact that biological characteristics are [[cline (biology)|clinally]] distributed across the planet, and that does not translate into the concept of race. He states: {{Quote|text=Well, you may ask, why can't we call those regional patterns "races"? In fact, we can and do, but it does not make them coherent biological entities. "Races" defined in such a way are products of our perceptions. ... We realize that in the extremes of our transit&amp;nbsp;– Moscow to Nairobi, perhaps&amp;nbsp;– there is a major but gradual change in skin color from what we euphemistically call white to black, and that this is related to the latitudinal difference in the intensity of the ultraviolet component of sunlight. What we do not see, however, is the myriad other traits that are distributed in a fashion quite unrelated to the intensity of ultraviolet radiation. Where skin color is concerned, all the northern populations of the Old World are lighter than the long-term inhabitants near the equator. Although Europeans and Chinese are obviously different, in skin color they are closer to each other than either is to equatorial Africans. But if we test the distribution of the widely known ABO blood-group system, then Europeans and Africans are closer to each other than either is to Chinese.&lt;ref name="pbs" /&gt;}}
"Race" is still sometimes used within [[forensic anthropology]] (when analyzing skeletal remains), [[biomedical research]], and [[race-based medicine]].&lt;ref name="Gill; Armelagos; et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name=Witzig/&gt; Brace has criticized this, the practice of forensic anthropologists for using the controversial concept "race" out of convention when they in fact should be talking about regional ancestry. He argues that while forensic anthropologists can determine that a skeletal remain comes from a person with ancestors in a specific region of Africa, categorizing that skeletal as being "black" is a socially constructed category that is only meaningful in the particular context of the United States, and which is not itself scientifically valid.&lt;ref name="anthropology" /&gt;

In 2007, [[Ann Morning]] interviewed over 40 American biologists and anthropologists and found significant disagreements over the nature of race, with no one viewpoint holding a majority among either group.  Morning also argues that a third position, "antiessentialism", which holds that race is not a useful concept for biologists, should be introduced into this debate in addition to "constructionism" and "essentialism".&lt;ref name="MorningSocial"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morning|first1=Ann|title="Everyone Knows It's a Social Construct": Contemporary Science and the Nature of Race|journal=Sociological Focus|date=November 2007|volume=40|issue=4|pages=436–454|doi=10.1080/00380237.2007.10571319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology, anatomy, and medicine===
In the same 1985 survey {{harv|Lieberman|Hampton|Littlefield|Hallead|1992}}, 16% of the surveyed [[biology|biologists]] and 36% of the surveyed [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologists]] '''disagreed''' with the proposition: "There are biological races in the species ''Homo sapiens''."

The authors of the study also examined 77 college textbooks in biology and 69 in physical anthropology published between 1932 and 1989. Physical anthropology texts argued that biological races exist until the 1970s, when they began to argue that races do not exist. In contrast, biology textbooks did not undergo such a reversal but many instead dropped their discussion of race altogether. The authors attributed this to biologists trying to avoid discussing the political implications of racial classifications, instead of discussing them, and to the ongoing discussions in biology about the validity of the concept "subspecies". The authors also noted that some widely used textbooks in biology such as [[Douglas J. Futuyma]]'s 1986 "Evolutionary Biology" had abandoned the race concept, "The concept of race, masking the overwhelming genetic similarity of all peoples and the mosaic patterns of variation that do not correspond to racial divisions, is not only socially dysfunctional but is biologically indefensible as well (pp. 5 18–5 19)."{{harv|Lieberman|Hampton|Littlefield|Hallead|1992|pp=316–17}}

A 1994 examination of 32 English sport/exercise science textbooks found that 7 (21.9%) claimed that there are biophysical differences due to race that might explain differences in sports performance, 24 (75%) did not mention nor refute the concept, and 1 (3.12%) expressed caution with the idea.&lt;ref name="presentation" /&gt;

In February 2001, the editors of ''Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine'' asked "authors to not use race and ethnicity when there is no biological, scientific, or sociological reason for doing so."&lt;ref name="Rivara, Finberg 2001" /&gt; The editors also stated that "analysis by race and ethnicity has become an analytical knee-jerk reflex."&lt;ref name="nih" /&gt; ''Nature Genetics'' now ask authors to "explain why they make use of particular ethnic groups or populations, and how classification was achieved."&lt;ref name="profiling" /&gt;

Morning (2008) looked at high school biology textbooks during the 1952–2002 period and initially found a similar pattern with only 35% directly discussing race in the 1983–92 period from initially 92% doing so. However, this has increased somewhat after this to 43%. More indirect and brief discussions of race in the context of medical disorders have increased from none to 93% of textbooks. In general, the material on race has moved from surface traits to genetics and evolutionary history. The study argues that the textbooks' fundamental message about the existence of races has changed little.&lt;ref name="reconstructing" /&gt;

Surveying views on race in the scientific community in 2008, Morning says that they often split along culture and demographic lines and that, since Lieberman's surveys, biologists have failed to come to a clear consensus, noting that "At best, one can conclude that biologists and anthropologists now appear equally divided in their beliefs about the nature of race."&lt;ref name="MorningSocial" /&gt;

Gissis (2008) examined several important American and British journals in genetics, epidemiology and medicine for their content during the 1946–2003 period. He wrote that "Based upon my findings I argue that the category of race only ''seemingly'' disappeared from scientific discourse after World War II and has had a ''fluctuating yet continuous use'' during the time span from 1946 to 2003, and has even ''become more pronounced from the early 1970s on''".&lt;ref name="autogenerated" /&gt;

33 health services researchers from differing geographic regions were interviewed in a 2008 study. The researchers recognized the problems with racial and ethnic variables but the majority still believed these variables were necessary and useful.&lt;ref name="operationalization" /&gt;

A 2010 examination of 18 widely used English [[anatomy]] textbooks found that they all represented human biological variation in superficial and outdated ways, many of them making use of the race concept in ways that were current in 1950s anthropology. The authors recommended that anatomical education should describe human anatomical variation in more detail and rely on newer research that demonstrates the inadequacies of simple racial typologies.&lt;ref name="biological" /&gt;

Fifth Edition. St. Paul, MN: West Publishing Company. P. 1132.&lt;/ref&gt;

White sociologist [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935), for example, used biological arguments to claim the inferiority of African Americans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; American sociologist [[Charles Cooley|Charles H.

Toronto: Random House Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Edward Alsworth Ross]] (1866-1951), also an important figure in the founding of American sociology, and an [[Eugenics|eugenicist]], believed that whites were the superior race, and that there were essential differences in "temperament" among races.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1910, the ''Journal'' published an article by [[Ulysses G. Weatherly]] (1865-1940) that called for white supremacy and segregation of the races to protect racial purity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] (1868–1963), one of the first African-American sociologists, was the first sociologist to use sociological concepts and empirical research methods to analyze race as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]] instead of a biological reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Beginning in 1899 with his book ''The Philadelphia Negro'', Du Bois studied and wrote about race and racism throughout his career. In his work, he contended that [[social class]], [[colonialism]], and [[capitalism]] shaped ideas about race and racial categories. Social scientists largely abandoned scientific racism and biological reasons for racial categorization schemes by the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Fitzgerald, Kathleen J. ''Recognizing Race and Ethnicity: Power, Privilege, and Inequality.'' 2014. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists associated with the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] theorized that notions about race were socially constructed, and were not biological.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1978, [[William Julius Wilson]] (1935–) argued that race and racial classification systems were declining in significance, and that instead, [[social class]] more accurately described what sociologists had earlier understood as race.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, William Julius. 1978.

==Political and practical uses==

===Biomedicine===
{{Main|Race and health}}
{{See also|Pharmacogenomics}}
In the United States, federal government policy promotes the use of racially categorized data to identify and address health disparities between racial or ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="hhs" /&gt; In clinical settings, race has sometimes been considered in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. Doctors have noted that some medical conditions are more prevalent in certain racial or ethnic groups than in others, without being sure of the cause of those differences. Recent interest in [[race-based medicine]], or race-targeted [[pharmacogenomics]], has been fueled by the proliferation of human genetic data which followed the [[Human Genome Project|decoding]] of the [[human genome]] in the first decade of the twenty-first century. There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research. Proponents of the use of racial categories in biomedicine argue that continued use of racial categorizations in biomedical research and clinical practice makes possible the application of new genetic findings, and provides a clue to diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Risch 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Condit, et al. 2003" /&gt; Biomedical researchers' positions on race fall into two main camps: those who consider the concept of race to have no biological basis and those who consider it to have the potential to be biologically meaningful. Members of the latter camp often base their arguments around the potential to create genome-based [[personalized medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Catherine|title="Race" and "ethnicity" in biomedical research: How do scientists construct and explain differences in health?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=March 2009|volume=68|issue=6|pages=1183–1190|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.12.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers point out that finding a difference in disease prevalence between two socially defined groups does not necessarily imply genetic causation of the difference.&lt;ref name="Graves 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fullwiley2011DNA" /&gt; They suggest that medical practices should maintain their focus on the individual rather than an individual's membership to any group.&lt;ref name="Harpending2006AnthropologicalGenetics" /&gt; They argue that overemphasizing genetic contributions to health disparities carries various risks such as reinforcing stereotypes, promoting racism or ignoring the contribution of non-genetic factors to health disparities.&lt;ref name="Lee, Mountain, et al." /&gt; International epidemiological data show that living conditions rather than race make the biggest difference in health outcomes even for diseases that have "race-specific" treatments.&lt;ref name="Kahn 2011" /&gt; Some studies have found that patients are reluctant to accept racial categorization in medical practice.&lt;ref name="Condit, et al. 2003" /&gt;

===Law enforcement===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

{{Main|Racial profiling}}
{{See also|Race and crime in the United Kingdom|Race and crime in the United States}}
In an attempt to provide general descriptions that may facilitate the job of [[law enforcement officer]]s seeking to apprehend suspects, the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] employs the term "race" to summarize the general appearance (skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and other such easily noticed characteristics) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend. From the perspective of [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officers, it is generally more important to arrive at a description that will readily suggest the general appearance of an individual than to make a scientifically valid categorization by DNA or other such means. Thus, in addition to assigning a wanted individual to a racial category, such a description will include: height, weight, eye color, scars and other distinguishing characteristics.

Criminal justice agencies in [[England]] and [[Wales]] use at least two separate racial/ethnic classification systems when reporting crime, as of 2010.  One is the system used in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001#Ethnicity|2001 Census]] when individuals identify themselves as belonging to a particular ethnic group: W1 (White-British), W2 (White-Irish), W9 (Any other white background); M1 (White and black Caribbean), M2 (White and black African), M3 (White and Asian), M9 (Any other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2 (Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-Bangladeshi), A9 (Any other Asian background); B1 (Black Caribbean), B2 (Black African), B3 (Any other black background); O1 (Chinese), O9 (Any other). The other is categories used by the police when they visually identify
someone as belonging to an ethnic group, e.g. at the time of a stop and search or an arrest: White – North European (IC1), White – South European (IC2), Black (IC3), Asian (IC4), Chinese, Japanese, or South East Asian (IC5), Middle Eastern (IC6), and Unknown (IC0).  "IC" stands for "Identification Code;" these items are also referred to as Phoenix classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/statistics/mojstats/stats-race-cjs-2010.pdf "Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System 2010, Appendix C: Classifications of ethnicity "].

In many countries, such as [[France]], the state is legally banned from maintaining data based on race, which often makes the police issue wanted notices to the public that include labels like "dark skin complexion", etc.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the United States, the practice of [[racial profiling]] has been ruled to be both [[unconstitutional]] and a violation of [[civil rights]]. There is active debate regarding the cause of a marked correlation between the recorded crimes, punishments meted out, and the country's populations. Many consider ''de facto'' [[racial profiling]] an example of [[institutional racism]] in law enforcement. The history of misuse of racial categories to impact adversely one or more groups and/or to offer protection and advantage to another has a clear impact on debate of the legitimate use of known phenotypical or genotypical characteristics tied to the presumed race of both victims and perpetrators by the government.

Mass incarceration in the United States disproportionately impacts African American and Latino communities. Michelle Alexander, author of ''[[The New Jim Crow]]: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'' (2010), argues that mass incarceration is best understood as not only a system of overcrowded prisons. Mass incarceration is also, "the larger web of laws, rules, policies, and customs that control those labeled criminals both in and out of prison."&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (New York, NY: The New Press, 2010), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; She defines it further as "a system that locks people not only behind actual bars in actual prisons, but also behind virtual bars and virtual walls", illustrating the second-class citizenship that is imposed on a disproportionate number of people of color, specifically African-Americans.  She compares mass incarceration to [[Jim Crow laws]], stating that both work as racial caste systems.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (New York, NY: The New Press, 2010), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many research findings appear to agree that the impact of victim race in the IPV arrest decision might possibly include a racial bias in favor of white victims. A 2011 study in a national sample of IPV arrests found that female arrest was more likely if the male victim was white and the female offender was black, while male arrest was more likely if the female victim was white. For both female and male arrest in IPV cases, situations involving married couples were more likely to lead to arrest compared to dating or divorced couples. More research is needed to understand agency and community factors that influence police behavior and how discrepancies in IPV interventions/ tools of justice can be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Dichter, ME, Marcus SM, Morabito MS, Rhodes KV: Explaining the IPV arrest decision: Incident, agency, and community factors. Criminal Justice Review, 2011; 36: 22-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work using DNA [[cluster analysis]] to determine race background has been used by some criminal investigators to narrow their search for the identity of both suspects and victims.&lt;ref name="abraham" /&gt;  Proponents of DNA profiling in criminal investigations cite cases where leads based on DNA analysis proved useful, but the practice remains controversial among medical ethicists, defense lawyers and some in law enforcement.&lt;ref name="willing" /&gt;

====Forensic anthropology====
{{Main|Forensic anthropology}}
Similarly, [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] draw on highly heritable morphological features of human remains (e.g. cranial measurements) to aid in the identification of the body, including in terms of race. In a 1992 article, anthropologist [[Norman Sauer]] noted that anthropologists had generally abandoned the concept of race as a valid representation of human biological diversity, except for forensic anthropologists. He asked, "If races don't exist, why are forensic anthropologists so good at identifying them?"&lt;ref name="Sauer 1992" /&gt; He concluded:

{{quote|1=[T]he successful assignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race concept, but rather a prediction that an individual, while alive was assigned to a particular socially constructed "racial" category. A specimen may display features that point to African ancestry. In this country that person is likely to have been labeled Black regardless of whether or not such a race actually exists in nature.&lt;ref name="Sauer 1992" /&gt;}}

Identification of the ancestry of an individual is dependent upon knowledge of the frequency and distribution of phenotypic traits in a population. This does not necessitate the use of a racial classification scheme based on unrelated traits, although the race concept is widely used in medical and legal contexts in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt; Some studies have reported that races can be identified with a high degree of accuracy using certain methods, such as that developed by Giles and Elliot. However, this method sometimes fails to be replicated in other times and places; for instance, when the method was re-tested to identify Native Americans, the average rate of accuracy dropped from 85% to 33%.&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt; Prior information about the individual (e.g. Census data) is also important in allowing the accurate identification of the individual's "race".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Konigsberg |first=Lyle W. |last2=Algee-Hewitt |first2=Bridget F.B. |last3=Steadman |first3=Dawnie Wolfe |date=1 May 2009 |title=Estimation and evidence in forensic anthropology: Sex and race |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.20934/abstract |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |language=en |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=77–90 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20934 |pmid=19226642 |issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different approach, anthropologist [[C. Loring Brace]] said:

{{quote|1=The simple answer is that, as members of the society that poses the question, they are inculcated into the social conventions that determine the expected answer. They should also be aware of the biological inaccuracies contained in that "politically correct" answer. Skeletal analysis provides no direct assessment of skin color, but it does allow an accurate estimate of original geographical origins. African, eastern Asian, and European ancestry can be specified with a high degree of accuracy. Africa of course entails "black", but "black" does not entail African.&lt;ref name="anthropology12" /&gt;}}

In association with a NOVA program in 2000 about race, he wrote an essay opposing use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/does-race-exist.html|title=Does Race Exist?|date=15 February 2000|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study found that about 13% of human craniometric variation existed between regions, while 81% existed within regions (the other 6% existed between local populations within the same region). In contrast, the opposite pattern of genetic variation was observed for skin color (which is often used to define race), with 88% of variation between regions. The study concluded that "The apportionment of genetic diversity in skin color is atypical, and cannot be used for purposes of classification."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Relethford | first1 = John H. | year = 2002 | title = Apportionment of global human genetic diversity based on craniometrics and skin color | url = http://references.260mb.com/Biometria/Relethford2002.pdf| journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 118 | issue = 4| pages = 393–98 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.10079 | pmid=12124919}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a 2009 study found that craniometrics could be used accurately to determine what part of the world someone was from based on their cranium; however, this study also found that there were no abrupt boundaries that separated craniometric variation into distinct racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Relethford|first1=John H.|title=Race and global patterns of phenotypic variation|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=18 February 2009|volume=139|issue=1|pages=16–22|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20900|quote=Craniometric variation is geographically structured, allowing high levels of classification accuracy when comparing crania from different parts of the world. Nonetheless, the boundaries in global variation are not abrupt and do not fit a strict view of the race concept; the number of races and the cutoffs used to define them are arbitrary.|pmid=19226639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2009 study showed that American blacks and whites had different skeletal morphologies, and that significant patterning in variation in these traits exists within continents. This suggests that classifying humans into races based on skeletal characteristics would necessitate many different "races" being defined.&lt;ref name=ousley2009/&gt;

Race or ethnicity should not be used as explanatory variables, when the underlying constructs are variables that can, and should, be measured directly (eg, educational level of subjects, household income of the families, single vs 2-parent households, employment of parents, owning vs renting one's home, and other measures of socioeconomic status). In contrast, the recent attention on decreasing health disparities uses race and ethnicity not as explanatory variables but as ways of examining the underlying sociocultural reasons for these disparities and appropriately targeting attention and resources on children and adolescents with poorer health. In select issues and questions such as these, use of race and ethnicity is appropriate."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freedom 251 ==
The [[company]] attracted attention when it announced the [[Freedom 251]], a [[3G]] [[smartphone]], at a price of [[rupee|₹]] 251. That would make it the world's cheapest smartphone.

Ringing Bells MD Mohit Goel claimed on 16 December 2016 that the company has already delivered 70000 phones and the remaining phones would be delivered soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tech.firstpost.com/amp/news-analysis/70000-freedom-251-smartphones-delivered-to-customers-clarifies-ringing-bells-md-mohit-goel-353301.html|title=Ringing Bells to import first 50 lakh phones: Govt. official|last=Bhargava|first=Yuthika|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Scam allegations===
There are suggestions that the Freedom 251 sale is a scam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/here-s-why-the-freedom-251-might-be-the-scammiest-scam-of-2016_-250897.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that the phone looks like a Chinese phone with the original brand label covered with [[correction fluid|whitener]]. The icons shown on screen shots are copied from Apple's [[iPhone]]. MP [[Kirit Somaiya]] describes the offer as a "huge scam" and has asked the government of [[Uttar Pradesh]] to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/freedom-251-is-a-ponzi-scam-bjp-mp-kirit-somaiya/ "Freedom 251 is a ponzi scam: BJP MP Kirit Somaiya", ''Indian Express'', 20 February 2016]. Accessed 22 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these concerns, the payment gateway facilitator PayUBiz decided to withhold payment to Ringing Bells until the items were dispatched. In response, Ringing Bells stated that they would accept payment by cash-on-delivery for those customers who had placed orders but had been unable to make payment through the payment gateway before the offer closed.&lt;ref&gt;Tech Desk, [http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/ringing-bells-freedom-251-cash-on-delivery/ "Ringing Bells Freedom 251 now has cash on delivery option"], ''Indian Express'', 26 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ringing Bells has also been accused of fraud and non-payment of dues by its customer services provider Cyfuture.&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/noida-based-bpo-cyfuture-files-police-complaint-against-ringing-bells/articleshow/51159346.cms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibnlive.com/news/tech/freedom-251-maker-ringing-bells-now-accused-of-cheating-and-fraud-by-its-customer-service-provider-1208076.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/freedom-251-maker-ringing-bells-accused-of-fraud/story/229627.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/photos/technology-gallery/ringing-bells-freedom-251-noida-police-registers-fir-cheating-everything-that-has-happened-so-far/3/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest of Mohit Goel===
Goel was detained on 24 February 2017 over fraud allegations, after the owner of Ghaziabad-based Ayam Enterprises filed an FIR alleging that Ringing Bells "defrauded" it of Rs. 16 lakh.&lt;ref name="goelrekt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/freedom-251-phone-ringing-bells-director-mohit-goel-detained-for-fraud/story-2IeBHycnvwkG5lYwx0XbPK.html|title=Mohit Goel, director of company that made Freedom 251 phones, detained for fraud|date=23 February 2017|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vatsa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/ringing-bells-freedom-251-cheapest-phone-maker-is-class-viii-fail-4542590/|title=‘Cheapest phone’ maker Mohit Goel is Class VIII fail: Cops|last=Vatsa|first=Aditi|date=25 February 2017|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohit Goel has been arrested on allegations of fraud.

'''Rural Alliances''' is an international project funded by the  [[European Union]] through the [[Interreg]] ''North West Europe'' European Regional Development Fund IVB &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nweurope.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; funding scheme aimed at bringing rural businesses together with their communities to stimulate local economies and services.

Twelve partner organisations from six different EU countries are working together. The twelve are:

'''Belgium'''
*Boerenbondvereniging voor Projecten vzw
*[[Vlaamse Landmaatschappij (VLM)]] (Flemish Land Agency)

'''France'''
*[[Redon, Ille-et-Vilaine|Maison de l'Emploi, du Développement, de la Formation et de l'Insertion du Pays de Redon-Bretagne Sud]] (MEDEFI)
*[[Laval, Mayenne]] Technopole (Laval &amp; Mayenne Technology Park)

'''Germany'''
*[[University of Marburg|Philipps Universität]], [[Marburg]]

'''Republic of Ireland'''
*[[County Kerry|South Kerry Development Partnership Ltd.]]
*[[Mayo County Council]]

'''Netherlands'''
*Stichting Streekhuis Het Groene Woud &amp; De Meierij
*Stichting Streekhuis [[Kempenland]]
*[[Lochem|Gemeente Lochem]]

'''United Kingdom'''
*[[Brecon Beacons National Park|Brecon Beacons National Park Authority]]
*[[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David]]

The project was initiated in 2011 with a meeting in [[Brecon]], [[Wales]]. A project officer is employed by the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority to develop clusters of activity in several areas of the park.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rural-alliances.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alliance building Blueprint Prototype'''

The University Partners have been working closely with the partners to explore and develop concepts and frameworks to capture, record and share successful alliance building methods in order to develop an Alliance Building Blueprint. To begin this process, they held a Master Class with all the partners in February 2012 in Leuven, Belgium where key concepts were discussed and agreed, including debates on what constitutes a rural area, what is a community, and how many members are needed to make up an Alliance.  This was followed up with research, interviews and further workshops with the partners to explore alliance building methods in the different areas.

At this early stage in the project an outline concept has been developed.  This shows a cyclic phase from building the alliance, its management, reviewing its development and growth, and looking towards long-term planning.

---abbp---

Key components include a good contact database; a method of plotting the skills and capacity that exist in the alliance or in the wider community; creating an atmosphere of open dialogue; identifying and supporting champions who are visionary and “get things done”, and a good understanding of local context, what other initiatives are competing, what are the risks and what are the rewards.

This concept will now be developed and modified through case studies on the different alliances in 2013/4 to explore the methods used to make them successful. Research will be done to assess how useful tools and techniques can be transferred between alliances, to ensure that lessons are being learned and communicated across the partnership, and monitoring and evaluation will take place to ensure the viability, usefulness and relevance of the Blueprint model.

'''Rural Vibrancy Measuring Index (RVMI)'''

The Rural Vibrancy Measuring Index is a tool that is currently being developed by the University partners of the Rural Alliances project. The current stage of the RVMI represents the outcomes of several transnational workshops, the evaluation of partner questionnaires and further literature research.
The purpose of this index is to give local communities a tool to determine their vibrancy. Using the RVMI should allow local communities to acquire knowledge on the strengths and weaknesses of their community and help them to allocate their resources more efficiently and develop their community.

'''Definition ‘Rural Vibrancy''''

‘Rural Vibrancy’ describes the nature of a rural community, which is characterized by active involvement and the creative, dynamic interaction of people from different groupings with the capacity to create common objectives and to act jointly to develop their community.
It is desirable from the perspective of the Rural Alliances consortium that vibrant rural communities follow the aim to develop and/or maintain social, cultural and economic benefit, adapt to change and improve quality of life for everyone within the community.

'''RVMI categories'''

The analytical subject of the RVMI is an analysis of local community groups that are formed within a specific area. The RVMI focusses on local community groups because they are the origin and the basis of ‘vibrancy’, being the organisational form of people that act jointly. Depending on the actions the community groups take (e.g. cooperation) they can make a place more or less vibrant. On the basis of this pattern the RVMI proposes a ‘catalogue’ of quantitative and qualitative questions on the role of community groups that can be visualized and interpreted. The first field tests are scheduled for early 2013.

'''Contribution to rural development'''

The main goal of the Rural Alliances project is to develop a transnational tool to capture rural vibrancy.  Approaches like quality of life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Quality of Life|url = http://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/oxpobooks/9780198287971.htm|date = 1993-01-01|first = Martha|last = Nussbaum|first2 = Amartya|last2 = Sen}}&lt;/ref&gt; or vibrant communities refer to a presence of certain amenities and measure hard and soft location factors.

It distinguishes between vibrant, active, barely active, and sleeping parishes assessed on numbers of meeting places, voluntary and cultural activities, as well as contested parish elections. Together with a living, working and protected countryside the vibrant countryside is seen as part of a sustainable rural development. Community involvement, participation and inhabitants’ perceptions need to be integrated in such instruments. Therefore, vibrant rural communities follow the aim to develop and/or maintain social, cultural and economic benefit, adapt to change and improve quality of life for everyone within the community. This development is on-going, iterative and inclusive. Taking various national frames, cultural backgrounds, social behaviours and personal opinions into consideration lead to a broadly agreed definition, approach and implementation process. A rural development instrument is created by the transnational partnership. This is called Rural Vibes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rural Vibes|url = http://www.ruralvibes.eu/|website = www.ruralvibes.eu|accessdate = 2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[local government]], a '''city hall''', '''town hall''', '''civic centre''', (in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] or [[Australia]]) a '''guildhall''', a '''Rathaus''' ([[German language|German]]), or (more rarely) a '''municipal building''', is the chief [[administration (government)|administrative]] building of a [[city]],&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/city+hall|title=city hall |year=2010 |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2010-05-19 |quote=1 : the chief administrative building of a city&lt;br&gt;2 a : a municipal government&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;b : city officialdom or bureaucracy &lt;!-- &amp;bull; you can't fight ''city hall'' --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[town]], or other [[municipality]]. It usually houses the [[City council|city]] or [[town council]], its associated departments, and their employees. It also usually functions as the base of the [[mayor]] of a city, town, [[borough]], or [[county]]/[[shire]].

By convention, until the mid 19th-century, a single large open chamber (or 'hall') formed an integral part of the building housing the council. The hall may be used for council meetings and other significant events. This large chamber, the "town hall" (and its later variant "city hall") has become synonymous with the whole building, and with the administrative body housed in it. The terms "council chambers", "municipal building" or variants may be used locally in preference to "town hall" if no such large hall is present within the building.

The local government may endeavor to use the town hall building to promote and enhance the [[quality of life]] of the community. In many cases, "town halls" serve not only as buildings for government functions, but also have facilities for various civic and cultural activities. These may include art shows, stage performances, exhibits and festivals. Modern town halls or "civic centres" are often designed with a great variety and flexibility of purpose in mind.

As symbols of local government, city and town halls have distinctive [[architecture]], and the buildings may have great historical significance{{snd}} for example the [[Guildhall, London]]. City hall buildings may also serve as [[cultural icon]]s that symbolize their cities.

== Nomenclature ==
The term "town hall" may be a general one, often applied without regard to whether the building serves or served a town or a city. This is generally the case in the [[United Kingdom]] (with examples such as [[Manchester Town Hall|Manchester]] and [[Liverpool Town Hall]]s in the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] respectively), [[Australia]] (with [[Sydney Town Hall]] in the city of [[Sydney]]), [[New Zealand]], [[Hong Kong]], and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.

English-speakers in some regions use the term "city hall" to designate the council offices of a [[municipality]] of [[city status]]. This is the case in [[North America]], where a distinction is made between city halls and town halls; and is also the case with [[Brisbane City Hall]] in [[Australia]].

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] sums up the generic terms:

* town hall: "A large hall used for the transaction of the public business of a town, the holding of a court of justice, assemblies, entertainments, etc.; the great hall of the town-house or municipal building; now very commonly applied to the whole building"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[County Council]] administrations in parts of [[England and Wales]] generally operate from a base in a building called, by analogy, a "[[County Hall]]" or "Shire Hall". Conversely, cities that have subdivisions with their own councils may have [[borough]] halls. In [[Scotland]], [[Scottish local government|local government]] in larger cities operates from the "City Chambers", otherwise the "Town House".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/ |title=www.chambersharrap.co.uk |publisher=Chambersharrap.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in English-speaking countries, other names are occasionally used. In London, the official headquarters of administration of the [[City of London]] retains its Anglo-Saxon name, the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], signifying a place where taxes were paid. In a small number of English cities (including [[Council House, Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[Coventry Council House|Coventry]] and [[Nottingham Council House|Nottingham]]) the preferred term is "Council House": this was also the case in [[Bristol]] until 2012, when the building was renamed "[[City Hall, Bristol|City Hall]]". In Birmingham, there is a distinction between the [[Council House, Birmingham|Council House]], the seat of local government, and the [[Birmingham Town Hall|Town Hall]], a concert and meeting venue which pre-dates it. In the City of [[Sheffield]], the distinction is between the [[Sheffield Town Hall|Town Hall]], the seat of local government, and the [[Sheffield City Hall|City Hall]], a concert and ballroom venue.

== History ==
Large halls called [[basilica]]s were used in [[Ancient Rome]] for the administration of [[justice]], as [[meeting]] places, and for [[trade]].

In the Early [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] period, the [[great hall|hall]], a single large open chamber, was the main, and sometimes ''only'' room of the home of a feudal lord. There the lord lived with his family and retinue, ate, slept and administered rule and justice. Activities in the hall played an essential role in the functioning of the feudal manor, the administrative unit of society. As manorial dwellings developed into [[manor house]]s, [[castle]]s and [[palace]]s, the hall, or "great hall" as it was often termed, remained an essential unit within the architectural complex.

In the later Middle Ages or [[early modern period]], many European [[market town]]s erected communal [[market hall]]s, comprising a covered open space to function as a sheltered [[marketplace]] at street level, and one or more rooms used for public or civic purposes on the upper floor or floors. Such buildings were frequently the precursors of dedicated town halls.

The modern concept of the town hall developed with the rise of local or regional government. Cities administered by a group of elected or chosen representatives, rather than by a lord or princely ruler, required a place for their council to meet. The [[Cologne City Hall]] of 1135 is a prominent example for self-gained municipal autonomy of medieval cities. The [[Palazzo Pubblico]] of the [[Republic of Siena]] and the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] of the [[Republic of Florence]], both town halls, date from 1297 and 1299 respectively. In each case the large, fortified building comprises a large meeting hall and numerous administrative chambers. Both buildings are topped by very tall towers. Both buildings have ancient timepieces by which the people of the town can regulate their lives. Both buildings have facilities for the storage of documents and references that pertain to the city's administration. These features: a hall, a tower and a clock, as well as administrative chambers and an archive or [[muniment]] room became the standard features of town halls across Europe. [[Brussels Town Hall]] of the 15th century, with its {{convert|96|m|ft|0|adj=on}} tower, is one of the grandest examples of the medieval era, serving as a model for 19th-century town halls such as the [[Rathaus, Vienna]].

During the 19th-century town hall buildings often included "reading rooms" to provide free education to the public, and it eventually became customary for the town or city council to establish and maintain a [[library]] as part of its service to the community. The grand chamber or meeting place, the "town hall" itself, became a place for receptions, banquets, balls and public entertainment. Town halls, particularly during the 19th century, were often equipped with large [[pipe organ]]s to facilitate public recitals.

In the 20th-century town halls, as venues, have served the public as places for voting, examinations, [[vaccinations]], relief in times of disaster and the posting lists of war casualties, as well as for the more usual civil functions, festivities and entertainments. Local councils have tended increasingly to remove administrative functions into modern offices. Where new premises are designed and constructed to house local governments, the concepts and functions of administrative council offices and of a civic town hall become separated.

== Language ==
English-speakers (particularly in North America) can use the term "city hall" by [[metonymy]] to mean "municipal government" or [[government]] in general, as in the [[axiom]] "You can't fight city hall".&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; "Town hall" tends to have less formal connotations (cf. [[Town meeting]]).

The '''standard cross-cultural sample''' is a sample of 186 cultures used by [[scholar]]s engaged in [[cross-cultural studies]].

==Origin==
[[Cross-cultural studies|Cross-cultural research]] entails a particular statistical problem, known as [[Galton's problem]]: tests of functional relationships (for example, a test of the hypothesis that societies with pronounced male dominance are more warlike) can be confounded because the samples of cultures are not independent. Traits can be associated not only because they are functionally related, but because they were transmitted together either through cross-cultural borrowing or through descent from a common cultural ancestor. 

[[George Peter Murdock]] attempted to tackle Galton's problem by developing a sample of cultures relatively independent from each other—i.e., with relatively weak phylogenetic and cultural diffusion relationships. Murdock began with the twelve hundred or so peoples in his ''Ethnographic Atlas'' (Murdock, 1967), dividing them into roughly 200 "sampling provinces" of closely related cultures. Murdock and [[Douglas R. White]] chose one particularly well-documented culture from each sampling province to create the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) (Murdock and White, 1969). The number of cultures is large and varied enough to provide a sound basis for statistical analysis; the sample includes 186 cultures, ranging from contemporary hunter gatherers (e.g., the Mbuti), to early historic states (e.g., the Romans), to contemporary industrial peoples (e.g., the Russians)  ({{Harvcolnb|Silverman|Messinger|1997}}; {{Harvcolnb|Mace|Pagel|1994}}).
 
Scholars engaging in statistical cross-cultural analysis are encouraged to use the set of cultures in the SCCS, since each new study adds to the number of coded variables capable of being used with already existing variables. By focusing scholarly attention on this sample of 186 cultures, the data have steadily improved in scope and quality. The [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] electronic journal [[World Cultures]], founded by White, published by [[William Divale]], and now edited by [[J. Patrick Gray]], functions as the repository of the SCCS, archiving the now nearly 2000 coded variables and publishing a number of papers on cross-cultural methodology. The journal moved in [http://escholarship.org/uc/search?entity=wc_worldcultures;volume=16;issue=1 2006] to the [[California Digital Library|University of California eScholarship Repository]].

Murdock also founded the [[Human Relations Area Files]] (HRAF) at [[Yale University]] in the 1940s. However, the SCCS contains a different set of cultures, uses a different set of ethnographic sources, and can be considered entirely distinct from the HRAF.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3988">'''Super-imperialism''' is a [[Marxist]] term with two possible meanings. It refers either to the ''[[hegemony]]'' of an imperialist great power over its weaker rivals, who then are called ''sub-imperialisms'', or to a comprehensive ''supra-structure'' above a set of (theoretically) equal-righted [[new imperialism|imperialist]] states. The latter meaning is the older one and had become rare by the middle of the 20th century.

== Origin of the term ==
The expression "super-imperialism" first appeared in November 1914 as an (inaccurate) translation of the newly coined German term ''[[Ultra-imperialism|Ultra-Imperialismus]]''. William E. Bohn, the translator of [[Karl Kautsky]]’s article "Der Imperialismus",&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kautsky: ''Der Imperialismus''. In: ''Die Neue Zeit''. 32 (1914), vol. 2, p. 908–922.&lt;/ref&gt; (= "The Imperialism") seemed to believe, that the terms ''Kartell'' and ''Ultra-Imperialismus'' were not reasonable for the audience of the "International socialist review" – an American Marxist journal.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl.: Karl Kautsky, Imperialism and the War, in: International socialist review, 15 (1914), 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Bohn faced a double problem: [[Cartel]]s were much less familiar in the USA than the concern-like, tauter organized [[Trust (monopoly)]] entities – and the word ''ultra'', which in English means ''exaggerated'' or ''extreme''. Thus, he paraphrased Kautsky’s ideas in terms more familiar to American readers,somewhat distorting Kautsky's statement.

== Recent meanings ==
Together with the revival of the [[Theories of New Imperialism|imperialism debates]] in the 1970s the term ''super-imperialism'' recovered, but got modified in its content. It served now to describe the domination by the super-power [[American imperialism|USA]] within a system of [[new imperialism|imperialism]], in which the other imperialist powers were set back in their abilities and thus were second-class.&lt;ref&gt; [[Robert Rowthorn|Bob Rowthorn]], Imperialism in the Seventies: Unity or Rivalry?, in: New Left Review, 59 (1971), 31; Michael Hudson: Super imperialism : the economic strategy of American empire, New York, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the same time, the German term ''Ultraimperialismus'' was translated into English literally with ''[[ultra-imperialism]]'' and was now used to describe a rather equal-righted inter-imperialist cooperation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5986">'''Thomas C. Stanford''' (September 30, 1865 – January 14, 1946) is the founder of [[Carey, Idaho|Carey]], [[Idaho]]. He was a Mormon [[rancher]] and a state [[legislator]] in [[Idaho]].

[[Image:Thomas C Stanford.jpg|thumb|Thomas C. Stanford]]

==Early years==
Stanford was born in [[Logan, Utah|Logan]], [[Utah Territory]], a son of Stephen and Louisa (Forman) Stanford. His father, a native of England, came to Utah Territory in 1861. Of the ten children, Thomas C. was the fifth and was four years old when the family moved to [[Salt Lake City]], where he grew up and received a basic education. He later attended the [[Brigham Young Academy]].&lt;ref name="French"&gt;Hiram Taylor French, ''History of Idaho: A Narrative Account of Its Historical Progress, Its People and Its Principal Interests,'' Lewis Publishing Co., Chicago and New York (1914).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homesteading and ranching==
In 1884, at age nineteen he moved to [[Albion, Idaho]]. After a brief stay there, he located a [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]] in the [[Little Wood River]] valley, which was the center of his operations as a [[ranching|rancher]] and [[Cowman (profession)|stockman]].  Along with operating his own ranch, Stanford also worked for a number of years as a cowboy, stage driver, and freighter.&lt;ref name="Hawley"&gt;James H. Hawley, ''History of Idaho: The Gem of the Mountains,'' The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago (1920).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 he bought additional land and engaged in sheep raising as well a continuing his interests in cattle and horses. He was regarded as one of the most successful [[livestock]] producers in Idaho. In his later years he also raised hogs on an extensive scale. His home place consisted of 160 acres (64.7 hectares) near Carey, [[Blaine County, Idaho]]. Further down the valley he had 250 acres (101.2 hectares) of land. Both farms were under [[irrigation]] and capable of producing fine crops.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

Stanford continued actively in the sheep business until 1918. He then sold his flocks and focused on general ranching and cattle raising. Over the years he replaced the family's original log home with "a beautiful and commodious residence" and similarly upgraded the ranching structures.&lt;ref name="Hawley"/&gt;

==Organizing stock growers==
Stanford was instrumental in the organized activities of Idaho stock growers and in 1908-10 served as president of the Idaho Wool Growers Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahowool.org/AboutUs.html|title=idahowool.org - This website is for sale! - Non Profit sheep Idaho sheep breeds wool information membership sheep skin products Resources and Information.|website=www.idahowool.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in getting much legislation passed beneficial to wool growers, and as president of the association called the first meeting that led to the organization of the National Wool Warehouse.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; Western wool growers organized the National Wool WareHouse and Storage Company at a 1909 meeting in Chicago. Their intent was to deal cooperatively with wool buyers to regularize pricing and avoid wide swings in the supply-demand situation.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Haas, David L. Holder, "Livestock and Wool Cooperatives,"'' Cooperative Information Report 1, Section 14'', U. S. Department of Agriculture, Government Printing Office (May 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==
Stanford was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the Ninth [[Idaho Legislature]] in the lower house (1907), and Governor Hawley appointed him a member of the [[livestock]] board of the state. For many years he played an active and influential role at the Republican state convention. Supporters and friends urged him to run for governor in 1912, but he declined.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; He did serve in Blaine County as a Justice of the Peace and in other local offices.&lt;ref name="Hawley"/&gt;

==Family and religion==
In June 1900, he married Ida Ivie, daughter of John Ivie, an old Indian scout, who served during the early [[Indian wars]] in Utah. The four children of their marriage were: Roka, Esther, Charles, and Frank.

Mr. Stanford was for a number of years actively connected with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and served as a [[missionary]] in [[New Zealand]] for three years and for two years in the United States.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

==Community development==
Mr. Stanford assisted in developing irrigation projects in Blaine County and surrounding parts of Idaho. In fact, his name seems to have been associated both as a worker and liberal contributor to all the [[community development]] projects in the Little Wood River valley for many years. He was an organizer of the local [[telephone company]] at Carey, served as vice president of the company, and was afterward elected its president. He was also one of the organizers of the Carey State Bank and at one time was president of the Cooperative Store.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

He moved to [[Boise, Idaho]] in 1945 due to ill health and died there. He is buried in the Cloverdale Memorial Park, west of Boise.&lt;ref&gt;Don P. Haacke, "Biographical Sketch: Thomas C. Stanford," ''The Thomas C. Stanford Papers, MSS 12'', Boise State University Special Collections (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Union of European Democrats''' ({{lang-pl| Unia Europejskich Demokratów}}, UED) is a [[Centrism|centrist]] [[list of political parties in Poland|political party in Poland]]. The party was founded on 12 November 2016 following the merger of the [[Democratic Party – demokraci.pl]] structures of the association of [[:pl:Europejscy Demokraci (stowarzyszenie)|European Democrats]].&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/europejscy-demokraci-lacza-sie-z-partia-demokratyczna/zxecng |publisher=onet.pl|title=European Democrats join with the Democratic Party |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name refers to the tradition of the [[Democratic Union (Poland)|Democratic Union]] and the [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]], of which it is the successor. The party is generally characterised as socially liberal, with a moderate Christian Democratic wing. The UED strongly emphasizes commitment to the values of the European Union.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt;

==History==
The extra-parliamentary Democratic Party merged with the European Democrats on 12 November 2016. The UED was led by the former Democratic Party president Elizabeth Bińczycka, with Jacek Protasiewicz serving as her Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uniaeuropejskichdemokratow.pl/#wladze-partii|title=The leaders |publisher=Union of European Democrats |access-date=3 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President [[Lech Walesa]] and the chairman of the [[Committee for the Defence of Democracy]] [[Mateusz Kijowski]] spoke at the party's founding conference, and letters were read from former presidents [[Bronislaw Komorowski]] and [[Aleksander Kwasniewski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiadomosci.com/nowa-partia-na-polskiej-scenie-politycznej-unia-europejskich-demokratow/|title=The new party on the Polish political scene - Union of European Democrats |publisher=wiadomosci.com |access-date=3 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme==
The party program declaration is concerned with the defense of Polish democracy, support for Poland's membership of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], and the putative threats to Poland posed by Russia. The UED supports the creation of a [[Federalisation of the European Union|federal Europe]]. The party also advocates civil service reform, the separation of church and state, and the introduction of civil partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uniaeuropejskichdemokratow.pl/#ued-tabs-2|title=Program Declaration |publisher=Union of European Democrats |access-date=3 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiadomosci.com/nowa-partia-na-polskiej-scenie-politycznej-unia-europejskich-demokratow/|title=The new party on the Polish political scene - Union of European Democrats |publisher=Union of European Democrats |access-date=3 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}{{Chinese|s=维权运动|t=維權運動|p=Wéiquán Yùndòng|l=rights defending movement}} 
The '''Weiquan movement''' is a non-centralized group of lawyers, legal experts, and intellectuals in China who seek to protect and defend the [[civil right]]s of the citizenry through litigation and legal activism. The movement, which began in the early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights abuses]], and written appeal letters, despite opposition from [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights, protection for [[HIV/AIDS in the People's Republic of China|AIDS]] victims, [[Pollution in China|environmental damage]], [[Freedom of religion in China|religious freedom]], [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|the press]], and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice" /&gt;

Individuals involved in the Weiquan movement have met with occasionally harsh reprisals from Chinese officials, including disbarment, detention, harassment, and, in extreme instances, torture.&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice" /&gt; Authorities have also responded to the movement with the launch of an education campaign on the "socialist concept of rule of law," which reasserts the role of the Communist Party and the primacy of political considerations in the legal profession, and with the [[Three Supremes]], which entrenches the supremacy of the Communist Party in the judicial process.

==Background==
Since the [[Legal history of China#1978-1981|legal reforms]] of the late 1970s and 1980s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has moved to embrace the language of the [[rule of law]] and establish a modern [[Court system of the People's Republic of China|court system]]. In the process, it has enacted thousands of new laws and regulations, and begun training more legal professionals.&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice" /&gt; The concept of "rule of law" was enshrined in the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]], and the CCP embarked on campaigns to publicize the idea that citizens have protection under the law. At the same time, however, a fundamental contradiction exists in the implementation of rule of law wherein the CCP insists that its authority supersedes that of the law;&lt;ref name=fordham/&gt; the constitution enshrines rule of law, but also emphasizes the principle of the "leadership of the Communist Party." The judiciary is not independent, and is therefore subject to politicization and control by the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice"/&gt; This has produced a system that is often described as "rule by law," rather than rule of law.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Because judicial decisions are subject to the sometimes arbitrary assessments of the CCP, citizens who attempt to make use of the legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Cai Yongshun, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Collective_resistance_in_China.html?id=e97ErKeqb08C "Collective Resistance in China: Why Popular Protests Succeed or Fail"] (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges, such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs, often have few means of pursuing an effective defense.

The Weiquan movement coalesced in the early 2000s in response to these inherent contradictions and the arbitrary exercise of [[Judicial system of the People's Republic of China|legal authority in China]], though its roots could be traced to the consumer protection movement that began in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt; The movement is informal, and can be understood as including lawyers and legal activists who advocate for [[civil rights]] and defend the interests of citizens against corporations, government or Communist Party organs. Fu Hualing and Richard Cullen note that Weiquan lawyers "are generally always on the side of the weaker party:  (migrant) workers v. employers in labor disputes; peasants in cases involving taxation, persons contesting environmental pollution, land appropriation, and village committee elections; journalists facing government censorship; defendants subject to criminal prosecution; and ordinary citizens who are discriminated against by government policies and actions."&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt;

The emergence of the Weiquan movement was made possible by a confluence of factors, including a market for their services, and an emerging rights consciousness. It was also facilitated by the 1996 "Lawyers Law," which changed the definition of lawyers from "state legal workers" to professionals holding a legal certificate who perform legal services. The law effectively delinked lawyers from the state, and gave lawyers greater (though still limited) autonomy within the profession.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lynch&gt;Elizabeth Lynch, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1825431 Rule of Law Mirage], George Washington International Law Review, 26 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weiquan lawyers tend to be especially critical of the lack of judicial independence in China. Rather than challenging particular laws, they frame their work as being in keeping with Chinese laws, and describe their activities as a means of defending and upholding the Constitution against abuses.&lt;ref name="transnational"/&gt; As such, Weiquan lawyering has been described as a form of [[Rightful resistance]].&lt;ref name="conscientious"/&gt;

==Weiquan lawyers==
{{Weiquan Lawyers}}
{{main|Weiquan Lawyers}}
Weiquan Lawyers ({{zh|维权律师}}), or "rights protection" lawyers, refer to a small but influential movement of lawyers, legal practitioners, scholars and activists who help Chinese citizens to assert their constitutional, civil rights and/or public interest through litigation and legal activism.&lt;ref name="MarazziChen2012"/&gt; In the context of a rising number of lawyers in China,&lt;ref name="peopledaily"/&gt; the proportion of Weiquan lawyers is very small&lt;ref&gt;Teng Biao, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/24/AR2009072402940.html 'Chinese Human Rights Lawyers Under Assault'], ''The Washington Post'', 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Weiquan Lawyers face considerable personal, financial and professional risks.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt;

Notable Weiquan Lawyers include [[He Weifang]], [[Xu Zhiyong]], [[Teng Biao]], [[Guo Feixiong]] and [[Chen Guangcheng]], [[Gao Zhisheng]], [[Zheng Enchong]], and [[Li Heping]].&lt;ref name="purdue"/&gt; Many barefoot lawyers are peasants who teach themselves enough law to file civil complaints, engage in litigation, and educate fellow citizens about their rights.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Some Weiquan lawyers are the pragmatists and some are more radical.&lt;ref name="fordham"/&gt;

==Major fields==

===Freedom of expression===

Although freedom of speech is enshrined in Article 35 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chinese authorities enforce restrictions on political and religious expression.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/hrrolindex.php 'Human rights and rule of law in China']&lt;/ref&gt; Such restrictions are sometimes in accordance with [[Political offences in China#Inciting subversion of the state|Article 105]] of the criminal code, which contains vague and broadly defined provisions against "[[inciting subversion of state power]]". Weiquan lawyers, along with international human rights organizations, have argued that the provisions against subversion are inconsistent both with China's own constitution and with international human rights standards, particularly in light of the lack of transparency and clear guidelines used in applying the laws.&lt;ref name="freedom"/&gt;

Several Weiquan lawyers have been involved in litigation and other forms of advocacy to defend the rights to free expression for individuals charged with the crime of subversion.&lt;ref name="gpo"/&gt; Notable cases include that of [[Liu Xiaobo]], a prominent Beijing intellectual sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion in December 2009. [[Chengdu]] activist [[Tan Zuoren]] was sentenced to five years for inciting subversion for publishing writings on the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square Massacre]], advocating for the families of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]] victims, and accepting interviews from the Falun Gong-affiliated [[Sound of Hope]] radio. His lawyers were reportedly barred from entering the courtroom.&lt;ref name="chinageeks"/&gt; In October 2009, intellectual [[Guo Quan]] was sentenced to 10 years in prison for publishing "reactionary" articles online.&lt;ref name="intermediate"/&gt;
 
Weiquan lawyers have also challenged the application of state secret laws, which are sometimes used to prosecute individuals who disseminate information on politically sensitive issues. In November 2009, for instance, lawyers were involved in arguing for [[Huang Qi]], a [[Sichuan]] activist who had advocated online for the parents of Sichuan earthquake victims. Huang was sentenced to three years in prison for possession of state secrets.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

===Judicial independence===
The Chinese Constitution enshrines rule of law, but simultaneously emphasizes the principle of the "leadership of the Communist Party."&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice"/&gt; The legal profession itself is subordinate to the authority of the Communist Party; the [[Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Justice]], not the [[All China Lawyers Association|bar associations]], is responsible for issuing and renewing lawyers' licenses.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; Weiquan lawyers have argued that this structure precludes the emergence of genuine rule of law, and in some cases have advocated for reforms to advance judicial independence and the protection of legal professionals.

In late August 2008, a collection of several dozen Beijing lawyers signed a petition stating that the Beijing Bar Association leaders should be elected by the organization's members, rather than being appointed. The petition letter stated that selection process in place for the Association's directors is inconsistent with official guidelines and the Chinese constitution, and should be replaced with a democratic voting process.&lt;ref name="chinafreepress"/&gt; The Beijing Bar Association responded to the campaign by asserting that "Any individual who uses text messages, the web or other media to privately promote and disseminate the concept of direct elections, express controversial opinions, thereby spreading rumors within the Beijing Bar Association, confuse and poison people's minds, and convince people of circumstances that do not exist regarding the so-called 'Call For Direct Elections For the Beijing Bar Association' is illegal."&lt;ref name="chinafreepress2"/&gt; The following year, the Beijing Bureau of Justice refused to renew the licenses of 53 Beijing Weiquan lawyers, all of whom had signed the petition for elections to the Bar Association.&lt;ref name="nytimes3"/&gt;

===Land rights===
{{Main|Forced evictions in China}}

[[File:Shanghai Tower construction, April 12, 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|The practice of land requisitions and forced evictions is widespread in China as local governments make way for private real estate developers.]]
Under [[Property Law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese property law]], there is no privately held land; "urban land" is owned by the state, which grants land rights for a set number of years. Rural, or "collectively owned land," is leased by the state for periods of 30 years, and is theoretically reserved for agricultural purposes, housing and services for farmers.&lt;ref name=CECCproperty/&gt;

[[Forced eviction (China)|Forced evictions]] are forbidden under [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which China has ratified. Under China's constitution and other property laws, expropriation of urban land is permitted only if it is for the purpose of supporting the "public interest," and those being evicted are supposed to receive compensation, resettlement, and protection of one's living conditions.  The "public interest" is not defined, however, and abuses are common in the expropriation process, with many citizens complaining of receiving little or no compensation.&lt;ref name=CECCproperty&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_house_committee_prints&amp;docid=f:61507.pdf 2010 Annual Report]. 10 October 2010, pp 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced evictions with little or no compensation occur frequently in both urban and rural China, with even fewer legal protections for rural citizens. Collectively owned rural land may be "reallocated" at the discretion of authorities, and in many regions local governments collude with private developers to reclassify rural land as urban land, which can then be sold.&lt;ref name=CECCproperty/&gt; from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, an estimated 40 million Chinese peasants were affected by land requisitions.&lt;ref name=fordham/&gt; Citizens who resist or protest the evictions have reportedly been subjected to harassment, beatings, or detention,&lt;ref name=CECCproperty/&gt; and land-related grievances occasionally escalate into large-scale protests or riots.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/4462719 “Protest in China: The Cauldron Boils”], 29 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Weiquan lawyers have advocated for the rights of individual citizens whose land and homes were taken with inadequate compensation, including Shanghai lawyer Zheng Enchong.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; [[Ni Yulan]], a Beijing lawyer, was herself left homeless by forced eviction, and became an outspoken advocate for victims before being sentenced to two years in prison.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"/&gt;

In 2007, a 54-year-old farmer in Heilongjiang [[Yang Chunlin]] published numerous articles on human rights and land rights, and helped to organise a petition entitled: "We want human rights, not the Olympics."&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; The petition reportedly collected over ten thousand signatures.&lt;ref name="voanews"/&gt; Yang was put to trial, and sentenced to five years in prison, where he has allegedly been tortured. [[Li Fangping]] was hired to defend him, but was denied access to his client.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

===Defense of ethnic minorities===
Several Weiquan lawyers, including Teng Biao, [[Jiang Tianyong]],&lt;ref name="thestar"/&gt; and Li Fangping,&lt;ref name="rfa"/&gt; offered legal aid to [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] in the wake of the March 2008 [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan protests]]. The protests resulted in the imprisonment of at least 670 Tibetans, and the execution of at least four individuals. Chinese government sources asserted that the unrest and violence in Tibet had been masterminded by the [[Dalai Lama]] and executed by his followers for the purpose of fomenting unrest and disrupting the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing. The [[Open Constitution Initiative]] (OCI), operated by several Weiquan lawyers and intellectuals, issued a paper in May 2009 challenging the official narrative, and suggesting that the protests were instead a response to economic inequities, [[Han Chinese]] migration, and religious sentiments. The OCI recommended that Chinese authorities better respect and protect the rights and interests of the Tibetan people, including religious freedom, and pursue the reduction of economic inequality and official corruption.&lt;ref name="cecc"/&gt;

Tibetan Filmmaker Dhondup Wangcheng was sentenced to six years in prison for making a documentary on [[human rights in Tibet]] in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics. Two lawyers who sought to represent him, [[Chang Boyang]] and [[Li Dunyong]], faced threats and harassment for their advocacy.&lt;ref name="amnesty"/&gt;

In July 2010, a group of Chinese activists including Teng Biao co-signed a letter to the Chinese leadership to protest the 15-year prison sentence that had been meted out to [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] journalist Halaite Niyaze.&lt;ref name="uyghurcongress"/&gt; Niyaze was not permitted to have a lawyer at his trial, where he was charged with "endangering state security." According to reports, Niyaze was being charged because he had criticized the Chinese government in an interview with a Hong Kong news agency for not doing enough to prevent the [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

===Falun Gong===
[[Image:April25Zhognanhai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Falun Gong practitioners demonstrate outside the [[Zhongnanhai]] compound in April 1999 to demand official recognition. The practice was banned three months later.]]
Falun Gong, a spiritual qigong discipline that once claimed tens of million adherents in China, was banned in July 1999 under the leadership of the Communist Party, and a campaign was launched to suppress the group.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; In an attempt to have Falun Gong adherents renounce their belief in the practice, they are subject to state-sanctioned, systematic violence in custody,&lt;ref name="washingtonpost4"/&gt; sometimes resulting in death.  Some sources indicate hundreds of thousands may have been detained in reeducation-through-labor camps for practicing Falun Gong and/or resisting persecution.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalpost"/&gt;

In November 1999, the [[Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China|Supreme People's Court]] offered a judicial interpretation of article 300 of the criminal code, stating that Falun Gong should be regarded as a ''"xie jiao''," or cult.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; Large numbers were subsequently sentenced to long prison terms, often under article 300, in what are typically very short trials without the presence of a lawyer.&lt;ref name=CECC2010&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_house_committee_prints&amp;docid=f:61507.pdf ' Annual Report 2010], 10 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 alone, the Falun Dafa Information Center reported that several hundred Falun Gong adherents have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 18 years.&lt;ref name="faluninfo"/&gt; Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, note that the application of the law to persecute Falun Gong adherents contravenes both China's own constitution and international standards.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; Several Weiquan lawyers have argued similarly while defending Falun Gong adherents who face criminal or administrative sentencing for their beliefs. Lawyers who have defended Falun Gong include [[Guo Guoting]], Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu,&lt;ref name="hrichina"/&gt; Wang Yonghang,&lt;ref name="amnesty5"/&gt;[[Tang Jitian]] and Liu Wei,&lt;ref name="nytimes3"/&gt; among others.

In addition to litigation work, Weiquan lawyers like Gao Zhisheng have also advocated publicly and in the media for human rights for Falun Gong. In 2004 and 2005, Gao wrote a series of letters to China's top leadership detailing accounts of torture and sexual abuse against Falun Gong practitioners, and calling for an end to the persecution of the group.&lt;ref name=fordham/&gt; In response, Gao lost his legal license, was put under house arrest, detained, and was reportedly tortured.&lt;ref name="nytimes7"/&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
Some Weiquan lawyers have advocated for the rights of HIV/AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood drives. In the 1990s, government officials in central China, and especially in [[Henan]], encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order to supplement their incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of [[Li Changchun]], the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan.

[[Hu Jia (activist)|Hu Jia]] is arguably the most well known advocate for HIV/AIDS victims, having served as the executive director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute of Health Education and as one of the founders of the non-governmental organization Loving Source.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/chinese-activist-gets-jail-sentence-20080403 'Hu Jia jailed for three and a half years], 4 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
[[Chen Guangcheng]], a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to prominence for defending victims of China's [[one-child policy]]. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may only have one child, though there are exceptions for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves only children.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Fitzpatrick, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912861,00.html 'A Brief History of China's One-Child Policy'], ''Time'', 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, Chinese authorities and family planning staff have been accused of carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 'Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China'], 22 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Elegant, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1615936,00.html 'Why Forced Abortions Persist in China'], ''Time'', 30 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions.&lt;ref name="wp_8July06"&gt;{{cite news| title = Chinese to Prosecute Peasant Who Resisted One-Child Policy |work=The Washington Post| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/07/AR2006070701510.html| date = 8 July 2006 | first=Philip P. | last=Pan | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underground Christians===
China's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, yet also provides a caveat specifying that only "normal" religious activities are permitted. In practice, religious freedom is granted only within the strictly prescribed parameters of the five officially sanctioned "patriotic" religious associations of [[Buddhist Association of China|Buddhism]], [[Chinese Taoist Association|Taoism]], [[Islamic Association of China|Islam]], [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement|Protestantism]] and [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association|Catholicism]].  Groups falling outside the state-administered religions, including "underground" or [[Chinese house church|"house church"]] Christians, are subject to varying degrees of repression and persecution.&lt;ref name=DOS2011&gt;U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/171651.pdf July–December, 2010 International Religious Freedom Report: China (Includes Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau)], 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are no definitive figures on the number of underground Christians in China, some estimates have put their total number in excess of 70 million. At least 40 Catholic bishops operate independently of official sanction, and some are under surveillance, house arrest, detention, or have disappeared.&lt;ref name=DOS2011/&gt; Several leaders and members of underground [[Protestant]] churches have also been detained and sentenced to reeducation through labor or prison terms. Violent raids and demolitions have been carried out on underground churches, sometimes resulting in injury to congregants inside. Chinese officials have labelled several underground Protestant churches as a ''xie jiao'' (translated literally as "evil religion"), or cult, thus providing a pretext for harsher punishment of members.&lt;ref name="cecc8"/&gt;

Several prominent Weiquan lawyers themselves identify with the underground Protestant movement, and have sought to defend church members and leaders facing imprisonment. These include Zhang Kai, Li Heping, and Gao Zhisheng. Former house church leader [[Bob Fu]]'s US-based organization "ChinaAid" has sponsored legal cases, and provided "rule-of-law training" and legal help for distressed clients in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/02/nation/la-na-nn-texas-chinaaid-20120502|title=Chen Guangcheng plight: To Texas man, it echoes of the familiar|first=Molly|last=Hennessy-Fiske|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=28 June 2013|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/respect-for-life-declining-in-china-dissident-20130404-2h826.html|title=Respect for life declining in China: dissident|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=28 June 2013|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|first=Audrie|last=Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other initiatives===
A number of specific events have attracted the help and attention of Weiquan activists. In the March 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province, [[Sichuan schools corruption scandal|shoddy school construction]] resulted in the collapse of several schools full of students. A number of Weiquan lawyers, including [[Tan Zuoren]], were involved in advocating for the rights of parents, and in investigating allegations that corrupt officials were responsible for the poor construction. Parents and lawyers met with reprisals from Chinese officials for their activism.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Later the same year, it was revealed that large quantities of infant formula had been [[2008 Chinese milk scandal|tainted with melamine]], causing 300,000 infants to fall ill and resulting in several deaths. A group of parents of the victims were reportedly detained for attempting to draw media attention to their plight. Dozens of lawyers—particularly from the provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shandong—offered pro-bono legal services to victims, but their efforts were [[2008 Chinese milk scandal#Pressure on the legal profession|obstructed by authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Jane Macartney| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5152668.ece |title=US places ban on Chinese food imports |date= 14 November 2008 |work=The Times |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radio Free Asia, [http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/lawyer-10072008150126.html 'Lawyers’ Outrage at Milk Case Ban'], 7 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual human rights cases, such as the [[Deng Yujiao incident]] and the death of [[Qian Yunhui]], have also drawn help from rights defenders such as Wu Gan.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

In 2003, a group of legal scholars, including [[Teng Biao]] and [[Xu Zhiyong]], formed the [[Open Constitution Initiative]] ({{zh|公盟}}) to advocate for greater rule of law. The organization was involved in the [[Sun Zhigang]] case, and has advocated for petitioners, labor rights, freedom of expression, HIV/AIDS victims, Tibetans, land rights, and protection of public health, among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/14098751 'Open Constitution Closed'], 23 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government response==

===Retrenchment on rule of law===
In response to the emergence of the Weiquan movement, which often makes use of the official language about "rule of law" to justify its work, in April 2006 a political campaign was launched to solidify the Communist Party's leadership over judicial work, combat the idea of greater independence for judges and lawyers, and educate people and judicial authorities about the "socialist concept of rule of law." The campaign was announced by [[Luo Gan]], then the head of the Party Central Committee's [[Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China|Political and Legislative Affairs Committee]].  Luo urged that in order to protect political stability, "forceful measures" be adopted "against those who, under the pretext of rights-protection (weiquan), carry out sabotage."&lt;ref name="qsjournal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald C. Clarke, "China's Legal System: New Developments, New Challenges," Cambridge University Press, (Cambridge, UK: The China Quarterly, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The launch of the campaign coincided with a crackdown on Weiquan lawyers.

Shortly after the campaign's launch, Party Committees provided instruction to judges reminding them of the political goals that their work must uphold. According to one document issued to judges in [[Zhejiang]] and quoted by [[Human Rights Watch]], "Recently, some judges have started to believe that to be a judge you just have to strictly apply the law in a case. In fact, this kind of concept is erroneous [...] all the legal formulations have a clear political background and direction [...] We must stamp out the kind of narrow viewpoint that thinks that you can also do court work by having judicial independence."&lt;ref name="lawbase"/&gt;

During a December 2007 conference on political-legal work, CCP general secretary [[Hu Jintao]] articulated the theory of the "[[Three Supremes]]," which emphasized again that legal work should regard as supreme the concerns and interests of the Communist Party. In March 2008, [[Wang Shengjun]] was confirmed as the new head of the [[Supreme People's Court]]. Wang, who has no formal legal training himself, abandoned the efforts of his predecessors to improve judicial competence, training, and autonomy, and instead placed primary importance on the ideological implications of the "Three Supremes" theory and upholding the leadership of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt;

In 2010, China's Ministry of Justice issued two new regulations intended to "strengthen the supervision and management of lawyers and law firms". According to the Associated Press, the new regulations would serve to "allow authorities to punish lawyers ... for actions such as talking to the media or even causing 'traffic troubles.'"&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;

In March 2012, China's Ministry of Justice issued a new directive requiring lawyers first obtaining their license or renewing an existing license to swear an oath of loyalty to the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong|first=Edward|title=Chinese Lawyers Chafe at New Oath to Communist Party|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/world/asia/chinese-lawyers-chafe-at-new-oath-to-communist-party.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ministry's website, a section of oath includes the following: “I swear to faithfully fulfill the sacred mission of legal workers in socialism with Chinese characteristics. I swear my loyalty to the motherland, to the people, to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, and to protect the dignity of the Constitution and laws." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Oath Lawyers Must Take" (进入律师队伍必须进行宣誓)|url=http://www.moj.gov.cn/index/content/2012-03/21/content_3445267.htm?node=7318|publisher=Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression of lawyers and coercive measures===
Weiquan lawyers have faced various challenges to their work from the Chinese government, including disbarment or suspension, violence, threats, surveillance, arbitrary detention, and prosecution.&lt;ref name="hrw9"/&gt; This is particularly true for lawyers who take up politically sensitive cases. Reports of harassment, intimidation, and violence against Weiquan lawyers increased in 2006 following the launch of the campaign to promote the "socialist concept of the rule of law." Authorities have refused to renew the licenses of several dozen Weiquan lawyers,&lt;ref name="cecc10"/&gt; and several have effectively been banned for life from the legal profession. In 2009, for instance, at least 17 Weiquan lawyers were not permitted to renew their legal licenses after taking on politically sensitive cases.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights in China, [http://hrichina.org/content/300 Chinese Rights Defense Lawyers Under All-out Attack by the Authorities], 4 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Weiquan lawyers have themselves been sentenced to prison in response to their activism. A selection of notable instances of suppression are listed here:

* [[Gao Zhisheng]], once recognized as one of China's ten most promising lawyers, was an advocate for a range of disenfranchised individuals and minorities. In 2006, after he wrote a series of letters to the Chinese leadership concerning the torture of Falun Gong adherents, Gao had his legal license revoked and his law firm was shut down.&lt;ref name="nyt1134536400"/&gt; His family was placed under house arrest, and he was detained for six months. Gao was sentenced, with a five-year reprieve, to four years in prison. He has been the subject of several prolonged disappearances into custody, during which he has reportedly been tortured.&lt;ref name="taipeitimes"/&gt;
* On 27 December 2007, AIDS and pro-democracy activist Hu Jia was detained as part of a crackdown on dissents during the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. A well known rights advocate who had advocated on behalf of AIDS victims, peasants, victims of land requisitions, Hu had also been critical of the lack of human rights progress that had been made ahead of the Olympic games.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Yardley, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/world/asia/01iht-dissident.1.9665869.html 'China formally arrests detained activist Hu Jia'], ''The New York Times'', 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hu pleaded not guilty at his trial in March 2008. On 3 April 2008, he was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison for "inciting subversion of state power."&lt;ref name="Chinese civil rights activist sentenced for subversion"/&gt; He had previously been under house arrest, and has reportedly been beaten by police.&lt;ref name="amnesty11"/&gt;
* In response to his work to bring a class action lawsuit against family planning authorities in Linyi, Shandong Province in 2005, [[Chen Guangcheng]] was put under house arrest, threatened, detained, and beaten. Three other Weiquan activists – [[Li Fangping]], Li Subin, and [[Xu Zhiyong]]— visited him to offer support, but were themselves beaten and interrogated. On 24 August 2006, he was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for "damaging property and gathering crowds to disturb transport order." Following his release, he remains under house arrest.&lt;ref name="hrw12"/&gt;
* On 22 April 2010, Beijing lawyers Liu Wei and Tang Jitian were permanently disbarred for defending Falun Gong practitioners.&lt;ref name="amnesty13"/&gt;
* On 13 May 2009, lawyers Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu are violently beaten and detained in [[Chongqing]] for investigating the death of Jiang Xiqing, a 66-year-old Falun Gong practitioner killed in a labor camp. One month earlier, Beijing lawyer Cheng Hai was similarly beaten by police in Sichuan province for seeking to defend a Falun Gong adherent.&lt;ref name="hrichina"/&gt;
* [[Yang Chunlin]] was arrested in July 2007 and charged with "inciting subversion of state power".&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; His trial began in February 2008 in the city of [[Jiamusi]].&lt;ref name="rfa15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www"/&gt; Yang was sentenced to five years in prison on 24 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chrdnet.org/2008/03/24/“olympics-prisoner”-yang-chunlin-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison/ "'Olympic Protester' Yang Chunlin sentenced to five years in prison"], Chinese Human Rights Defenders, 24 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained his innocence throughout the trial. During and after the hearing at which he was sentenced, Yang was reportedly beaten with an electric rod on at least two occasions.&lt;ref name="rfa17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost18"/&gt;
* On 4 July 2009, around 20 security agents broke into the home of Wang Yonghang. Wang, a Weiquan lawyer from [[Dalian]] City, had defended Falun Gong adherents. He was taken into custody for interrogation and was reportedly beaten severely.&lt;ref name="amnesty5"/&gt; Wang's lawyers were not permitted to contact him. In November 2009, Wang was sentenced in a closed court to seven years in prison for his advocacy on behalf of Falun Gong practitioners. When his lawyers were permitted to see him in January 2010, they reported that he had been tortured.&lt;ref name="gpo20"/&gt;
* On 17 July 2009, authorities in Beijing raided and shuttered the Open Constitution Initiative, an NGO established by legal scholars Teng Biao and Xu Zhiyong.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost21"/&gt;
* On 20 February 2011, several Weiquan activists were detained following online calls for pro-democracy protests in China, including Chen Wei, Jiang Tianyong, Tang Jitian, and Teng Biao.&lt;ref name="guardian22"/&gt;
* In May 2014, as multiple Chinese activists began preparing for the 25th anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], a number of lawyers were arrested for planning or being suspected of planning demonstrations. Among those arrested was [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a lawyer who was involved in organising the demonstrations in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kaiman, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/china-cracks-down-dissent-tiananmen-anniversary China cracks down on dissent ahead of Tiananmen anniversary], ''The Guardian'', 13 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International response==
Although there is relatively little awareness of the Weiquan phenomenon as a movement outside of China, Western governments and human rights organizations have consistently expressed concern over the treatment of individual Weiquan lawyers in China, some of whom have faced disbarment, imprisonment, prolonged disappearance, sentencing and alleged torture for their work in promoting civil rights and speaking out against one-party rule. In October 2010, a bipartisan group of 29 members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] pressed President Obama to raise the cases of Liu Xiaobo and Gao Zhisheng with the Chinese leadership, writing of Gao Zhizheng's prolonged detention: "If lawyers are hauled away for the "crime" of defending their clients, then even the pretense of rule of law in China has failed."&lt;ref name="indiatimes"/&gt; The U.S. State Department claims to have raised the cases of these two individuals with their Chinese counterparts.&lt;ref name="america"/&gt;

In 2008, Hu Jia was awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] by the [[European Parliament]] recognizing his human rights advocacy.&lt;ref name="bbc23"/&gt; The same year, Hu and Gao Zhisheng received nominations for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and were considered to be favorites for the award.&lt;ref name="telegraph24"/&gt; Two years later, seven members of the U.S. House of Representatives nominated imprisoned lawyers Gao Zhisheng and Chen Guangcheng, along with fellow dissident Liu Xiaobo for the prize.&lt;ref name="members"/&gt; The letter noted that these individuals have sought to "raise the Chinese people's awareness of their dignity and rights, and to call their government to govern within its constitution, its laws, and the international human rights agreements it has signed," and thereby made a significant contribution to peace. The Nobel Prize Committee awarded the honor to Liu in absentia in December 2010.&lt;ref name="nytimes25"/&gt;

'''White supremacy''' or '''white supremacism''' is the [[racist]] belief that [[white people]] are superior to people of other [[Race (human classification)|races]] and therefore should be dominant over them. White supremacy has roots in [[scientific racism]], and it often relies on [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] arguments. Like most similar movements such as [[neo-Nazism]], white supremacists typically oppose members of other races as well as [[Jews]].

The term is also typically used to describe a [[political ideology]] that perpetuates and maintains the [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[historical revisionism|historical]], or [[institutional racism|institutional]] domination by white people (as evidenced by historical and contemporary sociopolitical structures such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[Jim Crow laws]] in the [[United States]], and ''[[apartheid]]'' in [[South Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America |last=Wildman |first=Stephanie M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |publisher=NYU Press |location= |isbn=0-8147-9303-7 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helms 2016 6–7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=2016|title=An election to save White Heterosexual Male Privilege|url=|journal=Latina/o Psychology Today|volume=3|pages=6–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of white supremacism put forth different conceptions of who is considered white, and different groups of white supremacists identify various racial and cultural groups as their primary enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spaces of Hate: Geographies of Discrimination and Intolerance in the U.S.A. |last=Flint |first=Colin |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-93586-5 |page=53 |quote=Although white racist activists must adopt a political identity of whiteness, the flimsy definition of whiteness in modern culture poses special challenges for them. In both mainstream and white supremacist discourse, to be white is to be distinct from those marked as non-white, yet the placement of the distinguishing line has varied significantly in different times and places.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic usage, particularly in usage which draws on [[critical race theory]] or [[Intersectionality]], the term "white supremacy" can also refer to a political or socioeconomic system, in which white people enjoy a structural advantage ([[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level.

==History==
White supremacy has ideological foundations that date back to 17th-century [[scientific racism]], the predominant paradigm of human variation that helped shape international relations and racial policy from the latter part of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] until the late 20th century (marked by decolonization and the abolition of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]] in 1991, followed by that country's [[South African general election, 1994|first multiracial elections in 1994]]).

[[File:One side of the monument erected to race prejudice New Orleans Louisiana 1936.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Battle of Liberty Place Monument|Battle of Liberty Place monument]] in Louisiana was erected in 1891 by the white dominated New Orleans government. An inscription added in 1932 states that the [[1876 US Presidential Election]] "recognized white supremacy in the South and gave us our state". It was removed in 2017 and placed in storage.]]

In 1937, [[Winston Churchill]] told the Palestine Royal Commission: "I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place."

===Germany===
[[Nazism]] promoted the idea of a superior [[Germanic people]] or [[Aryan race]] in [[Germany]] during the early 20th century. Notions of white supremacy and Aryan racial superiority were combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining the belief that white people were members of an Aryan "[[master race]]" which was superior to other races, particularly the [[Jews]], who were described as the "Semitic race", [[Slavs]], and [[Names of the Romani people|Gypsies]], which they associated with "cultural sterility". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|''ancien régime'']] in France on racial degeneracy caused by racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the "purity" of the Nordic or Germanic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan or Germanic peoples and Jewish culture.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul.

As the [[Nazi Party]]'s chief racial theorist, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] oversaw the construction of a human racial "ladder" that justified [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Hitler's racial and ethnic policies]]. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]], which regarded [[Nordic race|Nordics]] as the "master race", superior to all others, including other Aryans (Indo-Europeans).&lt;ref&gt;Though Rosenberg does not use the word "master race". He uses the word "Herrenvolk" (i. e., ruling people) twice in his book ''The Myth'', first referring to the [[Amorite]]s (saying that [[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]] described them as fair skinned and blue eyed) and secondly quoting [[Victor Wallace Germains]]' description of the English in "The Truth about Kitchener". ("The Myth of the Twentieth Century") - Pages 26, 660 - 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg got the racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' from the title of [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stoddard, Lothrop| authorlink = Lothrop Stoddard| year = 1922| title = The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man| publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| location = New York| isbn =| url = https://archive.org/details/revoltagainstciv00stoduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

==Academic use of the term==
The term ''white supremacy'' is used in academic studies of racial power to denote a system of structural or [[societal racism]] which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or the absence of racial hatred. White racial advantages occur at both a collective and an individual level (''[[ceteris paribus]]'', {{Nowrap|i. e.}}, when individuals are compared that do not relevantly differ except in ethnicity). Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:
{{quote|By "white supremacy" I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist [[hate group]]s. I refer instead to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansley|first=Frances Lee|title=Stirring the Ashes: Race, Class and the Future of Civil Rights Scholarship|journal=Cornell Law Review|year=1989|volume=74|pages=993ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editor1 = Richard Delgado |editor2= Jean Stefancic | last = Ansley | first = Frances Lee | title = Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror | chapter = White supremacy (and what we should do about it) | date = 1997-06-29 | page = 592}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] educators, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre–[[civil rights movement]] era of open white supremacism and the current racial power structure of the United States. It also expresses the visceral impact of structural racism through "provocative and brutal" language that characterizes racism as "nefarious, global, systemic, and constant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis US | isbn = 978-0-415-98980-0 | editor1 = Jeanette Davidson | editor2 = George Yancy | last = Davidson | first = Tim | title = Critical perspectives on Bell Hooks | chapter = bell hooks, white supremacy, and the academy | date = 2009-02-23 | page = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic users of the term sometimes prefer it to ''racism'' because it allows for a distinction to be drawn between racist feelings and white racial advantage or [[white privilege|privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;"Why is it so difficult for many white folks to understand that racism is oppressive not because white folks have prejudicial feelings about blacks (they could have such feelings and leave us alone) but because it is a system that promotes domination and subjugation?" {{Cite book | publisher = Turnaround Publisher Services Limited | isbn = 978-1-873262-02-3 | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Black Looks: Race and Representation | date = 2009-02-04 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grillo and Wildman cite hooks to argue for the term ''racism/white supremacy'': "hooks writes that liberal whites do not see themselves as either prejudiced or interested in domination through coercion, and they do not acknowledge the ways in which they contribute to and benefit from the system of white privilege." {{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editor1 = Richard Delgado | editor2 = Jean Stefancic | last1 = Grillo | first1 = Trina |author2= Stephanie M.

The term's recent rise in popularity among [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] activists has been characterized by some as counterproductive. [[John McWhorter]], a specialist in language and race relations, has described its use as straying from its commonly accepted meaning to encompass less extreme issues, thereby cheapening the term and potentially derailing productive discussion.&lt;ref name="left language"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/left-language-right-language/|title=Left Language, Right Language|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McWhorter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4584161/white-supremacy/|title=The Difference Between Racial Bias and White Supremacy|website=TIME |last1=McWhorter|first1=John|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://heterodoxacademy.org/2017/12/14/an-interview-with-john-mcwhorter/|title=An Interview with John McWhorter about Politics and Protest|date=2017-12-14|work=HeterodoxAcademy.org|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political columnist [[Kevin Drum]] attributes the term's growing popularity to frequent use by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]], describing it as a "terrible fad" which fails to convey nuance. He claims that the term should be reserved for those who are trying to promote the idea that whites are inherently superior to blacks and not used to characterize less blatantly racist beliefs or actions.&lt;ref name="MotherJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/11/lets-please-kill-white-supremacy-fad|title=Let's Be Careful With the "White Supremacy" Label|website=Mother Jones|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/the-scourge-of-the-left-too-much-stigma-not-enough-persuasion/508961/|title='The Scourge of the Left': Too Much Stigma, Not Enough Persuasion|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|access-date=2016-12-04|language=en-US|newspaper=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the academic definition of white supremacy has been criticized by Conor Friedersdorf for the confusion it creates for the general public inasmuch as it differs from the more common dictionary definition; he argues that it is likely to alienate those it hopes to convince.&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf" /&gt;

==Ideologies and movements==
Supporters of [[Nordic race#Nordicism|Nordicism]] consider the "Nordic peoples" to be a superior race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordicism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nordicism|website=Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, white supremacy was attached to emerging theories of racial hierarchy. The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] attributed cultural primacy to the white race:
{{quote|The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahman]]s, the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], and the rulers of the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur Schopenhauer | title = ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' | year = 1851 | pages = Vol. 2, Section 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] argued in his 1916 book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', that the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements, and that [[Miscegenation|admixture]] was "race suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Madison | title = The Passing of the Great Race | publisher = C.

[[File:Klan-in-gainesville.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Members of the second [[Ku Klux Klan]] at a rally in 1923.]]

In the United States, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) is the group most associated with the white supremacist movement. Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and do not focus solely on [[discrimination]] based on skin color.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"&gt;http://law.jrank.org/pages/11302/White-Supremacy-Groups.html White Supremacy Groups&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK's reasons for supporting [[racial segregation]] are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The KKK and other white supremacist groups like [[Aryan Nations]], [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] and the [[White Patriot Party]] are considered [[Antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] promulgated white supremacy based on the belief that the [[Aryan race]], or the Germans, were the ''[[master race]]''. It was combined with a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programme]] that aimed for [[racial hygiene]] through compulsory sterilization of sick individuals and extermination of [[Untermensch]]en ("subhumans"): [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|Slavs]], Jews and [[antiziganism|Romani]], which eventually culminated in [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Gumkowski, Janusz; Leszczynski, Kazimierz; Robert, Edward (translator) (1961).

Mitchell. Cultural Locations of Disability. University of Michigan Press. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Identity]] is another movement closely tied to white supremacy. Some white supremacists identify themselves as [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Odinists]], although many Odinists reject white supremacy. Some white supremacist groups, such as the [[South Africa]]n [[Boeremag]], conflate elements of [[Christianity]] and Odinism. [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity]] (formerly known as "The World Church of the Creator") is [[atheism|atheistic]] and it denounces Christianity and other [[Theism|theistic religions]].&lt;ref name="Atheistic"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HB1wyFPRGm4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=atheism+white+supremacy#v=onepage&amp;q=atheistic&amp;f=false|title =The new white nationalism in America: its challenge to integration|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|quote=For instance, Ben Klassen, founder of the atheistic Church of the Creator and author of ''The White Man's Bible'', discusses Christianity extensively in his writings and denounces it as a religion that has brought untold horror into the world and has divided the white race.|accessdate = 2011-03-27|isbn =9780521808866|date =2002-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atheism"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rBgn3xB75ZcC&amp;pg=PA493&amp;dq=competing+atheistic+white+racist+movement#v=onepage&amp;q=competing%20atheistic%20white%20racist%20movement&amp;f=false|title =The World's Religions: Continuities and Transformations|publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|quote=A competing atheistic or panthestic white racist movement also appeared, which included the Church of the Creator/ Creativity (Gardell 2003: 129–34).|accessdate = 2011-03-27|isbn =9781135211004|date =2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this, its ideology is similar to that of many Christian Identity groups because it believes in the [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|antisemitic conspiracy theory]] that there is a "Jewish conspiracy" in control of governments, the banking industry and the media. [[Matthew F. Hale]], founder of the World Church of the Creator, has published articles stating that all races other than white are "mud races", which is what the group's religion teaches.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

The white supremacist ideology has become associated with a racist faction of the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]], despite the fact that when the skinhead culture first developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by black fashions and [[Black music|music]], especially [[Jamaica]]n [[reggae]] and [[ska]], and African American [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ska.about.com/musicperform/ska/library/1999/aa081699a.htm |title=Smiling Smash: An Interview with Cathal Smyth, a.k.a.

White supremacist recruitment activities are primarily conducted at a [[grassroots]] level as well as on the [[Internet]]. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in white supremacist websites.&lt;ref name="Adversity"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=1Adams |first1=Josh |first2=Vincent J. |last2=Roscigno |title=White Supremacists, Oppositional Culture and the World Wide Web |work=University on North Carolina Press 84 (2005): 759–88 |date=20 November 2009 |jstor=3598477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet provides a venue to openly express white supremacist ideas at little [[social cost]], because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.
