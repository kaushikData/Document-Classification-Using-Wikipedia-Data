The '''2006 [[FESPIC Games]]''', officially known as the '''9th and Final FESPIC Games''', was an Asia-Pacific disabled multi-sport event held&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiyonoie.or.jp/03_feel/images/FESPIC-02.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210113542/http://www.taiyonoie.or.jp/03_feel/images/FESPIC-02.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-12-10|title=FESPIC Federation: its Games and History (2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia, from 25 November to 1 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind.org.my/sites/default/files/International%20Paralympic%20Events%20and%20Achievements.pdf|title=International Paralympic events and achievements}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kln.gov.my/web/can_vancouver/n2006/-/asset_publisher/ME2g/blog/9th-fespic-games-november-25-%E2%80%93-december-1-2006-kuala-lumpur|title=9th FESPIC Games Kuala Lumpur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first and last time Malaysia hosted the games. Malaysia is the eighth and the last FESPIC organisation member to host the FESPIC games after Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, China, Thailand, and South Korea. Around 3,641 athletes from 46 nations competed at the games which featured 19 sports. The games was opened by Prime Minister of Malaysia, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi at the KLFA stadium. 

The final medal tally was led by China, followed by Thailand, South Korea, and host Malaysia. Several games and national records were broken during the games. The games were deemed generally successful with the rising standard of disabled sports competition among the Pacific and Asian nations for other active sports tournaments. With the games concluded, the FESPIC organisation was officially defunct, and since then, the Asian Countries participate at the [[Asian Para Games]] held after every [[Asian Games]], beginning with the [[2010 Asian Para Games]] in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]].

==Host city==
In 1999, Malaysia, New Zealand and Hong Kong formally submitted the bid for the games. With the withdrawal of New Zealand and Hong Kong from the bid, the hosting right was awarded to Malaysia which named its capital, Kuala Lumpur as the host city.

==Development and preparation==
The KL'06 9th FESPIC Games Organising Committee was formed to oversee the staging of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301024432/http://www.kl06fespicgames.com.my/kl06/default.asp?p=kl06&amp;p1=org2&amp;what=committee|url=http://www.kl06fespicgames.com.my/kl06/default.asp?p=kl06&amp;p1=org2&amp;what=committee|title=Organising Committee |archivedate=1 March 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venues===
The 2006 FESPIC Games used a mix of new, existing and temporary venues. Most venues were public-sporting facilities which will revert to public use after the games. No major retrofitting work were done in most venues as most had been used to host major multi-disciplinary events such as the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]], [[2001 Southeast Asian Games]] and the [[2001 ASEAN Para Games]].

At the centrepiece of the activities was the National Sports Complex. Incorporating the new 87,411-seat national stadium, it hosted most of the events.

A games village was not built. Instead, a "village in the city" concept saw athletes and officials housed in 13 hotels across the Klang Valley. They are physically near to the assigned sports venues of the games, and was hoped that it will add vibe to the hosting venues and reduce post-games costs in converting a dedicated games village to other uses.

The '''Final FESPIC Games''' had 20 venues for the games. 11 in Kuala Lumpur, 7 in Selangor and 1 each in Putrajaya and Negeri Sembilan respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kl06fespicgames.com.my/venues/default.asp?p=venues&amp;what=competition |title=Competition Venues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301024406/http://www.kl06fespicgames.com.my/venues/default.asp?p=venues&amp;what=competition |archivedate=1 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo===
[[File:2006 FESPIC Games mascot.gif|thumb|right|"Ujang" and "Che Mek", the Chevrotain, the official mascots of the games.]]

The initial KL in the logo, represents Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia as the venue of the Games, '06 represents to the year 2006, the heart shape in the '0' portrays the loving, caring and hospitality of the people of Malaysia, while the brush stroke sphere represents unity of the Malaysians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301024104/http://www.kl06fespicgames.com.my/kl06/default.asp?p=kl06&amp;what=logo|url=http://www.kl06fespicgames.com.my/kl06/default.asp?p=kl06&amp;what=logo|title=KL'06 Logo|date=10 July 2016|archivedate=1 March 2007|work=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mascot===
The official mascot of the 2006 FESPIC Games is a pair of [[mousedeer]] named "Ujang", the male one and its female counterpart, "Cek Mek". The mousedeer is a native animal in Malaysia locally known as pelanduk or kancil which is shy, but very agile and quick thinking. It is a favourite character in local folktales commonly known as "Sang Kancil", noted for its intelligence, wit, cunning feints and quick reaction to escape from all kinds of danger, especially from its enemies. The adoption of mousedeer as the games mascot is to represent the courage of the Paralympic athletes in overcoming challenges and the odds. The names of the mascots, Ujang and Che Mek, are common nicknames for local Malay youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301024123/http://www.kl06fespicgames.com.my/kl06/default.asp?p=kl06&amp;what=mascot|url=http://www.kl06fespicgames.com.my/kl06/default.asp?p=kl06&amp;what=mascot|title=Mascot KL'06|date=10 July 2016|archivedate=1 March 2007|work=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The games==

Lee Seng Chow, the blind discus throw athlete then take the oath on behalf of the athletes. Finally the torch was lit by four Malaysian paralympic athletes, Razali Jaafar, Hisham Khaironi, Choo Kam Chan and David Wang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2006&amp;dt=1126&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Sukan&amp;pg=su_02.htm#ixzz4FR8gBve5 |title=Sukan Fespic dibuka penuh tradisi|work=[[Utusan Malaysia]]|date=26 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Bangladesh]]''' has competed in nine Summer [[Olympic Games]]. They have never competed in the Winter Games.

In 2016, [[Siddikur Rahman]] became the first Bangladeshi to qualify for the Olympic games in golf,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/sports/rio-2016-olympics/golfer-siddikur-rahman-becomes-first-bangladesh-player-to-qualify-for-olympics-2910010/|title=Golfer Siddikur Rahman becomes first Bangladesh player to qualify for Olympics|date=13 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bangladesh sent seven athletes to compete, more than any other year. The country has sent other representatives to the Games thanks to the [[wild card (sports)|wildcard]] process.&lt;ref name=swing&gt;[http://english.cri.cn/2886/2008/06/15/53@369141.htm "Bangladesh's Preparation for Beijing Olympics in Full Swing"]. ''Xinhua''. June 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh, with an approximate population of 170 million, is the most populous country in the world never to have won an Olympic medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikemehalick/the-10-most-populated-countries-to-never-win-an-ol|title=The 10 Most Populous Countries To Never Win An Olympic Medal|work=BuzzFeed Community|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh Olympic Association head [[Wali Ullah]] has stated that Bangladesh's weak economy accounts for its poor results in sports.&lt;ref name=swing/&gt;

'''Benjamin Fischer''' (born 19 October 1980) is a retired [[Liechtenstein]] [[association football|football]] [[forward (association football)|striker]].
He began his career by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] club [[Grasshopper Club Zürich]] in the youth team and holds a Swiss passport.
In February 2011 he retired from professional football following a recurrence of back and thigh injuries.

==International career==
Benjamin Fischer nearly made history when, in the final qualifier for World Cup 2006 in Germany against Portugal, who needed a point to qualify, he scored a 32nd minute opening goal. However Liechtenstein were unable to keep their lead, with a Pauleta equaliser and an 85th minute Nuno Gomes winner turning the game on its head for a second time.

'''Cooper Field'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guhoyas.com/facilities/gu-cooper-field.html&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly known as Harbin Field or Multi-Sport Field) is a 2,500-seat [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on the campus of [[Georgetown University]]. The field was originally used for intramurals and was adopted for soccer in 1994 as Harbin Field. The name was changed to "Multi-Sport Field", a placeholder pending final construction, to reflect the football team's use of the field starting in 2003. In 2015, Georgetown changed the name to Cooper Field in honor of a $50 million gift from Peter and Susan Cooper which funded athletic leadership programs at Georgetown and construction upgrades to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clarke|first1=Liz|title=Georgetown athletics will receive $50 million gift from California couple|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/georgetown-athletics-will-receive-50-million-gift-from-california-couple/2015/10/06/4aabe678-6c5c-11e5-aa5b-f78a98956699_story.html|accessdate=10 October 2015|work=Newspaper|publisher=Washington Post|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfinished Construction==
The field has been awaiting further construction since 2005, when work was halted on completing permanent bleachers and other facilities. As a result, it remains the smallest stadium in all of [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] Football Bowl Subdivision or Football Championship subdivisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/sports/ncaafootball/georgetown-trying-to-get-football-program-righted.html |title= Obstacles Nothing New for Georgetown Football |first= Tom |last= Flynn |date= November 15, 2012 |accessdate= July 11, 2014 |work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the school athletics teams play home games there, including the [[Georgetown Hoyas football|Hoyas football team]], the men's and [[Georgetown Hoyas women's lacrosse|women's lacrosse]] teams, the women's field hockey team, and the [[Georgetown University Rugby Football Club]]. The professional [[Chesapeake Bayhawks|Washington Bayhawks]] of [[Major League Lacrosse]] used the field for most of their games during the 2007 season.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Lights were installed on the field in early 2009. The surface is artificial, made of [[FieldTurf]].

'''Druzbha-78''' ({{lang-uk|Дружба-78}}; {{lang-en|Friendship-78}}) was an U-18 [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]].

== Criminal allegations and death ==
In January 2012, the coach and owner of the team, [[Ivan Pravilov]] was accused of fondling two 14-year-old Ukrainian players who he had invited to his home in [[Philadelphia]]. He was placed in a Federal Detention Center but was found to be unresponsive at around 3:00 am; by 3:45, he was pronounced dead at the hospital.  Evidence suggested that he had committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2012-02-10/news/31046644_1_ivan-pravilov-hockey-coach-federal-investigators Hockey coach charged with assaulting youths found dead in cell], [[Philly.com]] (10 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by the city medical examiner's office on 23 February 2012.&lt;ref name=kyivpost&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/123008/ Autopsy:Charged Ukrainian coach committed suicide], [[Kyiv Post]] (23 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estadio Cuauhtémoc''' is a [[Soccer-specific stadium|football stadium]] in the city of [[Puebla]], Mexico.It is the home of [[Puebla F.C.]] [http://www.puebla-fc.com] It is currently the fourth biggest [[Soccer-specific stadium|football stadium]] in Mexico by capacity.The stadium has been the host of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]. From November 2014 – 2015, the stadium went through massive renovations.

As of November 2015, Cuauhtémoc Stadium is considered to be an innovation in textile design and sports architecture in Mexico, since it is the first and only stadium in Latin America to have a facade totally covered with [[ETFE]].[http://dunn-lwa.com/portfolio/cuauhtemoc-stadium-etfe/]

==History==

'''Estadio Cuauhtémoc''' has been the home for Puebla F.C. for the last 40 years and has witnessed various national and international tournaments the stadium has located in [[Puebla, Puebla]] Mexico.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The Stadium was originally designed in 1965 by architect [[Pedro Ramírez Vázquez]], who also designed El [[Estadio Azteca]] and the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

It was inaugurated on October 6, 1968 during the pre-inauguration of the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]. It is named after the Mexican brewery Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma, who paid for most of the construction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081118070058/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1968/1968v2pt1.pdf 1968 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. Part 1. pp. 75-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first years of existence the club had a capacity of 35,000, which was expanded in 1986 for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]. A mural that had been painted by Jesús Corro Ferrer, which represented the human race, had to be covered up. The stadium has an official capacity for 42,648, though on some occasions it has had attendance of above 50,000 .The Stadium is the 4th largest, as well as the tallest, stadium in Mexico, behind the [[Estadio Jalisco]] in [[Jalisco]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ignagura.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Ticket stub from first league match in 1968]] --&gt;
The stadium has hosted 2 [[Mexican Primera División]] finals. The first came in the 1982-83 tournament when Puebla F.C. defeated [[C.D. Guadalajara]]

The second final was played in the 1989-90 tournament against [[Club Universidad de Guadalajara]] where Puebla managed to beat the club from [[Jalisco]] 4-3.The stadium has also hosted the now defunct [[Copa México]] tournament, which the club managed to win in 1990, becoming just the 5th stadium to host both finals and have its home team win.

The stadium has also hosted club international tournaments, such as the [[CONCACAF Champions League]] and [[Copa Interamericana]]. In 2008 the stadium was supposed to host its first [[Copa Sudamericana]] tournament, but did not after the [[CONCACAF]] decided to pull out of all [[CONMEBOL]] competitions due to the clubs' lack of interest in the domestic conference tournaments.

===1970 FIFA World Cup===
{{Main article|1970 FIFA World Cup}}
El Estadio Cuauhtémoc played host to the [[Uruguay national football team]] for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. In the first game on June 2, 1970 [[Uruguay]] defeated [[Israel]] 2-0. The second match was against Italy, which ended in a scoreless draw. The third match was against Sweden, where Uruguay fell 1-0. Players such as [[Sandro Mazzola]] and [[Luigi Riva]] went on to play in the finals against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], which they lost to 4-1.

===1986 FIFA World Cup===
{{Main article|1986 FIFA World Cup}}

In 1986 Mexico hosted the 13th World Cup, becoming the first country to ever host the competition for a second time. This occurred due to [[Colombia]] announcing in 1983 that they were not going to be available to organize the tournament.

In this World Cup, Puebla played a bigger role than the previous one in 1970. This time, the defending champions Italy played at El Estadio Cuauhtémoc. Italy played against [[Argentina]] on July 5, 1986, where they tied 1–1 with a goal from the football legend [[Diego Armando Maradona]].
The second game was against the [[Korea Republic national football team]], who Italy managed to defeat 3–2.

In the round of 16 match, Argentina defeated Uruguay 1-0 in El Estadio Cuauhtémoc, which was played on June 5, 1986. In the Quarter Finals, the stadium hosted the match between Spain and Belgium which ended in a 1–1 draw, sending them to extra time, and ultimately to a penalty shootout. Van der Elst would score the final and deciding goal, sending Belgium to the semi finals. In that match, the stadium registered the biggest crowd with an attendance of 45,000.

In 2012 the state of Puebla was named to host the [[2013 CONCACAF U-20 Championship]] .

===Renovation 2015===
[[Puebla FC]] announced a complete renovation of the stadium that was set to begin in the late 2014. The stadium was old, in bad condition, and needed a fresh new image. In early 2014, the [[Governor of Puebla]], [[Rafael Moreno Valle Rosas]] announced the official project.

The stadium would grow in capacity from 42,648 to 51,726 spectators, and would be completely remodeled from the inside, with 2 new ramps built in the north and south side of the stadium, along many other things.

Initially the facade of the stadium would be covered with crystal. [http://dunn-lwa.com/portfolio/cuauhtemoc-stadium-etfe/]

[[Dünn Lightweight Architecture]], experts in sports and textile architecture in Mexico and Latin America, made a new proposal with [[ETFE]] because of the many advantages that [[ETFE]] had over other materials for that particular project. 
[[ETFE]] has been used in many world renowned architectural works, such as the [[Water Cube]] for the Olympics in [[Beijing]], [http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/beijing/water-cube.htm] and by many European stadiums such as the [[Allianz Arena]] in [[Munich]].

Renovations started in November 2014 and were initially planned to be done by October 2015. Due to the city's rainy season, construction slowed down and in August 2015 it was announced that the construction would be done by November 2015.
As of November 2015, the Cuauhtémoc stadium would be the first and only stadium in Mexico and Latin America to have a facade completely covered with [[ETFE]].  
On November 18 the stadium was reopened in a friendly match against [[Boca Juniors]] of [[Argentina]] before Puebla's final week of [[Liga MX]] [[Apertura 2015]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">'''FanHouse''' was a sports website owned by [[AOL]]. Launched in September 2006, FanHouse was considered the Internet's most linked sports blog by aggregator BallHype won [[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'s 2008 EPpy Award for "Best Sports Blog",&lt;ref name="eppy1"&gt;[http://www.eppyawards.com/Content/Past_2008_Winners-10-.aspx 2008 EPpy Winners]&lt;/ref&gt; and was named as a finalist for the award in 2009.&lt;ref name="eppy2"&gt;[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003964325 2009 EPpy nominees]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, FanHouse began hiring experienced print journalists, including [[Jay Mariotti]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Kevin Blackistone]] of the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', and [[Lisa Olson]] of the ''[[New York Daily News]]''. FanHouse has continued to bolster its roster, hiring writers away from the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' and ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'', among others. FanHouse kept its stable of traditional bloggers as well, including widely published [[Michael David Smith]] and [[Elie Seckbach]]. Upon its 2006 launch, it became the first sports blog to pay a large number of sports bloggers a per-post fee.

FanHouse was managed by executive producer Randy Kim. Previous executive producers have moved on to leadership positions at [[Yahoo!]] (Jamie Mottram), [[Yardbarker]] (Alana Nguyen) and [[NBC]] (John Clifford Ness). Many FanHouse bloggers have also moved on to other publications.

In January 2011, ''[[Sporting News]]'' announced a partnership with AOL to take over editorial control of FanHouse; the site was merged into that of ''Sporting News'', and eventually discontinued.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/sports/14fanhouse.html Sporting News Will Take Over AOL FanHouse Content]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bar grip hanging.jpg|right|thumb|A grip in use on the [[high bar]]]]
'''Grips''' are devices that are worn on the hands of [[artistic gymnastics|artistic gymnasts]] when performing on various apparatus. They are worn by female gymnasts on the [[uneven bars]], and by male gymnasts on the [[high bar]] and [[still rings]]; it is rare to wear them on the [[parallel bars]]. Grips are used to enhance the gymnast's grip on the apparatus and to reduce [[friction]], which can cause painful blisters and ''rips'', in which outer layers of skin separate and tear away from the hand. 

Grips are optional and are not used by all gymnasts. Some athletes substitute sports tape or [[gauze]] for grips, while others use bare hands. Most gymnasts apply powdered chalk (typically [[magnesium carbonate]]) to their grips, or to their hands if not using grips so that they do not slip.

==Construction==
A grip consists of a wide strip of [[leather]] joined to a wrist strap. The leather strip, which covers and protects the palm of the hand, is approximately five centimeters wide and has finger holes at one end. On properly fitted grips, the finger holes will be positioned at the first [[knuckle]]s of the inserted fingers.

Some types of grips, known as ''dowel grips'', incorporate a leather-covered [[dowel|dowel rod]] or [[Pipe (material)|pipe]] to create a linear bump on the outer face of the grip. This bump, in conjunction with the bar, forms a [[detent]] that serves to leverage the gymnast's grip, thus reducing the hand pressure needed to maintain a hold on the apparatus.

The wrist strap is used to secure the grip to the gymnast's hand and to transfer body weight from the fingers to the wrist. The grip is enhanced when the dowel rests on the apparatus, pulling the leather tight, and transferring some of the load to the wrist, reducing the grip required during the most dynamic elements. The leather portion of the grip encircles the wrist and is then locked in place with either [[velcro]] or [[buckle|buckles]]. Gymnasts typically wear soft material, such as cloth [[wristband]]s, under the wrist straps to prevent skin [[Chafing (skin)|chafing]]. Some brands of grips include soft, removable pads that fit under the wrist straps.

==Types of grips==
Most competitive gymnasts wear dowel grips. On the high bar, men use grips that have three finger holes and a small dowel, whereas grips used on the still rings have a larger dowel and two finger holes. Grips used on the parallel bars (Very uncommon) have two finger holes and a small dowel. Women's grips have two finger holes and resemble men's ring grips with a smaller dowel.

Gymnasts at lower competition levels and those participating in recreational gymnastics typically use grips without dowel rods. Such grips provide no mechanical advantage for gripping the bar; they are used primarily to minimize friction injuries. These grips are usually less expensive and are made of thinner leather.

'''HC Tiroler Wasserkraft Innsbruck''' is an [[Austria]]n professional [[ice hockey]] team in the [[Erste Bank Eishockey Liga]] (EBEL). They play their home games at [[OlympiaWorld Innsbruck]] complex in [[Innsbruck]].

==History==
The club was founded in 1994 as HC Innsbruck and in 1999 with the introduction of wealthy sponsor "Tyrolean Hydropower" were renamed to HC Tiroler Wasserkraft Innsbruck. Since the [[2000-01 Austrian Hockey League season|2000-01]] season the Sharks were playing in the highest Austrian league and was the first Innsbruck team in the first division since the exit of [[EV Innsbruck]] upon completion of the 1992–93 season.

Over the years, the team reached the semi-finals on multiple occasions, however, never made it to the finals. In recent seasons,{{When|date=January 2016}} the majority of the squad has often been replaced, but this was reflected on the budget constraints. In addition, the team failed to win in the final stages of the season, year after year, repeated regularly and culminated in the early playoff exits. 

On 3 March 2009, Innsbruck announced its intention to leave the Erste Bank Hockey League for financial reasons and resume play in the second tier, the [[Austrian National League]].

Their return season in the new league was completed with a successful squad that consisted mainly of young Tyrolean players. The club finished the regular season first, seven points ahead of the runner-up [[Dornbirner EC]]. In the final Innsbruck were defeated by the Vorarlbergians, losing the series 3 games to 1. Two years later, the club succeeded in winning the second division National League Championship, for the first time in franchise history. A short time later it was announced that Innsbruck would return to the top-flight EBEL league.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.erstebankliga.at/8f234634abc92fd30763c1e63b89d9bf.html?arrSave%5BArticleID%5D=8690 |title=Erste Bank Eishockey Liga reaches its 10th season |publisher=''[[Erste Bank Eishockey Liga]]'' |date=2012-09-03 |accessdate=2012-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812223914/http://www.erstebankliga.at/8f234634abc92fd30763c1e63b89d9bf.html?arrSave%5BArticleID%5D=8690 |archivedate=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venue==
The Innsbruck Sharks' home games are played at the [[OlympiaWorld Innsbruck]] complex, which hosted the Winter Olympic Games in 1964 and 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.olympiaworld.at/en/ | title = Olympiaworld venue listings | publisher = ''olympiaworld.at'' | date = 2013-04-15 | accessdate = 2013-04-15 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innsbruck have the luxury to play at two home venues within the complex, after first primarily using the [[Olympiahalle Innsbruck]] which seated approximately 8,000, which was renovated for the [[2005 IIHF World Championship]]. 

In 2005, the Sharks moved to also play in the smaller capacity and purpose built [[Tyrolean Ice Arena]] which seats 3,200. The Olympiahalle is now used sparingly, specially to cater for larger crowds on important rival games or playoff games.

The [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] were not expected to perform well, the team having only recently returned to high-level international competition following the dismantling of [[apartheid]]—the country was hosting the World Cup, thus earning an automatic entry. Freeman and Damon play, respectively, [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Francois Pienaar|François Pienaar]], the captain of the South Africa [[rugby union]] team, the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]].&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite web

''Invictus'' was released in the United States on December 11, 2009. The title refers to the Roman divine epithet [[List of Roman deities#Invictus|Invictus]] and may be translated from the [[Latin]] as "undefeated" or "unconquered". "Invictus" is also the title of [[Invictus|a poem]], referred to in the film, by British poet [[William Ernest Henley]] (1849–1903). The film was met with positive critical reviews and earned [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for Freeman ([[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]) and Damon ([[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]).

==Plot==
{{chronological|plot section's}}
On 11 February 1990, [[Nelson Mandela]] is released from [[Drakenstein Correctional Centre|Victor Verster Prison]] after having spent 27 years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Archive: Nelson Mandela's 'walk to freedom' in 1990 after his release from prison|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/nelson-mandela/9958896/Archive-Nelson-Mandelas-walk-to-freedom-in-1990-after-his-release-from-prison.html|language=en|accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, Mandela is elected the [[South African apartheid referendum, 1992#Aftermath|first black President of South Africa]]. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|post-Apartheid era]], including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and [[white South Africans]], which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black [[African National Congress|ANC]] additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust.

While attending a game between the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]], the country's [[rugby union]] team, and [[England national rugby union team|England]], Mandela recognises that the black people in the stadium are cheering for England, and not their own country, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on [[Robben Island]]. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, [[François Pienaar]] ([[Matt Damon]]), and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with François a British poem, "[[Invictus]]", that had inspired him during his time in prison.

François and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of [[Racism in South Africa|racial tensions]], as for many black people, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise [[Baasskap|white supremacy]]. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country.

Things begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks begins to grow among the black population. By the second game, the whole country comes together to support the Springboks and Mandela's efforts. Mandela's security team also grows closer as the racially diverse officers come to respect their comrades' professionalism and dedication.

As Mandela watches, the Springboks defeat one of their [[History of rugby union matches between Australia and South Africa|arch-rivals]]—[[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], the defending champions and known as the Wallabies—in their opening match. They then continue to defy all expectations and, as Mandela conducts trade negotiations in [[Taiwan]], defeat [[France national rugby union team|France]] in heavy rain to advance to [[1995 Rugby World Cup Final|the final]] against their other [[History of rugby union matches between New Zealand and South Africa|arch-rival]]: [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], known as the All Blacks. New Zealand and South Africa were universally regarded as the two greatest rugby nations, with the Springboks then the only side to have a winning record (20–19–2) against the All Blacks, since their first meeting in 1921.

Before the game, the Springbok team visits [[Robben Island]], where Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail. There, Pienaar is inspired by Mandela's will and his idea of self-mastery in "Invictus". François mentions his amazement that Mandela "could spend thirty years in a tiny cell, and come out ready to forgive the people who put [him] there".

Supported by a large home crowd of all races at [[Ellis Park Stadium]] in [[Johannesburg]], Pienaar motivates his teammates for the final. Mandela's security detail receives a scare when, just before the match, a [[South African Airways]] [[Boeing 747-200]] jetliner flies in low over the stadium. It is not an assassination attempt though, but a demonstration of [[patriotism]], with the message "Good Luck, Bokke"—the Springboks' Afrikaans nickname—painted on the undersides of the plane's wings. Mandela also famously arrives onto the field before the match wearing a Springbok cap and a replica of Pienaar's #6 jersey.

The Springboks complete their run by beating the All Blacks 15–12 in [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]], thanks to a [[drop goal]] from [[Rugby union positions#Fly-half|fly-half]] [[Joel Stransky]]. Mandela and Pienaar meet on the field together to celebrate the improbable and unexpected victory, and Mandela hands Pienaar the [[Webb Ellis Cup|William Webb Ellis Cup]], signaling that the Springboks are indeed rugby union's world champions. Mandela's car then drives away in the traffic-jammed streets leaving the stadium. As Mandela watches South Africans celebrating together in the street from his car, his voice is heard reciting "Invictus" again.

==Reception==
The film was met with generally positive reviews. Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 76% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 237 reviews, with an average score of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus is: "Delivered with typically stately precision from director Clint Eastwood, ''Invictus'' may not be rousing enough for some viewers, but Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman inhabit their real-life characters with admirable conviction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/invictus/ |title=Invictus (2009) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/invictus |title=Invictus Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[David Ansen]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title='Invictus': A Whole New Ballgame | url= http://www.newsweek.com/id/224352 | publisher=[[Newsweek]] | author= [[David Ansen]] | date=November 25, 2009| accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Anthony Peckham's sturdy, functional screenplay, based on John Carlin's book ''Playing the Enemy'', can be a bit on the nose (and the message songs Eastwood adds are overkill). Yet the lapses fade in the face of such a soul-stirring story—one that would be hard to believe if it were fiction. The wonder of ''Invictus'' is that it actually went down this way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Invictus | url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091209/REVIEWS/912099994 | publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | author= Roger Ebert | date=December 9, 2009| accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a very good film. It has moments evoking great emotion, as when the black and white members of the presidential security detail (hard-line ANC activists and Afrikaner cops) agree with excruciating difficulty to serve together. And when Damon's character—François Pienaar, as the team captain—is shown the cell where Mandela was held for those long years on Robben Island. My wife, Chaz, and I were taken to the island early one morning by Ahmed Kathrada, one of Mandela's fellow prisoners, and yes, the movie shows his very cell, with the thin blankets on the floor. You regard that cell and you think, here a great man waited in faith for his rendezvous with history.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shave Magazine''{{'}}s Jake Tomlinson wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Review: Invictus | url= http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/reviews/091201 | publisher=[[Shave (magazine)|Shave]] | author= Jake Tomlinson | date= December 10, 2009| accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eastwood's film shows how sport can unify people, a straightforward and moving message that leaves audiences cheering. The sports, accurate portrayal and the solid storyline earn this movie a manliness rating of 3/5. However, the entertainment value, historical accuracy and strong message this movie delivers earn it an overall rating of 4.5 stars. Definitely, worth seeing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'s Todd McCarthy wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Invictus | url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941681.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | author= Todd McCarthy | date=November 27, 2009| accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inspirational on the face of it, Clint Eastwood's film has a predictable trajectory, but every scene brims with surprising details that accumulate into a rich fabric of history, cultural impressions and emotion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===People involved===
[[Don Edward Beck|Don Beck]], who had helped the rugby team succeed in 1995 as a close friend and adviser to coach Kitch Christie and team captain François Pienaar, found the film faithful to the true story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">The '''Jeantaud''' was a [[France|French]] [[automobile]] manufactured in [[Paris]] from 1893 until 1907.  It was the brainchild of Charles Jeantaud, a [[coachbuilder]] who built his first [[electric car]]riage in 1881.  Among the vehicles he constructed was the first car to set a [[land speed record]] ({{convert|39.24|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on}}, driven by [[Gaston de Chasseloup-Laubat]]), as well as [[coupe]]s and [[hansom cab]]s; in these the driver sat high, and to the rear. Some cars had an unusual bevel-gear [[front-wheel-drive]] layout. From 1902 to 1904, Jeantaud offered a range of gas-engined cars similar to 1898 [[Panhard]]s.

==Specifications==
The 1899 Jeantaud Duc Profilée was powered by a 36 horsepower (26.8 kilowatts) electric engine. The car weighed around 1,400 kg and transmitted its power to the rear wheels through a chain-drive gearbox. The Profilée was designed to be more aerodynamic than its older brother, featuring pointy ends on both the front and back, which allowed it to break its less pointy rival the GCA Dogcart's record top speed of 49 mph on 4 March 1899, achieving a speed of 57 mph. Its record, though, was quickly broken by the more famous [[La Jamais Contente]], the first purpose-built land speed record car, which reached 65 mph on the same day.

'''Joseph Miller''' (died October 1784) was a noted English [[cricket]]er who is generally considered to have been one of the greatest batsmen of the 18th century. He is mostly associated with [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] but also made appearances for [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]]. First recorded in the [[1769 English cricket season|1769 season]], Miller made 65 known appearances (including single wicket) from then to 1783, though he certainly played in many matches of similar status whose records have been lost or are incomplete. He was unquestionably an outstanding batsman and perhaps second only to [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] in the 18th century. He made numerous good scores as the match details consistently show.&lt;ref name="S&amp;B3–58"/&gt;

==Cricket career==
The first mention of a player called Miller in [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]] was in the [[Caterham Cricket Club|Caterham]] v [[Bourne Cricket Club|Bourne]] match on Friday, 10 June 1768. This Miller was playing for Caterham, a Surrey team, while the "crack" batsman of the 1770s played invariably for Kent-based teams. Caterham won the match by 14 runs and Miller scored 3 and 20. Apart from the result and the individual scores, no other details have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He was next recorded in 1769 playing for Caterham against [[Hambledon Cricket Club|Hambledon]] at [[Guildford Bason]], Hambledon winning by 4 wickets. No details of individual performances have survived except a brief report that Hambledon's victory was due to the batting of [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] and [[John Bayton]].&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, ''Dawn of Cricket'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

More is known about Miller's career from 1772 when scorecards began to be kept on a habitual basis. The first definite mention of him is in a "fives" [[single wicket cricket|single wicket]] match between [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] at the [[Artillery Ground]] in June 1772. He took part in all three important matches recorded in the 1772 season. In the second, playing for All-England against Hampshire at Guildford Bason, he was top scorer for his team in both innings with 30 out of 126 and then 26 out of only 86.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1773, he scored a total of 316 runs in his 7 known important match appearances with a best score of 73 (out of 177) for All-England v Hampshire at [[Sevenoaks Vine]] on 28 &amp; 29 June. His innings enabled All-England to win by an innings and 51 runs.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; When Kent played Surrey at Sevenoaks Vine in August 1773, Miller scored 42 out of 141 in the first innings and then an unbeaten 32 out of 100–4 in the second innings, leading Kent to a 6 wickets victory.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Haygarth recounts how a poem called ''The Kentish Cricketers'' was composed after this match. It was in reply to a poem called ''Surrey Triumphant'', a parody of ''Chevy Chase'' which had apparently been published earlier that season.&lt;ref name="Haygarth, p. 15"&gt;Haygarth, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1773, Miller played as a "given man" for Surrey v Hampshire at [[Laleham Burway]] and, again, two good scores enabled his team to win by 8 wickets. He scored 37 out of 120 in the first innings and an unbeaten 30 out of 64–2 in the second innings.&lt;ref name="Haygarth, p. 15"/&gt;

Miller's best known performance was for Kent v Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine in August 1774 when he made 95 out of 240 and enabled Kent to win by an innings and 35 runs.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, in the return match at [[Broadhalfpenny Down]], Miller scored 40 and 45 out of 168 and 136–6 as Kent won by 4 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's innings of 95 was briefly the [[List of first-class cricket records#Highest individual score|highest individual score]] recorded in first-class cricket (i.e., since the ''statistical record'' began in 1772), beating the 88 scored by [[William Yalden]] in 1773. Miller’s "world record" lasted only a year until John Small beat it with the earliest known first-class century.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller was less successful in 1775 and experienced a number of low scores but he did play two notable innings of 71 for Kent v Hampshire and then 42 for Surrey against Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; He had an indifferent season in 1776 but then recovered his form in 1777 when he made a total of 311 runs in 6 known appearances including scores of 65, 64 and 51 in three separate matches for All-England against Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, pp. 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt; He made a few useful scores in 1778 when his best was 59 for Surrey against Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=The Cricket Statistician |year=2010 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller made only one more half-century which was a score of exactly 50 for All-England against Hampshire at [[Itchin Stoke Down]] in September 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; His date of birth is unknown but, as he had been playing since the 1760s, he must have reached the veteran stage by the 1780s and his scores were less notable than they had been a decade earlier. Apart from a few useful contributions, Miller was by 1782 playing a minor role. He made 3 known important match appearances in 1783, his final season, and his last known match was Kent v Hampshire at [[Bourne Paddock]] in August. Hampshire won by 85 runs and, if the batting order in the scorecard is correct, Miller batted last and scored just 2 and 9.&lt;ref name="S&amp;B58"/&gt;

==Style and personality==
[[Arthur Haygarth]]'s biography of Miller quotes [[John Nyren]]'s comment that Miller had a beautiful style and was as "firm and steady as the Pyramids". He was a man "to be depended on and very active" as well as being "a kind-hearted and amiable man".&lt;ref name="S&amp;B58"&gt;Haygarth, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyren also says that Miller and [[John Minshull]] were "the only two batsmen (i.e., in the 1770s) that the [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] men were afraid of". He comments on Miller's ability to "cut a ball at the point of the bat" and adds, slightly contradicting Haygarth's version, that "although (Miller was) fully as stout a man as Minshull, he was considerably more active".&lt;ref name="N74"/&gt;

Little is known about Miller personally except that he seems to have been a gamekeeper employed by the [[John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset|Duke of Dorset]] at Knole House near [[Sevenoaks]]. Latterly, he took up residence with [[Sir Horatio Mann, 2nd Baronet|Sir Horatio Mann]] at [[Bourne, Kent|Bourne]], probably in the same employment. His burial took place at [[Bridge, Kent]] on 31 October 1784, only a year after his last recorded match.&lt;ref name="S&amp;B58"/&gt;

==Alternative first name==
Miller's first name may be subject to question for, although he is generally known as Joseph, he has also been referred to as Richard,&lt;ref name=MTG&gt;Major, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; though that would seem to be due to confusion with the Richard Miller (possibly his brother) who played alongside him in one match for [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] in the [[1774 English cricket season|1774 season]].&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Cricket Scores'', [[H. T. Waghorn]] records that "Richard Miller" played for Kent against Surrey at [[Laleham Burway]] in June 1773&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, ''Cricket Scores'', pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; but in Haygarth's version of this scorecard, he has listed the player as "J. Miller".&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of sources call him J. or Joseph although Nyren, a great admirer of Miller, uses his surname only.&lt;ref name="S&amp;B3–58"&gt;Haygarth, pp. 3–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="N74"&gt;Nyren, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, pp. 177–179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underdown, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mote, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haygarth, who studied all of the old scorecards and biographical material available, acknowledges that "there seems to have been two (Millers) but it is almost certain that J was the "crack" and played in the great contests of the day".&lt;ref name="S&amp;B58"/&gt; [[G. B. Buckley]] does not attempt to correct Haygarth re Miller in his appendix of additions and amendments to ''Scores and Biographies'' and thereby accepts that J. Miller is the correct version.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, pp. 207–236.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MDCC-Arena''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Magdeburg]], [[Germany]]. It has been completed and opened to the public in December 2006, replacing the old [[Ernst-Grube-Stadion]]. It is mostly used for [[Association football|football]] matches and hosts the home matches of [[1. FC Magdeburg]].

== Stadium Facts ==
The stadium is a fully covered football-only stadium, i.e. without an athletics track. It has a capacity of 25,910&lt;ref name="capacity" /&gt; people. The stadium has 64 seats for [[Disability|persons with disabilities]]. Furthermore, 40 [[News media|press]] seats are available. The maximum distance from the pitch is 32 meters. The floodlight is attached to the stadium's roof, as well as the two 30m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; screens. The pitch is {{convert|105|m|yd|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|68|m|yd|abbr=off}} wide, it has [[under-soil heating]]. Total cost of construction was 31 million Euros. In the 2016–17 3. Liga season, Magdeburg drew the highest average home attendance (17,100), followed by MSV Duisburg (14,175) and Hansa Rostock (11,433).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/3-liga-2016-2017/1/ | title = Germany » 3. Liga 2016/2017 » Attendance » Home matches | website = worldfootball.net | access-date = 25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first stadium at this location had been inaugurated on 14 April 1912 as the home of [[SV Victoria 96 Magdeburg]]. In 1914, it hosted the [[German champions (football)|final to the German championship]] between [[Greuther Fürth|Spielvereinigung Fürth]] and [[VfB Leipzig]]. In 1937 it was bought by the [[Allianz]] insurance company after Victoria had gone bankrupt. During [[World War II]] the stadium was completely destroyed by bombing.
 
After World War II the city of Magdeburg planned to erect a sports center consisting among others of a stadium with a capacity for 80,000 people and a natatorium. However, the city was unable to acquire the site originally intended and so the project was abandoned. Instead, the city decided to build a new stadium east of the Elbe river, at the site of the Victoria stadium. In order to erect the stands, about 5.3 million cubic ft of rubble were transported from the ruins of the city. The stadium was equipped with an athletics track and was opened in front of a crowd of 40,000 on 18 September 1955. Over the years, it was upgraded several times, parts of the stands were put under a roof, and floodlights were installed. However, after the [[reunification of Germany]] the stadium fell into disrepair and in 2004 the city council decided to build a new one at the same site. The Ernst-Grube-Stadion was demolished between March and June 2005, and construction of the new stadium began on 4 July 2005.

The first match was held on 19 December 2006. In front of a crowd of 13,279, hosts 1. FC Magdeburg came to a nil-all draw against [[Eintracht Braunschweig]]. In the inaugural match, 1. FC Magdeburg lost 0–3 to [[Bundesliga]] side [[SV Werder Bremen]], this time 24,300 spectators had come. In the remaining matches of the season, 10,800 spectators came to see 1. FC Magdeburg play on average. The first international match was held on 29 July 2007 when the [[Germany women's national football team|German women's national team]] beat their [[Denmark women's national football team|Danish counterparts]] 4–0 in front of 10,735 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = DFB – Deutscher Fußball-Bund e.V. – Alle Spiele | url = https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500008&amp;no_cache=1&amp;action=showSchema&amp;liga=Frauen-Nationalmannschaft&amp;matchid=dfbatf309&amp;lang=D&amp;cHash=6707200b94 | accessdate = 27 April 2009 | language = German | publisher = [[German Football Association|Deutscher Fußball-Bund e.V.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mapfre Stadium''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑː|f|r|eɪ}} {{respell|MAH|fray}};&lt;ref name="Dispatch" /&gt; styled as "MAPFRE Stadium"), previously known as '''Columbus Crew Stadium''', is a [[soccer-specific stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], United States. It primarily serves as the home stadium of the [[Columbus Crew SC]] of [[Major League Soccer]]. Mapfre Stadium is also the site of a variety of additional events in amateur and professional soccer, American football, lacrosse, and rugby, and is a regular site for outdoor concerts due to the permanent stage in the north end zone.

Built in 1999, it was the first soccer-specific stadium built by a [[Major League Soccer]] team, starting an important trend in MLS stadium construction. The stadium is named for [[Madrid]]-based [[Mapfre|Mapfre Insurance]] after the company signed a sponsorship agreement announced on March 3, 2015. The listed [[seating capacity]] is 19,968. In 2015, MAPFRE Stadium and Director of Grounds, Weston Appelfeller, CSFM, were honored with the prestigious Field of the Year award by the Sports Turf Managers Association (STMA) for the professional soccer division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsturfonline.com/2015/12/01/2015-field-of-the-year-winners-named-by-stma/|title=S2015 Field of the Year winners named by STMA|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Columbus Crew SC played their first three seasons at [[Ohio Stadium]] on the campus of the [[Ohio State University]].  During games, large sections of the stadium were blocked off to reduce capacity from approximately 90,000 to 25,243.  Although the Crew enjoyed success at Ohio Stadium during their tenure there, the large seating capacity and limitations to the field size made the stadium ill-suited for soccer.  Additionally, Ohio Stadium lacked permanent field lights.  These problems, along with planned renovations to Ohio Stadium, which began in 1999, were all factors in the development of Mapfre Stadium. The construction cost of US$28.5 million was covered entirely with private funds from Crew owner and oil billionaire [[Lamar Hunt]] and his Hunt Sports group. It is located on the grounds of the Ohio Expo Center and [[Ohio State Fair|State Fairgrounds]], between East 17th Avenue and East Hudson Street. The site was previously home to Columbus Auto Parts, an [[OEM]] factory supplying the automobile industry, which stood vacant for decades between the [[Conrail]] railroad tracks and [[Interstate 71]] before its demolition in the '90s.

Mapfre Stadium opened on May 15, 1999 as Columbus Crew Stadium with a match between the home side and the [[New England Revolution]].  It is the second [[soccer-specific stadium]] built in the country, after Steel Athletic Field was built in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1913, and the first Major Leaue Soccer stadium constructed in the United States. It has been credited with inspiring the wave of construction of soccer-specific stadiums throughout the league. In the 2010 Showcase issue of ''Stadia Magazine'', Ian Nuttall stating "Who'd have thought when it opened in 1999 that [[Major League Soccer]]'s first purpose-built stadium would kick-start the wave of dedicated soccer-specific stadiums that continue today?"

After nearly 15 years of the stadium not having a corporate sponsor, the Crew announced naming rights were sold to [[Madrid]]-based [[Mapfre]] Insurance on March 3, 2015. The team had been searching to sell stadium naming rights since it opened in 1999, but had been unable to come to an agreement. Mapfre maintains an office in Columbus and has its U.S. base in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name = "Dispatch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Crew's home has new name: Mapfre Stadium |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/sports/2015/03/04/0303-crew-stadium.html |author=Jardy, Adam |date=March 3, 2015 |newspaper=[[Columbus Dispatch]] |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Introducing MAPFRE Stadium: Columbus Crew SC reveals historic stadium naming rights partnership with MAPFRE Insurance |url=http://www.columbuscrewsc.com/news/2015/03/introducing-mapfre-stadium-columbus-crew-sc-reveals-historic-stadium-naming-rights-part |date=March 3, 2015 |work=ColumbusCrewSC.com |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
In addition to hosting the Crew SC home games, Mapfre Stadium has also hosted other Major League Soccer and professional soccer events.  It was the site of the [[MLS Cup 2001|2001 MLS Cup championship]] and was the host stadium for the [[Major League Soccer All-Star Game]] in [[2000 MLS All-Star Game|2000]] and [[2005 MLS All-Star Game|2005]]. Both the United States [[United States men's national soccer team|men's]] and [[United States women's national soccer team|women's]] national teams have played numerous matches at Mapfre Stadium, most notably, the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier in February 2001 between the U.S. and Mexico known as ''La Guerra Fria'' (The Cold War) due to sub-freezing temperatures.  During the [[FIFA Women's World Cup 2003|2003 Women's World Cup]], the stadium was one of the venues used during the group stage of the tournament. In 2018, Mapfre Stadium was one of three sites selected to host the SheBelieves Cup.  

Mapfre Stadium has also hosted events outside of professional soccer. The [[NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship]] was held at Mapfre Stadium in 2001 and 2003. In 2002, it hosted the [[Steinfeld Cup]], the championship game of [[Major League Lacrosse]]. In June 2010, MAPFRE Stadium hosted the inaugural USA [[Rugby sevens|Sevens Rugby]] Collegiate Championship Invitational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/36196025/ns/sports-rugby_7s/|title=USA 7’s Rugby Collegiate Championship Invitational 2010. |accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue is a regular site for [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] state championship tournaments in both [[American football]] and soccer.

Since the opening of Mapfre Stadium, it has been a regular site for the [[United States men's national soccer team]] matches, hosting ten games through 2013. The men's national team held an unbeaten record of 8–3–0 in all competitions, outscoring opponents 19–1. This was until the U.S. was beaten by [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] on [[Veterans Day]] 2016.

The stadium has hosted five consecutive World Cup qualifying matches against Mexico, with the U.S. winning four of the five matches by the same score of 2–0 (with the U.S. fans adopting the rallying cry of ''[[Mexico–United States soccer rivalry|dos-a-cero]]'').

The national team was beaten by Mexico on November 11, 2016, by a score of 1–2, prompting Mexico's first ever win in Columbus, and the U.S.'s first World Cup qualifying defeat on home soil in 15 years. It hosted a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Guatemala on March 29, 2016, which the US won, 4–0.

==MLS Cup Finals==
Since the opening of Mapfre Stadium, it has hosted two MLS Cup Finals; once as a neutral site, and once as home side [[Columbus Crew SC]] played host. The latter occurred following a 2012 MLS rules change which did away with a neutral site for the Final, and instead has the club with the best overall regular season record hosting the match.

A permanent stage, built in 2008, was constructed in the north end of the stadium to accommodate concerts after the closing of [[Germain Amphitheater]]. The addition replaced about 2,100 seats in the north end.

There are rumors that this purchase was engineered by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] owner Roman Abramovich.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/28/chelsea-vitesse-arnhem-links-deeper-public-told&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed-up by acquiring the services of new players and replacing manager [[Theo Bos (footballer)|Theo Bos]] with the unexperienced [[Albert Ferrer]], a former Spanish international defender. In 2013, Jordania appointed [[Peter Bosz]], who left the club in January 2015. In 2016, [[Henk Fraser]] was appointed manager of the Vitesse first team.

'''National Sports Academy''' was a private preparatory school for winter-sport athletes in [[Lake Placid, New York]], United States. The academy was closed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressrepublican.com/news/deeply-in-debt-national-sports-academy-to-shut-down-for/article_a4e462a6-0095-11e5-8f85-1f12a9d81aee.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school began in 1977 as Mountain House, a winter tutorial program for student-athletes. The school changed from a winter-only program to a traditional school calendar in 1981, and changed its name to National Sports Academy on March 17, 1989.

===Campus and Nearby Training Facilities Used by NSA Student Athletes  ===

The school covers grades 9-12 and is located in the former Winterset Inn, which housed Italian athletes during the [[1980 Winter Olympics]]. The schools main building which houses cafeteria, dorm rooms and classrooms is located directly across from Mirror Lake. The average number of boarding students is around 200 Students per year.  The school is located steps from the Olympic Center which is a massive sports facility which houses 3 Hockey rinks and was home to the 1932 and 1980 Olympic Hockey competitions where the United States famously won the Gold medal (1980). The Olympic Center is the home practice and game facility for all of the National Sports Academy hockey players and speed skating athletes. The varsity A boys and girls teams practice daily and host all home games on the Herb Brooks Arena which is a 13,450 seat arena with a full Olympic sized sheet of ice.   Players use the weight rooms, basketball courts and other amenities in the Olympic Center to help train them off ice. Outside is the Olympic Speed skating oval which has hosted many international competitions, most notably  the 1932 and 1980 Olympic games. Alpine skiers are fortunate enough to have one of the best locations in the US for the advancement of their skills. Skiers train at the Olympic Training Center which hosts winter sport athletes from the US and other countries who are living in Lake Placid or in town to train for extended periods of time. This gives NSA student athletes a first hand opportunity to train with and observe the training practices of some of the top athletes in their respective sports. The Olympic Sports Complex is the third significant facility that NSA athletes have full access and use of on a daily basis. The current home of the US Olympic Men's and Women's sliding teams. (Luge, Bobsled and Skeleton) The sliding track was the home of the 32 and 80 Olympic games and has been one of the premier tracks in North America in the past 15 years in terms of training and competition sliding events. Students go to class in the afternoon and end in the late evening.

==Curriculum==
The school's student athletes focus on one of ten winter sports: Alpine skiing, freestyle skiing, snowboarding, Nordic skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined, biathlon, figure skating, luge, and boys’ and girls’ hockey. Academic studies are addressed by a rigorous college-preparatory curriculum and specialized curricula and tutors for students who travel to compete.

==Extracurricular activities==
Student groups and activities at National Sports Academy include a community service committee, a cultural arts committee, Coffee Haus, dodgeball club, ping pong tournaments, student council, a sustainability and stewardship council, ultimate Frisbee club, and yearbook.

==Notable alumni==
National Sports Academy has had 34 National team members, 21 members of the U.S. Ski Team, five Members US Jr. Luge Team, 2 members of the Czech Women's Ice Hockey Team, and its alumni have won five National Nordic Skiing Titles, 5 Nordic Skiing Medalists, eight Jr. National Skiing Titles, and one Women's National Luge Champion.

[[File:Polo Shirt Basic Pattern.png|thumb|Polo shirt outline]]
A '''polo shirt''', also known as a '''golf shirt''' and '''tennis shirt''', is a form of shirt with a collar, a [[placket]] with typically two or three buttons, and an optional pocket. Polo shirts are short sleeved.

All three terms may be used interchangeably. Polo shirts are usually made of [[knitted fabric|knitted]] [[cotton]] (rather than [[woven]] cloth), usually a [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] knit, or less commonly an [[Jersey (fabric)|interlock]] knit (the latter used frequently, though not exclusively, with [[Gossypium barbadense|pima cotton]] polos), or using other fibers such as [[silk]], [[merino]] [[wool]], [[synthetic fiber]]s, or blends of natural and synthetic fibers. A [[dress]]-length version of the shirt is called a '''polo dress'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKean|first=Erin|title=The Hundred Dresses: The Most Iconic Styles of Our Time|year=2013|publisher=A &amp; C Black|location=USA|isbn=978-1-4725-3585-6|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1tY4jXQw08C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of the tennis shirt ===
[[File:Tennis-shirt-lacoste.jpg|thumb|A [[Lacoste]] tennis shirt]]
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[tennis]] players ordinarily wore "tennis whites" consisting of long-sleeved white button-up shirts (worn with the sleeves rolled up), flannel [[trousers]], and [[necktie|ties]].&lt;ref name="fashenc-07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/Ki-Le/Lacoste-Sportswear.html|title=Lacoste Sportswear – Fashion Designer Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lacoste"&gt;The Story of Lacoste. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.lacoste.com/library/pdf/LACOSTE_history_histoire.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060126234449/http://www.lacoste.com/library/pdf/LACOSTE_history_histoire.pdf |archivedate=26 January 2006 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time-04"&gt;Style &amp; Design: Lacoste. ''Time'' Magazine, Winter 2004. Retrieved from http://www.time.com/time/2004/style/111504/article/lacoste_on_a_lark_and_a08a.html.&lt;/ref&gt; This attire presented problems for ease of play and comfort.&lt;ref name="lacoste" /&gt;

[[René Lacoste]], the [[France|French]] seven-time [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis champion, felt that the stiff tennis attire was too cumbersome and uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="lacoste" /&gt; He designed a white, short-sleeved, loosely-knit [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] cotton (he called the cotton weave ''jersey petit piqué'') shirt with an unstarched, flat, protruding collar, a buttoned placket, and a  shirt-tail longer in back than in front (known today as a "tennis tail"; see below), which he first wore at the 1926 U.S. Open championship.&lt;ref name="fashenc-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lacoste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time-04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brandch"&gt;[http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=300 ''The Brand Channel'', Lacoste profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926165934/http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=300 |date=26 September 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 1927, Lacoste placed a crocodile emblem on the left breast of his shirts, as the American press had begun to refer to him as "The Crocodile",&lt;ref name="The Crocodile"&gt;[http://www.chansons-net.com/tennis/champions/lacoste/E-lacoste.html]''The Crocodile''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Birth of the Crocodile"&gt;[http://www.lacoste.com/#/rene_lacoste-rub-1]''The Birth of the Crocodile''&lt;/ref&gt; a nickname which he embraced.&lt;ref name="fashenc-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lacoste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time-04" /&gt;

Lacoste's design mitigated the problems that traditional tennis attire created:&lt;ref name="fashenc-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time-04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brandch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butterworth|first=Helen|title=The History of the Polo Shirt|url=http://www.polo-shirts.co.uk/guides/18/The_History_of_the_Polo_Shirt.html|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the short, cuffed sleeves solved the tendency of long sleeves to roll down
* the soft collar could be loosened easily by unbuttoning the placket
* the piqué [[collar (clothing)|collar]] could be worn [[upturned collar|upturned]] to protect the [[neck]] skin from the [[sun]]
* the jersey knit piqué cotton breathed and was more durable
* the "tennis tail" prevented the shirt from pulling out of the wearer's trousers or shorts

In 1933, after retiring from professional tennis, Lacoste teamed up with [[André Gillier]], a friend who was a clothing merchandiser, to market that shirt in Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="fashenc-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lacoste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brandch" /&gt; Together, they formed the company [[Lacoste|Chemise Lacoste]], and began selling their shirts, which included the small embroidered crocodile logo on the left breast.&lt;ref name="fashenc-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lacoste" /&gt;

=== Application to polo  ===
[[File:Chakravarty Cup 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Polo players Paul Barr, [[Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha]], [[Adolfo Cambiaso]], [[Martin Valent]] with fellow player [[Prince William]] (center), wearing polo shirts as part of their uniform.]]
Before Lacoste's 1933 mass-marketing of his tennis shirt, [[polo]] players wore thick long-sleeve shirts made of [[Oxford (cloth)|Oxford-cloth]] cotton.&lt;ref name=brooksbros&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksbrothers.com/aboutus/heritage.tem|title=Brooks Brothers – About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shirt was the first to have a buttoned-down collar, which polo players invented in the late 19th century to keep their collars from flapping in the [[wind]] ([[Brooks Brothers]]' early president, John Brooks, noticed this while at a polo match in England and began producing such a shirt in 1896).&lt;ref name="brooksbros" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/Bo-Ch/Brooks-Brothers.html ''Fashion Encyclopedia'', "Brooks Brothers"].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brooks Brothers still produces this style of button-down "polo shirt".&lt;ref name="brooksbros" /&gt; Still, like early tennis clothing, those clothes presented a discomfort on the field, and when polo players became aware of Lacoste’s invention in the 1930s they readily adopted it for use in polo.

In 1920, Lewis Lacey, a Canadian born of English parents in Montreal, Quebec, in 1887,[[Haberdashery | haberdasher]] and polo player, began producing a shirt that was embroidered with an emblem of a polo player, a design originated at the [[Hurlingham Club (Argentina)|Hurlingham Polo Club]] near Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Monday, Sept. 01, 1986 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962178,00.html |title=A Popular Shirt Tale |publisher=TIME |date=1986-09-01 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Polo Ralph Lauren logo.png|thumb|200px|left|Polo Ralph Lauren symbol]] --&gt;

The term ''polo shirt'', which previously had referred only to the long-sleeved, buttoned-down shirts traditionally used in polo, soon became a universal moniker for the tennis shirt; by the 1950s, it was in common usage in the U.S. to describe the shirt most commonly thought of as part of formal tennis attire. Indeed, tennis players often would refer to their shirt as a ''polo shirt'', notwithstanding the fact that their sport had used it before polo did.

In 1972, [[Ralph Lauren]] included his "polo shirt" as a prominent part of his original line [[Polo Ralph Lauren|Polo]], thereby helping further its already widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.ralphlauren.com/history/history.asp?year=1972 Official Ralph Lauren history website: "1972"].&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically designed for use by polo players, Lauren's shirt imitated what by that time had become the normal attire for polo players. As he desired to exude a certain "[[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPishness]]" in his clothes, initially adopting the style of clothiers like Brooks Brothers, [[J. Press]], and "[[Savile Row]]"-style English clothing, he prominently included this attire from the "sport of kings" in his line, replete with a logo reminiscent of Lacoste's [[crocodile]] [[emblem]], depicting a polo player and pony. 

This worked well as a marketing tool for, subsequently, the immense popularity of Lauren's clothing led a majority of English-speaking westerners to begin referring to Lacoste's tennis shirt as a "polo shirt".&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.ralphlauren.com/history/history.asp?year=1967 Official Ralph Lauren history website: "1967"].&lt;/ref&gt; Still, "tennis shirt" remains a viable term for all uses of Lacoste's basic design.

=== Golf ===
Over the latter half of the 20th century, as standard clothing in [[golf]] became more casual, the tennis shirt was adopted nearly universally as standard golf attire.&lt;ref name="fashenc-07" /&gt; Many golf courses and country clubs require players to wear golf shirts as a part of their dress code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burleighgolfclub.com.au/guests/golf/dress.mhtml "Dress Code"], BURLEIGH HEADS GOLF CLUB&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golflongislandnational.com/Club_Rules___Regulations.html "Dress Code: Proper Golf Attire"], Long Island National Golf Club&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, producing Lacoste's "tennis shirt" in various golf cuts has resulted in specific designs of the tennis shirt for golf, resulting in the moniker ''golf shirt''. 

Golf shirts are commonly made out of polyester, cotton-polyester blends, or mercerized cotton. The placket typically holds three or four buttons, and consequently extends lower than the typical polo neckline. The collar is typically fabricated using a stitched double-layer of the same fabric used to make the shirt, in contrast to a polo shirt collar, which is usually one-ply ribbed knit cotton. Golf shirts often have a pocket on the left side, to hold a scorepad and pencil, and may not bear a logo there.

'''Reverse ferret''' is a phrase used predominantly within the British media to describe a sudden reversal in an organisation's editorial line on a certain issue. Generally, this will involve no acknowledgement of the previous position.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{Cite news|subscription=yes |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4275198.ece|title=Tabloid week: the reverse ferret|last=White|first=Roland|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originates from [[Kelvin MacKenzie]]'s time at ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. His preferred description of the role of journalists when it came to public figures was to "stick a ferret up their trousers". This meant making their lives uncomfortable, and was based on the supposed northern stunt of [[ferret-legging]] (where contestants compete to show who can endure a live [[ferret]] within their sealed trousers the longest). However, when it became clear that the tide of public opinion had turned against the paper's line, MacKenzie would burst from his office shouting "Reverse Ferret!" &lt;ref name="White" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Chenoweth - Rupert Murdoch: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Media Wizard - {{ISBN|978-0-609-61038-1}} - excerpt: http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400046881&amp;view=excerpt  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704035908/http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400046881&amp;view=excerpt |date=4 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/mackenzie-performs-a-bbc-reverse-ferret/155916.article MacKenzie performs a BBC reverse ferret]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Mayor of New York performed a literal reverse ferret when he repealed a ban on owning domesticated ferrets within the city.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/reverse-ferret-mayor-of-new-york-set-to-repeal-ban-9456335.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican leaders' reaffirmation of support for 2016 presidential nominee [[Donald Trump]] in October was described as a reverse ferret by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/world/americas/donald-trump-and-the-gop-the-party-of-lincoln-reagan-and-perhaps-extinction.html?ref=world&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taco Bell Arena''' (originally '''BSU Pavilion''') is a multi-purpose indoor [[arena]] in the [[Western United States|western]] [[United States]], on the campus of [[Boise State University]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Idaho]]. The arena is located on the east end of campus, between West Campus Lane and [[Cesar Chavez|César Chávez]] Circle, immediately northwest of [[Albertsons Stadium]].

It is home to the Broncos [[Boise State Broncos basketball|basketball]], [[wrestling]], and [[gymnastics]] teams, with a current [[seating capacity]] of 12,644 for basketball. The [[elevation]] of its floor is approximately {{convert|2700|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]].

The venue is also used for concerts (capacity 13,390), community events, and trade shows ({{convert|17000|sqft|-1}} of arena floor space plus {{convert|10000|sqft|-1|abbr=on}} in the auxiliary gym). It hosted a [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] match in April [[2013 Davis Cup World Group|2013]], a second-round tie between the [[United States Davis Cup team|U.S.]] and [[Serbia Davis Cup team|Serbia]].

==Bronco Gym==
The arena's predecessor on campus was Bronco Gymnasium, which opened in the mid-1950s, during the junior college era.  Its last varsity basketball game was the regular season finale in 1982 on February 27, against rival [[1981–82 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team|Idaho]], ranked ninth in the {{nowrap|AP poll.&lt;ref name=jumpbck&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tLdeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eTAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6031%2C2946904 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=Vandals jump back into polls' top ten |date=February 23, 1982 |page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=imrtr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Wk9OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1u4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7035%2C2829798 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=staff and wire reports |title=Idaho makes return trip to Top Ten |date=February 23, 1982 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Sold out two weeks in advance,&lt;ref name=nnvndls&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Xk9OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1u4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4372%2C4269681 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |last=Missildine |first=Harry |title=No. 9 Vandals stand in BSU's playoff way |date=February 27, 1982 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Saturday night game had a record attendance of 3,946;&lt;ref name=vlbdsk&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ubdeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eTAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3118%2C4992982|work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |title=Vandals leak but don't sink |date=February 28, 1982 |page=4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; the capacity of the gym at the time was listed at 3,682.&lt;ref name=nnvndls/&gt;&lt;ref name=wwitmo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uLdeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eTAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3410%2C4475536 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |title=Who wants it most?

==Basketball tournaments==

While the Broncos were members, the venue hosted four [[Big Sky Conference]] [[Big Sky Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|men's basketball tournaments]]: [[1985 Big Sky Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|1985]], [[1989 Big Sky Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|1989]], [[1990 Big Sky Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|1990]], and [[1994 Big Sky Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|1994]]. In those four tourneys, BSU made the finals in 1989 and won the title in 1994.

Taco Bell Arena has been a familiar site for early-round [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] games, hosting first and second round competition nine times ([[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1983]], [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1989]], [[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]], [[1998 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1998]], [[2001 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2001]], [[2005 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2005]], [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2009]], and [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2018]]). The NCAA tournament is scheduled to return in 2021.

The tournament games played at the arena have resulted in some of the most memorable moments in NCAA history. {{nowrap|In [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]],}} [[1994–95 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] guard [[Tyus Edney]] dashed the length of the {{convert|94|ft|sing=on}} court in just over four seconds to make a layup that gave the Bruins a 75–74 win over [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]],&lt;ref name=esgsfb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n2JWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vvEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4850%2C8606599 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Edney sinks game-saver for Bruins |date=March 20, 1995 |page=C1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which sustained UCLA's run to a {{nowrap|national title.&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Tom - [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDF1530F933A15750C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 N.C.A.A.

That he also managed to toss in a swooping layup left Missouri with its hands over its face. The No. 1-seeded Bruins trailed the No. 8-seeded Tigers by 1 point with 4.8 seconds remaining when Edney, a turbo point guard, started his cross-country journey. He took the inbounds pass under his own basket, was neck-and-neck with defender Jason Sutherland at midcourt, freed himself with a behind-the-back dribble, made a hairpin turn to the lane and banked in a shot over {{height|ft=6|in=9}} Derek Grimm at the buzzer.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[2001 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2001]], it was the site of the closest first-round day at a single host location ever, with the four games played on March 15 decided by a combined total of seven points.&lt;ref name=erghscyc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GVFTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=musDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6746%2C3911811 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Hampton stuns Cyclones, 58-57 |date=March 16, 2001 |page=2D }}&lt;/ref&gt; One was [[Hampton Pirates men's basketball|Hampton]]'s upset of #2 seed [[2000–01 Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team|Iowa State]] — Hampton was only the fourth #15 seed to beat a #2 seed since the tournament expanded from 53 to 64 teams {{nowrap|in [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]].&lt;ref name=erghscyc/&gt;}}

'''Central Stadium''' ({{lang-uk|Центральний cтадіон}}, ''Tsentralnyi stadion'') is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Zhytomyr]], [[Ukraine]]. The decent size stadium has over 20,000 seats (21,928).

Built in 1951 as part of the [[Dynamo Sports Club]], it was originally named as "'''Dynamo'''". In 1959 the stadium was transferred to the Avanhard Republican Volunteer Sports Society and the first major renovations took place at the stadium. It served as a home field of the society's football section that eventually grew into a team of masters (a professional club). During another sports reorganization the stadium was transferred to the Spartak Volunteer Sports Society and soon it was renamed '''in a memory of the Lenin Communist Union of Youth of Ukraine (LKSMU)'''. The latest renovations were taking place before the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in 1980. Since 2005 the stadium is in emergency conditions. 

After the main association football club of the region withdrew from national competitions in 2005, the stadium was transferred under the ownership of community and was renamed as the Central Stadium. It required some major renovations already in 2005, yet none were conducted.
