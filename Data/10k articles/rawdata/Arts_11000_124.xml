[[Image:ALWDcvr.jpg|thumb|''ALWD Citation Manual'']]

'''''ALWD Guide to Legal Citation''''', formerly '''''ALWD Citation Manual''''', is a [[style guide]] providing a [[legal citation]] system for the [[United States]], compiled by the [[Association of Legal Writing Directors]]. Its first edition was published in 2000, under editor [[Darby Dickerson]]. Its sixth edition, under editor [[Coleen M. Barger]], was released in May 2017.

It primarily competes with the ''[[Bluebook]]'' style, a system developed by the law reviews at [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], [[Yale Law School|Yale]], [[University of Pennsylvania Law School|University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Columbia Law School|Columbia]]. Citations in the two formats are roughly similar. However, ''ALWD'' differs from ''Bluebook'' in one key respect: Under the ''Bluebook'' system, the type styles used in citations found in academic legal articles (always footnoted) are very different from those used in citations within court documents (always cited inline). While the ''ALWD'' system follows the standard convention of footnotes within academic articles and inline citations in court documents, it rejects ''Bluebook''{{'}}s insistence on using different type styles in the two classes of documents. The ''ALWD'' type style is identical to that used in the ''Bluebook'' system for citations within court documents.

==Adoption==

Four U.S. jurisdictions have adopted ''ALWD'':
* [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]]
**This court accepts citations in either ''ALWD'' or ''Bluebook'' format, but also requires that citations to [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decisions provide both official "U.S." and [[West (publisher)|West]]'s "S.Ct." citations, when available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules/Addena |url=http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/rules/index.php |accessdate=6 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601113415/http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/rules/index.php |archivedate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States District Court for the District of Montana]]
**This court specifically accepts either ''ALWD'' or ''Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Rules of Procedure: United States District Court for the District of Montana |url=http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/mtd/documents.nsf/3a55ca523f1ad3ef882563fb0080c38f/3fa0ae63fdb1bd99872570c9006b1f14/$FILE/LOCAL%20RULES%202005.pdf |accessdate=April 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924021814/http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/mtd/Documents.nsf/3a55ca523f1ad3ef882563fb0080c38f/3fa0ae63fdb1bd99872570c9006b1f14/%24FILE/LOCAL%20RULES%202005.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States Bankruptcy Court]], Montana
**This court accepts any "nationally recognized citation form", and specifically names the ''ALWD Citation Manual''. It does not mention ''Bluebook'' by name, but given its national recognition (it is the dominant legal style guide in the United States), it should be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LOCAL BANKRUPTCY RULES FOR THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA |url=http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/mtd/documents.nsf/3a55ca523f1ad3ef882563fb0080c38f/460c7c7d0ea0e6a587256ee800679ef9/$FILE/2001%20Mont.%20Local%20Bankr%20Rules.pdf |accessdate=April 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924021750/http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/mtd/Documents.nsf/3a55ca523f1ad3ef882563fb0080c38f/460c7c7d0ea0e6a587256ee800679ef9/%24FILE/2001%20Mont.%20Local%20Bankr%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Command Judge Advocate Office]] at the U.S. Army base on [[Kwajalein Atoll]] (leased from the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]]).

In addition to those, 72 law schools and 47 paralegal schools have fully adopted ''ALWD''. Law journals such as ''Animal Law'', ''NAELA'', and ''Legal Writing'' have also adopted ''ALWD''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALWD Citation Manual adoptions|publisher=ALWD|url=http://www.alwd.org/publications/adoptions/|accessdate=2016-04-22}} Law school adoption numbers reported as of December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Dance to the Music of Time''''' is a painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]] in the [[Wallace Collection]] in London. It was painted between about 1634 and 1636 as a commission for Giulio Rospigliosi (later [[Pope Clement IX]]), who according to [[Gian Pietro Bellori]] dictated its detailed iconography.  The identity of the figures remains uncertain, with differing accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace.  The date is purely based on style, and Ingamells, 310 thought "1639-40 or perhaps slightly earlier".&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is well known for giving its name to the ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'' novel cycle, though this title is first seen in a Wallace Collection catalogue of 1913. Before that it was given titles referring to the [[Season#Traditional season divisions|Four Seasons]]. In the 1845 sale it was called ''La Danse des Saisons, ou l'Image de la vie humaine''.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Four figures, holding each other by the hand, dance in a circle, as Time plays a [[lyre]] on the right.  The scene is set in the early morning, with [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], goddess of dawn, preceding the chariot of [[Apollo]] the sun-god in the sky behind; the Hours accompany him and he holds a ring representing the [[Zodiac]].  According to [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori|Bellori]], the subject was devised by Rospigliosi.  The four dancers represented, beginning with the one at the back seen mostly from behind: Poverty, Labour, Riches, and Pleasure or Luxury. These represent a progression in human life, completed by Pleasure or Luxury leading to Poverty again.  As the Four Seasons Poverty would be Autumn, Labour Winter, and so on. The suggestion of [[Anthony Blunt]] that, unusually for a group of the seasons, Autumn/Poverty at the rear of the group was male is now generally accepted, and the museum now describe him as [[Bacchus]].  This follows the story invented by [[Boitet de Frauville]] in his ''Les Dionysiaques'' that, responding to complaints from the Seasons and Time, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] gave the world Bacchus and his wine in order to compensate for the miserable living conditions mortals must endure.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 309-310; Wallace&lt;/ref&gt;  [[André Félibien]], the friend and biographer of Poussin, explained the picture in the same terms, except that where Bellori identified Summer with Luxury, Félibien said that it represented Pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 309-310&lt;/ref&gt; 

These identifications are disputed by Malcolm Bull, at least as the original intention.  He traces the [[iconography]] of the painting to the Late Greek poet [[Nonnus]], reflected in the ''Hymne de l'Automme'' of [[Pierre de Ronsard]]. Nonnus' descriptions of the four seasons, as translated into French, are closely followed by Poussin: "on the left is Spring, with a garland of roses in her hair; at the back is Autumn, whose hair has been cropped by the winds but whose brow is wreathed with olive branches; Winter is next, with her bound hair and shadowed face, and at the front is Summer, dressed in white with ears of corn in the braids of her hair."&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 258&lt;/ref&gt;  Bacchus himself appears, in his double aspect as a young and old figure, in the [[herma]] at left.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 258-259&lt;/ref&gt;  Bull suggests that Rospigliosi, an intellectual and author with a taste for [[allegory]], invented the other interpretation "during or after its completion",&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 260&lt;/ref&gt; while Ingamells feels that "Poussin was not unduly concerned with the precise identification of the figures".&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 310&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are several [[pentimenti]], including the removal of a second, larger, tree on the right between Winter/Labour and Time.  The painting is in generally good condition, but has been retouched in places, including over the repair of a large L-shaped tear running right through the central group.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 307-309&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthony Powell==
At the start of [[Anthony Powell]]'s [[A Dance to the Music of Time|series of novels]] named after the painting, the narrator, Nicolas Jenkins, reflects on it in the first two pages of ''[[A Question of Upbringing]]'':

:''These classical projections, and something from the fire, suddenly suggested Poussin's scene in which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure, stepping slowly, methodically sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance.''

==Provenance==
It passed from the Rospigliosi family to the [[Joseph Fesch|Joseph Fesch collection]] in 1806, when it was taken to France for a period. It was then bought, along with several other paintings, by [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford]], in the great Fesch sale in Rome in 1845. It then passed to his son, [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Wallace]].  It was exhibited in the [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 311&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Akeelah and the Bee''''' is a 2006 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Doug Atchison]]. It tells the story of Akeelah Anderson ([[Keke Palmer]]), an 11-year-old girl who participates in the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]], her mother ([[Angela Bassett]]), her schoolmates, and her coach, Dr. Joshua Larabee ([[Laurence Fishburne]]). The cast also features [[Curtis Armstrong]], J.R. Villarreal, Sean Michael Afable, [[Erica Hubbard]], [[Lee Thompson Young]], Julito McCullum, Sahara Garey, [[Eddie Steeples]], and [[Tzi Ma]].

The film was developed over a period of 10 years by Atchison, who came up with the initial concept after seeing the 1994 [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] and noting that a majority of the competitors came from well-off socioeconomic backgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the [[Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting]] in 2000, which attracted producers [[Sid Ganis]] and [[Nancy Hult Ganis]]. After an initial inability to secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of the 2002 documentary film ''[[Spellbound (2002 film)|Spellbound]]''. [[Lionsgate Films]] undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year it was filmed in [[South Los Angeles]] on a budget of over $6 million.

Atchison remarked that his theme for the film, deemed an inspirational film, was about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He also said that he wanted to portray African Americans in a manner that was not stereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizing the public school system. Cast members said that although the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.

Released in the United States on April 28, 2006, ''Akeelah and the Bee'' was positively received by critics and audiences. Reviewers praised its storyline and cast, lauding Palmer's performance, although a few critics panned the story as familiar and formulaic, and were critical of the portrayal of Asian-American characters. The film grossed $19 million, and received a number of awards and nominations, including the [[Black Reel Awards]] and the [[NAACP Image Award]]s. Film critics highly praised it for avoiding [[Stereotypes of African Americans|African-American stereotypes]] common in Hollywood films, while scholars were less favorable, even saying it reinforces some clichés.

==Plot==
Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old spelling enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, a predominantly [[black school]] in [[South Los Angeles|South]] [[Los Angeles]]. She lives with her disgruntled [[widow]]ed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she sign up for the Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee, which she initially refuses. After being threatened for detention for the remaining of the semester, she gives in, enters the spelling bee, and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old [[Mexican American]] boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]] middle school.

At Woodland Hills, Akeelah meets Dylan Chiu, a [[Chinese American]] boy who had won second place at the past two national spelling bees. Contemptuous, he asks her to spell "[[xanthosis]]". When she starts with a "z", he tells her she needs a coach. At the conclusion of the spelling club meeting, Javier invites Akeelah to his birthday party. At the party, Akeelah nearly beats Dylan in [[Scrabble]]. The boy is reprimanded by his father for nearly losing to "a little black girl". After the party, Tanya is depressed over Terrence's bad behavior after getting caught by the police for acting out with his thugs, her husband's death after a criminal shot and killed him on his way home from work and concerned about her daughter's grades and frequent [[truancy]]. As she finds out about Akeelah going alone to Woodland Hills, she subsequently forbids Akeelah from participating in the upcoming state bee. To circumvent this prohibition, Akeelah forges her deceased father Samuel's signature on the consent form and secretly studies with Dr. Larabee. During the state bee, Tanya comes inside and interrupts her daughter before she can spell her word. Tanya relents after a side discussion with Dr. Larabee and Mr. Welch, especially giving Akeelah double chores for three months as a punishment for giving it a secret behind her back. Javier protects Akeelah from disqualification by stalling until she can return. Dylan, Javier and Akeelah advance to the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

As Christmas approaches, Akeelah goes out to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his deceased daughter Denise: being very sick caused her death and that caused his wife Patricia to move into another city. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells her that if she looked around her, she would realize that she has "50,000 coaches". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to [[Washington, D.C.]] with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to [[match fixing|intentionally lose]] by deliberately misspelling "xanthosis". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally misspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition, rejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together, with Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling "logorrhea", much to his father's delight. Akeelah spells the last word on the list, "pulchritude", and the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.

==Production==

===Writing===
Doug Atchison first had the idea of making a film about spelling bees after watching the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] of 1994 and noticing that most of the contestants had "privileged backgrounds".{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}} Atchison also considered spelling bees to contain "all the drama and tension and entertainment value of a sporting event", and felt that this could be made into a film.&lt;ref name=doug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/akeelahandthebee/a/akeelahda042406.htm |title=Interview with 'Akeelah and the Bee' Writer/Director Doug Atchison |author=Murray, Rebecca |year=2006 |publisher=About.com |accessdate=June 17, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QPMGnSL2?url=http://movies.about.com/od/akeelahandthebee/a/akeelahda042406.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2014 |deadurl=no |pp=1–2 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=studlife&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studlife.com/archives/Cadenza/2006/04/07/AkeelahandtheBeeAnInterviewwithDougAtchison/ |title=Akeelah and the Bee: An Interview with Doug Atchison |author=Stitt, Brian |date=April 7, 2006 |work=[[Student Life (newspaper)|Student Life]] |publisher=[[Washington University in St. Louis]] |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QPafZYYE?url=http://www.studlife.com/archives/Cadenza/2006/04/07/AkeelahandtheBeeAnInterviewwithDougAtchison/ |archivedate=June 18, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this, he got the idea to write a script following the story of a child who had talent for spelling bee but was from a low-income neighborhood so did not "have access to the resources or coaching to pursue it as these other kids had."&lt;ref name=kpbs/&gt;{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}} He had the desire of making a "''[[Rocky]]''-like story" and although made it a "dramatic" plot, he declared it is "essentially a sports movie".&lt;ref name=kpbs/&gt;

Atchison started his screenplay in 1999, when he wrote a five-page [[Film treatment|treatment]] in about a month.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}}&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; In addition to the fact he was working on other projects, Atchison said he waited years before starting to write because he "thought someone else would do it first." This did not happen, so he began to write by himself.&lt;ref name=studlife/&gt; Few changes were made in the process of transitioning from the original draft to the final product. One change was that at first, Akeelah's mother had a smaller role and Akeelah's father was alive. Also, Larabee had been an older man (72 years old), and a few characters were cut. However, Atchison has summarized that "the steps she goes through, the friends she's got, those were always the same."&lt;ref name=doug/&gt;

===Development===
In 2000, Atchison submitted his script to the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] along with about 4,500 others, in hopes of winning the [[Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting]]. Atchison's script ended up being one of five scripts selected, and he won the grant.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/fellows/1986-present.html | title=Academy Nicholl Fellows 1986–Present | publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | accessdate=June 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302233824/http://oscars.org/awards/nicholl/fellows/1986-present.html | archivedate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editor [[Glenn Farr]], then a member of the committee, offered to edit Atchison's film as soon as it was finished.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt; Producer [[Sid Ganis]] was also attracted to the story during the award presentation ceremony.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}} [[Nancy Hult Ganis]], Sid's wife who was interested in public education, encouraged him to follow through with the film.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}}

The film was produced by [[Lionsgate Films]], [[2929 Entertainment]], [[Starbucks Entertainment]], Out of the Blue Entertainment, Reactor Films and Cinema Gypsy Productions,{{efn|name=companies}} with a budget around $6–8 million.&lt;ref name=ppgaz/&gt;&lt;ref name=box/&gt; However, the Ganis couple found it difficult to secure funding for the film.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}} In August 2001, Danny Llewelyn's Panoptic Pictures acquired the rights of Atchison's script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/panoptic-buzzes-to-bee-1117851262/ |title=Panoptic buzzes to 'Bee' |author=Swanson, Tim |date=August 14, 2001 |work=Variety |publisher=Penske Media Corporation |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aCQdEfUX?url=http://variety.com/2001/film/news/panoptic-buzzes-to-bee-1117851262/ |archivedate=July 22, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=wpost/&gt;&lt;ref name=austinc/&gt; --&gt;, documentary ''[[Spellbound (2002 film)|Spellbound]]'' was released and attracted attention to spelling bees, which, according to Hult Ganis, "helped us in some way".{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}} In November 2004, Lionsgate Films announced they would fund and distribute the film;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/lions-gate-gets-busy-on-bee-drama/ |title=Lions Gate Gets Busy on 'Bee' Drama |author=Foreman, Liza |date=November 30, 2004 |work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aCTbTVHd?url=http://www.backstage.com/news/lions-gate-gets-busy-on-bee-drama/ |archivedate=July 22, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in collaboration with 2929 Entertainment they would co-finance the production.&lt;ref name=bonnet&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/features/lions-gate-puts-bee-in-its-bonnet-1117914121/ |title=Lions Gate puts 'Bee' in its bonnet |author=Dunkley, Cathy |date=November 29, 2004 |work=Variety |publisher=Penske Media Corporation |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aB8JwN8P?url=http://variety.com/2004/film/features/lions-gate-puts-bee-in-its-bonnet-1117914121/ |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Starbucks announced a partnership with Lionsgate to market it.&lt;ref name=starbucks/&gt;

Another factor in not having a studio attached before was Atchison's desire to direct it as he wanted to ensure his story would remain the one he envisioned. Several studios wanted to turn Larabee's character into a white character but Atchison felt "it was important that Akeelah's mentor be someone that comes from her neighborhood, that looks like her."&lt;ref name=kpbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2006/may/04/akeelah-and-the-bee/ |title=Akeelah and the Bee |author=Accomando, Beth |date=May 4, 2006 |publisher=KPBS |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aBtNP9m4?url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2006/may/04/akeelah-and-the-bee/ |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lionsgate's President of Production Michael Paseornek agreed that Atchison should direct the script, claiming that he was the only person who could do it because the story "was in his heart and in his mind".{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}}

===Filming===
Filming began in February 2005;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/bassett-on-bee-spree-1117916235/ |title=Bassett on 'Bee' spree |date=January 12, 2005 |author=Dunkley, Cathy |work=Variety |publisher=Penske Media Corporation |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aCiYfp8a?url=http://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/bassett-on-bee-spree-1117916235/ |archivedate=July 22, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the crew filmed for ten hours a day for thirty-one days.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}}&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United States' [[child labor laws in the United States|child labor laws]], which necessitated spending at least three hours a day at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}}&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; Nevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis commented, "I honestly don't know how we figured it out, but we did".{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}} To get the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time and chatted with cinematographer [[M. David Mullen|David Mullen]], the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to compile a list of scenes.&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; This way, the filming team began each day knowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances scheduled for each day.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}}&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; Most of the filming took place in [[South Los Angeles]],{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}} which Atchison picked as the filming location due to their low budget.&lt;ref name=rfree/&gt; Scenes were also filmed at the [[University of Southern California]], [[Hollywood Palladium]]—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C. Hyatt Hotel—and [[Venice High School (Los Angeles)|Venice High School]].{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=10}}

===Authenticity===
To bring authenticity to the film's portrayal of spelling bees, George Hornedo, who competed in spelling bees in real life, was hired to play contestant Roman and be "an unofficial technical consultant." Hornedo helped the actors to recreate "certain habits and idiosyncrasies they do on stage to help them spell."{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=10}} Thus, Akeelah skipping rope to memorize the words was added as "something that was normal for the spelling bee" but Atchison tried to create it in a "subtle" way as he thought the audience could consider this unrealistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/akeelahandthebee/a/akeelahkp042006.htm |title=Keke Palmer Steals the Show in Akeelah and the Bee |author=Murray, Rebecca |year=2006 |publisher=About.com |accessdate=June 17, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QPJ2PX6b?url=http://movies.about.com/od/akeelahandthebee/a/akeelahkp042006.htm |archivedate=2014-06-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornedo and other children who had never acted before were cast because of their authentic portrayals of nervous contestants; other kids, in Atchison's eyes, were "too old in how they acted".&lt;ref name=studlife/&gt; Also, [[Jacques Bailly]], who won the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1980 and is currently the contest's official pronouncer, since 2003, played himself in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1900587,00.html | title=Spelling Bee Pronouncer Jacques Bailly | author=Stephey, M.J. | date=May 26, 2009 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To further help the staff, Atchison asked Paige Kimball, director of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, to be a consultant. Kimball "was amazed at not only at how precise it was in its recreation, but also how authentic the individuals and the casting for the event was."{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=10}} However, she and the organization did have some disagreements. Atchison has admitted that he originally created a more dramatic story than she wanted. However, he believed most of the disagreements were about technical procedures, "things you wouldn't even notice". For example, the children were originally sponsored by newspapers to compete, but Atchison felt this detail did not improve the story, so he removed it. There were some concerns about the screenplay, and Atchison changed some of them "because [he] thought it didn't matter one way or another so [he] just made them happy."&lt;ref name=doug/&gt;

===Music===
The film features a musical score by [[Aaron Zigman]], who wrote 45 minutes of compositions in two and a half weeks. He had planned to score ''Akeelah and the Bee'' over the holidays, but Lionsgate pushed its release date up, so Zigman was pressed for time to write the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=219 |title=Aaron Zigman - Interview |author=Goldwasser, Dan |date=February 2007 |publisher=[[Soundtrack.Net]] |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYG3XLF?url=http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=219 |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew inspiration from Fishburne's performance to write it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inmag.com/music/aaron-zigman.html |title=An Interview With Aaron Zigman |author=Tran, Kim |work=In Magazine |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYU4iDv?url=http://www.inmag.com/music/aaron-zigman.html |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A soundtrack album consisting of 16 tracks was released by Lionsgate Records in a deal with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]'s [[RED Distribution]] on April 4, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/akeelah-and-the-bee/ |title=Akeelah and the Bee Soundtrack (2006) |publisher=Soundtrack.Net |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYeaQqP?url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/akeelah-and-the-bee/ |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Lionsgate's New Tracks | author=Martens, Todd | journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=April 15, 2006 | issue=15 | volume=118 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It peaked at number 193 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and reached the 19th and sixth spot on the [[Billboard Top Independent Albums|''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums]] and Top Soundtracks respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/akeelah-and-the-bee-original-soundtrack-mw0000533256/awards |title=Akeelah and the Bee [Original Soundtrack] - Original Soundtrack − Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYwjVNP?url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/akeelah-and-the-bee-original-soundtrack-mw0000533256/awards |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original score, consisting of 37 tracks, was also released on April 4 as an [[iTunes]] exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/akeelah-and-the-bee-original-score/ |title=Akeelah and the Bee - Original Score (2006) |publisher=Soundtrack.Net |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYgIpbi?url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/akeelah-and-the-bee-original-score/ |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/lionsgate-releases-tylers-bug-score-online_article_54690.html |title=Lionsgate releases Tyler's BUG score online |author=Larson, Randall |date=May 18, 2007 |publisher=Mania.com |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYqGTAn?url=http://www.mania.com/lionsgate-releases-tylers-bug-score-online_article_54690.html |archivedate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's overcoming the fear of being great, before you can be great."{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=11}} Sid Ganis described it as a film "about hope and doing great things against all the odds,"{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}} while a ''[[New York Press]]'' reviewer declared it "addresses the human condition".&lt;ref name=nypress/&gt;

After attending USC School of Cinematic Arts and working at a youth center in South Los Angeles,&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who do well in school are said to be "[[acting white]]". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities.&lt;ref name=studlife/&gt; These doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that "Spelling Bee is for someone else".&lt;ref name=bonnet/&gt; She "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy,"&lt;ref name=bonnet/&gt; and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it "empowers her to ... accomplish this task."{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}} Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who look like her doing".&lt;ref name=ppgaz/&gt; The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing on their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all audiences "but particularly for kids [[person of color|of color]] to see a little black girl who does something powerful."&lt;ref name=ppgaz/&gt;

The director also attributed Akeelah's low-esteem and doubt of her own capacities to the public school system, where she is bullied and "her intellectual curiosity is kind of crushed".&lt;ref name=kpbs/&gt; As such, Akeelah is portrayed as an "undermotivated student",&lt;ref name=chang/&gt; who "[u]nwilling to be stigmatized as a freak or a brainiac," avoids showing her abilities.&lt;ref name=turan/&gt; According to Wesley Morris of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the film shows "the contradiction gifted students feel in an inhospitable environment."&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; Ann Hornaday from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Akeelah's sentence "Why would I want to represent a school that doesn't even have doors on the toilets?" is "one of the film's many subtle critiques of the country's education policies."&lt;ref name=wpost/&gt; Writing in the ''[[English Journal]]'', Amanda L. Hodges said it suggests a new approach on teaching with the "50,000 coaches" part; she declared it deconstructs the image of teachers "as those who keep order and disseminate knowledge" and shows that "[t]eaching is not an isolated activity that begins and ends at the classroom door."&lt;ref name=hodges&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Critical Close-Up: Three Films and Their Lessons in Critical Literacy | author=Hodges, Amanda L. | journal=English Journal | publisher=[[National Council of Teachers of English]] | volume=99 | issue=3 | date=January 2010 | page=73 | doi=10.2307/40503486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villarreal commented that the film "teaches you not to let your friends down",&lt;ref name=utsd/&gt; while Fishburne believed that the theme of community was important.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=8}} Marrit Ingman of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' said the film indicates "a community-based, cooperative model of group success,"&lt;ref name=austinc/&gt; while Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said it "focuses ... on the bee's community-uniting impact."&lt;ref name=chang/&gt; Hodges said Akeelah goes to the spelling bee because she recognizes it "proves that someone from their neighborhood can achieve success, and her achievement is, in a real sense, their own".&lt;ref name=hodges/&gt; In contrast, Bernard Beck wrote for ''Multicultural Perspectives'' that it depicts "the success of individual perseverance",{{sfn|Beck|2009|p=149}} while ''Red Feather Journall''{{'}}s Kathryn Linder expressed a similar opinion about individual success.{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=24}} Nevertheless, [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' commented "it raises important points about the ... obstacles to success that kids from poor neighborhoods face."&lt;ref name=turan/&gt; The ''New York Press''{{'}}s reviewer went further and said social class was its "real subject" as it "depicts the basics of class mobility that are routinely taken for granted".&lt;ref name=nypress/&gt; However, Chang asserted it shows the spelling bee contest as "a democratizing force",&lt;ref name=chang/&gt; while Rob Asghar, for ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', wrote it treats English as "the quintessential American tool for success."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060518&amp;slug=asghar18 |title=One nation, one anthem, sung in our common tongue |author=Ashgar, Rob |date=May 18, 2006 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=August 1, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aTAUTzk9?url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060518&amp;slug=asghar18 |archivedate=August 2, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Fishburne and Bassett also remarked that an important message of ''Akeelah and the Bee'' is to "speak properly" rather than strictly in vernacular, although Bassett emphasized the importance of the film's themes beyond spelling and spelling bees.&lt;ref name=radiofree/&gt;&lt;ref name=bassett/&gt; Atchison added that beyond learning how to spell words, Akeelah must learn the importance of the words. He said that Larabee "looks at Akeelah as a potential leader. He wants her to understand her history. She needs to know the importance of language – and competition."&lt;ref name=studlife/&gt; In spite of knowing its importance, it "deconstruct[s] the 'competition' paradigm of learning", according to Ingman.&lt;ref name=austinc/&gt; Fishburne noted not only children but parents can learn from the film; in his opinion, the most important is that they should pay attention to their children's abilities.&lt;ref name=radiofree/&gt; Villarreal also felt that, through Dylan's father, parents would be able to ponder if they are "push[ing] their kids to follow their own dreams and not the children's dreams."&lt;ref name=villa/&gt;

In spite of criticism, cast members' performances were usually well received – in particular, Palmer's portrayal of Akeelah. Ebert said, "The movie depends on her, and she deserves its trust."&lt;ref name=ebert/&gt; Hornaday opined that "Palmer's Akeelah is that cinematic ''[[wikt:rara avis|rara avis]]'', the kid who is cute without being too cute, sympathetic without being cloying, and believable without being tiresome."&lt;ref name=wpost/&gt; ''Evening Chronicle'' stated Palmer does it "with effortless grace" and that she "carries the film and doesn't strike a single wrong emotional note."&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt; Fuchs felt that most of the film's strengths "have to do with Palmer's winning performance."&lt;ref name=fuchs/&gt; Ingman declared Atchison's "ensemble is wonderful, and his star, Palmer, is a fantastically assured young actress who conveys Akeelah's maelstrom of 11-year-old feelings with no apparent effort."&lt;ref name=austinc/&gt; Turan complimented how Fishburne and Bassett's "presence and ability give this film a welcome integrity."&lt;ref name=turan/&gt; Mohan stated, "Although Fishburne and Bassett can do these roles in their sleep, the kids are actually quite engaging."&lt;ref name=oregon/&gt; Tourmakine felt there were "fine performances all around" and that Fishburne and Bassett "lend fine support in utterly believable roles".&lt;ref name=filmj/&gt;

Scholars Charise Pimentel and Cathleen Sawyer from the [[Texas State University]] published an article titled "''Akeelah and the Bee'': Inspirational Story of African-American Intellect and Triumph or Racist Rhetoric Served Up On Another Platter?" on the May 2011 issue of journal ''Multicultural Perspectives''.{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=100}} On a [[critical discourse analysis]], the authors argue that despite appearing to be an "inoccent enough" film, it has major approaches that make it racist.{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=100}} First, it implies that African-Americans needs to be rescued by others;{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=100}} second, depicts African-Americans community as "marked by homelessness, poverty, criminality, unemployment, and remnants of gang activity";{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=101}} third, indicates that black people usually only achieve success through sports by "linking the very essence of Akeelah's phenomenal ability to spell to her rhythmic abilities";{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=103}} and shows that African-Americans only can succeed outside their communities, "far from the oppressive clutches of their own."{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=104}}

Linder, on her September 2011 paper "Spelling Out Racial Difference: Moving Beyond the Inspirational Discourses in ''Akeelah and the Bee''", also criticizes it saying it "acts as a platform for a racial melodrama through which ideals of whiteness are reinforced and strengthened."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=19}} Using [[Linda Williams (film scholar)|Linda Williams]]' categories of what constitutes a racial [[melodrama]], Linder argues that it is described as an "inspirational" film because of "[its] portrayal of Akeelah's victimization by the black community that surrounds her" and of redemption only achieved "through the idealized discourse of young people's educational success as defined by dominant (white) culture."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=22}} Linder said characters "are mostly represented as having 'no interest in escape' from societal oppressions and limitations" and that "there is no sign throughout the film of any kind of lasting change for Akeelah's school or her young peers."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=30}}

Linder affirms that it creates a dichotomy between "success (whiteness) versus failure (blackness)."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=30}} Pimentel and Sawyer, as well as Linder, identify Larabee as the one who makes this separation clear when he manifests his disregard of [[African American Vernacular English]].{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=101}} The co-authors wrote that Larabee implies that "legitimate forms of intelligence can only be achieved through a Eurocentric perspective, thus advancing the message that Akeelah must be rescued from her African-American ways of knowing, in order to be considered intellectual."{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=101}} Another contraposition commented by scholars was "between the supportive Dr. Larabee and Akeelah's skeptical mother."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=28}} Pimental and Sawyer said she is portrayed as "an African-American obstructionist",{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=103-104}} while scholar Gloria Ladson‐Billings asserted she represents the stereotype of "ignorant Black woman".{{sfn|Ladson‐Billings|2009|p=93}} Although Fuchs said the film was able to avoid the "[[white savior narrative in film|white authority figure saves the underclass child]]" plotline by introducing Larabee,&lt;ref name=fuchs/&gt; Ladson‐Billings, Linder, and Pimentel and Sawyer opined that it did not.{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=103-104}}{{sfn|Ladson‐Billings|2009|p=93}} After all, Larabee, as Linder described, is "a non-threatening black man who has assimilated to white culture and who can be depended on to help assimilate others".{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=30}}

An '''art blog''' is a common type of [[blog]] that comments on art.  More recently, as with other types of blogs, some art blogs have taken on 'web 2.0' social networking features.  Art blogs that adopt this sort of change can develop to become a source of information on art events (listings and maps), a way to share information and images, or virtual meeting ground.

Art blogs entries cover different topics, from art critiques and commentary to insider art world gossip, auction results, art news, personal essays, portfolios, interviews, artists’ journals, art marketing advice and artist biographies. Some artists use art blogs as a form of new media art project.

Art blogs may also serve as a forum to reach out to anybody interested in art — be it painting, sculpture, print making, creative photography, video art, conceptual art or new media. In this way, they may be visited not only for the practitioners of different forms of art, but also collectors, connoisseurs, and critics.

==Mainstream media==
In 2011, art critic [[Brian Sherwin]] interviewed art critic Mat Gleason of [[Coagula Art Journal]] for Faso.com's FineArtViews blog. The interview between Sherwin and Gleason focused on [[contemporary art]] criticism and the role of art blog’s in present-day [[art criticism]] among other issues. Gleason suggested to Sherwin that art blogs and the development of new media have become a "''blow''" to traditional print art magazines. Gleason and Sherwin also discussed how [[bloggers]] form a "''pack mentality''" based on region and perceived significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faso.com/fineartviews/27987/fineartviews-interview-mat-gleason-art-critic-and-founder-of-coagula-art-journal "FineArtViews Interview: Mat Gleason -- Art Critic and Founder of Coagula Art Journal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218141116/http://faso.com/fineartviews/27987/fineartviews-interview-mat-gleason-art-critic-and-founder-of-coagula-art-journal |date=18 December 2011 }}, Faso.com - FineArtViews. Retrieved 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/26/fineartsviews-interviews-_n_828719.html "FineArtViews Interviews Mat Gleason, Art Critic/Founder of Coagula"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420061624/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/26/fineartsviews-interviews-_n_828719.html |date=20 April 2012 }}, Huffington Post. Retrieved 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2009, Art Connect produced an in-depth interview by Peter Cowling for [[Art Connect]] and Jessica Palmer of [[Bioephemera]].  The interview, titled It is not Really Bloggers vs. Journalists, You Know,&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, Peter and Palmer, Jessica, "It is not Really Bloggers vs. Journalists, You Know", April 2009 {{cite web|url=http://www.loveart-gallery.com/art-blog-reviews/2009/04/27/extraordinary-art-blogs-series-part-seven-it-is-not-really-bloggers-vs-journalists-you-know |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701133911/http://www.loveart-gallery.com/art-blog-reviews/2009/04/27/extraordinary-art-blogs-series-part-seven-it-is-not-really-bloggers-vs-journalists-you-know/ |archivedate=1 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed to five trends that were shaping the communication and discussion of art on the internet, and that the real picture was much bigger than just the bloggers vs. journalists that had been discussed to date.  These five points were:

* Media convergence will continue to improve consumer choice, providing a better match between desire and availability.
* Content producers are just that.  Consumers care less about how and where they can get the content they want.  What they do consistently care about is the quality of the content, and whether the content is produced to their timescales.
* The content producer-to-content consumer relationship is changing.  Requests for feedback and further debate have been partially overtaken by things like conversations, and further fragmentation will certainly occur.
* Information technology and systems, provided as commodity (pay-as-you-go) services.  Such services range from processing and storage, through to credit card processing and super-fast content delivery.
* The economic downrun.

On January 8, 2009, Regina Hackett, art critic of the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]], noted in her article Art Blogs Hit Wikipedia &lt;ref&gt;Hackett, Regina, "Art Blogs Hit Wikipedia." ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', January 2009. {{cite web |url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/art/archives/159041.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720231949/http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/art/archives/159041.asp |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that commercially run, mainstream media supported, art blogs face issues of acceptance among the independent art blogging community.

On January 7, 2009, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' art critic Martha Schwendener suggests that art blogs have helped shape a more laissez-faire climate for art writing. "Art blogs have created a new, largely unedited, admirably 'unprofessional'—hence, democratic—venue for people to speak their minds, gossip, or theorize about art."&lt;ref&gt;Schwendener, Martha, "What Crisis? Some Promising Futures for Art Criticism." ''The Village Voice'', January 2009. {{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-01-07/art/what-crisis-some-promising-futures-for-art-criticism/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116123956/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-01-07/art/what-crisis-some-promising-futures-for-art-criticism |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the ''[[Brooklyn Rail]]'' contributor [[James Kalm]] produced an article titled "Virtually Overwhelmed.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/09/artseen/brooklyn-dispatches-virtually-overwhelmed Kalm, James, "Virtually Overwhelmed." ''Brooklyn Rail''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105114244/http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/09/artseen/brooklyn-dispatches-virtually-overwhelmed |date=5 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A practicing artist and video blogger himself, Kalm has this to say about art blogs, "The art blogosphere is a work in progress, and you’ve got to be vigilant of hidden agendas. As with anything online, take it with a grain of salt. Have fun, speak out, but don’t let it cut too much into your studio time; you might end up in a twelve step-program."

In the November 2007 issue of ''[[Art in America]]'', [[Peter Plagens]] contributed "Report from the Blogosphere: The New Grass Roots."&lt;ref&gt;Plagens, Peter, "Report from the Blogosphere: The New Grass Roots." ''Art in America'', November 2007. [http://madsilence.wordpress.com/2008/02/03/the-future-of-the-art-blog/]&lt;/ref&gt; Plagens convened a round table of veteran art bloggers, who conversed via email on a range of questions, aimed at getting a better understanding of what art blogs were, how they were run, and their relationship with the mainstream media.

In an October 2007 article for artnet Magazine, critic Charlie Finch suggested that art critiques and reviews by art bloggers are overrated and lengthy, and implied that the art blogging community was overly insular.&lt;ref&gt;Finch, Charlie, "A NOT-SO-VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY" ''artnet Magazine'', {{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/finch/finch10-26-07.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418041306/http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/finch/finch10-26-07.asp |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article includes several ''ad hominen'' arguments against specific art bloggers, and ventures the opinion that art blogs "have no readers".

In the January 2005 issue of ''[[Art in America]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Rafael, "Art in the Blogoshere." ''Art in America'', "Front Page," January 2005. {{cite web |url=http://www.firstpulseprojects.com/frontpageaia.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807172818/http://www.firstpulseprojects.com/frontpageaia.pdf |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael Rubinstein mentioned several blogs in the magazine's "Front Page" section, where he penned a brief, annotated survey of 12 art blogs that he found "to be worth regular visits.". Rubinstein opined that "art-related blogs" had not, at the time, become as consequential as blogs in other fields such as poetry or politics.

{{Culture of Bangladesh}}

There has been numerous works of art that depicted the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] during and since the War both at Bangladesh and abroad. The concert for Bangladesh organized by members of the Beatles was a major happening in 1971 for protest music. The songs recorded for and broadcast on [[Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra]] are still considered to be the best of Bangladeshi protest songs.

The four documentaries made during the War – [[Zahir Raihan]]'s ''[[Stop Genocide]]'' and ''A State Is Born'', Babul Chowdhry's ''Innocent Millions'', Alamgir Kabir's ''Liberation Fighters'' – are described as the first films made in [[Bangladesh]], as earlier films were all made in Pakistan or India, larger entities that Bangladesh belonged to. ''[[Muktir Gaan]] (Song of Freedom)'', based on footage shot by Leer Levin during the war, by [[Tareque Masud|Tareque]] and Kathrine Masud is critically the most acclaimed Bangladeshi documentary. The directors followed the film with two sequels – ''[[Muktir Kotha|Story of Freedom]]'' and ''Narir Katha''. Their feature film on the same subject, ''[[Matir Moyna]]'', won the FIPRESCII award at Cannes Film Festival.

There have been numerous poems and novels written on the Liberation war, including Shamsur Rahman's famous poems written during the War. Arguably it is the most often used subject for Bangladeshi literature since 1971. The monuments made to commemorate the War are the highest esteemed monuments in Bangladesh.

==History==
Ayers Saint Gross is the successor firm to '''Sill, Buckler &amp; Fenhagen''', founded in 1912 and known as the designer of [[Baltimore City College|The Baltimore City College]], the third oldest public high school in America, founded downtown in 1839, and having occupied eight different locations in its now 175-year-old history.  Some of the City College's earlier buildings were landmark structures in their era, built by several famous local architects of the time. "Buckler &amp; Fenhagen" won the national competition in the 1920s with their design for BCC's landmark stone [[Gothic Revival architecture|Collegiate Gothic]] "Castle on the Hill" on the highest hilltop in the northeast section of the City overlooking the downtown skyline to the south. Built at a cost of over 2.4 million dollars, during 1924-1928, the "Castle" still serves this magnet, college prep high school which focuses on the humanities, liberal arts, social studies and the Classics and is traditionally one of the best performing student body in the State.  As a humorous note, carved limestone faces of both architects are placed as small stone "[[gargoyles]]" on either side of a large central window over the front entrance.

'''Birmingham Conservation Trust''' is a charity which saves and restores historic buildings in the city of [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. In 2004 it completed the conservation and restoration of the last surviving court of [[Birmingham Back to Backs|Back to Back houses]] on [[Hurst Street]] in the city. These are now run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

Birmingham Conservation Trust moved on to a short term project managing the protection of [[Perrott's Folly]] &amp;mdash; a tower in the city which has close associations with [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Work has been taking place to ensure the tower does not collapse.

Another project is Newman Brothers, a family-run factory in Birmingham's unique [[Jewellery Quarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/newman-brothers-coffin-works-jewellery-5380940|title=Newman Brothers Coffin Works in Jewellery Quarter brought back from the dead - Birmingham Mail|author=Jane Tyler|work=birminghammail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm made some of the world's finest [[coffin]] furniture, including the fittings for the funerals of [[Winston Churchill]], [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. The very last sets of cast brass gothic handles from this factory were used on the coffins of Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] and of [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]].

'''''Bishop Petros with Saint Peter the Apostle''''' ({{Lang-pl|Biskup Petros ze świętym Piotrem Apostołem}}) is a [[Nubia]]n Christian wall painting from the last quarter of the 10th century.{{Sfn|Mierzejewska|2016|loc="Opis"}}{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} Made with [[tempera]] on [[silt]] [[plaster]] using a [[Fresco-secco|''al secco'']] [[fresco]] technique, it depicts Petros, the bishop of [[Faras]] between 974 and 997. The anonymous work was discovered in the ruins of [[Faras Cathedral]], an important religious centre of Nubia, in modern [[Sudan]]. Rescued from flooding when [[Lake Nasser]] was created, since 1964 it is part of the Faras Gallery of the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]].{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

The painting, which used to be part of a larger composition, representing King [[Georgios II of Makuria]] with the [[Virgin and Child]], was painted on the west wall of the chapel located in the southern [[nave]] of the cathedral.  The portrait of the bishop was placed to the right of the image of the king. The representation of the two highest hierarchs of the state along with their [[patron saints]] indicated the supernatural origin of the power of the nobles and symbolized the unity of the clerical and secular power.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|p=182}}

The image was created in Petros' lifetime, which is suggested by the inscription in Greek accompanying the painting, wishing him "many years [of life]".{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} The painting is considered one of the most precious images of Nubian officials found in the Cathedral of Faras{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} and is also one of six best preserved portraits of bishops discovered there.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|p=176}}

== History ==
The painting, like most other pieces of {{Interlanguage link multi|Christian Nubian art|pl|3=Chrześcijańskie malarstwo nubijskie|lt=Nubian art}} in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Faras Gallery|pl|3=Galeria Faras im. Profesora Kazimierza Michałowskiego w Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie}} of the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]], was recovered by Polish archaeologists during the so-called Nubian Campaign, an international effort led by [[UNESCO]] prior to construction of the [[Lake Nasser|Nasser Dam]]. The excavations, carried out between 1961 and 1964, discovered a religious complex in the town of Faras (ancient Pachoras), near modern Sudanese-Egyptian border. Well-preserved ruins of a large Christian cathedral from 7th to 14th centuries contained well-preserved wall religious paintings.{{Sfn|Sulikowska|2015|loc=¶ 1–12}}

Since the area was to be flooded by the waters of the artificial Lake Nasser, a team of Polish archaeologists led by [[Kazimierz Michałowski]] was allowed to recover the artifacts. A major part was then transported to the [[National Museum of Sudan]], where a team of Polish scientists led by [[Józef Gazy]] carried out {{Interlanguage link multi|Conservation and restoration of Faras wall paintings|pl|3=Konserwacja i restauracja malowideł ściennych z Faras|lt=their conservation}}. Some 40 per cent were transported to the National Museum of Warsaw, becoming the nucleus of the future Faras Gallery.{{Sfn|Sulikowska|2015|loc=¶ 1–12}}

The image itself was painted by an anonymous artist some time during bishop Petros' tenure, between 974 and 999 AD.{{Sfn|Michałowski|1974}} It represents the so-called yellow and red style, typical of a transitional period between the white style of 9th century and later multicolour style introduced in the 11th century and typical of all later wall paintings at Faras until its abandonment in the 14th century. Other images representative of the yellow and red style found at Faras represent King Georgios, a ''Virgin and Child'', ''Three Men in the Fiery Furnace'', as well as a Passion Cycle. The red and yellow style paintings are considered among the most interesting, both visually and for their theological message.{{Sfn|Michałowski|1974}}

== Description ==
[[File:Faras_-_Restoration_in_MNW-04.jpg|thumb|Work on conservation and restoration of the fresco in Warsaw's National Museum, 1964–1966]]

The dark-skinned bishop is depicted wearing his liturgical robes, complete with a narrow, white handkerchief (''[[encheiron]]'') wound around the index finger of his right palm. With it he points at a [[Gospel Book]] he holds in his other arm.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

Petros is dressed in a long white robe (''[[sticharion]]'') with vertical green stripes. His yellow ''[[phelonion]]'' (a type of [[chasuble]]), in the shape of an elongated ellipse, is adorned with a pattern of a red net, with precious stones sewn into the fabric. The edge of the chasuble is also adorned with a strip of fabric with green and red jewels. Bishop's ''[[epitrachelion]]'' is decorated with yellow wheels with a green circuit and red rectangles.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|p=178}} The ''[[omophorion]]'', one of symbols of episcopal dignity, is white with a pattern of circles and rectangles.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|pp=181–182}} The head of the bishop is wrapped in a turban characteristic of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] hierarchs, which could suggest that Petros was a [[Monophysitism|monophysite]].{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|pp=186–188}}

Behind the bishop stands Saint [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]], dressed in a white crown signifying martyrdom. The saint has both hands on the shoulders of the bishop.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} This pose, common in Nubian painting of the epoch, signifies the fact that the saint protects and supports the bishop,{{sfn|Martens-Czarnecka|2006|p=35}} but also points at the supernatural character of bishop's power.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

Around the head of Saint Peter there is a black inscription in Greek: SAINT PETER THE APOSTLE MARTYR OF THE CROSS ABBA PETROS BISHOP AND METROPOLITAN OF PACHORAS [may he live] MANY YEARS.{{Sfn|Mierzejewska|2016|loc="Opis"}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5302">[[File:Minuscule caroline.jpg|thumb|250px|This Carolingian Gospel Book is written in a fine [[Carolingian minuscule]].]]

'''British Library, Additional Manuscript 11848''' is an [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]]  [[Carolingian]] [[Latin]] [[Gospel Book]] produced at [[Tours]].  It contains the [[Vulgate]] translation of the four [[Gospel]]s written on [[vellum]] in [[Carolingian minuscule]] with [[Square Capitals|Square]] and [[Rustic Capitals]] and [[Uncial]]s as display scripts.  The manuscript has 219 extant [[Bookbinding|folio]]s which measure approximately 330 by 230 mm.  The text is written in area of about 205 by 127 mm. In addition to the text of the Gospels, the manuscript contains the letter of [[St. Jerome]] to [[Pope Damasus I|Pope Damasus]] and of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] to [[Carpian]], along with the Eusebian [[canon tables]].  There are  prologues and capitula lists before each Gospel.  A table of readings for the year was added, probably between 1675 and 1749, to the end of the volume. This is followed by a list of capitula incipits and a word grid which were added in the Carolingian period.

== Provenance ==

The [[codex]] was produced at the Monastery of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin at Tours]] between 820 and 830, under the abbacy [[Fridugisus]], who was the successor of [[Alcuin]].  It is the earliest known Gospel Book from Tours to contain four [[Evangelist portrait]]s.  The location of the book is uncertain until the 18th century. There is a book stamp on folio 1 that indicates that the volume belonged to Count Suchtelan, the Russian Ambassador to Stockholm in the 18th century.  In the early 19th century it belonged to Lord Strangford.  It was sold at Sotheby's in August 1831 and was purchased by [[Samuel Butler (schoolmaster)|Samuel Butler]], Bishop of Lichfield. The [[British Library]] acquired the book along with the rest of Bishop Butler's collection of manuscripts.

== Decorations ==

[[Image:BritLibAddMS11848Fol109vLuke.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Folio 109 verso contains a portrait of the Evangelist [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]].]]

The manuscript contains canon tables set within architectural arcades which are decorated with zoomorphic and foliate designs.  There are four Evangelist portraits.  Each evangelist is shown as a scribe and is identified by a half-length symbol above him and by an inscription. The portraits show some similarities to some [[Insular art|Insular]] manuscripts and some Court School manuscripts, as might be expected given the nationality Fridugisus, who was English, and from his connections to the Carolingian court.  The portraits have been described as being "coarsely executed".  The manuscript also contains a decorated title page and incipit page for each gospel. There are also decorated major and minor initials.  The major initials are done in early [[Franco-Saxon]] style and were done by a different artist than the one who did the portraits.

== Binding ==
The volume still has its Carolingian [[treasure binding]] dating from the ninth century.  The covers were refurbished in the 14th and 19th centuries.  The covers are oak panels covered in embossed silver.  The front cover has the figure of a seated Christ in Majesty enclosed within a rectangular frame decorated with stones and foliate designs.  The majority of the medal work is 9th century typical of mid-ninth century Carolingian metalwork.   In the four corners of the frame are enamels of the four evangelist symbols, which were added in the fourteenth century.  The enamels were probably produced at  [[Limoges]].  The original colored stones were replaced by jewels in 1838 for Bishop Butler.  There are [[relic]]s of finger bones from an anonymous saint embedded on the interior of the boards.   The clasps for the volume were probably replaced in the 19th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1227">In a historical context, a '''covenant''' applies to formal promises that were made under [[oath]], or in less remote history, agreements in which the name actually uses the term 'covenant', implying that they were binding for all time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} One of the earliest attested covenants between parties is the so-called Mitanni treaty, dating to the 14th or 15th century BC, between the [[Hittites]] and the [[Mitanni]].

Historically, certain treaties and compacts have been given the name "covenant", most notably the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] that marked the [[Covenanter]]s, a [[Protestant]] political organization important in the [[history of Scotland]]. The term 'covenant' appears throughout Scottish, English and Irish history.

The term covenant could be used in English to refer to either the [[Bundesbrief]] of 1291, or the [[Pfaffenbrief]] of 1370, documents which led to the formation of the Swiss state or "[[Eidgenossenschaft]]". In this usage the German "''Eid''" is being translated as "covenant" rather than "oath" in order to reflect its written status.

{{about|a literary form|the real estate concept|Fixer-upper|"fixup" in the context of executable formats on computers|Relocation (computer science)}}

A '''fix-up''' (or '''fixup''') is a [[novel]] created from several [[short fiction]] stories that may or may not have been initially related or previously published. The stories may be edited for consistency, and sometimes new connecting material, such as a [[frame story]] or other interstitial narration, is written for the new work. The term was coined by the [[science fiction]] writer [[A. E. van Vogt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Robert|title=A. E. van Vogt: The Weinberg Interview (1980)|url=http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/interviews/weinberg.php|website=Icshi.net|publisher=Isaac Walwyn|accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published several fix-ups of his own, including ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'',&lt;ref name="liptak20130805"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Liptak |first=Andrew |date=2013-08-05 |title=A.E. van Vogt and the Fix-Up Novel |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/e-van-vogt-and-fix-novel/ |magazine=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the practice (if not the term) exists outside of science fiction. The use of the term in science fiction criticism was popularised by the first (1979) edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', edited by [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]], which credited Van Vogt with the creation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = Peter |author2=John Clute| title = New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction | publisher = Orbit | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-85723-897-4 | page = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/fixup|title=Fixup page at Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (Third Edition)|website=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name comes from the modifications that the author needs to make in the original texts to make them fit together as though they were a novel. Foreshadowing of events from the later stories may be jammed into an early chapter of the fix-up, and character development may be interleaved throughout the book. Contradictions and inconsistencies between episodes are usually worked out.

Some fix-ups in their final form are more of a [[short story cycle]] or composite novel rather than a traditional novel with a single main plotline. Examples are [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' and [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[I, Robot]]'', both of which read as a series of short stories which may share plot threads and characters but which still act as self-contained stories.&lt;ref name="luscher"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WyidbsLaxQC&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;ots=mnc_goAXNW&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=A Companion to the American Novel |last=Luscher |first=Robert M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |isbn=9781405101196 |editor-last=Bendixen |editor-first=Alfred |editor-link=Alfred Bendixen |series=Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture |volume=80 |page=370 |chapter=The American Short-Story Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, van Vogt's ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]]'' is structured like a continuous novel although it incorporates material from three previous Van Vogt short stories.

Fix-ups became an accepted practice in the 1950s, when science fiction and [[fantasy]]—once published only in magazines—began appearing in book form. Large book publishers like [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] entered the market, greatly increasing demand for fiction. Authors created new manuscripts from old stories to sell to publishers. [[Algis Budrys]] in 1965 described fixups as a consequence of the lack of good supply during the "bad years for quality" of the mid-1950s, although citing ''The Martian Chronicles'' and [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s ''[[City (novel)|City]]'' as among exceptions.&lt;ref name="budrys196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

'''''In the Cut''''' is a 2003 Australian-American [[Mystery film|mystery]] and  [[erotic thriller]] film written and directed by [[Jane Campion]] and starring [[Meg Ryan]], [[Mark Ruffalo]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Campion's screenplay is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the novel of the same name by [[Susanna Moore]]. The film focuses on a college English professor who becomes entangled with a detective investigating a series of gruesome murders in her Manhattan neighborhood. 

The film received a [[limited release]] on 22 October 2003 in the United States, and was subsequently given a [[wide release]] on [[Halloween]] that year in the United States and United Kingdom. The film received mixed to negative reviews from most critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_cut/ | work=Rotten Tomatoes | title=In the Cut | accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Plot==
High school teacher and writer Frannie Avery meets a student at a local bar, and when she heads to the bathroom sees a woman performing [[oral sex]] on a man. A few days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions her as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman, whose severed limb was found in Frannie's garden. They flirt despite the grisly nature of their introduction, and meet at the same bar later. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows more disillusioned with the attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez. Even as Malloy defends his partner, who can no longer carry a gun because he threatened his unfaithful wife, he promises he will do anything she wants except hit her. She leaves abruptly and is assaulted walking home, but calls Malloy and their affair begins that night. 

Frannie recognizes the detective's tattoo, from the man in the basement of the bar, and asks her sister Pauline if she would trust a man who got a blow job in a bar. Pauline says yes, but Frannie is still suspicious. After Malloy tells her that she and the first victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, and she might have seen the murderer, she begins to suspect that Malloy may actually be the killer, especially after a second victim is found. But later she goes with him to a woodsy spot by the water, where he scares her by shooting at [[garbage bag]]s floating on the surface, then tells her she should learn how to shoot. She surprises herself by taking aim and shooting well, before they head back to the city.

She finds her old boyfriend in her bed when she gets home, and goes back to her sister's apartment, where she finds the door open and Pauline's decapited head. She is now more frightened of Malloy than ever, but goes home and gets drunk, and almost stumbles into bed with her student before throwing him out. Malloy's partner is outside watching as the young man runs out, and Frannie shouts out the window that Malloy should stay away from her. But he comes over and helps her clean herself up, and she can't decide if she should trust him. So she cuffs him to a pipe and makes love to him, and as soon as she is done he starts rattling the cuffs, demanding to be set free. She is fishing in his jacket for the keys when she finds the missing charms from her bracelet, which he claims he found and was planning to return to her. She suddenly becomes very suspicious of him, and he gets scared and yells at her. She finally tells Malloy she saw his tattoo in the basement of the bar when he was getting a blow job, and she runs out, stumbling right into his partner's arms. Frannie tells Rodriguez what she saw, and he says they need to sit down and talk, so she gets in his car. Malloy's screams from the window are ignored.

Rodriguez drives her out to the [[Little Red Lighthouse]] below the [[George Washington Bridge]], telling her this is the place he goes to fish, and she says, "I teach that book, ''[[To the Lighthouse]]''." But as soon as he locks the gate behind them she knows she is in trouble, and he shows her the tattoo on his arm, the twin of Malloy's. She realizes Malloy is innocent, then she slips on his jacket before Rodriguez takes her in his arms. She shoots him once with Malloy's gun but he tries to strangle her before she can shoot him again; they fall, and he dies. She walks, bloodied, back to her apartment and lies down in the arms of the exhausted Malloy, still cuffed to the pipe where she left him.

==Reception==
''In the Cut'' received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with a score of 34% from Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 147 critics and an average rating of 4.8 out of 10; the consensus reads: "Ryan is very good playing against type, but Campion's good-looking thriller is far from thrilling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_cut/|title=In the Cut - Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film maintains a score of 46 out of 100 from 38 critics on Metacritic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-the-cut|title=In the Cut Reviews - Metacritic|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CinemaScore gave it a rating of "F" based on surveys from general audiences.

Despite the largely unfavorable reception, however, ''In the Cut'' was among the films discussed by [[Slavoj Žižek]] in ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/shelf-life-13/ |title=Shelf Life: Jane Campion reconsidered. |last=Gottlieb |first=Akiva |publisher=The Nation |date=August 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic David Thomson has also called it a masterpiece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/david-thomsons-moments-that-made-the-movies.html |title=David Thomson's 'Moments That Made the Movies' |last=Schwarzbaum |first=Lisa |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 6, 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in his book ''Moments That Made the Movies'', hails it as "one of the great films of the twenty-first century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moments That Made the Movies|page=277|last=Thomson|first=David|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|date=2014|isbn=0500516413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association is headquartered in [[Los Angeles]], but has a global membership and wide scope of services and advocacy. Its roster of 150 member companies in 23 countries include independent production and distribution companies, sales agents, television companies, studio-affiliated companies and [[financial institution]]s. IFTA members create more than 500 independent films and countless hours of TV programming each year generating a revenue of $4 billion annually.

The freedom for independents to create and distribute movies and television shows has been threatened by a handful of consolidated media companies that control programming and distribution. As the voice and advocate for the independent industry worldwide, IFTA continues to increase public awareness of the major issues facing independents and publicly  represents the [[independent film]] industry on such matters as the threat to a competitive marketplace seen in [[Concentration of media ownership|media consolidation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/BC_Beat/12577-IFTA_Not_Invited_To_Cocktail_Party_.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404014836/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/BC_Beat/12577-IFTA_Not_Invited_To_Cocktail_Party_.php |archivedate=April 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Network neutrality|net neutrality]];&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ife9d9d88fcefbcdc766b1003d2890216]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the elimination of [[trade barrier]]s; the impact of new technology on our traditional [[business model]]s; [[Copy protection#Anti-piracy|anti-piracy]]; improvement of [[copyright|copyright protection]] around the world;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebusinessoffilmdaily.com/afm2009/D7_S2.html/ |title=IFTA Steps Up Anti-Piracy Campaign With Internet Security Technology Measures |website=Thebusinessoffilmdaily.com |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the need to foster broad-based growth of the industry.

To that end, IFTA executives meet regularly with Washington lawmakers to advocate on behalf of reasonable and limited regulations to restore balance in the television and cable marketplace. IFTA endorses the principles of "net neutrality" or open access to the Internet. Net neutrality is currently threatened if broadband providers are able to discriminate in favor of certain content or applications, potentially replicating the closed and [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] structure with traditional programming and distribution platforms.

In December 2008, IFTA called on the new [[Barack Obama|Obama]] Administration to appoint an [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] chairman and commissioners who support principles of openness and diversity in the media with an [[open letter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifta-online.org/Uploads/Issues/60.PDF ]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to his transition team, including [[Julius Genachowski]], who was confirmed as the new FCC chairman.

IFTA lobbies against market barriers that impede the independents' ability to compete fully in national markets around the world, including import and censorship restrictions and weak copyright protection. IFTA is a member of the [[Center for Copyright Information]] (CCI),&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113051407/http://www.copyrightinformation.org/about |archivedate=January 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to reduce online [[copyright infringement]] through a [[graduated response]] scheme called the [[Copyright Alert System]].

==What is an Independent?==
According to IFTA:&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifta-online.org/ |title=Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance &amp;#124; The Voice for Independents |website=Ifta-online.org |date=2016-02-15 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An independent film or television program is financed primarily from sources outside the seven major U.S. [[Movie studio|studios]]. Independent entertainment programming is made at every budget range, from mainstream commercial to [[Art film|art house]], and is seen by the public side-by-side with major studio releases. IFTA's member companies are the independents who finance, license, and produce this programming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some members of the IFTA are subsidiaries of the [[Major film studio|Big Six movie studios]], such as [[New Line Cinema]] and [[HBO]] which is owned by [[Time Warner]], and [[Focus Features]] which is owned by [[NBCUniversal]].

==IFTA leadership==
Jean Prewitt became IFTA's President in April 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/263558-Leading_the_War_for_Independents.php |title=Leading the War for Independents &amp;#124; Broadcasting &amp; Cable |website=Broadcastingcable.com |date=2009-05-23 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to Chief Executive Officer in December 2001. Prior to joining IFTA, Prewitt was a senior government official and lobbyist for the film and entertainment industry for nearly ten years. Before her time in Washington DC, she was Senior Vice President and General Counsel of United International Pictures (the international distribution entity formed by then-Universal, Paramount and MGM-UA studios), managing international legal and government affairs.&lt;ref name="ifta-online.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifta-online.org/ifta-staff |title=IFTA Staff &amp;#124; Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance |website=Ifta-online.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Wolf has been IFTA's Executive Vice President and Managing Director of the American Film Market since 1998.  He joined IFTA in 1993 as Senior Vice President of Business Development. Before joining IFTA, Wolf served two years as President &amp; COO of Studio Three Film Corporation, a U.S. theatrical distribution company.&lt;ref name="ifta-online.org"/&gt;

In September 26, 2017 Michael Ryan was elected for a second two-year term as Chairman of the Alliance until 2019. Another appointments include Andrew Kramer ([[Lionsgate]]) as General Vice Chairperson and Clay Epstein as Vice Chairperson.
Jay Joyce, Lloyd Kaufman ([[Troma Entertainment]]), Charlotte Mickie and Almira Ravil continue to serve as members of the Executive Committee through their second year of their term. The Board of Directors include Tannaz Anisi, Paul Bales ([[The Asylum]]), Jason Buckley ([[Lakeshore Entertainment]]), Carl Clifton (Hyde Park International), Caroline Couret-Delegue, Kirk D'Amico (Myriad Pictures), Jeffrey Greenstein ([[Millennium Media]]), Lise Romanoff, Gabrielle Stewart, Jeannine Tang, [[Shaked Berenson]] ([[Epic Pictures Group]]), Tamara Birkemoe (Foresight Unlimited), Jody Cipriano (MarVista Entertainment), Alexandra Cocean ([[Voltage Pictures]]), Camela Galano, Brad Krevoy, Albert Lee, Nat McCormick, Michael Rothstein and Alison Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifta-online.org/independent-film-television-alliance-elects-executive-committee-and-board-directors|title=http://www.ifta-online.org/independent-film-television-alliance-elects-executive-committee-and-board-directors|website=Ifta-online.org |date=2017-09-26|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A group of independent producers established the [[American Film Market]] and the AFM's parent, the non-profit American Film Marketing Association, in 1980 to expand the independent film business. In 2004, the organization changed its name and expanded its scope to include television with the formation of the Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

Collectively, independents produce the largest number of motion picture industry jobs, films and, over the past quarter century, Academy Award-winning movies. IFTA members have produced and distributed such [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]] winners as ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982); ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984); ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986); ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (1987); ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' (1989); ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990); ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991); ''[[Braveheart]]'' (1995); ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996); ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998); ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' (2002); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003); ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004); ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004); ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006); ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007) ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (2008), ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', (2009); ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010); and ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' (2011).

Most recently, some of the world's most prominent films were produced, distributed and financed by IFTA Members: ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (2008); ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]'' (2008); ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'' (2008); ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]'' (2008); ''[[Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]'' (2008); ''[[W. (film)|W]]'' (2008); ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'' (2008); ''[[Defiance (2008 film)|Defiance]]'' (2008); ''[[I've Loved You So Long]]'' (2008); ''[[Burn After Reading]]'' (2008); ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (2009); ''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]'' (2009); ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' (2010); ''[[Twilight Saga: Eclipse]]'' (2010); ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' (2011); ''[[The Lincoln Lawyer]]'' (2011); ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' (2012); ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]'' (2013).

IFTA members, as well as the entire independent film industry, benefit from the American Film Market (AFM), which has grown into one of the world's largest film markets, as well as the organization's standard form contracts and   publications. Acting as an arbitration tribunal, IFTA resolves distribution-related disputes between parties.

Before her selection as an astronaut candidate she served as a Flight Surgeon for Training Squadron 86 ([[VT-86]]), the [[Naval Flight Officer]] advanced training squadron for tactical jets at NAS Pensacola.

She was a Basic Life Support Instructor, Advanced Cardiac Life Support Provider, Advanced Trauma Life Support Provider, and Hyperbaric Chamber Advisor.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in April 1996, Clark reported to the [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]] in August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/01/sprj.colu.profile.clark/index.html|title=CNN.com - Astronaut Clark: 'Life is a magical thing' - Feb.  4, 2003|website=www.cnn.com|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing two years of training and evaluation, she was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. From July 1997 to August 2000 Clark worked in the Astronaut Office Payloads/Habitability Branch. Clark flew aboard [[STS-107]], logging 15 days, 22 hours and 21 minutes in space.&lt;ref name="NASAbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/clark.html|title=Astronaut Bio: Laurel Blair Salton Clark 5/04|publisher=}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/astronauts/english/clark_laurel.htm|title=Astronaut Biography: Laurel Clark|first=Joachim|last=Becker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space flight experience===
[[image:LaurelClarkSTS107.jpg|250px|Laurel Clark during STS-107|thumb]]
{{Main|STS-107}}
STS-107 ''Columbia'' – The 16-day flight was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. Clark's bioscience experiments included gardening in space, as she discussed only days before her death in an interview with [[Milwaukee]] media near her Wisconsin hometown. The STS-107 mission ended abruptly on February 1, 2003, when ''Columbia'' disintegrated and her crew perished during re-entry, 16 minutes before scheduled landing.

Clark also recorded inside the cockpit during ''Columbia''{{'}}s descent into the Earth's atmosphere on a small digital camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/2003/03/01/168023-columbia-crew-cheerful-on-tape-before-disaster/|title=Columbia crew cheerful on tape before disaster - Tucson Citizen Morgue, Part 2 (1993-2009)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark's final message to her friends and family was through an email sent from ''Columbia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/archives/sts-107/memorial/clark.html|title=HSF - STS-107 Memorial - Laurel Clark|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313102022/http://racine.wi.net/clarkletter.html Letter Home from Space] January 31, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lib ru.jpg|80px|thumb|Screenshot of main page of Maksim Moshkow's Library]]
'''Lib.ru''', also known as '''Maksim Moshkow's Library''' ({{lang-ru|Библиоте́ка Макси́ма Мошко́ва}}, started to operate in November 1994) is the oldest [[electronic library]] in the [[Internet in Russia|Russian Internet segment]].

Founded and supported by [[Maksim Moshkow]], it receives contributions mainly from users who send texts they scanned and processed ([[Optical character recognition|OCR]], [[proofreading]]). This method of acquisition provides the library a broad and efficient augmentability, though sometimes it adversely affects the quality (errors, omissions).

The structure of the library includes a section where one can publish his own literary texts ("[[Samizdat]]" journal), a project for music publishing ("Music hosting"), a travel notes project ("Foreign countries") and some other sections (See ''Maksim Moshkow's projects collection'' section).

''Maksim Moshkow's Library'' received several Ru-net Awards, including the National Internet Award (2003).

The headline on the site Lib.ru says "With support from the [[Rospechat|Federal Press and Mass Communications Agency]]". According to Moshkow, his project received $35,000 from that organization in September 2005, which indicates some level of government support for the online publishing of in-copyright works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=4005 |title=Maksim Moshkow and lib.ru: Russia's own 'Gutenberg' {{!}} TeleRead: Bring the E-Books Home |last1=Carey |first1=Quinn Anya |date=20 December 2005 |website={{URL|teleread.org}} |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030404/http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=4005 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maksim Moshkow's project could be compared to some [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects and is sometimes referred to as [[Russia]]'s [[Project Gutenberg]].

== KM Online vs. Maksim Moshkow's Library ==
{{Main|Gevorkyan v. Moshkov}}
[[Image:Maxim moshkov.jpg|left|thumb|Maxim Moshkow]]
On April 1, 2004 the "KM Online" media company, which is known for forming its own library by copying texts from the other electronic libraries, issued a [[lawsuit]] against Maksim Moshkow's Library in the name of [[Eduard Gevorkian]], Marina Alekseyeva (pen-name "[[Alexandra Marinina]]"), [[Vasili Golovachov]] and [[Elena Katasonova]]. It was later discovered that only Gevorkian had had real claims against Moshkow. Moshkow's lawyer was Andrey Mironov from the [[Art. Lebedev Studio|Artemi Lebedev Studio]], while KM's interests were presented by the so-called "National association on Digital Technologies (NOCIT)".

This case became a precedent in the Russian legal practice which illustrated pressure on an electronic library caused by a [[copyright violation]] lawsuit.

On March 30, 2005, [[Moscow]]'s [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] city district court imposed a penalty on Maksim Moshkow to pay Eduard Gevorkian a total of 3000 [[Russian ruble]]s (around 120 USD) as compensation for [[moral damage]]. The ruling did not mention any compensation for copyright violation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

On May 30, 2006, another court order ruled that Moshkow had no right to publish online the works of [[William Shakespeare]], Harrison and Zinoviev and ordered him to pay 10,000 rubles in each case. Moshkow's lawyer said he would appeal the decision.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Salhany claimed Murdoch, in meetings in front of others, asked if she was a "fem-Nazi" and what her husband would think of things.&lt;ref name=Lasell-GradComm-Video-2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes-Fox-Resignation-Murdoch-1994&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lippman|first1=John|title=Head of Fox Broadcasting Is Resigning : TV: Lucie Salhany, who helped lure affiliates and the NFL contract, is said to be leaving because of clashes with Rupert Murdoch|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-07/business/fi-12932_1_rupert-murdoch|accessdate=17 November 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=7 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She moved back to Paramount as they were about to launch the [[United Paramount Network]], also known as the UPN—which later merged with [[The WB]].&lt;ref name=SeasonFinale-WB-UPN-2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daniels|first1=Susanne|last2=Littleton|first2=Cynthia|title=Season Finale: The Unexpected Rise and Fall of the WB and UPN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXjv0LSL1GQC&amp;pg=PA157|accessdate=2 May 2011|date=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|ISBN=978-0-06-134099-4|pages=157–|OCLC=136783001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salhany was Chief Executive Officer of UPN from 1995 to 1997.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-WB-Exit-1997&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fabrikant|first1=Geraldine|title=The Media Business: Chief of United Paramount Network Is Quitting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/business/chief-of-united-paramount-network-is-quitting.html|accessdate=15 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, after leaving UPN, Salhany moved to Boston, where her husband is based, and started a media consultancy business called JH Media.&lt;ref name=Variety-CatchingUp-2004 /&gt;

From 1999 to 2002: Salhany was President/Chief Executive Officer of LifeFX Networks, Inc., a company that animated faces.&lt;ref name=Lasell-GradComm-Video-2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Computerworld-LifeFX-2001&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lais|first1=Sami|title=Is It Real, or Is It LifeFX?|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2590570/app-development/is-it-real--or-is-it-lifefx-.html|accessdate=15 November 2015|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=22 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Variety-LostFound-LifeFX-2001&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Paula|title=Lost &amp; Found: Lucie Salhany|url=https://variety.com/2001/digital/news/lost-found-lucie-salhany-1117798366/|accessdate=17 November 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Salhany co-founded Echo Bridge Entertainment, LLC.

=== Hewlett-Packard ===
Salhany joined the Hewlett-Packard (HP) Board of Directors in January 2002, in connection with the acquisition of [[Compaq|Compaq Computer Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.huffingtonpost.com/paypals/lucille-s-salhany|title=Lucille S. Salhany - Pay Pals - The Huffington Post|website=The Huffington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she also became a member of the HR and Compensation Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://h30261.www3.hp.com/~/media/Files/H/HP-IR/documents/reports/2005/03proxy.pdf|title=2003 Annual Meeting of Shareowners Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hewlett-Packard Company|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salhany was appointed to the Audit Committee in September 2006. In the same month, she became the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000104746907000347/a2175536zdef14a.htm|title=2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders|last=|first=|date=|website=Sec.gov|publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of new leadership and heavy criticism of HP’s board, Salhany left HP’s board in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2012/05/08/how-hewlett-packard-lost-its-way/|title=How Hewlett-Packard lost its way|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Léo Apotheker|Leo Apotheker]], took over as chief of HP in November 2010 and brought in five new directors to diversify leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hp-board/hewlett-packard-shakes-up-board-four-to-leave-idUSTRE70J6YG20110120|title=Hewlett-Packard shakes up board, four to leave|last=Madway|first=Gabriel|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to Salhany’s departure, the HP board faced shareholder lawsuits and received criticism from analysts and shareholders, over the hiring of Apotheker. Of the 12-member board who voted to hire Apotheker, the majority of board members had never met Apotheker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/01/20/technology/HP_board_of_directors/index.htm|title=4 HP directors step down after Hurd scandal - Jan. 20, 2011|last=reporter|first=By Julianne Pepitone, staff|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/business/voting-to-hire-a-chief-without-meeting-him.html|title=Voting to Hire a Chief Without Meeting Him|last=Stewart|first=James B.|date=2011-09-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mary Magdalene''''' is a [[Pre-Raphaelite]] 1858-1860 painting by [[Frederick Sandys]]. [[Mary Magdalene]] was the only figure from the [[Bible]] that Sandys ever painted. Having sharp features reminiscent of [[Lizzie Siddal]] (though the model is unknown),&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shadowlight.gydja.com/preraphaelite.html |title= Shadowlight: The Pre-Raphaelite Goddess|author= |accessdate=2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is depicted in front of a patterned forest-green [[damask]]. She holds an [[alabaster]] ointment cup, a traditional attribute which associates her with the unnamed sinful woman who anointed [[Jesus]]' feet in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#7:37|Luke 7:37]]. Like other Pre-Raphaelite painters, Frederick Sandys gave Magdalene a sensual look. 

[[Dante Rossetti]] accused Sandys of [[plagiarism]], because of the resemblance to his ''[[Mary Magdalene Leaving the House of Feasting]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The watercolor, dated 1857, is at the [[Tate Gallery]]; it was [http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/works/religion.asp exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708201508/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/works/religion.asp |date=2008-07-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but when Rossetti came to paint Magdalene some twenty years later, it was his painting that resembled Sandys.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;

''Mary Magdalene'' was acquired in 1894 by [[Samuel Bancroft]], the most important American collector of Pre-Raphaelite art, whose family donated his collection to the [[Delaware Art Museum]] in 1935.  Bancroft had bought the painting from [[Charles Fairfax Murray]], an artist in the Pre-Raphaelite circle. 

It has been exhibited as part of a touring exhibition of the Bancroft Collection, at the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]], [[San Diego Museum of Art]], the [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Nottingham Castle]], and other locations.  It was once featured in an oversize advertisement in the [[San Antonio International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delart.org/view/collections/pr_home.html |title=Delaware Art Museum |author= |accessdate=2007-10-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626143551/http://www.delart.org/view/collections/pr_home.html |archivedate=2007-06-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OnceOnATime.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]])]]
'''''Once On A Time''''' is a [[fairy tale]] created by [[A. A. Milne]].

Written in 1917, Milne's own introduction begins 'This is an odd book', and indeed it is very difficult to classify.  Ostensibly a typical fairytale, it tells the story of the war between the kingdoms of Euralia and Barodia and the political shenanigans which take place in Euralia in the king's absence, all supposedly rewritten by Milne from the writings of the fictional historian "Roger Scurvilegs".

Milne created the story to contain believable, three-dimensional characters, rather than the stereotypes which will satisfy children. Hence the book introduces us to a princess who is far from helpless; a prince who, whilst handsome, is also pompous and vain; an enchantment which is almost entirely humorous; a villain who is not entirely villainous and receives no real comeuppance; a good king who is not always good; an evil king who is not always evil, and so on.  The result is a book which children may not enjoy as much as adults.

The book was written by Milne partly for his wife, upon whom the character of the Countess Belvane was partially based.

==Plot summary==

When the King of Barodia receives a pair of [[seven-league boots]] as a birthday present, his habit of flying over the King of Euralia's castle during breakfast provokes a series of incidents which escalate into war.  While the King of Euralia is away, his daughter Hyacinth tries to rule in his stead and counter the machiavellian ambitions of the king's favourite, the Countess Belvane.

==Characters==

'''King Merriwig of Euralia''':  fat, jolly if occasionally pompous and easily led.  He nevertheless can show great strength of mind, as related in an anecdote in which he outwitted a fairy, mostly by sheer stubbornness.

'''Princess Hyacinth''':  Merriwig's daughter.  Rather more savvy than her father, she is nevertheless at first out of her depth when trying to rule the kingdom in his absence.  Despite this, she grows into the role.

'''The King of Barodia''':  Bombastic, proud and arrogant, and takes inordinate pride in his moustache.

'''The Countess Belvane''':  A difficult character.  Beautiful, proud and haughty, she is inclined to melodramatics and emotional self-indulgence.  Ostensibly the villain of the piece, her motives are complex and subtle.

'''Lady Wiggs''':  Hyacinth's closest friend;  helpful and dreamy.

'''Lady Woggs''':  A palace servant;  well-meaning but terribly dim.

'''Prince Udo of Araby''':  Prince of a neighbouring realm, invited by Hyacinth to help her in her troubles with Belvane.  He turns out to be very little help at all, partly due to suffering an embarrassing enchantment, but mostly due to his personality.

'''Coronel''':  Udo's companion-at-arms and best friend.  Far more laid-back and likeable than the prince.

'''Roger Scurvilegs''':  Noted historian of Euralia, author of the monumental work ''Euralia Past and Present''.  The narrator gives him credit for the basic facts of the story whilst gently lampooning him for his stuffiness.

==Themes and issues==

Milne himself resisted characterising the book.  In his foreword to the 1922 edition he wrote of it:

"For whom, then, is the book intended?  That is the trouble. Unless I can say, "For those, young or old, who like the things which I like," I find it difficult to answer. Is it a children's book? Well, what do we mean by that? Is ''[[Wind in the willows|The Wind in the Willows]]'' a children's book? Is ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]''? Is ''[[Treasure Island]]''? These are masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how much more pleasure when we are grown-up. In any case, what do we mean by "children"? A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of fourteen - are they all to like the same thing? And is a book "suitable for a boy of twelve" any more likely to please a boy of twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven;  even if the novel be described truly as "suitable for a man of thirty-seven"? I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult problems.  But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which children will like, unless he write it for himself first. That being so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups. [...]  But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what sort of book it is. Perhaps no explanation is necessary. Read in it what you like; read it to whomever you like;  be of what age you like; it can only fall into one of the two classes. Either you will enjoy it, or you won't.

"It is that sort of book.&lt;ref&gt;Milne, A.A.: "Once On A Time" pp vi-viii, 1922 US ed. published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap (New York)&lt;/ref&gt;".

The '''Pala della Peste''' (altarpiece of the bubonic plague) or '''Pallione del Voto''' is a [[Baroque art|Baroque]]-style altarpiece by [[Guido Reni]] depicts the ''Madonna and Child in Glory with the Patron Saints of Bologna: Petronius, Francis, Ignatius, Francis Xavier, Proculus of Bologna, and Florian''. The painting is oil on silk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinacotecabologna.beniculturali.it/collezione/percorsi/percorsoEsp_A.php?IDSala=24&amp;IDOpera=280 Pinacoteca of Bologna], altarpiece called ''Madonna col Bambino in gloria e i Santi Protettori di Bologna Petronio, Francesco, Ignazio, Francesco Saverio, Procolo e Floriano.''(Pala della Peste) and is now in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale of Bologna]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The altarpiece was painted in 1631-1632 as an ''[[ex voto]]'' after the ebbing of the plague epidemic in 1630 in [[Bologna]]. The altarpiece was in the past paraded yearly in a formal procession from the Palazzo Pubblico to the church of [[San Domenico, Bologna]].

The structure of the painting follows the formal arrangement, exemplified by a late 16th-century canvas by [[Annibale Carraci]] in the Pinacoteca of Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinacotecabologna.beniculturali.it/collezione/percorsi/percorsoEsp_A.php?IDSala=23&amp;IDOpera=63 ''Madonna and Child in Glory with Saints Lodovico, Alessio, John the Baptist, Catherine, Francis, and Clare''] (1587-1588), by Annibale Carraci, Pinacoteca Nazionale of Bologna.&lt;/ref&gt; The Madonna and child are in the superior portion. The infant blesses with his right hand, while the left hand holds a flowering sprig. Around the couple, cherubim are active draping flowers, holding rosaries and scapulars, and crowning the Virgin with a floral crown.

In the scene below, the seven saints implore for Bologna, depicted at the bottom center. [[Charles Borromeo]], recently canonized, at the left was known for his work among the pestilent of Milan. Beside him standing is St [[Proculus of Bologna]], a martyred Roman soldier, holding a sword and palm leaf (symbol of Martyrdom). Across the canvas, the armored St Florian holds a halberd and palm leaf. Kneeling below are: St Petronius with a bishop's mitre at his feet; St Francis in a cassock, and to the right are two Jesuit saints, [[Francis Xavier]] with the palm leaf pointing to him, and the founder of the order St [[Ignatius of Loyola]].

The style recalls the earthy coloring of [[Ludovico Carracci]]. The work is now in the Pinacoteca of Bologna, which also has a 1616 ex voto Madonna by Reni. The ''Palla delle Peste'' is described by Viardot as "an excellent specimen of the pale coloring which Guido had adopted".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s8VCAAAAYAAJ ''Wonders of Italian Art''], by Louis Viardot, (1875) page 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pazyryk''' ({{lang-ru|Пазырык}}) '''burials''' are a number of [[Saka]]&lt;ref name="LH_443"&gt;{{harvnb|de Laet|Herrmann|1996|p=443}} "The rich kurgan burials in Pazyryk, Siberia probably were those of Saka chieftains"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="K_94"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuzmina|2008|p=94}} "Analysis of the clothing, which has analogies in the complex of Saka clothes, particularly in Pazyryk, led Wang Binghua (1987, 42) to the conclusion that they are related to the Saka Culture."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="K_103"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuzmina|2007|p=103}} "The dress of Iranian-speaking Saka and Scythians is easily reconstructed on the basis of... numerous archaeological discoveries from the Ukraine to the Altai, particularly at Issyk in Kazakhstan... at Pazyryk...  and Ak-Alakha"&lt;/ref&gt; Iron Age tombs found in the Pazyryk Valley of the [[Ukok plateau]] in the [[Altai Mountains]], [[Siberia]], south of the modern city of [[Novosibirsk]],  [[Russia]]; the site is close to the borders with [[China]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="nova"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous comparable burials have been found in neighboring western Mongolia.

The tombs are [[Scythian]]-type [[kurgans]], [[tumulus|barrow]]-like tomb mounds containing wooden chambers covered over by large [[cairn]]s of boulders and stones, dated to the 4th - 3rd centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''A Special Issue on the Dating of Pazyryk.'' ''Source: Notes in the History of Art'' 10, no. 4, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacular burials at Pazyryk are responsible for the introduction of the term ''kurgan'', a Russian word of Turkic origin, into general usage to describe these tombs. The region of the Pazyryk kurgans is considered the [[type site]] of the wider [[Pazyryk culture]]. The site is included in the [[Golden Mountains of Altai]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The bearers of the Pazyryk culture were horse-riding pastoral [[nomad]]s of the [[steppe]], and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in [[Persia]], [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;{{cite book

These finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation.

Because of a freak climatic freeze, some of the Altai-Sayan burials, notably those of the 5th century BCE at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as [[Katanda]], [[Shibe, Siberia|Shibe]], and [[Tuekt]], were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them.
Certain geometric designs and [[sun symbols]], such as the circle and [[Rosette (design)|rosette]], recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. Such specifically Scythian features as zoomorphic junctures, i.e. the addition of a part of one animal to the body of another, are rarer in the Altaic region than in southern Russia. The stag and its relatives, however, figure as prominently in Altai-Sayan as in [[Scythian art]]. &lt;ref name="Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.britannica.com/art/Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts |title=Altaic Tribes|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"At Pazyryk too are found bearded mascarons ([[funerary mask|masks]]) of well-defined Greco-Roman origin, which were doubtless inspired by the [[Hellenistic kingdoms]] of the [[Cimmerian]] [[Bosporus]]."&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pazyryk deer.jpg|thumb|upright|A gilded wooden figurine of a deer from the Pazyryk burials, fifth century BC]]
The first tomb at Pazyryk, barrow 1, was excavated by the [[archaeologist]] M. P. Gryaznov in 1929; barrows 2-5 were excavated by [[Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko]] in 1947-1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudenko|1970|pp=18, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the tombs had already been looted in earlier times, the excavators unearthed buried horses, and with them immaculately preserved cloth saddles, felt and woven rugs including the world's oldest pile [[carpet]],&lt;ref name="EB_Carpet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512386/rug-and-carpet/73762/Symbolism-of-overall-design#toc73765 |title=Rug and carpet: Oriental carpets |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB_Central_Asian_Arts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102325/Central-Asian-arts/13969/Altaic-tribes |title=Central Asian Arts: Altaic tribes |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [https://web.archive.org/web/20000106182748/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7e.html 3-metre-high four-wheel funeral chariot] from the 5th century BC and other splendid objects that had escaped the ravages of time.&lt;ref name="EB_Stone_Age"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/567232/Stone-Age/52383/European-cultures |title=Stone Age: European cultures |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These finds are now exhibited at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

Craniological studies of samples from the Pazyryk burials determined that skulls were generally of [[Europoid]] type, with some showing [[Mongoloid]] features.&lt;ref name="Rudenko45"&gt;{{harvnb|Rudenko|1970|p=45}} "Although in general the skulls in the series are of europeoid type, there are some among them with markedly mongoloid features."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pazyryk chief===
Rudenko's most striking discovery was the body of a tattooed Pazyryk chief: a thick-set, powerfully built man who had died when he was about 50. Parts of the body had deteriorated, but much of the tattooing was still clearly visible (see [[:Image:Scythian tatoo.jpg|image]]). Subsequent investigation using reflected [[infrared photography]] revealed that all five bodies discovered in the Pazyryk kurgans were tattooed.&lt;ref&gt;Findings published in ''Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia'', Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; No instruments specifically designed for tattooing were found, but the Pazyryks had extremely fine needles with which they did miniature [[embroidery]], and these were probably used for tattooing.

The chief was elaborately decorated with an interlocking series of striking designs representing a variety of fantastic beasts. The best preserved [[tattoo]]s were images of a [[donkey]], a [[argali|mountain ram]], two highly stylized [[deer]] with long antlers and an imaginary [[carnivore]] on the right arm. Two monsters resembling [[griffin]]s decorate the chest, and on the left arm are three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a [[mountain goat]]. On the front of the right leg a [[fish]] extends from the foot to the knee. A monster crawls over the right foot, and on the inside of the shin is a series of four running rams which touch each other to form a single design. The left leg also bears tattoos, but these designs could not be clearly distinguished. In addition, the chief's back is tattooed with a series of small circles in line with the vertebral column.  This tattooing was probably done for therapeutic reasons. Contemporary Siberian tribesmen still practice tattooing of this kind to relieve back pain.

===Ice Maiden===
{{main|Siberian Ice Maiden}}
[[Image:Mummy of the Ukok Princess.jpg|thumb|The Ice Maiden - fifth century BC]]
The most famous undisturbed Pazyryk burial so far recovered is the [[Siberian Ice Maiden|Ice Maiden]] or "Altai Lady" found by archaeologist [[Natalia Polosmak]] in 1993 at Ukok, near the Chinese border. The find was a rare example of a single woman given a full ceremonial burial in a wooden chamber tomb in the fifth century BC, accompanied by six horses.&lt;ref name="nova" /&gt;
She had been buried over 2,400 years ago in a casket fashioned from the hollowed-out trunk of a Siberian [[Larch|larch tree]]. On the outside of the casket were stylized images of deer and [[snow leopard]]s carved in leather. Shortly after burial the grave had apparently been flooded by freezing rain, and the entire contents of the burial chamber had remained frozen in [[permafrost]]. Six horses wearing elaborate harnesses had been sacrificed and lay to the north of the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Polosmak, Natalia (1994). "A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven." ''National Geographic'' 186:4, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The maiden's well-preserved body, carefully embalmed with peat and bark, was arranged to lie on her side as if asleep. She was young, and her hair was shaven off but wearing a wig and tall hat; she had been 167 cm (5 feet 6&amp;nbsp;inches) tall. Even the [[animal style]] [[tattoo]]s were preserved on her pale skin: creatures with horns that develop into flowered forms. Her coffin was made large enough to accommodate the high felt headdress she was wearing, which was decorated with swans and gold-covered carved cats.&lt;ref&gt;Polosmak (1994), pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; She was clad in a long crimson and white striped woolen skirt and white felt stockings. Her yellow blouse was originally thought to be made of wild "[[tussah]]" silk but closer examination of the fibers indicate the material is not Chinese but was a [[wild silk]] which came from somewhere else, perhaps [[India]].&lt;ref name="atlas"/&gt; Near her coffin was a vessel made of [[yak]] horn, and dishes containing gifts of [[coriander]] seeds:  all of which suggest that the Pazyryk trade routes stretched across vast areas of Iran{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Similar dishes in other tombs were thought to have held ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'',  confirming a practice described by [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref name="nova"/&gt; but after tests the mixture was found to be coriander seeds, probably used to disguise the smell of the body.

Two years after the discovery of the "Ice Maiden" Dr. Polosmak's husband, Vyacheslav Molodin, found a frozen man, elaborately tattooed with an elk, with two long braids that reached to his waist, buried with his weapons.

Doctor Anicua also noted that her blouse was a bit stained, indicating that the material was not a new garment, made for the burial.

===Pazyryk carpet===
[[Image:Scythiancarpet.jpg|thumb|upright|The Pazyryk carpet]]

One of the most famous finds at Pazyryk is the '''Pazyryk carpet''', which is probably the oldest surviving [[pile carpet]] in the world. It measures 183×200&amp;nbsp;cm and has a knot density of approximately 360,000 [[knot density|knots per]] square meter, which is higher than most modern carpets. The middle of the carpet consists of a ribbon motif, while in the border there is a procession with elk or deer, and in another border warriors on horses. The Pazyryk carpet was manufactured in Ancient Armenia (one of hypotheses)around 400 BC. When it was found it had been deeply frozen in a block of ice, which is why it is so well-preserved. The carpet can be seen at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.&lt;ref name="Carpet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carpetencyclopedia.com/pages/History-184.html |title=History of handknotted carpets |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=CarpetEncyclopedia.com |publisher= |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other findings===
In a corner of one grave chamber of the Pazyryk cemetery was a fur bag containing cannabis seed, a censer filled with stones, and the hexapod frame of an inhalation tent - these are believed to have been utilized at the end of the funerary ritual for purification.

Other undisturbed kurgans have been found to contain remarkably well-preserved remains, comparable to the earlier [[Tarim mummies]] of [[Xinjiang]]. Bodies were preserved using [[mummy|mummification]] techniques and were also naturally frozen in solid ice from water seeping into the tombs.  They were encased in coffins made from hollowed trunks of [[larch]] (which may have had sacral significance) and sometimes accompanied by sacrificed concubines and horses.  The clustering of tombs in a single area implies that it had particular ritual significance for these people, who were likely to have been willing to transport their deceased leaders great distances for burial.

As recently as the summer of 2012,  tombs have been discovered at various locations.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  In January 2007 a timber tomb of a blond chieftain warrior was unearthed in the permafrost of the [[Altai Republic|Altai mountains region]] close to the Mongolian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Russian Archaeologists Discover Remains of Ancient Chieftain in Altai Permafrost | url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2007/01/10/ancienttomb.shtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302010403/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2007/01/10/ancienttomb.shtml | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-03-02 | date=2007-01-10 | accessdate=2007-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of the presumed Pazyryk chieftain is tattooed; his sable coat is well preserved, as are some other objects, including what looks like [[scissors]]. A local archaeologist, Aleksei Tishkin, complained that the indigenous population of the region strongly disapproves of archaeological digs, prompting the scientists to move their activities across the border to [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Daria Radovskaya | url=http://www.rg.ru/2007/01/10/kochevnik.html | title=Кочевник был блондином | publisher=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] | date=2007-01-10 | accessdate=2007-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pazyryk culture==
{{main|Pazyryk culture}}
Rudenko initially assigned the neutral label [[Pazyryk culture]] for these nomads and dated them to the 5th century BC; the dating has been revised for barrows 1-5 at Pazyryk, which are now considered to date to the 4th-3rd centuries B.C.&lt;ref&gt;See above, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pazyryk culture has since been connected to the [[Scythians]] whose similar tombs have been found across the steppes.  The Siberian [[animal style]] tattooing is characteristic of the Scythians. Trading routes between [[Central Asia]], [[China]] and the [[Near East]] passed through the oases on the plateau and these ancient Altai nomads profited from the rich trade and culture passing through.&lt;ref name="nomads"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7.html
|title=Early Nomads of the Altaic Region
|publisher=The Hermitage
|accessdate=2007-07-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that Pazyryk trade routes were vast and connected with large areas of [[Asia]] including [[India]], perhaps Pazyryk merchants largely trading in high quality horses.&lt;ref name="nova"/&gt;

There is also the possibility that the current inhabitants of the [[Altay Mountains|Altai]] region are descendants of the Pazyryk culture, a continuity that would accord with current ethnic politics: [[Archaeogenetics]] is now being used to study the Pazyryk mummies.

'''PHaradise''' is a permanent light installation conceived by [[NatHalie Braun Barends]] at the Kunsthalle Mannheim, which was inaugurated on 9 March 2007, located at the dome and the adjacent roof tops of the Hermann Billing Bau at [[:de:Kunsthalle Mannheim|Kunsthalle Mannheim]].&lt;ref name="Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=100 Yahre Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007 | publisher=Kunsthalle Mannheim | year=2007 | isbn=978-3-89165-210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
It represents the act of breathing before falling asleep. The inspiration is represented by cold white light flowing vertically from below into the dome, and the exhalation by warm white colored lights air flowing horizontally towards the rooftops beside the cupola.&lt;ref name="NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life"&gt;{{cite book | title=NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life | publisher=Art Space | year=2007 | location=Berlin/New York/Santiago | isbn=978-3-941494-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to this evening light motion, the viewer has the experience of reliving the breath of the architectural structure, which is transformed into a light sculpture in the [[:de:Skulpturengarten der Kunsthalle Mannheim|Skulpturengarten]]. The "breathing" rhythm becomes slower as time pass by during the evening, symbolizing falling asleep.

PHaradise overlooks the Phoenix Room of [[HHole| HHole for Mannheim]], a multimedia installation at the rooftop of the Athene-Trakt of the Museum, where, among other things, natural light flows into the museum through its seven holes, meeting artificial light coming from below, thus creating a symbolic imaginary space between heaven and earth.

The architecture of the Kunsthalle becomes "alive", changing its own breathing rhythm similar to a living being.

The '''representation of women in Athenian tragedy''' was performed exclusively by men and it is likely (although the evidence is not conclusive) that it was performed solely for men as well.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In a society that valued women’s silence, their predominance in the most public of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[The arts|art-forms]] constitutes a [[paradox]]. Only one of the surviving 32 plays has no female [[Character (arts)|characters]]: [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]''. Female [[Greek chorus|tragic choruses]] also outnumber the male choruses by twenty-one to ten.&lt;ref name="Easterling"&gt;Easterling, P. E. (Ed.). (1997). ''Cambridge companion to Greek tragedy.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural stereotype== 
Macaria, in the ''[[Heracleidae]]'' states that "for a woman, silence and self control are best."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; The philosopher [[Xenophon]] thought females possessed the positive traits of 'vigilance' and 'love for infants'. However Xenophon reflects the Greek fear of these 'others', highlighting their irrationality, religious fervour and sexual passion.&lt;ref name="Bushnell"&gt;Bushnell, R. W. (Ed.). (2005). ''A companion to tragedy.'' Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] went further, stating that women were deformed, incomplete males, designed to be subservient to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0009%3Achapter%3D15%3Asection%3D14&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, women had their freedom restricted and were believed to have lived in separate areas to men. In a speech recorded in the Lysias Orations 3.6, a speaker seeks to convey his opponent’s licentiousness by telling how he trespassed into "the women’s rooms where my sister and my nieces were – women who have always lived so decently that they are ashamed to be seen even by relatives."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; [[Sheila Murnaghan]] argues that "it is no accident that what little evidence we do have for actual Athenian women comes largely from courtroom speeches or medical treatises, genres brought into being by conflict and disease."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], a woman was viewed as a passive conduit of male fertility, on long term loan by her father.&lt;ref name="Blondell"&gt;Blondell, R., et al. (Ed.). (1999). ''Women on the edge: four plays by Euripides.'' New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marriage was an unequal relationship, whereby the husband owned the children and didn’t have the same obligation toward sexual fidelity that the wife had.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; 
The playwright Euripides presents two very different reactions to this cultural norm. Firstly, his female protagonist [[Alcestis]], represents the "perfect wife" sacrificing her own life, so her husband, Admetos, can live.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; Yet as Blondell points out this "female fame is hard won, even oxymoronic" as her own marriage kills her.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

The most important relationships within this play are between the men. [[Heracles]] goes to the underworld not for Alcestis, but to honour his male friend’s hospitality. [[Admetos]] goes against the promise he made to his wife, so as to obey his male friendship. "Alcestis drops out," Easterling argues, "to facilitate the interaction between the men."&lt;ref name="Easterling" /&gt;

In contrast, however, Euripides [[Medea]] breaks the marital conventions, choosing her husband herself and reacting against his infidelity by breaking the female oath and killing her children. "In a sense," Blondell argues, "every bride was a stranger in a strange land. And every married woman was dependent on her husband."&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

==Theatrical themes==

===The problem of male absence===
In the surviving plays, women become [[Tragedy|tragic]] figures by men’s absence or mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

[[Sophocles]]' [[Antigone]] takes action after her uncle [[Creon]] refuses to bury her brother [[Polynices]]. In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'', [[Clytemnestra]] takes power in [[Argos]] because her husband [[Agamemnon]] has been away fighting at [[Troy]] for ten years. Clytemnestra's later murder of him is motivated by a range of male abuses. Medea becomes the aggressor when her husband [[Jason]] plans a new more advantageous marriage.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

===The public versus the private===
There is also a theme running through the plays based on the setting. Performed in open-air theatres, Classical Athenian tragedy was [[Setting (narrative)|set]] outside the private sphere of the home.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; Indeed, [[Euripides]] was notorious for "taking the streets, the bedroom, into tragedy" and thereby reducing its remoteness.&lt;ref name="McLeish"&gt;McLeish, K., et al. (Trans.). (2005). ''Greek tragedy.'' London: Nick Hern.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] first appears, carried out of the house by her servants, demanding open air, in order to declare her love for her stepson and thus the spiral of tragedy to unwind.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'', [[Clytemnestra]] in the first play of the trilogy orders her husband's death outside, while in the second play, her son [[Orestes]] forces her into the house to be killed. It is only in the third play, which is in an entirely public space of the court of Areopagus, that order is restored. "This three play sequence," Bushnell argues, "which begins when a self-willed woman takes matters into her own hands, finally achieves closure as figures representing women are removed from view.'&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

===The female warrior===
A woman displaying traits of the heroic Grecian male was not portrayed in a positive light. [[Euripides]]' [[Medea]] is the prime example. Her name in Greek means "cunning" and is also the word for the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] (the Greek’s greatest foreign enemy).&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

Most of the time, a woman is full of fear&lt;br&gt;
Too weak to defend herself or to bear the sight of steel &lt;br&gt;
But if she happens to be wronged in love,&lt;br&gt;
Hers is the bloodthirstiest heart of all.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

Ruby Blondell argues that Medea displays stereotypically male attributes that the Greeks held as positive. Possessing courage, intelligence, decisiveness, resourcefulness, power, independence, the ability to conceive and carry out a plan effectively, as well as the art of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; The nurse even likens her to a rock of the sea, as [[Patroclus]] famously does to [[Homer]]’s [[Achilles]] in the [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Iliad|The Iliad]]''.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; Yet Medea, similarly to [[Aeschylus]]’ [[Clytemnestra]], another "woman with a heart of manly counsel"&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; were not admired  but portrayed as "[[Cruella de Vil]]" type characters.&lt;ref name="McLeish" /&gt;

So the declaration "that a noble man ought either to live with honour, or die with honour" does not apply to women.&lt;ref name="McLeish" /&gt;

==Public reaction==
In [[Plato]]’s [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], [[Socrates]] thought the impersonation of inferiors, such as women and slaves, that drama utilised was morally harmful. Socrates was also worried "about the ethical damage caused by the representation of 'womanish' emotions in tragedy."&lt;ref name="Easterling" /&gt; Plato unsurprisingly excludes poetry, embodied by the figure of a woman, from his ideal [[Polis|city-state]].&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

The [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] however thought it important to place on "display those feature[s] of human experience that inspire terror, sorrow and rejection, and they accomplished their mission by giving women visibility and a powerful voice."&lt;ref name="Bushnell"/&gt;

"'''Save the World'''" is a song by English musician [[George Harrison]], released as the final track of his 1981 album ''[[Somewhere in England]]''. It was also the [[B-side]] of "[[Teardrops (George Harrison song)|Teardrops]]", which was the second single off the album. An environmental [[protest song]], "Save the World" was Harrison's first composition to directly address topical issues such as the nuclear arms race, rainforest and wildlife devastation, and the ecologically irresponsible practices of corporate concerns. Musically, the song partly recalls the style of the comedy troupe [[Monty Python]].

Harrison recorded "Save the World" at his [[Friar Park]] studio in England in 1980. The recording includes sound effects that support the song's message of a world heading towards self-destruction, including bombs falling, a cash register, a street demonstration, and a nuclear explosion. In 1985, Harrison contributed a version of the song with amended lyrics to [[Greenpeace]]'s [[Greenpeace – The Album|self-titled fundraising album]]. "Save the World" also appeared on the home video ''Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits''.

Since its release, the song has been held in low regard by several music critics and biographers. Some of these reviewers highlight the disparity between the serious message and the quirky musical backing. In line with Harrison's wishes, a demo of "Save the World" appeared as the sole bonus track on the posthumously reissued ''Somewhere in England'' in 2004.

==Background and inspiration==
As reproduced in the 2017 book ''[[I, Me, Mine|I, Me, Mine – The Extended Edition]]'', [[George Harrison]] dated the lyrics of "Save the World" to 24 February 1978, with [[Hana, Maui]] as the location.&lt;ref name="IMM p 434"&gt;Harrison, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; During that visit to Hawaii, Harrison completed the writing for his 1979 album ''[[George Harrison (album)|George Harrison]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, pp. 175, 365–66.&lt;/ref&gt; which, as with its predecessor, ''[[Thirty Three &amp; 1/3]]'', reflected a light-heartedness that had been lacking in much of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woffinden, pp. 103, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the song when working on his album ''[[Somewhere in England]]'', most of which was written between mid 1979 and the early part of 1980.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 459"&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; As with a track Harrison wrote for ''Somewhere in England'', "[[Tears of the World]]",&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 77, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 221, 226.&lt;/ref&gt; "Save the World" conveys his disapproval at the ecological issues and political machinations threatening the world in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1980, Harrison became a member of [[Greenpeace]] and [[CND]];&lt;ref&gt;Leng, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; he also protested against the use of nuclear energy with [[Friends of the Earth]], in London,&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and helped finance ''[[Vole (magazine)|Vole]]'', a [[Green politics|green]] magazine launched by [[Monty Python]] member [[Terry Jones]].&lt;ref name="Clayson p 388" /&gt; Author Simon Leng describes "Save the World" as Harrison's first attempt at ecology-focused songwriting and a "quirky [[protest song]]" that marked "the culmination of the Pythonization of Harrison's music" at a time when he was increasingly associated with members of the Monty Python comedy troupe through his film company [[HandMade Films]]. While recognising "Save the World" as indicative of its composer's disillusion with the 1980s, Leng comments that Harrison had long valued the "madness" of Monty Python's comedy as "a mirror to the insanity of world events", and that his adoption of humour was a "peculiarly British" reaction to a grave situation.&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt;

==Composition==
In his lyrics, Harrison sings of "This planet's rape, how we've abused it".&lt;ref&gt;''Somewhere in England'' CD booklet ([[Dark Horse Records]], 2004; produced by George Harrison &amp; Ray Cooper), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He first addresses the [[nuclear arms race]] being waged between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], and laments the introduction of intergalactic weapons. He then addresses the devastation of the world's rainforests for commercial gain and the threat to wildlife. He refers to the [[Anti-whaling#Save the Whales|Save the Whales]] environmental campaign and how Greenpeace's attempts to limit whale hunting had been thwarted by the interests of "dog food salesmen". He also laments the irresponsibility of arms manufacturers and, with regard to [[plutonium]] stockpiles, concludes: "Now you can make your own H-bomb / Right in the kitchen with your mom." He then denigrates the use of nuclear power as a "half-wit's answer to a need" that causes cancer. In the final verse, Harrison attributes the world's environmental problems to just a few profit-seeking individuals. He ends on what he promises to be "a happy note" by stating that a simple solution lies in the realisation that "God [lives] in your heart".&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1987 interview, Harrison said that "Save the World" was meant to be "serious and funny at the same time".&lt;ref&gt;Allison, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Kordosh, "Fab! Gear! The George Harrison Interview (part 1)", ''[[Creem]]'', December 1987; available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/fab-gear-the-george-harrison-interview-part-1 Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|His handwritten lyrics include a verse that was omitted from the published song: "Those people in the military / All need a dose of LSD / Then send them to a yoga class / To find their souls [and] forget their ass."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp. 434, 436.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Contrasting with the subject matter, the music recalls the comedy songs of Monty Python.&lt;ref name="Leng p 226"&gt;Leng, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; In the description of Harrison biographer [[Alan Clayson]], the style is "quasi-reggae",&lt;ref name="Clayson p 381"&gt;Clayson, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; while author Ian Inglis refers to it being sung on the official recording "in a deceptively sweet voice to a [[March (music)|march]] tempo".&lt;ref name="Inglis p 77"&gt;Inglis, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Leng also likens the song's musical aspects to Harrison's 1975 tribute to comedian [[Legs Larry Smith]], "[[His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)]]", in terms of its [[Groove (music)|groove]] and musical arrangement.&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt;

==Recording==
Harrison recorded "Save the World" during the main sessions for ''Somewhere in England'', held at his [[FPSHOT]] studio in [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]], Oxfordshire, between March and September 1980. Aside from Harrison, who played guitars and self-produced the sessions,&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 459" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; the musicians on the track were [[Neil Larsen]] and [[Gary Brooker]] (both on keyboards), [[Willie Weeks]] (bass), [[Jim Keltner]] (drums), [[Ray Cooper]] (percussion) and [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]] (horns).&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt; Harrison added various [[sound effects]] throughout the recording, including the sound of bombs being dropped, a cash register,&lt;ref name="Clayson p 381" /&gt; an army on the march, gunfire, and a street demonstration.&lt;ref name="Inglis p 78"&gt;Inglis, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these effects appear midway through the song,&lt;ref name="Clayson p 381" /&gt; accompanied by a [[Moog synthesizer]] solo,&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt; after which the section concludes with the sound of a [[nuclear explosion]].&lt;ref name="White/Musician" /&gt; A baby's cry then accompanies the song's return.&lt;ref name="White/Musician" /&gt;

At the end of the track, Harrison edited in the faint sound of a bow-played Indian string instrument, the [[tar shehnai]].&lt;ref name="White/Musician" /&gt; This part was taken from "Crying", an instrumental piece performed by Vinayak Vora&lt;ref&gt;Album credits, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' CD ([[Apple Records]], 2014; produced by George Harrison).&lt;/ref&gt; and released on Harrison's 1968 soundtrack album ''[[Wonderwall Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about its inclusion in "Save the World", Harrison told ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' magazine in 1987: "I just wanted to let the whole song go out with something sad, to touch that nerve and maybe make you think, 'Ohhh shit.'"&lt;ref name="White/Musician" /&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Harrison added, with the regard to the tar shehnai: "It's like a one-string fiddle, a bowed instrument with the sympathetic strings resting over a stretched skin, so it has that hollow, echoey resonance, a wailing, crying sound."&lt;ref name="White/Musician"&gt;Timothy White, "George Harrison – Reconsidered", ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'', November 1987, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After submitting ''Somewhere in England'' to [[Warner Bros. Records]], the distributor of his [[Dark Horse Records|Dark Horse]] record label, in late September 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison was forced to rework the content of the album&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 459" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, pp. 377–78.&lt;/ref&gt; – including replacing four of the original songs – to ensure the release had more commercial appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison chose to retain "Save the World" in the revised track listing and worked with Ray Cooper on a second version of the album.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 459" /&gt; Although the mix for the re-submitted "Save the World" differed little from Harrison's original,&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461"&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper was credited as a co-producer.&lt;ref name="Harry p 349"&gt;Harry, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
''Somewhere in England'' was released on 1 June 1981,&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; with "Save the World" sequenced as the final track.&lt;ref&gt;Harry, pp. 349–50.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only song from Harrison's initial submission to Warner Bros. to retain its position in the running order of the official release.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt; The album was a relative commercial success,&lt;ref name="Inglis p 78" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, pp. 129, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; an outcome that was due largely to a public outpouring of grief in reaction to the murder of Harrison's former [[Beatles]] bandmate [[John Lennon]] in December 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, pp. 2646–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 217–18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, pp. 459–60.&lt;/ref&gt; As a follow-up single to Harrison's tribute to Lennon, "[[All Those Years Ago]]", Warner's released "[[Teardrops (George Harrison song)|Teardrops]]",&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; which was another of the album's four replacement tracks.&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; This release took place on 20 July 1981, with "Save the World" appearing as the single's [[B-side]].&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his album review for ''[[Creem]]'' magazine, Mitchell Cohen called Harrison a "C– thinker" and ridiculed the lyrics of "Save the World" with the comment: "Harrison comes out against ''paper towels'' (!!) (expect a rebuttal on the next Nancy Walker album) and whalemeat used as dogfood (ditto Lorne Greene)."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Cohen, "George Harrison: ''Somewhere In England''", ''[[Creem]]'', September 1981; available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/george-harrison-isomewhere-in-englandi Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; In another unfavourable review,&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leng, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Thomas of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' opined that "Social commentary and ironic wit clearly remain outside the scope of Harrison's very real talents" and wrote of "Save the World": "Veering uncertainly between whimsy and dour warnings, the song ultimately fails either to galvanize or amuse."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Thomas, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071124061439/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/georgeharrison/albums/album/176119/review/5946590/somewhere_in_england "George Harrison: Somewhere In England"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 6 August 1981, p. 44 (archived version from 24 November 2007, retrieved 19 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''[[NME]]'' critic [[Bob Woffinden]] welcomed the song as an example of how the album's subject matter ranged beyond the "humdrum", and he found it "only characteristic of [Harrison] to embrace more universal themes".&lt;ref&gt;Woffinden, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Greenpeace'' version==
Harrison revisited "Save the World" in 1985 when Greenpeace UK approached him for a contribution to an album intended to raise funds&lt;ref name="Clayson p 388"&gt;Clayson, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; for their environmental efforts.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt; Harrison amended the lyrics slightly to include further references to Greenpeace,&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harry p 329"&gt;Harry, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; along with a spoken comment that conveyed his disgust with the power of corporations: "You greedy bastards".&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt; In addition to recording a new vocal, he remixed the musical backing, giving more prominence to some of the guitar parts.&lt;ref name="Huntley p 196"&gt;Huntley, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RainbowWarriorAmsterdam1981.jpg|thumb|right|Greenpeace's ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]''. The video clip for "Save the World" used footage of the ship and of Greenpeace's activities to protect the environment.]]
Titled ''[[Greenpeace – The Album]]'',&lt;ref name="Huntley p 196" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; and including contributions from fifteen other British artists,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Benarde, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-08-23/features/8502040412_1_rainbow-warrior-compilation-album-fernando-pereira "Brits Cut An Album To Aid Greenpeace"], ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'', 23 August 1985 (retrieved 20 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; the album was released in the UK by [[EMI]] on 4 June 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The album was issued by [[A&amp;M Records]] in the United States, in August 1985.&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The inclusion of "Save the World" on ''Greenpeace'' marked a rare new musical release for Harrison between 1983 and 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Dave Thompson, "The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide", ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]'', 25 January 2002, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; when he was otherwise engaged in film production with the continued success of HandMade.&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 239–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 84–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, p. 2647.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the same period, however, he became increasingly involved in environmental matters; these activities included attending an anti-nuclear demonstration in London's [[Trafalgar Square]],&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; voicing support for the British [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]], and inspiring a successful campaign to stop the [[John Lewis Partnership]] from demolishing Henley's Regal Cinema and building a supermarket complex.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, pp. 388–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was also included in the video compilation ''Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits'', released in December 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; five months after the French intelligence services' [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sinking]] of the Greenpeace flagship ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Brown &amp; Rob Evans, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/23/uk.freedomofinformation "How Rainbow Warrior was played down"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 August 2005 (retrieved 20 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by Ian Weiner, the clip for "Save the World" consisted of scenes of ''Rainbow Warrior'' and Greenpeace personnel at work on their international activist campaigns.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt;

==Retrospective assessment and legacy==
Until his death in November 2001, Harrison continued to express alarm at the ecological issues facing the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70, 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated his 1989 compilation album ''[[Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989|Best of Dark Horse]]'' to Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and "anyone interested in saving our planet";&lt;ref&gt;Harry, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; in the revised artwork for the 2001 reissue of ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', he included a series of images showing the gradual encroachment of pollution and industry onto the Friar Park scene depicted on that album's 1970 cover photo.&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, pp. 146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; As a songwriter, he revisited the themes of "Save the World" in "[[Cockamamie Business]]", a new song issued on ''Best of Dark Horse'',&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, pp. 477–78.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the title track to his final studio album, the posthumously released ''[[Brainwashed (George Harrison album)|Brainwashed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 100, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|In addition, Harrison considered titling that album ''Your Planet Is Doomed – Volume One''.&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, pp. 309–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allison p 70"&gt;Allison, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1990s, Harrison's elder sister, Louise, used "Save the World" as the soundtrack for a series of public service radio segments she produced, titled ''Good Earthkeeping Tips'', which offered information on environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with Harrison's instructions for the reissuing of his [[The Dark Horse Years 1976–1992|Dark Horse catalogue]],&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 312–13.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song appeared as the sole bonus track on the 2004 reissue of ''Somewhere in England''.&lt;ref name="John Metzger/MB"&gt;John Metzger, [http://www.musicbox-online.com/gh-some.html#axzz3AMts81es "George Harrison ''The Dark Horse Years'' (Part Three: ''Somewhere in England'')"], ''The Music Box'', vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 20 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' in March 2017, [[Neil Spencer]] highlighted "Save the World" as one of the "[unexpected] delights" among Harrison's 1980s releases, and said that while it was dismissed as "soft protest" originally, the song is "beautifully played and never more relevant than today".&lt;ref name="Spencer/Uncut"&gt;Neil Spencer, [http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/george-harrison-vinyl-collection "George Harrison – The Vinyl Collection"], [[Uncut (magazine)|uncut.co.uk]], 27 March 2017 (retrieved 30 November 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Save the World" is held in low regard by several Harrison and Beatles biographers. Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe it as "a wholly unappealing track" on which the "heavyhandedness" of the lyrics is completely at odds with the musical mood.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt; Ian Inglis echoes this view, deeming the lyrics "trite to the point of being risible" and the combination of an unfocused narrative and the overuse of sound effects to be as unsuccessful as the Beatles' work during the ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'' era.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he concedes that the scarcity of environmental songs in the early 1980s, relative to the 1990s, might be a mitigating factor, Inglis dismisses the song as a "hopelessly vague indictment of the perils we are inflicting around the globe", adding: "The problem with such a general attack is that it lacks focus and, therefore, force."&lt;ref name="Inglis p 78" /&gt;

Alan Clayson views Harrison's conservationist sentiments as "laudable" and considers the track to be a protest song in the mould of [[Barry McGuire]]'s 1965 hit "[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]", yet he also identifies the lack of subtlety as betraying "the impartiality of one long and, perhaps, guiltily isolated from the everyday".&lt;ref name="Clayson p 381" /&gt; [[Dale Allison]] recognises it as "the most extensive expression of George's ecological anxiety" and a sincere statement, particularly as Harrison chose to revisit the track for the Greenpeace album.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70–71, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Allison deems it to be a "strange song" with a "jarring disjunction between lyric and sound", and he says that as with Harrison's other songs about pollution and environmental issues, his message reflects a romanticism that was born out of 1960s radicalism but fails to convince in the manner of [[Neil Young]]'s "[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]".&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70–71, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Leng finds "Save the World" closer in style to Monty Python's "[[Eric the Half-a-Bee]]" than to a genuine environmental song such as "[[Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)]]" by [[Marvin Gaye]].&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt; He describes the ''Somewhere in England'' version as "horribly overproduced" next to the "charming" demo, which "is more [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]] than Monty Python".&lt;ref&gt;Leng, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SelinaDolaro.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Selina Dolaro]]
'''Selina Dolaro''' (20 August 1849 – 23 January 1889) was an English singer, actress, [[Actor-manager|theatre manager]] and writer.  During a career in operetta and other forms of musical theatre, she managed several of her own opera companies and raised four children as a single mother.  She is best remembered as a producer of the original production of ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].

==Life and career==
Dolaro was born in London.  Her father was the violinist and conductor Benjamin Simmonds, and her mother was Julia (née Lewis).  Dolaro received early music lessons from her father's colleagues, and she attended the [[Paris Conservatory]] as a teenager to continue her musical studies.  In 1865, at the age of sixteen, she married Isaac Dolaro Belasco, an Italian Jew of Spanish descent, in Upper Kennington, England.  By 1870, she had adopted Dolaro as her stage name.&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;Siegel, Michele. [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/dolaro-selina "Selina Dolaro"], ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia'', 1 March 2009, Jewish Women's Archive, accessed 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trial by Jury cover.jpg|left|thumb|Programme cover of April 1875 for ''[[La Périchole]]'' and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', with caricatures of [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]] as cherubs framing a portrait of Dolaro]]
Dolaro made her stage debut at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], in the role of the Spanish princess, Galsuinda, in [[Hervé (composer)|Hervé]]'s [[operetta]] ''[[Chilpéric (operetta)|Chilpéric]]'' in 1870 and soon played there in [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] operettas.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt; Successes at various London theatres followed: After a season at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], Dolaro starred in an English-language Offenbach adaptation called ''Breaking the Spell'', on tour with [[Fred Sullivan]]'s Operetta Company in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 5 September 1871, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 Dolaro was a leading performer in [[H. B. Farnie]]'s English-language adaptation of Offenbach's ''[[Geneviève de Brabant]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1872, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; in Hervé's ''[[Doctor Faust]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 June 1872, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and in a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of [[Ferdinand Hérold]]'s ''[[Zampa]]'' ("Charmingly sung by Miss Dolaro in imitation of Mdlle Chaumont", said ''[[The Times]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 October 1872, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in the title role of [[George Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' in the first English-language production, with the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]], opposite [[Durward Lely]] as Don José.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, Dolaro divorced her husband on the grounds of his adultery and desertion; she brought up her two sons and two daughters on her own income.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt;

By January 1875, Dolaro was director of the [[Royalty Theatre]], where her father served as musical director.  She starred as the title character in Offenbach's ''[[La Périchole]]'', uniting "vivacity as an actress" with "taste and skill as a singer".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 February 1875, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As a replacement afterpiece to ''La Périchole'', her new theatre manager, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], commissioned ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' from [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]].&lt;ref&gt;In late January 1875, ''[[The Times]]'' ran advertisements for the Royalty Theatre: "In preparation, a new comic opera composed expressly for this theatre by Mr. [[Arthur Sullivan]], in which Madame Dolaro and [[Nelly Bromley]] will appear" (Allen, p. 28), and commentators took this as an advertisement for ''Trial by Jury''.  However, ''Trial'' has no place for two principal ladies. McElroy and others conclude that Sullivan was writing a two-act opera for the Royalty that was abandoned, and the music was soon re-used in Sullivan's ''[[The Zoo]]'', which has roles for two women. ''The Zoo'' played at another London theatre later in 1875 and at the Royalty in 1879 (McElroy, pp. 39–54). In any event, Bromley played the sole female principal role in ''Trial'', not Dolaro.&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan conducted the opening night performance of ''Trial'' on 25 March, but Dolaro's father generally conducted the orchestra thereafter until the end of its initial run on 12 June 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolaro took her Madame Selina Dolaro's Comic Opera Co. on tour between 13 June and 10 October 1875, as the theatre was closed during the hot summer months. On their return, [[Charles Morton (impresario)|Charles Morton]] became manager of the theatre.  Dolaro returned to the position in January 1876 when, again working with Carte, she played Malvina in ''The Duke's Daughter''. Dolaro continued to perform both in London and on tour, appearing at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] in 1877.  In 1879 she worked at the [[Folly Theatre]], which she also managed for the time.

Dolaro travelled to the United States that autumn, appearing in October at the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]] in New York City in the title role of ''Carmen'', but reviews were mixed, with one critic commenting that she seemed "much more at home" performing in burlesque and [[comic opera]].&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt; She then joined a touring [[comic opera]] troupe before returning to London.  In 1880 she appeared again at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] as Cerisette in [[Henry Brougham Farnie|Farnie]] &amp; Genee's ''The Naval Cadets''.  Soon thereafter she moved to New York, where she spent the next few seasons performing in comic opera.  There, she worked under Carte's agency while appearing as Girola in Bucalossi's ''Les Manteaux Noirs'' and Katrina in [[Robert Planquette]]'s ''[[Rip van Winkle (operetta)|Rip van Winkle]]'' and as the Fairy Queen in Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[Iolanthe]]'', both in 1882 at the [[Manhattan Theatre|Standard Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Arthur | authorlink=Arthur Jacobs |year=1984|title=Arthur Sullivan: A Victorian Musician|publisher=Oxford University Press |page=176 |isbn=0-19-315443-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, an opinion piece in the ''New York Herald'' by a Reverend Philip Germond denounced "play-acting as a godless life."  Dolaro responded with a spirited defence of her profession: "Had I not been ‘launched’ on this ‘godless life,’ I should probably have been a burden to some parish or perhaps launched on what I regard as indeed a godless life. ... Is it not enough that we must slave as we do to earn the means to educate and train our children so as to enable them to become useful members of society without being assailed even from the pulpit with such outrageous slander?”&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt;

Dolaro's last part was Minnie Marden in an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Agnes'' in 1886.  Her health soon began to decline, as she began to struggle with [[tuberculosis]].  Her last appearance was in New York as a supernumerary in a benefit production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' for [[Lester Wallack]], played at Daly's Theatre in May 1888.

Dolaro died of a stroke in New York City in January 1889 at the age of 39.

==Publications==
Dolaro's play, ''In the Fashion'' (later known only as ''Fashion''), ran in New York between 1887 and 1888.  Her ''Mes amours: Poems, Passionate and Playful'', based on love letters that she had received, was published in 1888.  She also wrote a play called ''Justine''.

Dolaro also wrote novels, including: 
*''The Princess Daphne'', Belford, Clarke &amp; Co. (US), 1888 ([[Edward Heron-Allen]] with Selina Dolaro – a tale of psychic vampirism, involving mesmerism, doppelgangers and metapsychosis)
*''Bella Demonia'', Belford, Clarke &amp; Co. (US), [c.1889] (ghost written for Dolaro by Heron-Allen – an historical novel concerning the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78), published shortly after her death by ''[[Lippincott's Magazine]]'' 
*''The Vengeance of Maurice Denalguez'', Belford, Clarke &amp; Co. (US), [c.1889] (ghost written for Dolaro by Heron-Allen)

''Sidlaphadi'' near [[Badami]] in [[Karnataka]], is a natural rock bridge and pre historic rock shelter. It is located at about four km. in the middle of a shrub jungle near the historic town of Badami. A bridle and kutcha path through sandstone hills from Badami leads to Sidlaphadi and there is no metal road to the spot. ''Sidlaphadi'' literally means in Kannada the ''Rock of lightning'', derived from gaping holes in the natural rock arch, which was formed when a lightning struck.&lt;ref name=arun&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhat|first1=Arun|title=Struck by lightning|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/41256/ipl-2012.html|accessdate=13 August 2014|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The natural rock bridge structure looks like a ''wide arch'' between two sandstone boulders (served as a roof). The rock structure has large, gaping holes in the arch and allows sunlight to enter inside which provides the required light for interiors. It was also a shelter for hunter-gatherer prehistoric people.

There is a replica of Sidlaphadi in the Badami archaeological museum, it is dedicated to recreate Sidlaphadi and has posters to provide relevant information about the evolution of man.

There are evidences to prove that the Sidlaphadi was a dwelling of prehistoric man.

==Prehistoric rock art==

This natural rock bridge structure was studied by archaeologist Shri A. Sundar, who identified prehistoric (now fading) paintings on the roof of the arch. The blunt weapons of stone were also discovered in the area.&lt;ref name=arun/&gt;

Starting Gate performs mainly contemporary classic plays, mostly by American authors, though they make occasional forays into classical texts.  The company emphasizes its production values—which tend to be very high compared to other small theater companies in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]]--and its development of actors through workshops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/state_of_the_arts/features/webguide/theater.shtml "Web Guide to Minnesota Arts"]; State of the Arts; Minnesota Public Radio website&lt;/ref&gt; Starting Gate produced a large number of shows in its first few season and gained early success with critics and audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Papatola, Dominic; [http://www.renbox.com/content.asp?id=212 "Starting Gate Plunges Ahead with Ambitious 2nd Season"]; St. Paul Pioneer Press; 4 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, the producers in the company turned their attention to securing Equity actors for some of their productions.&lt;ref&gt;Royce, Graydon; [http://www.renbox.com/content.asp?id=448 "An Upgrade at Starting Gate"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229182458/http://www.renbox.com/content.asp?id=448 |date=2006-12-29 }}; Minneapolis Star Tribune; 5 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Henry Sharp]], who decided to make painting of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] his life work, visited Taos on a trip through New Mexico in 1893.&lt;ref name=HMA-TSA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harwoodmuseum.org/collections/taos-society |title=Taos Society of Artists |work=Collections |publisher=Harwood Museum of Art |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While there he became enchanted with the people of the [[Taos Pueblo]] and the landscape,&lt;ref name=James373&gt;James (1920), p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; an interest he shared with [[Ernest L. Blumenschein|Ernest Blumenschein]] when they were studying art in Paris.&lt;ref name=HMA-TSA/&gt;&lt;ref name=James373/&gt;   Having heard of the degree to which Sharp was interested in painting the [[western United States]], and the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] [[pueblo]] of Taos in particular, Blumenschein came to Taos with fellow artist [[Bert Geer Phillips|Bert Phillips]] in 1898.  Planning only to visit Taos, they became enamored by the Taos valley and its people that they decided to stay.  This was the beginning of the [[Taos art colony]].&lt;ref name=Blieler&gt;{{cite book | title=Taos | author=Bleiler, L; Society of the Muse of the Southwest | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | location=Charleston | year=2011 | page=75 | isbn=978-0-7385-7959-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9tLeh-G-kEC&amp;pg=PA75 |series=Images of America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blumenschein described his first sights of Taos, "The month was September, and the fertile valley a beautiful sight, and inspiration for those who ply the brush for happiness.  The primitive people of this out-of-the-way region were harvesting their crops by sunlight and by moonlight.  Brown people they were, both [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], happy people with happy children, in a garden spot protected by mountains."  More compelling were the people.  Native Americans had lived for centuries in the pueblo just outside the village of Taos. There a peace-loving, [[democracy|democratic]] society has maintained, and continues to maintain, its history, culture, dress and way of life over centuries.&lt;ref name="James375-376"&gt;James (1920), pp. 375-376&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernest Blumenschein returned to [[New York City]] for a time while Phillips stayed behind.  Blumenschein kept up correspondence with Phillips and discussed setting up an artist colony in Taos.  Blumenschein also wrote other artists in New York and [[Paris]] of Taos about the "beauty and artistic promise of [[northern New Mexico]]."&lt;ref name=HMA-TSA/&gt;

On July 19, 1915 [[Joseph Henry Sharp]], [[E. Irving Couse]], [[Oscar E. Berninghaus]], [[W. Herbert Dunton]], [[Ernest L. Blumenschein|Ernest Blumenschein]] and [[Bert Geer Phillips|Bert Phillips]] formed the Taos Society of Artists.  The six founding members were known as the "Taos Six". [[E. Irving Couse]] was the Society's first president.&lt;ref name=Blieler/&gt;

Their work, defined the first several decades of the [[Taos art colony]], was distinguished by: Native Americans in traditional clothing, area [[Hispanic]]s and [[Anglo-American ethnic group|Anglo-Americans]] and landscapes.&lt;ref name=HMA-TSA/&gt;

The group's first exhibition was held at the [[Palace of the Governors]] in Santa Fe soon after their formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen-Solal|first1=Annie|title=Painting American : The Rise of American Artists, Paris 1867-New York 1948|date=2001|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0679450939|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917 they were sending [[Travelling exhibition|travelling exhibits]] of their work across the United States.  Initial critical reaction of the works was that they were unrealistic and overdone: vivid colors, too emotionally evocative and strong vibrational quality.  The artists questioned the critics veracity, since they had never been to the [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] [[desert]], nor the [[Taos Pueblo]].&lt;ref name="James377-378"&gt;James (1020), pp. 377-378&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and membership==
Member artists had to have worked in Taos for three consecutive years, shown an interest and aptitude for painting Native Americans and have shown in reputable galleries or New York salons (ongoing art exhibits). The primary reason for the requirements was to ensure that the artists were well-intentioned and capable of capturing the character and spirit of the people.&lt;ref name="James376-377"&gt;James (1920), pp. 376-377&lt;/ref&gt;

Later members included [[Julius Rolshoven]], [[E. Martin Hennings]], [[Catharine Carter Critcher|Catharine C. Critcher]] (the only female member &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://addisonrowe.com/Gallery_Artists/Catherine_Carter_Critcher/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913164518/http://addisonrowe.com/Gallery_Artists/Catherine_Carter_Critcher/ |archivedate=2015-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), Kenneth Adams, [[Walter Ufer]], and [[Victor Higgins]].&lt;ref name="TAM-About"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Associate and honorary members==
Some artists from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], another developing arts center, were included as Associate members: [[Robert Henri]],  [[Albert L. Groll]], [[Randall Davey]], [[Bror Julius Olsson Nordfeldt|B.J.O. Nordfeldt]], [[Gustave Baumann]], Albert Groll, [[Birger Sandzén]],&lt;ref name=TAM-About/&gt; and [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]].&lt;ref name="Taos Daily"/&gt;
   
Honorary memberships were extended to men who helped create a museum infrastructure in New Mexico: [[Edgar L. Hewett]], the director of the [[Museum of New Mexico]]; and Frank Springer, whose donations helped to build the Museum of New Mexico’s [[New Mexico Museum of Art|Fine Arts Museum]] in Santa Fe.&lt;ref name="Taos Daily"/&gt;

==War work==
During [[World War I]], the Taos society artists served on United War Work Committees, designed posters and exhibited canvases at [[Red Cross]] bazars. Most notably they created "range-finder paintings", 50 by 100 foot landscapes of Belgium and France used as military teaching tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RINDGE|first1=FRED HAMILTON|title=TAOS—A UNIQUE COLONY OF ARTISTS|journal=The American Magazine of Art|date=September 1926|volume=17|issue=9|page=452|jstor=23929280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these paintings were exhibited in the 1918 Taos Society of Artists' annual exhibition held at the [[Museum of New Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Robert R.|title=The Taos Society of Artists|date=1998|publisher=University of New Mexico|location=Albuquerque|isbn=0826319467|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depression==
The [[Great Depression|depression]] was the precipitating factor for the dissolution of the Taos Society of Artists.  Taos was devastated by the depression and the artist's [[Patronage|patrons]] were not spending money on art during that time. Victor Higgins the most financially devastated by the Depression made two of his most important paintings during that time, ''Winter Funeral'' heralded by the New York press, and ''Sleeping Nude'' similarly praised by the Chicago Herald Examiner writer Inez Cunningham.  Cunningham likened Higgins to a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] rising out of the ashes, "what heights of intellectual and emotional fire.  He is one of those fortunate few who flower in maturity."&lt;ref name="TAM-About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taosartmuseum.org/about.php |title=About |publisher=Taos Art Museum |accessdate=2011-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006060005/http://www.taosartmuseum.org/about.php |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The "Taos Six" applied academic technique to native themes to produce a uniquely American school of painting. Each artist's style was unique, though cross influence can certainly be noted as can strong elements of their [[Academic art|European Academic artistic training]]. Aside from the inspiration of their environment, one quality early [[Taos art colony]] paintings share is their vibrant palette of colors - not a common sight when paired with more traditional representational images and application of paint. Today, these artists are recognized for their contribution to artistic development and their scenes of Taos locales grace the walls of many museums.&lt;ref name="Taos Daily"&gt;Whaley, Bill; Stiny, Andy.

'''''The Book of the Book''''' is a book by [[Idries Shah]]. The majority of the book's 200 pages are blank, with the remaining nine pages telling the story of a book left by a wise man consisting of one sentence and attempts over hundreds of years to discern the intended meaning. 

[[Lawrence Paul Elwell-Sutton]] writing for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' said, "I suppose his admirers among the Hampstead intelligentsia will have swallowed this buffoonery with the same enthusiasm with which they have gulped down the rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1970/10/22/the-mysterious-east-2/|title=The Mysterious East|last=Elwell-Sutton|first=L. P.|last2=Lessing|first2=Doris|date=July 2, 1970|website=The New York Review of Books|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doris Lessing]] responded to Elwell-Sutton's remarks, in the ''New York Review of Books'', stating "Ignorance, I will admit, is no crime, and I am sure that Dr. Elwell-Sutton does not claim to be a literary man. But motivation has its mysteries." 

A review in [[Studies in Comparative Religion]] stated "The Book of the Book, which purports to be an object lesson in the problem of the container and the content, consists of some fifteen pages of print bound together with over 250 blank pages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The September Issue''''' is a 2009 American documentary film about the behind-the-scenes drama that follows editor-in-chief [[Anna Wintour]] and her staff during the production of the September 2007 issue of American ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine. The film is directed by [[R.J. Cutler]] and produced by Eliza Hindmarch and [[Sadia Shepard]].

It was released in Australia on August 20, 2009 after being screened at numerous film festivals including Sundance, Zurich, Silverdocs and [[Sheffield Doc/Fest]]. The movie was released in American theaters on August 28, 2009.

==Plot==
The film revolves around the making of the ''Vogue'' September 2007 issue. (The September ''Vogue'' is traditionally the biggest, most important issue of the year.)  It depicts the effort that goes into making the magazine, and the passion that [[Grace Coddington]], a former model turned creative director and the only person who dares to stand up to Anna Wintour, has for the highly regarded fashion magazine. In the film, Coddington is often portrayed as the leading victim to Wintour's aggressive personality. The relationship between Wintour and Coddington reveals itself to be symbiotic, as Wintour recognizes Coddington's expertise and keen eye for design. In the end, Wintour approves most of Coddington's ideas and they appear in the final version of the September issue.

==Notable fashion icons==
The film features appearances by many well-known and influential people in the fashion industry, from top editorial models to noted fashion photographers and designers.

'''Theater''' has been performed in '''Yemen''' since the early years of the twentieth century. It is, as elsewhere, a public and social genre: performances take place in cultural centers, at universities, at schools and language institutes, in public parks and squares, as well as at more intimate gatherings, such as wedding celebrations. By the count of one scholar of Yemeni theater, a minimum of five hundred plays of all kinds have been performed in Yemen over the course of the last century, around three hundred and seventy of which are by Yemeni authors; there are also around one hundred published Yemeni play scripts.&lt;ref&gt; Sayf, Yahya Muhammad. ''Al-Mukhtasar al-mufid fi al-Masrah al-arabi al-jadid:  al-Masrah fi al-Yaman (A Useful Introduction to New Arabic Theater:  Theater in Yemen.'' Arab Theater Institute, Sharjah 2009, p. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;
Some of these plays have taken uniquely Yemeni themes as their subject matter:  particular moments or celebrated figures from Yemeni history, like Bilqis, the legendary [[Queen of Sheba]]; the 1962 revolution against the [[Imams of Yemen#Modern History|Hamid al-Din Imamate]] in the North; or the 1967 revolution against the British colonial forces in the South. But Yemeni performances have also drawn upon other traditions, including Egyptian drama, like the works of [[Yusuf Idris]], [[Alfred Farag]], and [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]], and on texts by European playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], and [[Luigi Pirandello]]. Performances vary in type from [[tragedy]] to [[Improvisational Theater|improvised comedy]], from [[Musical theatre|musical]] to [[experimental theater]], from [[Naturalism (theater)|naturalistic plays]] to [[theater of the absurd]].

== History ==

According to Yemeni theater historian Sa'id Aulaqi, the first play publicly performed by Yemeni actors was Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', in Arabic translation, staged in the city of Aden in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;'Aulaqi, Sa'id. ''Saba'un 'Aaman Min al-Masrah fii al-Yaman (Seventy Years of Theater in Yemen'').  Aden:  Ministry of Culture and Tourism, 1983, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare proved popular with Yemeni audiences:  subsequent decades saw performances of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]], [[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and ''[[Othello]]''. &lt;ref&gt; al-Asmar, Husayn.  ''al-Masraḥ fī al-Yaman:  taǧribah wa ṭumūḥ (Theatre in Yemen:  Experience and Ambition)'', Al-Manār al-‘Arabī Press, Giza 1991, p. 71; Aulaqi, Chs. 3 and 5; and Hennessey, Katherine. “Shylock in the Hadhramaut? Adaptations of Shakespeare on the Yemeni Stage”, ''Arablit'' 3:5 (Summer 2013). &lt;/ref&gt;
But Yemeni playwrights and actors also created their own texts.  Some of these plays sought to criticize the British occupying forces in Aden and the surrounding area, and to call for independence.  Others were less overtly political—romantic comedies, or dramatizations of foundational events in Islamic history.  The first full-length comedy performed in Yemeni dialect, Masrur Mabruk’s ''Tarfisha and Shorban'', took place in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Sayf, Yahya Muhammad.  ''‘Ālam al-adab wa ’l-fann al-masraḥī fī al-Yaman (Great Names in the Literature and Art of the Theater in Yemen)'', al-Hay’ah al-‘āmah lil-kuttāb, Ṣan‘ā’ 2006, p. 71. Also ’Aulaqi, p. 46. &lt;/ref&gt;
Performances in the early decades of the 20th century often took place in public squares or in schools, since no theaters ''per se'' existed.  Only men acted, as in the Elizabethan era, and some became famous for interpreting female characters.  This remained the case until 1956, when Nabiha Azim became the first Yemeni woman to appear on stage.&lt;ref&gt; Aulaqi, p. 80. &lt;/ref&gt;  It is also important to note that, in the first half of the 20th century, almost all performances occurred in the south of Yemen, most notably in Aden.  In the North, under the Imamate, theatrical performances were much rarer. 

The 1960s were a decade of revolution both North and South, and many Yemeni performances from these years took revolution as their theme, reflecting upon the military and political upheavals and the challenges of building new states and societies.&lt;ref&gt; Sa‘īd, ‘Abd al-Maǧīd Muḥammad. ''Nušūʾ wa taṭawwur al-masraḥ fī al-Yaman 1910 ilà 2000 (The Growth and Development of Theater in Yemen, 1910-2000)''.  Wazārat al-Ṯaqāfah, Ṣan‘ā’, 2010, pp. 45-49.  Also Aulaqi, Ch. 10. &lt;/ref&gt; The governments of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] and the [[South Yemen|People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (North and South Yemen respectively) demonstrated their interest in theater by establishing National Theater Troupes and supporting theater festivals. &lt;ref&gt; Aulaqi, Ch. 11. &lt;/ref&gt;
Yemeni theater faced new challenges in the 1980s as a result of economic crises and political upheaval (war in  1979 between North and South Yemen, a civil war in the South in 1986). The celebrations that greeted the unification of North and South as the Republic of Yemen in 1990 were short-lived. Civil war broke out in 1994, amidst a background of economic hardship resulting from the expulsion of Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia in the wake of the first [[Gulf War]].  Performances continued, however, both independently and under the auspices of the government, which sponsored important theater festivals in the 1990s that showcased the work of theater troupes from each of Yemen’s provinces.&lt;ref&gt; Sa‘īd, ‘Abd al-Maǧīd Muḥammad. ''Nušūʾ wa taṭawwur al-masraḥ fī al-Yaman 1910 ilà 2000 (The Growth and Development of Theater in Yemen, 1910-2000)''.  Wazārat al-Ṯaqāfah, Ṣan‘ā’, 2010.  C.f. pp. 61-75 for an analysis of the 1990 festival, pp. 77-91 for the festival in 1993, and pp. 92-106 for the one in 1995. &lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st century has seen a resurgence of theater in Yemen, with foreign embassies, INGOs, and local organizations and institutes sponsoring theatrical productions. Among Yemen’s most notable contemporary actors and directors are ‘Amr Jamal and the Khalij Aden acting troupe, Amin Hazaber, Nargis ‘Abbad, Nabil Hizam, Ibrahim al-‘Ashmuri, and Saleh al-Saleh.  The [http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu ''Global Shakespeares'' webpage], hosted by MIT, recently added its first-ever page featuring a Yemeni production,  [http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/lamp-will-keep-you-company-hazaber-amin-2013/ a scene from ''Aismur Ma'ish al-Siraj,'' directed by Hazaber (2012, 2013)].

'''{{nihongo|Tokyo Kodomo Club|東京こどもクラブ|Tōkyō Kodomo Kurabu}}''', meaning '''Tokyo Children Club''', is an [[early childhood education]] program published in Japan in an audio-visual format, distributed monthly on a [[Gramophone record|record]]. The 7-inch record contained stories and songs, accompanied by a [[picture book]] that could be bound in a special folder. The early-childhood education program came in two courses: a 2-4 year old course and a 5-7 year old course. Each of the courses was designed to complete in 12 months. In addition on a quarterly basis, the Club sent out supplemental stories, songs and other music on a 12-inch record. The recitations on Side A were by {{nihongo|"Uncle Maeda"|前田武彦|Takehiko Maeda}}, and on Side B, {{nihongo|"Bin-chan"|楠トシエ|Toshie Kusunoki}}. The records were monaural recordings at 33-1/3 rpm. Presently, the recordings have gone out of print, making their procurement quite difficult.

==Programs==
The programs were designed to familiarize children with stories and songs from around the world, with emphasis on European orchestral works. Main story narration often featured Classical music as a background music in order to help set the tone of the story. The bullets found in the index to each lesson were color-coded: red for the main story, blue for the songs and yellow for the occasional extra story. In the original course series, the main stories and songs were bulleted with a star and the extra stories with a circle. However, in later course series, they switched their bullets to red circles, blue squares and yellow triangles, keeping the same color code as before.

===Sing in English Group===
The Tokyo Kodomo Club issued two courses of children’s songs in English for the Japanese audience in the '''{{nihongo|Sing in English Group|英語で歌う会|Ei-go de Utau Kai}}''' series. These songs were sung by Esther Ghan and her children. The '''{{nihongo|Let’s Sing English Songs|英語で歌いましょう|Ei-go de Utaimashō}}''' course was designed similarly to their Japanese courses, where the lesson units were distributed monthly on a record. Each of the courses was designed to complete in 12 months, with the course set spanning two years. For the older children, '''{{nihongo| Folk-album for All|みんなのフォーク・アルバム|Minna no Fōku-arubamu}}''' in a set of six lesson units and a Christmas supplement were provided. It also spanned over two years.

[[File:Frankenstein trailer (1931).webm|thumb|right|350px|A trailer for the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'']]

A '''trailer''' (also known as a '''preview''' or '''coming attraction''') is a commercial [[advertisement]] for a [[feature film]] that will be exhibited in the future at a [[movie theater|cinema]], the result of creative and technical work. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a feature film screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://straightdope.com/mailbag/mtrailers.html | title = Why are they called "trailers" if they're shown before the movie? | author = Gfactor | publisher = The Straight Dope | date = 2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice did not last long, because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film begins.

Movie trailers have now become popular on [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray]] discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Of some 10 billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | title = AWFJ Opinion Poll: All About Movie Trailers | publisher = AWFJ | date = 2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer format has also been adopted as a promotional tool for television shows, video games, books, and theatrical events/concerts.

== History ==
[[File:The African Queen - trailer.ogv|thumb|Film trailer for ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' ([[1951 in film|1951]]).]]

The first trailer shown in an American film theater was in November 1913, when [[Nils Granlund]], the advertising manager for the [[Marcus Loew]] theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical ''The Pleasure Seekers'', opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. As reported in a wire service story carried by the [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] ''Daily Star'', the practice which Loew adopted was described as "an entirely new and unique stunt", and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew’s picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising".&lt;ref&gt;"Movies Score on Legit in New York;" Lincoln, Nebraska ''Daily Star''; November 9, 1913; Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring [[Charlie Chaplin]] at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Blondes, Brunettes, and Bullets, Granlund, N.T.; Van Rees Press, NY, 1957, Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Trailers were initially shown after, or "trailing", the feature film, and this led to their being called "trailers". The practice was found to be somewhat ineffective, often ignored by audiences who left immediately after the feature. Later, exhibitors changed their practice so that trailers were only one part of the film program, which included cartoon shorts, newsreels, and serial adventure episodes. Today, more elaborate trailers and commercial advertisements have largely replaced other forms of pre-feature entertainment, and in major multiplex chains, about the first 20 minutes after the posted showtime is devoted to trailers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Up until the late 1950s, trailers were mostly created by [[National Screen Service]] and consisted of various key scenes from the film being advertised, often augmented with large, descriptive text describing the story, and an underscore generally pulled from studio music libraries.  Most trailers had some form of narration, and those that did featured [[wiktionary:stentorian|stentorian]] voices.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the early 1960s, the face of motion picture trailers changed. Textless, montage trailers and quick-editing became popular, largely due to the arrival of the "new Hollywood" and techniques that were becoming increasingly popular in television.  Among the trend setters were [[Stanley Kubrick]] with his montage trailers for ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]), ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]).  Kubrick's main inspiration for the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer was the short film ''[[Very Nice, Very Nice]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]) by Canadian film visionary [[Arthur Lipsett]]. [[Pablo Ferro]], who pioneered the techniques Kubrick required as necessary elements for the success of his campaign, created the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer, as well as the award-winning trailer for ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Many home videos contain trailers for other movies produced by the same company scheduled to be available shortly after the legal release of the video, so as not to spend money advertising the videos on TV. Most [[VHS]] tapes would play them at the beginning of the tape, but some VHS tapes contained previews at the end of the film or at both ends of the tape. VHS tapes that contained trailers at the end usually reminded the viewer to "Stay tuned after the feature for more previews." With [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]s, trailers can operate as a bonus feature instead of having to watch through the trailers before the film.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Definition ==
Trailers consist of a series selected shots from the film being advertised. Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]]. For this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. A trailer has to achieve that in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum length allowed by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]]. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trailer music |publisher=SoundtrackNet, LLC |date=30 April 2009 |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/trailers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the movie theater trade group ''[[National Association of Theatre Owners]]'' issued an industry guideline asking that film distributors supply trailers that run no longer than 2 minutes, which is 30 second shorter than the prior norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marketingmovies.net/news/theaters-advocate-shorter-trailers-marketing/ | title = Theaters Advocate Shorter Movie Trailers | publisher = MarketingMovies.net | date = 2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guideline is not mandatory, and also allows for limited exceptions of a select few movies having longer trailers. Film distributors reacted coolly to the announcement. There had been no visible disputes on trailer running time prior to the guideline, which surprised many.

Some trailers use "special shoot" footage, which is material that has been created specifically for advertising purposes and does not appear in the actual film. The most notable film to use this technique was ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', whose trailer featured an elaborate special effect scene of a T-800 Terminator being assembled in a factory that was never intended to be in the film itself. [[Dimension Films]] also shot extra scenes for their 2006 horror remake, ''[[Black Christmas (2006 film)|Black Christmas]]'' - these scenes were used in promotional footage for the film, but are similarly absent from the theatrical release. A trailer for the 2002 blockbuster ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' had an entire action sequence especially constructed that involved escaping bank robbers in a helicopter getting caught in a giant web between the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s two towers. However, after the [[September 11 attacks]] the studio pulled it from theaters.

One of the most famous "special shoot" trailers is that used for the 1960s thriller ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', which featured director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] giving viewers a guided tour of the Bates Motel, eventually arriving at the infamous shower. At this point, the soft-spoken Hitchcock suddenly throws the shower curtain back to reveal [[Vera Miles]] with a blood-curdling scream. As the trailer, in fact, was made after completion of the film when [[Janet Leigh]] was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Miles don a blonde wig for the fleeting sequence. Since the title, "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years until freeze-frame analysis clearly revealed that it was Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.

There are dozens of companies that specialize in the creation of film trailers in Los Angeles and New York. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Ben Cain, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park, Buddha Jones) while the film itself is being cut together at the studio.  Since the edited film does not exist at this point, the trailer [[film editor|editor]]s work from [[Dailies|rushes]] or [[dailies]]. Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different [[take]]s of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie's soundtrack. This is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score—sometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie's release date—while composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film.

Some trailers that incorporate material not in the film are particularly coveted by collectors, especially trailers for classic films. For example, in a trailer for ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' the character Rick Blaine says, "OK, you asked for it!" before shooting Major Strasser; this line of dialogue is not spoken in the final film.

== Truth vs. misleading ==
{{essay|section|date=December 2016}}

Over the years, there have been many instances where trailers give misleading representations of their films. They may give the impression that a celebrity who only has a minor part in the film is one of the main cast members, or advertising a film as being more action-packed than it is. These tricks are usually done to draw in a larger audience. Sometimes the trailers include footage not from the film itself. This could be an artistic choice, or because the trailer was put together before the film's final cut, but at other times it is to give the audience a different impression of the movie. Then trailers could be misleading in a 'for the audience's own good' kind of way, in that a general audience would not usually see such a film due to preconceptions, and by [[bait and switch]]ing, they can allow the audience to have a great viewing experience that they would not ordinarily have. However, the opposite is true too, with the promise of great trailers being let down by mediocre films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernman.com/10-incredibly-misleading-movie-trailers/ |title=10 Movie Trailers That Are Nothing Like The Actual Movie |publisher=Modernman.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American woman sued the makers of ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' because their film "failed to live up to its promo's promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hardie|first=Giles|title=Misleading trailer leads to law suit|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/misleading-trailer-leads-to-law-suit-20111011-1lj2z.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Woman sues to stop Drive getting away with a 'misleading' trailer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/10/woman-sues-drive-trailer|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=10/08/11 3:02pm 10/08/11 3:02pm |url=http://gawker.com/5847970/woman-files-lawsuit-over-misleading-trailer-for-drive |title=Woman Files Lawsuit Over 'Misleading' Trailer for Drive |publisher=Gawker.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; although her lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michbar.org/file/opinions/appeals/2013/101513/55553.pdf ''Deming v.

== Composition ==
Trailers tell the story of a film in a highly condensed fashion to have maximum appeal. In the decades since film marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light. Some of the elements common to many trailers are listed below. Trailers are typically made up of scenes from the film they are promoting, but sometimes contain [[deleted scene]]s from the film.

The key ambition in trailer-making is to impart an intriguing story that gets film audiences emotionally involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics|first=Robert |last=Marich  |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |edition=3rd|year=2013 |pages=6–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trailers have a [[three-act structure]] similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax. Act 3 usually features a strong piece of "signature music" (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie.

[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (33).jpg|thumb|250px|Screenshot from film trailer for 1959 ''[[North by Northwest]]'']]

[[Voice-over]] narration is sometimes used to briefly set up the premise of the film and provide explanation when necessary, although this practice has declined in the years after the passing of voice-over artist [[Don LaFontaine]]. Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience's understanding of the plot. Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer voice-over artists have been the aforementioned LaFontaine, [[Hal Douglas]], [[Mark Elliot (voice-over artist)|Mark Elliott]], John Leader, [[Corey Burton]], [[George DelHoyo]], [[Peter Cullen]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Ashton Smith]], [[Jim Cummings]], John Garry, [[Tom Kane]], [[Nick Schatzki]], [[Ben Patrick Johnson]], Tony Rodgers, [[Beau Weaver]], and [[Brian Cummings]]. Classic voice-over artists in film trailers of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s included Howard Strickling (for MGM), Lou Marcelle (for Warner Bros.), Art Gilmore, Knox Manning, Reed Hadley, Les Tremayne (for MGM), Fred Foy (for MGM), Karl Weber (for MGM) and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clichés such as "Colossal!", "Stupendous!", etc. Some trailers have used voice over clichés for satirical effect. This can be seen in trailers for films such as Jerry Seinfeld's Comedian and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.

[[Music]] helps set the [[setting tone|tone]] and mood of the trailer. Usually the music used in the trailer is not from the film itself (the [[film score]] may not have been composed yet). The music used in the trailer may be:

* Music from the score of other movies.
* Popular or well-known music, often chosen for its tone, appropriateness of a lyric or lack thereof, or recognizability. The most often used of these is ''[[O Fortuna]]'' from ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' by Carl Orff,&lt;ref name="soundtrack.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundtrack.net/trailers/frequent/ |title=SoundtrackNet : Trailers: Frequently Used Trailer Music |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the works of [[E.S. Posthumus]] and [[Beethoven]].  Popular music may be selected for its tone (i.e. hard rock for an action film, lighter pop for a romantic comedy), or to establish context (e.g. the trailer for a film set in the 1940s might use big band swing).
* "Library" music previously composed specifically to be used in advertising by an independent composer. There are many trailer music library companies which produce [[trailer music]], some of the best known are [[audiomachine]], [[Two Steps From Hell]], [[Immediate Music]] and [[X-Ray Dog]] or SFX and Music libraries like the ones from Moss Landing, [[Gerrit Kinkel Productions]] or [[RedCola Music|redCola]].
* Specially composed music. One of the most famous Hollywood trailer music composers, credited with creating the musical voice of contemporary trailers, is [[John Beal (composer)|John Beal]], who began scoring trailers in the 1970s and, in the course of a thirty-year career, created original music for over 2,000 film trailer projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118020113.html?categoryid=4051&amp;cs=1 |title=Daily Variety: Razor-thin copyright line |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 40 of the top-grossing films of all time, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Braveheart]]'', ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''.

A ''cast run'' is a list of the [[movie star|stars]] that appear in the movie. If the [[film director|director]] or [[film producer|producer]] is well-known or has made other popular movies, they often warrant a mention as well. Most trailers conclude with a [[billing (film)|billing]] block, which is a list of the principal [[actor|cast]] and [[film crew|crew]]. It is the same list that appears on posters and print publicity materials, and also usually appears on-screen at the beginning (or end) of the movie. Studio [[production logo]]s are usually featured near the beginning of the trailer. Until the late 1970s, they were put only at the end of the trailer or not used at all; however, [[Paramount Pictures]] was the first studio to use its actual studio logo at the beginning of its trailers in the 1940s. Often there will be logos for both the [[production company]] and [[film distributor|distributor]] of the film.

Many trailers are [[audio mixing (film and television)|mixed]] in Dolby Digital or any other multichannel sound mix. Scenes including sound effects and music that are enhanced by stereophonic sound are therefore the focus point of many modern trailers.

Trailers preceding feature films are generally presented in the same format as the feature, being either 35&amp;nbsp;mm film or a digital format. High bandwidth internet connections allow for trailers to be distributed online at any resolution.  Since the advent of [[Digital 3D|Digital 3&amp;#8209;D]], it has become common for a 3‑D feature film to be preceded by one or more trailers that are also presented in 3‑D.

== Collections ==
National Screen Service contracts required that trailers be returned (at the cinema's expense) or destroyed, however it required no proof of destruction and depositing them in a waste bin counted. A market for trailers evolved as it became clear that some had a commercial value to collectors. Many of the trailers for films like the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series reported as 'destroyed' were taken back out of the bin and sold by cinema staff. As they cost about $60 each to make (1981 estimate) and were hired to the cinema for $10, such losses led to NSS increasing its rental charges, which led to a decrease in the number of trailers rented and shown to audiences.&lt;ref&gt;"Coming Soon to a Theatre Near You - Maybe" in Ares 8, Schow, DJ; Simulations Publications, NY 1981, Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cinemas also began to show "trailer trash" programs of trailers without a main feature. Similarly, several DVDs containing nothing but trailers for films, typically from exploitation film genres, have been produced for sale.

== Other types of trailers ==
Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and along with the development of the Internet and sites such as [[YouTube]] as well as animation techniques, more types of trailers began to be created due to easier and cheaper costs to produce and show trailers.

=== Video game trailers ===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}

Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, video game trailers began to be produced as they became more mainstream. Used to entice viewers to go out and play the game, game trailers are very useful. The content and production process is similar to that for movies, complicated by the need to convey the way the game plays. The trailer for Aliens: Colonial Marines, for example, featured graphics that were of a higher standard than the game that was eventually sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2013/04/03/sega-admits-aliens-colonial-marines-trailer-was-misleading/ |title=Sega Admits 'Aliens: Colonial Marines' Trailer Was Misleading |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hideo Kojima]], a game creator strongly influenced by Hollywood movies, edits the elaborate trailers for his own games from a special studio in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-12-war-has-changed-but-has-hideo-kojima |title=War has changed.

=== TV spots ===
TV spots are trailers for movies shown on television that are often shortened to 30–60 seconds. These trailers are similar to green band trailers and have content "appropriate" for the channel.

=== TV show trailers ===
[[TV show]] trailers are trailers advertising a new TV series, episode, event or marathon premiering on television. Trailers for the next episode of a TV series are often shown during or following the closing credits of the show.

=== Book trailer ===
A '''book trailer''' is a [[video]] advertisement for a [[book]] which employs techniques similar to those of [[trailer (film)|movie trailers]] to promote books and encourage readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|title=YouTube video sets stage for novel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/04/business/fi-vidbooks4|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trailers can also be referred to as "video-podcasts", with higher quality trailers being called "cinematic book trailers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deval|first=Jacqueline|title=Publicize Your Book (Updated): An Insider's Guide to Getting Your Book the Attention It Deserves|year=2008|publisher=Perigee Trade|isbn=0399534318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4FVhmwgodMUC&amp;pg=PT195&amp;lpg=PT195&amp;dq=%22book+trailer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22book%20trailer%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are circulated on television and online in most common digital video formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Justin|title=Seeking readers via 'book trailer' / Publisher tries out movie-style preview to market new title |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Seeking-readers-via-book-trailer-Publisher-2488096.php|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common formats of book trailers include actors performing scenes from the book akin to a movie trailer, full production trailers, flash videos, animation or simple still photos set to music with text conveying the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Killian|title=On a screen near you ...|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/16/fiction.features7|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=15 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from author readings and interviews, which consist of video footage of the author narrating a portion of their writing or being interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kneschke|first=Tristan|title=Don't Judge a Book by its Trailer|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/301723/20120220/book-trailer-video-movie-edit-film-novel.htm|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=International Business Times|date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early book trailers consisted mostly of still images of the book, with some videos incorporating actors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Nina|title=Super Sad Book Trailers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-06/features/ct-prj-0708-book-trailers-20120706_1_book-trailers-publishers-videos|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[John Farris|John Farris's]] book trailer for his 1986 novel ''Wildwood'' incorporating images from the book cover along with actors such as [[John Zacherle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitton|first=Akira|title=TOR Books' WILDWOOD promo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OMCNVb7wMM|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' established the Trailie Award for the best book trailers. There are three categories: author/publisher created, student created and librarian/adult created. The award was announced at the ''School Library Journal'' Leadership Summit on the Future of Reading on October 22, 2010 in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLJ's Trailie Awards Asks Readers to Vote for Their Favorite Book Trailer|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/home/886663-312/sljs_trailie_awards_asks_readers.html.csp|publisher=School Library Journal|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Dan Rosen and CV Herst established BookReels, a website dedicated to allowing publishers and authors to post book trailers and other multimedia, culminating in the annual BookReels Awards. BookReels lets readers browse and rate trailers, post comments and reviews, join discussion groups, and share BookReel discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BookReels, an MTV for Books?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/62365-bookreels-an-mtv-for-books.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fan-made trailers ===
For popular movies, fans often make trailers on their own. These are unofficial videos by fans utilizing audio or video of a movie, studio trailer, animation techniques or fan-acted scenes replacing the video of the official trailer.

== MPAA rating cards for theatrical trailers ==
{{Anchor|Rating cards}}
[[File:Redband.JPG|thumb|An example of a red band trailer card, in this case for 2008 ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''.]]

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) mandates that theatrical trailers be no longer than two minutes and thirty seconds.  Each major studio{{clarify|date=February 2013}} is given one exception to this rule per year.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Internet or home-video trailers have no time restrictions. ''Rating cards'' appear at the head of trailers in the United States which indicate how closely the trailer adheres to the MPAA's standards.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A ''green band'' is an all-green graphic at the beginning of the trailer.  Until April 2009, these cards indicated that they had been approved for "all audiences" and often included the movie's [[MPAA rating]]. This signified that the trailer adheres to the standards for motion picture advertising outlined by the MPAA, which include limitations on foul language and violent, sexual, or otherwise objectionable imagery. In April 2009, the MPAA began to permit the green band language to say that a trailer had been approved for "appropriate" audiences, meaning that the material would be appropriate for audiences in theaters, based on the content of the film they had come to see. In May 2013, the MPAA changed the trailer approval band from "for appropriate audiences" to "to accompany this feature", but only when accompanying a feature film; for bands not accompanying a feature film, the text of the band remained the same. The font and style of the text on the graphic bands (green and red) was also changed at the time the green band was revised in 2013.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Trailers which do not adhere to these guidelines may be issued a ''red band'', which indicates approval for only "restricted" or "mature" audiences. These trailers may only be shown theatrically before R-rated, NC-17-rated, or unrated movies{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} (only films that are released in theaters rated R and not in theaters{{clarify|date=December 2014}} rated PG-13). These trailers may include nudity, profanity, or other material deemed inappropriate for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Cat-and-Mouse for a Trashy Trailer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/movies/24kick.html | publisher =New York Times |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-24 | first=Brooks | last=Barnes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, "yellow band" trailers were introduced around 2007 to indicate restricted content, only for distribution on the Internet. Although official, this practice appears to have never been widespread (although occasional yellow band trailers are created). A notable example is the yellow band trailer for Rob Zombie's ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' ([[2007 in film|2007]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David M. |last=Halbfinger |date=13 June 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/movies/13yell.html |title=Attention, Web Surfers: The Following Film Trailer May Be Racy or Graphic |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=E1 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Every year there are two main events that give awards to outstanding film trailers: The [[Key Art Awards]], presented by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', and the [[Golden Trailer Awards]]. The Golden Trailer Awards and the Key Art Awards pick winners in all creative parts of film advertising, from trailers and TV spots to posters and print ads. The Golden Trailer Awards are currently expanding to add a sister event, The World Trailer Awards, to be a kickoff to the Cannes Film Festival in France, 2013. The yearly Key Art Awards ceremony is often held at the [[Dolby Theater]] in Hollywood. ''The Film Informant'' also recognizes movie marketing media and held the first annual TFI Awards in early January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 TFI Awards|url=http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|work=2011 Film Informant Awards|publisher=The Film Informant|accessdate=23 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717025506/http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is the first to officially start recognizing and rating movie marketing media on a daily basis.

[[Image:UTE logo.png|right]]
The '''Union of European Theatres''' (UTE; {{lang-fr|Union des Théâtres de l'Europe}}) is an alliance of [[Europe]]an public [[theatre]]s. It serves to promote [[European integration]] through cultural interaction.
It does intensive transnational theatre work comprising over ten thousand performances and reaching three million viewers
each season. The UTE presents festivals, exhibitions, workshops, theatre school collaborations, colloquiums and co-productions throughout Europe. The Union des Théâtres de l'Europe has over 40 members, 20 of which are major national and municipal theatres from 17 countries.

== History ==

The UTE was founded in 1990 by [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], then Culture Minister of France, and Italian theatre director [[Giorgio Strehler]]. Apart from fostering European integration, their motivation also was the perceived threat to European [[cultural diversity]] posed by [[globalisation]]:

:"Already then we felt that the building of Europe required a firm stand against the unruly vagaries of the economic machine. Today we find ourselves faced with the same questions: how do we defend art within a [[market economy]] whose logistics are designed to [[Pensée unique|standardise our way of life and thought]] so that we are reduced to a state of passive [[consumerism]]? Can public policies that support the arts be more effective?"

== Mission ==

The UTE's stated mission is
:"to contribute to the building of the [[European Union]] through [[culture]] and [[theatre]], to encourage a collective cultural movement that breaks through language barriers in order to develop an art theatre which is seen as a vector of fraternity among people. The UTE promotes productions and co-productions, theatre exchanges and shared experiences while respecting individual identities and cultures. ... Etched in continuity, the sum of these activities helps in elucidating the objectives of artistic and cultural policies that aim to reinforce artistic cooperation and transnational circulation in Europe."

The UTE is a “multinational house”, an idea which corresponds to the so-called “Mehrspartenhaus” in German Theatre – that is, one major theatre with different departments, and in the case of the UTE one theatre that consists of seventeen national theatres but yet remains a single entity. This “multinational house” intensively discusses the questions of a European identity and the role of culture in its formation. Its goal is to promote cultural activities across national borders that respect the principles of the particular identities, a thing that requires common and continuous research. Its current programme focuses on projects that put new working methods to the test and connects experienced theatre creators with enthusiastic newcomers, projects which are close to the citizens of the different European cities, and all this on a long-term scale.

== Members and structure ==

The UTE is governed by a General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;http://www.union-theatres-europe.eu/UNIQ145760068806842/ute_general_assemblies&lt;/ref&gt; and a board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.union-theatres-europe.eu/UNIQ145760068806842/ute&lt;/ref&gt;

The president is Gábor Tompa, artistic and general director of the Hungarian Theatre of Cluj, Romania.

Today the UTE has 19 member theatres&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.union-theatres-europe.eu/UNIQ145760068806842/theatres|title=U.T.E. : Theatres|website=www.union-theatres-europe.eu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 15 European countries and beyond:

'''WikiToLearn''' is a collaborative, international, free knowledge project, run entirely by volunteers, and dedicated to the creation of [[Open textbooks|free]] and accessible textbooks for higher education. In December 2013 it joined the [[KDE]] Project through its incubation process with multiple sponsors like [[Wikimedia Italia]].

}}

== History ==
WikiToLearn started as WikiFM in [[Milan]] by a group of science students from the [[University of Milan Bicocca]] on the May 1, 2012. WikiFM was originally launched as a private wiki for exchange of links, suggestions and other information related to studying at the University of Milan Bicocca.

In May 2013 the website has been publicly announced using some money destined to student associations of the University of Milan Bicocca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikifm.org/2013/05/wikifm-cambia-faccia/ |title=WikiFM cambia faccia! &amp;#124; WikiFM blog |publisher=Blog.wikifm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-12}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this historical reason, while the project has an international aim, the bulk of the oldest content is in Italian.

In September 2013 WikiFM received the sponsorship of [[Wikimedia Italia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikifm.org/2013/10/wikifm-patrocinio-wikimedia-italia/ |title=WikiFM patrocinato da Wikimedia Italia! &amp;#124; WikiFM blog |publisher=Blog.wikifm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-12}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, WikiFM officially joined the [[KDE]] project, by entering, as first project, [[KDE]]'s incubator program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-community/2013q4/000375.html|title=[kde-community] Incubating project|work=kde.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://community.kde.org/Incubator/Projects/WikiFM&lt;/ref&gt; It was later advertised by the [[KDE]] project as one of its most important success stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dot.kde.org/2015/08/17/another-kde-success-story-incubator-part-1|title=Another KDE success story - the Incubator - Part 1|work=KDE.news|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From WikiFM to WikiToLearn  ==
2015 has been the turning point for the project. The key event happened during [[KDE]]’s annual conference, Akademy. In July 2015, Riccardo Iaconelli has given a speech on the WikiFM project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://conf.kde.org/en/akademy2015/public/events/272|title=akademy2015: Akademy 2015 Program|work=kde.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to submit it to the attention of the international community. On this occasion, the website has enriched to accommodate multiple languages, to embrace a larger number of people using their native language.
Following the initial feedback, WikiFM was subsequently renamed to WikiToLearn. The project thus started to gather a more official attention from educational institutions. The first foundation interested in using WikiToLearn as a training/tutoring platform has been the High Energy Physics Software Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hepsoftwarefoundation.org|title=The HEP Software Foundation|work=hepsoftwarefoundation.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which experimentally tried its own section on the English website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikitolearn.org/Hep_Software_Foundation|title=Hep Software Foundation|work=wikitolearn.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikitolearn.org/Hep_Software_Foundation/Philosophy_of_this_site|title=Hep Software Foundation/Philosophy of this site - WikiToLearn - collaborative textbooks|work=wikitolearn.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several professors from different institutions have subsequently started to collaborate on WikiToLearn, like [[CERN]], HSF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/2015/11/04/training.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fermilab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikitolearn.org/Contributing_to_WikiToLearn/Uni_list|title=Contributing to WikiToLearn/Uni list - WikiToLearn - collaborative textbooks|work=wikitolearn.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2015, the University of Milano-Bicocca became the first institution to officially back  the project, asking professors and students to populate the portal with educational content.

== The project ==
The goal of WikiToLearn is to provide free, collaborative and accessible textbooks for the whole world, with a focus on training and didactics. To reach this goal, the project relies on the combined effort of many volunteers in the academic world.

Content are written by both students, who ideally start to create textbooks while studying the subject in question, and professors, who provide thorough fact-checking and accuracy.

Given the deep technical nature of the topics, there is a complex review and rating system under review  to try to measure the quality of the individual articles.&lt;ref&gt;https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/wikitolearn/attachments/20150831/67d000be/attachment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14441">'''William Kurtz Wimsatt Jr.''' (November 17, 1907 – December 17, 1975) was an American professor of English, literary theorist, and critic. Wimsatt is often associated with the concept of the [[intentional fallacy]], which he developed with [[Monroe Beardsley]] in order to discuss the importance of an author's intentions for the creation of a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;Wimsatt, William K. and Monroe C. Beardsley. "The Intentional Fallacy." Sewanee Review, vol. 54 (1946): 468-488. Revised and republished in The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry, U of Kentucky P, 1954: 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Wimsatt was born in [[Washington D.C.]], attended [[Georgetown University]] and, later, [[Yale University]], where he received his [[Ph.D.]] In 1939, Wimsatt joined the English department at Yale, where he taught until his death in 1975. During his lifetime, Wimsatt became known for his studies of eighteenth-century literature (Leitch et al. 1372). He wrote many works of [[literary theory]] and [[criticism]] such as ''The Prose Style of Samuel Johnson'' (1941) and ''Philosophic Words: A Study of Style and Meaning in the "Rambler" and "Dictionary" of [[Samuel Johnson]]'' (1948; Leitch et al. 1372). His major works include ''The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry'' (1954); ''Hateful Contraries'' (1965) and ''Literary Criticism: A Short History'' (1957, with [[Cleanth Brooks]]). Wimsatt was considered crucial to [[New Criticism]] (particularly New [[Formalism (literature)|Formalist]] Criticism; 1372). He was a member of the [[Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

== Influences ==
Wimsatt was influenced by [[Monroe Beardsley]], with whom he wrote some of his most important pieces. Wimsatt also drew on the work of both ancient critics, such as [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] and [[Aristotle]], and some of his own contemporaries, such as [[T. S. Eliot]] and the writers of the [[Chicago school (literary criticism)|Chicago School]], to formulate his theories, often by highlighting key ideas in those authors' works in order to refute them.

== Influence ==

Wimsatt's ideas have affected the development of [[reader-response criticism]], and his influence has been noted in the works of writers such as [[Stanley Fish]], and in works such as [[Walter Benn Michaels]]' and [[Steven Knapp]]’s “Against Theory” (Leitch et al. 1373-1374).

== Approach ==

Wimsatt was interviewed, along with [[Walter J. Ong]], S.J., of [[Saint Louis University]], by Sheila Hough on the 327th edition of the radio talk-show Yale Reports, broadcast on May 24, 1964, by WTIC-Hartford. (Professor Wimsatt had received an honorary doctorate from [[Saint Louis University]] in 1963.) Ms. Hough asked Professor Wimsatt a question that still resonates today: "Is literature taught in complete isolation from its author, Mr. Wimsatt -- don't you consider the person who wrote it?"

Wimsatt replied: "I do, of course. Your question, I think, was prompted by that very fine essay of Father Ong's, 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn,' which you read in his book ''The Barbarian Within'' [1962: 15-25]. It first appeared in ''Essays in Criticism'' at Oxford some years ago [1954], and was in part, I believe, an answer to an essay written many years ago, about twenty at least, by a friend of mine, [[Monroe Beardsley]], and myself, called 'The Intentional Fallacy.' I would like to pay Father Ong the compliment of saying that I think that his essay 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn' is the only sensible response that has ever been written to that essay of ours."

As a staunch [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] critic, Wimsatt believed in the authority of the poem: any analysis of a poem must centre on the text itself (Leitch et al. 1371-1372). He outlines and advocates (particularly in his two influential essays written with [[Monroe Beardsley]], “[[intentional fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]” and “[[affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]”) an “objective criticism” in which the critic essentially disregards the intentions of the poet and the effect of the poem on the audience as the sole (or even the major) factors in analyzing and evaluating a poem (Davis and Schleifer 43).

Wimsatt does allow for a certain degree of variation in the analysis of poetry and does not necessarily contend that there is only one possible reading for any given poem. He allows, for example, for what he calls the “literary sense” of meaning, saying that “no two different words or different phrases ever mean fully the same” (Verbal Icon xii).

Much of his theory, however, appears to stem from an ambivalence towards "[[impressionism]], [[subjectivism]], and relativism” (Leitch et al. 1373) in criticism. In ''Hateful Contraries'', Wimsatt refers to a “New Amateurism,” an “anti-criticism” emerging in works such as [[Leslie Fiedler]]’s “Credo,” which appeared in the ''[[Kenyon Review]]''. “The only reservation the theorist need have about such critical impressionism or expressionism,” says Wimsatt, “is that, after all, it does not carry on very far in our cogitation about the nature and value of literature…it is not a very mature form of cognitive discourse” (''Hateful Contraries'' xvi).

Indeed, Wimsatt is concerned with ensuring a level of legitimacy in English studies and he sets about doing so by favouring a scientific approach to criticism—even, for example, decrying affective theory as “less a scientific view of literature than a prerogative -- that of a soul adventuring among masterpieces” (''Verbal Icon'' 29).

== Theories ==

Wimsatt contributed several theories to the critical landscape, particularly through his major work, ''The Verbal Icon'' (of which some of the ideas are discussed below). His ideas generally centre around the same questions tackled by many critics: what is poetry and how does one evaluate it?

=== Intentional fallacy ===
{{main|Intentional fallacy}}

Perhaps Wimsatt’s most influential theories come from the essays “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (both are published in ''Verbal Icon'') which he wrote with [[Monroe Beardsley]]. Each of these texts “codifies a crucial tenet of New Critical formalist orthodoxy,” making them both very important to twentieth-century criticism (Leitch et al. 1371).

The [[Intentional Fallacy]], according to Wimsatt, derives from “confusion between the poem and its origins” (''Verbal Icon'' 21) – essentially, it occurs when a critic puts too much emphasis on personal, biographical, or what he calls “external” information when analyzing a work (they note that this is essentially the same as the “[[Genetic fallacy]]” in philosophical studies; 21). Wimsatt and Beardsley consider this strategy a fallacy partly because it is impossible to determine the intention of the author — indeed, authors themselves are often unable to determine the “intention” of a poem — and partly because a poem, as an act that takes place between a poet and an audience, has an existence outside of both and thus its meaning can not be evaluated simply based on the intentions of or the effect on either the writer or the audience(see the section of this article entitled “The Affective Fallacy" for a discussion of the latter; 5). For Wimsatt and Beardsley, intentional criticism becomes subjective criticism, and so ceases to be criticism at all. For them, critical inquiries are resolved through evidence in and of the text — not “by consulting the oracle” (18).

=== Affective fallacy ===
{{main|Affective fallacy}}

The Affective fallacy (identified in the essay of the same name, which Wimsatt co-authored with [[Monroe Beardsley]], as above) refers to “confusion between the poem and its ''results''” (''Verbal Icon 21''; italics in original). It refers to the error of placing too much emphasis on the effect that a poem has on its audience when analyzing it.

Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley|Beardsley]] argue that the effect of poetic language alone is an unreliable way to analyze poetry because, they contend, words have no effect in and of themselves, independent of their meaning. It is impossible, then, for a poem to be “pure emotion” (38), which means that a poem’s meaning is not “equivalent to its effects, especially its emotional impact, on the reader” (Leitch et al. 1371).

As with the Intentional fallacy, engaging in affective criticism is too subjective an exercise to really warrant the label “criticism” at all — thus, for Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley|Beardsley]], it is a fallacy of analysis.

=== Concrete Universal ===

In “The Concrete Universal,” Wimsatt attempts to determine how specific or general (i.e., concrete or universal) a verbal representation must be in order to achieve a particular effect. What is the difference, for example, between referring to a “purple cow” and a “tan cow with a broken horn” (''Verbal Icon'' 74)? In addressing such questions, Wimsatt attempts to resolve what it is that makes [[poetry]] different from other forms of communication, concluding that “what distinguishes poetry from scientific or logical discourse is a degree of concreteness which does not contribute anything to the argument but is somehow enjoyable or valuable for its own sake.” For Wimsatt, poetry is “the vehicle of a metaphor which one boards heedless of where it runs, whether cross-town or downtown — just for the ride” (76).

=== The Domain of Criticism ===

In “The Domain of Criticism,” Wimsatt “[defends] the domain of poetry and poetics from the encircling (if friendly) arm of the general [[aesthetics|aesthetician]]" (''Verbal Icon'' 221) – that is, he discusses the problems with discussing poetry in purely [[aesthetic]] terms. Wimsatt questions the ability of a poem to function aesthetically in the same way as a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]]. For one, visual modes such as sculpture or painting are undertaken using materials that directly correlate with the object they represent — at least in terms of their “beauty.” A beautiful painting of an apple, for example, is done with beautiful paint.

Verbal expression, however, does not function this way — as Wimsatt points out, there is no such thing as a “beautiful” or “ugly” word (or, at least, there is no general consensus as to how to apply such concepts in such a context; 228). There is no correlation between words and their subject, at least in terms of [[aesthetics]] — “the example of the dunghill (or equivalent object) beautifully described is one of the oldest in literary discussion” (228).

More importantly, language does not function merely on the level of its effects on the senses, as (for example) visual modes do. A poem does not just derive its meaning from its [[rhyme]] and meter, but these are the domains of [[aesthetics]] (231) — to analyse [[poetry]] on the basis of its [[aesthetics]], then, is insufficient in one is to adequately explore its meaning.

== Major works ==

=== ''The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry'' ===

Written as a series of independent essays between 1941 and 1952, ''The Verbal Icon'' was finally published as a cohesive work (after Wimsatt revised some of the original versions) in 1954. Probably his most influential work, ''The Verbal Icon'' contains two of Wimsatt's most important essays, “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (co-authored with [[Monroe Beardsley]]). Paul de Man offers a significant critique of Wimsatt's text, taken as an example of the understanding of the notion of 'autonomy' in New Criticism, in ''Blindness and Insight''.

=== ''Hateful Contraries: Studies in Literature and Criticism'' ===

Apparently concerned with the (admittedly lessened) influence of what he calls “Amateur Criticism,” Wimsatt published ''Hateful Contraries'' in 1965 as a way to “distinguish what [he] consider[s] an inevitable and proper literary interest in the contraries” (Hateful Contraries xviii). Through studies of works by T. S. Eliot as well as discussions of topics such as “The Augustan Mode in English Poetry” and “The Criticism of Comedy” (xi), Wimsatt attempts to add to the efforts to justify and improve [[literary criticism]] (xix).

=== ''Literary Criticism: A Short History'' ===

Written with [[Cleanth Brooks]] in 1957, ''Literary Criticism: A Short History'' is intended as “a history of ideas about verbal art and about its elucidation and criticism” (Wimsatt and Brooks ix). The authors attempt to contribute to the “intelligibility in the history of literary argument” as well as “contributes to a distinct point of view,” which, they argue, is a necessary part of any historical literary studies (vii).
