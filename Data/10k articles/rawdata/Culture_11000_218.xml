'''Allan David Bloom''' (September 14, 1930 &amp;ndash; October 7, 1992) was an American [[philosopher]], [[classicist]], and [[academician]]. He studied under [[David Grene]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Richard McKeon]], and [[Alexandre Kojève]]. He subsequently taught at [[Cornell University]], the [[University of Toronto]], [[Yale University]], [[École Normale Supérieure]] of Paris, and the [[University of Chicago]]. Bloom championed the idea of [[Great Books]] education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American [[higher education]], with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

''Giants and Dwarfs: Essays 1960–1990'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990 pp.17-18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Bellow]] wrote ''[[Ravelstein]]'', a [[roman à clef]] based on Bloom, his friend and colleague at the University of Chicago.

==Early life and education==
Allan Bloom was born in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]], in 1930 to [[Second-generation immigrants in the United States|second-generation]] Jewish parents who were both [[social workers]]. The couple had a daughter, Lucille, two years earlier. As a thirteen-year-old, Bloom read a ''[[Readers Digest]]'' article about the [[University of Chicago]] and told his parents he wanted to attend; his parents thought it was unreasonable and did not encourage his hopes.&lt;ref name= atlas&gt;Atlas, James. "Chicago's Grumpy Guru: Best-Selling Professor Allan Bloom and the Chicago Intellectuals." ''New York Times Magazine''.  January 3, 1988. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, when his family moved to Chicago in 1944, his parents met a [[psychiatrist]] and family friend whose son was enrolled in the University of Chicago's [[humanities]] program for gifted students. In 1946, Bloom was accepted to the same program, starting his degree at the age of fifteen, and spending the next decade of his life enrolled at the University in Chicago's [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name= atlas/&gt; This began his lifelong passion for the 'idea' of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Allan. 1987. ''The Closing of the American Mind'', p. 243. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface to ''Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960–1990'', he stated that his education "began with [[Freud]] and ended with [[Plato]]". The theme of this education was self-knowledge, or self-discovery—an idea that Bloom would later write, seemed impossible to conceive of for a Midwestern American boy. He credits [[Leo Strauss]] as the teacher who made this endeavor possible for him.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Allan. 1991.  ''Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960–1990'', p. 11. New York: Touchstone Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom graduated from the University of Chicago with a [[bachelor's degree]] at the age of 18.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;Botsworth, Keith. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-allan-bloom-1556931.html  'Obituary: Professor Allan Bloom', ''The Independent'', October 12, 1992].&lt;/ref&gt; One of his college classmates was the classicist Seth Benardete.&lt;ref&gt;http://contemporarythinkers.org/allan-bloom/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; For post-graduate studies, he enrolled in the University of Chicago's [[Committee on Social Thought]], where he was assigned [[classicist]] [[David Grene]] as tutor. Bloom went on to write his thesis on [[Isocrates]]. Grene recalled Bloom as an energetic and humorous student completely dedicated to studying classics, but with no definite career ambitions.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; The Committee was a unique [[interdisciplinary]] program that attracted a small number of students due to its rigorous academic requirements and lack of clear employment opportunities after graduation.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; Bloom earned his Ph.D. from the Committee on Social Thought in 1955. He subsequently studied under the influential [[Hegelian]] philosopher [[Alexandre Kojève]] in [[Paris]], whose lectures Bloom would later introduce to the English-speaking world. While teaching philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, he befriended [[Raymond Aron]], amongst many other philosophers. Among the American expatriate community in Paris his friends included writer [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Field, ''The Man Who Would Marry Susan Sontag'', Wisconsin, 2005, pp. 158–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Rollyson and L. Paddock, ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'', W. W. Norton, 2000, pp. 45–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Reborn: Journals and Notebooks 1947–1963'', ed. D. Rieff, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2008, pp. 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom studied and taught in Paris (1953–55) at the [[École Normale Supérieure]],&lt;ref&gt;Strauss had sent Bloom to Paris without sufficient funding, and when Bloom was broke he sold his books to [[Ernest Fortin]], a young Catholic priest doing graduate studies there.  Father Fortin reported that this forced-purchase of Strauss' works was his introduction to Strauss.  J. Brian Benestad, ed., ''Human Rights, Virtue, and the Common Good: Untimely Meditations on Religion and Politics'', at 317 (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany (1957). Upon returning to the United States in 1955, he taught adult education students at the University of Chicago with his friend Werner J. Dannhauser, author of ''Nietzsche's View of Socrates''. Bloom went on to teach at [[Yale University|Yale]] from 1960 to 1963, at [[Cornell University|Cornell]] until 1970, and at the [[University of Toronto]] until 1979, when he returned to the University of Chicago. Among Bloom's former students are prominent journalists, government officials and political scientists such as [[Francis Fukuyama]], Robert Kraynak, Pierre Hassner, [[Clifford Orwin]], [[Janet Ajzenstat]], [[John Ibbitson]], and [[John Milligan-Whyte]].

In 1963, as a professor at Cornell, Allan Bloom served as a faculty member of the [[Cornell Branch of the Telluride Association|Cornell Branch]] of the [[Telluride Association]], an organization focused on intellectual development and self-governance. The students received free room and board in the [[Telluride House]] on the [[Cornell University]] campus and assumed the management of the house themselves. While living at the house, Bloom befriended former U.S. Secretary of Labor [[Frances Perkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Downey|first1=Kirstin|title=The Woman Behind the New Deal: The Life of Frances Perkins, FDR's Secretary of Labor and His Moral Conscience|date=2009|publisher=Nan A. Talese/Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-51365-4|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom's first book was a collection of three essays on Shakespeare's plays, ''[[Shakespeare's Politics]]''; it included an essay from [[Harry V. Jaffa]]. He translated and commented upon Rousseau's "[[Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles|Letter to M. D'Alembert on the Theater]]", bringing it into dialogue with [[Plato's Republic|Plato's ''Republic'']]. In 1968, he published his most significant work of philosophical translation and interpretation, a translation of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. Bloom strove to achieve "translation ... for the serious student".  The preface opens on page xi with the statement, "this is intended to be a literal translation."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Allan. 1968 (2nd ed 1991). ''The Republic of Plato''. (translated, with notes and an interpretive essay, by Bloom). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2013}} Although the translation is not universally accepted, Bloom said he always conceptualized the translator's role as a matchmaker between readers and the texts he translated.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Allan. 1991.

New York: Touchstone Books&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2013}} He repeated this effort as a professor of political science at the University of Toronto in 1978, translating [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]''. Among other publications during his years of teaching was a reading of Swift's ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', titled "Giants and Dwarfs"; it became the title for a collection of essays on, among others, [[Raymond Aron]], [[Alexandre Kojève]], [[Leo Strauss]], and liberal philosopher [[John Rawls]]. Bloom was an editor for the scholarly journal ''[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]]'' as well as a contributor to ''[[History of Political Philosophy]]'' (edited by [[Joseph Cropsey]] and Leo Strauss).

After returning to Chicago, he befriended and taught courses with [[Saul Bellow]]. In 1987 Bellow wrote the preface to ''The Closing of the American Mind''.

Bloom's last book, which he dictated while in the hospital dying, and which was published posthumously, was ''Love and Friendship'', an offering of interpretations on the meaning of love. There is an ongoing controversy over Bloom's semi-closeted homosexuality, possibly culminating, as in Saul Bellow's thinly fictionalized account in [[Ravelstein]], in his death in 1992 from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom's homosexuality

Bloom's work is not easily categorized, yet there is a thread that links all of his published material. He was concerned with preserving a philosophical way of life for future generations. He strove to do this through both scholarly and popular writing. His writings may be placed into two categories: [[scholarly]] (e.g., ''[[Plato's Republic]]'') and popular political commentary (e.g., ''The Closing of the American Mind''). On the surface, this is a valid distinction, yet closer examinations of Bloom's works reveal a direct connection between the two types of expression, which reflect his view of [[philosophy]] and the role of the [[philosopher]] in political life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===''The Republic of Plato''===
Bloom's translation and essay on the ''Republic'' is radically different in many important aspects from the previous translations and interpretations of the ''Republic''. Most notable is Bloom's discussion of [[Socratic irony]]. In fact, [[irony]] is the key to Bloom's take on the ''Republic'' (see his discussion of Books II–VI of the ''Republic''.) Allan Bloom says a philosopher is immune to irony because he can see the [[tragic]] as [[comic]] and comic as tragic. Bloom refers to Socrates, the philosopher ''par excellence,'' in his Interpretative Essay stating, "Socrates can go naked where others go clothed; he is not afraid of ridicule. He can also contemplate sexual intercourse where others are stricken with terror; he is not afraid of moral indignation. In other words he treats the comic seriously and the tragic lightly".&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Allan. 1968. ''The Republic of Plato'', "Interpretative Essay," p. 387. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; Thus irony in the ''Republic'' refers to the "Just City in Speech", which Bloom looks at not as a model for future [[society]], nor as a template for the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]; rather, it is a city presented ironically, an example of the distance between philosophy and every potential philosopher. Bloom follows Strauss in suggesting that the "Just City in Speech" is not [[nature|natural]]; it is man-made.

''The Closing of the American Mind'' was published in 1987, five years after Bloom published an essay in ''[[National Review]]'' about the failure of universities to serve the needs of students. With the encouragement of [[Saul Bellow]], his colleague at the University of Chicago, he expanded his thoughts into a book "about a life I've led",&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; that critically reflected on the current state of higher education in American universities. His friends and admirers imagined the work would be a modest success, as did Bloom, who recognized his publisher's modest advance to complete the project as a lack of sales confidence. Yet on the momentum of strong initial reviews, including one by [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and an op-ed piece by syndicated conservative commentator [[George Will]] titled, "A How-To Book for the Independent"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73836608.html?dids=73836608:73836608&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jul+30%2C+1987&amp;author=George+F.+Will&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=a.19&amp;desc=A+How-To+Book+for+the+Independent | title = A How-To Book for the Independent | first = George F | last= Will | date= July 30, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback and remaining at number one on ''[[The New York Times Bestseller List]]'' for nonfiction for four months.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, William. "The Story behind the Best Seller: Allan Bloom's Closing of the American Mind." Publishers Weekly. July 3, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom's ''The Closing of the American Mind'' is a critique of the contemporary university and how Bloom sees it as failing its students.  In it, Bloom criticizes the modern movements in philosophy and the humanities.  Philosophy professors involved in [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language analysis]] or [[logical positivism]] disregard important "humanizing" ethical and political issues and fail to pique the interest of students.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Allan. 1987. ''The Closing of the American Mind'', p. 278. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;  Literature professors involved in [[deconstructionism]] promote irrationalism and skepticism of standards of truth and thereby dissolve the moral imperatives which are communicated through genuine philosophy and which elevate and broaden the intellects of those who engage with them.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Allan. 1987. ''The Closing of the American Mind'', p. 279. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt;  To a great extent, Bloom's criticism revolves around his belief that the "great books" of [[Western thought]] have been devalued as a source of wisdom. Bloom's critique extends beyond the university to speak to the general crisis in American society. ''The Closing of the American Mind'' draws analogies between the [[United States]] and the [[Weimar Republic]]. The modern liberal philosophy, he says, enshrined in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought of [[John Locke]]—that a just society could be based upon self-interest alone, coupled by the emergence of relativism in American thought—had led to this crisis.

For Bloom, this created a void in the souls of Americans, into which demagogic radicals as exemplified by 1960s student leaders could leap. (In the same fashion, Bloom suggests, that the [[Nazism|Nazi]] brownshirts once filled the gap created in German society by the [[Weimar Republic]].) In the second instance, he argued, the higher calling of philosophy and reason understood as [[freedom of thought]], had been eclipsed by a pseudo-philosophy, or an [[ideology]] of thought. [[Relativism]] was one feature of modern liberal philosophy that had subverted the Platonic–Socratic teaching.

Bloom's critique of contemporary [[social movements]] at play in universities or society at large is derived from his classical and philosophical orientation. For Bloom, the failure of contemporary [[liberal education]] leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory.

In one chapter, in a style of analysis which resembles the work of the [[Frankfurt School]], he examined the philosophical effects of [[popular music]] on the lives of students, placing pop music, or as it is generically branded by record companies "rock music", in a historical context from ''Plato's Republic'' to [[Nietzsche]]'s [[Dionysian]] longings. Treating it for the first time with genuine philosophical interest, he gave fresh attention to the industry, its target-marketing to children and teenagers, its top performers, its place in our late-capitalist bourgeois economy, and its pretensions to [[Liberty|liberation]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].  Some critics, including the popular musician [[Frank Zappa]], argued that Bloom's view of pop music was based on the same ideas that critics of pop "in 1950s held, ideas about the preservation of 'traditional' white American society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zappa |first=Frank |title=On Junk Food for the Soul |journal=New Perspective's Quarterly |year=1987 |url=http://home.online.no/~corneliu/npq.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208153310/http://home.online.no/~corneliu/npq.htm |archivedate=2006-12-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom, informed by [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]], [[Rousseau]], and Nietzsche, explores music's power over the human soul. He cites the [[soldier]] who throws himself into battle at the urging of the [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum corps]], the pious believer who prays under the spell of a religious [[hymn]], the lover seduced by the romantic [[guitar]], and points towards the tradition of philosophy that treated musical education as paramount. He names the pop-star [[Mick Jagger]] as a cardinal representative of the hypocrisy and erotic sterility of pop-rock music. Pop music employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young and to persuade them that their petty rebelliousness is authentic politics, when, in fact, they are being controlled by the money-managers whom successful performers like Jagger quietly serve. Bloom claims that Jagger is a [[hero]] to many university students who envy his fame and wealth but are really just bored by the lack of options before them.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Allan. "Music" pp. 68–81. ''The Closing of the American Mind''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;   Along with the absence of literature in the lives of the young and their sexual but often unerotic relationships, the first part of ''The Closing'' tries to explain the current state of education in a fashion beyond the purview of an [[economist]] or [[psychiatrist]]—contemporary culture's leading umpires.

===Critical reception===
The book met with early critical acclaim including positive reviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. A second round of reviews was generally more critical.&lt;ref name="weeklystandard.com"&gt;{{citation | last = Ferguson | first = Andrew | title = The Book That Drove Them Crazy | journal = The Weekly Standard | date = April 9, 2012 | accessdate = May 19, 2013 | url = http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/book-drove-them-crazy_634905.html?nopager=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal commentator [[Martha Nussbaum]], a [[political philosopher]] and [[classicist]], and [[Harry V. Jaffa]], a conservative, both argued that Bloom was deeply influenced by 19th-century European philosophers, especially [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].  Nussbaum wrote that, for Bloom, Nietzsche had been disastrously influential in modern American thought.&lt;ref name = "Nussbaum"&gt;Nussbaum, Martha. "Undemocratic Vistas," ''New York Review of Books'' 34, no. 17 (November 5, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a passage of her review, Nussbaum wrote: "How good a philosopher, then, is Allan Bloom? The answer is, we cannot say, and we are given no reason to think him one at all."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt; The criticism of the book was continued by impassioned reviews of political theorist [[Benjamin Barber]] in ''[[Harper's]]''; [[Alexander Nehamas]], a scholar of ancient philosophy and Nietzsche, in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''; and [[David Rieff]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news

The book, he said, was one that "decent people would be ashamed of having written." The tone of these reviews led James Atlas in the ''New York Times Magazine'' to conclude "the responses to Bloom's book have been charged with a hostility that transcends the usual mean-spiritedness of reviewers."&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; One reviewer, the philosopher [[Robert Paul Wolff]] writing in the scholarly journal ''[[Academe]]'', satirically reviewed the book as a work of fiction: he claimed that Bloom's friend [[Saul Bellow]], who had written the introduction, had written a "coruscatingly funny novel in the form of a pettish, bookish, grumpy, reactionary complaint against the last two decades", with the "author" a "mid-fiftyish professor at the University of Chicago, to whom Bellow gives the evocative name 'Bloom.'"&lt;ref name = "NYT2" /&gt; Yet some reviewers tempered that criticism with an admission of the merits of Bloom's writing: for example, Fred Matthews, an historian from [[York University]], began an otherwise relatively critical review in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' with the statement that Bloom's "probes into popular culture" were "both amusing and perceptive" and that the work was "a rich, often brilliant, and disturbing book".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = The American Historical Review | author = Matthews, Fred | title = The Attack on 'Historicism': Allan Bloom's Indictment of Contemporary American Historical Scholarship  |volume = 95 | number = 2 |date=Apr 1990 | pages = 429–447 | url = https://www.jstor.org/pss/2163758 | accessdate = May 19, 2013 | doi=10.2307/2163758}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics embraced Bloom's argument. [[Norman Podhoretz]] noted that the closed-mindedness in the title refers to the paradoxical consequence of the academic "open mind" found in liberal political thought—namely "the narrow and intolerant dogmatism" that dismisses any attempt, by Plato or the Hebrew Bible for example, to provide a rational basis for moral judgments. Podhoretz continued, "Bloom goes on to charge liberalism with vulgarizing the noble ideals of freedom and equality, and he offers brilliantly acerbic descriptions of the sexual revolution and the feminist movement, which he sees as products of this process of vulgarization."&lt;ref&gt;Podhoretz, Norman. "Conservative Book Becomes a Best-Seller." ''Human Events'' July 11, 1987: 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1989 article, Ann Clark Fehn discusses the critical reception of the book, noting that it had eclipsed other titles that year dealing with higher education—Ernest Boyer's ''College'' and E. D. Hirsch's ''Cultural Literacy''—and quoting ''Publishers Weekly'' which had described Bloom's book as a "best-seller made by reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Fehn, Ann Clark | journal = The German Quarterly | volume = 62 | number = 3 | title = Focus: Literature since 1945 |date=Summer 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Camille Paglia]], a decade after the book's release, called it "the first shot in the culture wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

''Understanding Power''. Mitchell, Peter R. and John Schoeffel (eds.), New York: The New Press, 2002. p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an early ''[[The New York Times]]'' review by [[Roger Kimball]] called the book "an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today's intellectual and moral climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The New York Times | author = Kimball, Roger |title = The Groves of Ignorance | accessdate = May 19, 2013  | date = April 5, 1987 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/books/the-groves-of-ignorance.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on Bloom for ''[[The New Republic]]'' in 2000, conservative commentator [[Andrew Sullivan]] wrote that "reading [Bloom] ... one feels he has not merely understood Nietzsche; he has imbibed him. But this awareness of the abyss moved Bloom, unlike Nietzsche, toward love and political conservatism. Love, whether for the truth or for another, because it can raise us out of the abyss. Political conservatism because it best restrains the chaos that modernity threatens".&lt;ref name = "Longing 2000"&gt;''Longing: Remembering Allan Bloom'', The New Republic, April 17, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Bloom's book also received a more positive re-assessment from [[Jim Sleeper]] in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="sleeper"/&gt;

[[Keith Botsford]] would later argue:

{{quote|Bloom was writing vigorous polemic at a time when America sought to ensure that the intellect could not (and would not be allowed to) rise above gender and race; the mind was to be defined by its melanin and genetic content, and by what lay between our legs; or, in the academe, the canon was to be re-read and re-defined so that it fitted the latest theorem of gender or race. Bloom would have none of it. He loved people who were first-rate with real love ...  Many profited. Others, mainly dwellers in the bas fonds of 'social studies', or those who seek to politicise culture, resented and envied.&lt;ref name = "independent.co.uk" /&gt;}}

==''Love and Friendship''==
Bloom's last book, which he dictated while partially paralyzed and in hospital, and which was published posthumously, was ''Love and Friendship''. The book offered interpretations on the meaning of love, through a reading of novels by [[Stendhal]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]]; [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] in light of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau's]] influence on the [[Romantic movement]]; plays by [[William Shakespeare]]; [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne's]] ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]''; and [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''.

Describing its creation, Bellow wrote:

{{quote|Allan was an academic, but he was a literary man too&amp;nbsp;— he had too much intelligence and versatility, too much humanity, to be confined to a single category ... He didn't like these helpful-to-the-sick cliches or conventional get-well encouragements ... [S]till partially paralyzed and unable even to sign his name, he dictated a book ... I mention this because it was a remarkable thing for a sick man and a convalescent to do and because it was equally remarkable that a political philosopher should choose at such a moment in his life to write about literature ... I like to think that his free and powerful intelligence, responding to great inner impulses under the stimulus of life-threatening sickness, turned to the nineteenth-century novel, to Shakespeare's love plays, and to the Platonic Eros, summoning us to the great poetry of affects and asking us to see what has happened to our own deepest feelings in this age of artificial euphorias.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Bellow, ''It All Adds Up'' (Penguin, 2007), pp. 277–79.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of the work, Andrew Sullivan wrote "you cannot read &lt;nowiki&gt;[Bloom]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' or ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' without seeing those works in a new light. You cannot read his account of Rousseau's ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|La nouvelle Heloise]]'' without wanting to go back and read it—more closely—again ... Bloom had a gift for reading reality—the impulse to put your loving face to it and press your hands against it".&lt;ref name="Longing 2000" /&gt; Recollecting his friend in an interview, Bellow said "Allan inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air ... People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled. When critics proclaim the death of the novel, I sometimes think they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. [But] Allan was certainly one."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/15/fiction | title = The wordly mystic's late bloom | first = James | last = Wood | newspaper = The Guardian | location = UK | date = April 14, 2000| accessdate = May 19, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are distinguished from [[Eurogame]]s (German-style board games) in that American-style games often have longer playtimes and mechanics designed to suit the theme.&lt;ref&gt;[https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Ameritrash "Ameritrash" on the BoardGameGeek wiki], BoardGameGeek contributors.

Not all games from the [[United States]] fall under this category; [[party game]]s and family games with simpler rulesets are usually not included.

These games are sometimes referred to as '''Ameritrash''', which is used occasionally as a term of affection by some people, and a pejorative by others.  The terms '''Amerigame''' and '''Thematic Game''' do not carry negative connotations, and are preferred terms.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12009728 "German recreation: An affinity for rules?"] ''The Economist'', August 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[BoardGameGeek]] cites "''[[Axis &amp; Allies]]'', ''[[Dune (board game)|Dune]]'', ''[[Cosmic Encounter]]'', ''[[Talisman (board game)|Talisman]]'', and ''[[Twilight Imperium]]''" as classic Ameritrash titles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Glossary BoardGameGeek glossary], BoardGameGeek.

[[File:Servian Wall-Termini Station.jpg|thumb|Section of the [[Servian Wall]]]]
[[File:Muralla romana de Lugo.JPG|thumb|Section of the [[Roman walls of Lugo]], Spain, 263-276 AD]]
Defensive walls are a feature of [[ancient Roman architecture]].  The Romans generally fortified cities, rather than building stand-alone fortresses, but there are some fortified camps, such as the [[Saxon Shore#The forts|Saxon Shore forts]] like [[Portus Adurni|Porchester Castle]] in England.  City walls were already significant in [[Etruscan architecture]], and in the struggle for control of Italy under the early Republic many more were built, using different techniques.  These included tightly-fitting massive irregular polygonal blocks, shaped to fit exactly in a way reminiscent of later [[Inca]] work. The Romans called a simple rampart wall an [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]]; at this date great height was not necessary. The [[Servian Wall]] around Rome was an ambitious project of the early 4th century BC. The wall was up to 10&amp;nbsp;metres (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft) in height in places, 3.6&amp;nbsp;metres (12&amp;nbsp;ft) wide at its base, 11&amp;nbsp;km (7&amp;nbsp;mi) long,&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Nic; Peter Dennis ''The Walls of Rome'' Osprey Publishing; 10 Mar 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-84603-198-4}} p.10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=SDxrLQymWWwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=height+servian+wall&amp;as_brr=3#PPA10,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to have had 16 main gates, though many of these are mentioned only from writings, with no other known remains.  Some of it had a ''fossa'' or ditch in front, and an agger behind, and it was enough to deter [[Hannibal]]. Later the [[Aurelian Wall]] replaced it, enclosing an expanded city, and using more sophisticated designs, with small forts at intervals.

The Romans walled major cities and towns in areas they saw as vulnerable, and parts of many walls remain incorporated in later defences, as at [[Roman walls of Córdoba|Córdoba]] (2nd century BC), [[Chester city walls|Chester]] (earth and wood in the 70s AD, stone from c. 100), and [[York city walls|York]] (from 70s AD).  Strategic walls [[Roman military frontiers and fortifications|defending the frontiers of the Empire]] by running across open country were far rarer, and [[Hadrian's Wall]] (from 122) and the [[Antonine Wall]] (from 142, abandoned only 8 years after completion) are the most significant examples, both on the [[Picts|Pictish]] frontier.  Most defences of the [[borders of the Roman Empire]] relied on [[limes|systems of forts and roads]] without attempting a continuous barrier.

Notable walls built by [[ancient Rome]] include, in chronological order of construction:

* [[Servian Wall]], built around Rome in the early 4th century BC
* [[Roman walls of Córdoba]]
* Colchester town walls, built after the [[Boudica | Boudiccan revolt]] c.65–80 A.D
* [[Chester city walls]], originating as part of the fortress of Deva Victrix between 70 and 80 AD
* [[York city walls]], originally constructed around 71 AD when York was a Roman colony
* [[Hadrian's Wall]], built in England beginning in 122 AD at the edge of Roman conquest to keep out the Scots
* [[Antonine Wall]], a short-lived, advanced frontier wall built in Scotland north of Hadrian's Wall beginning in 142 AD
* [[London Wall]], built around Londinium between 190 and 225, probably between 200 and 220
* [[Roman walls of Lugo]], built between 263 and 276 AD to defend the Roman town of Lucus Augusti (in what is now Spain)
* [[Aurelian Walls]], the later wall of Rome, built in the late 3rd century AD
* [[Walls of Constantinople]], a great defensive wall that defended the metropolitan capital from the fourth century AD until 1453
* [[Anastasian Wall]], a wall named built in the late 5th century to ensure extra defenses for Constantinople. It was not very effective, and was abandoned in the 7th century.
* [[Venta Silurum, Caerwent, Wales]], Venta Silurum was a town in the Roman province of Britannia. The walls are some of the best examples in the UK.

He represented [[Cape Breton (electoral district)|Cape Breton]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] from 1900 to 1904 as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] member.

He was born in [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]], the son of the Reverend S.F. Kendall. Kendall was educated at [[Mount Allison University|Mount Allison College]], Halifax Medical College, [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] Medical School in [[New York City]] and [[Guy's Hospital]] Medical School in [[London]].

The '''Assyrian homeland''' or '''Assyria''' ({{lang-syr|ܐܬܘܪ}}) refers to a [[historical region|geographic and cultural region]] situated in [[Northern Mesopotamia]] that has been traditionally inhabited by [[Assyrian people]]. The areas that form the Assyrian homeland are parts of present-day northern [[Iraq]], southeastern [[Turkey]], northwestern [[Iran]] and, more recently, northeastern [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Donabed |first=Sargon|title=Reforging a Forgotten History: Iraq and the Assyrians in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwLdCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18|year=2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-8605-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skutsch2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Carl Skutsch|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXYKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149 |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-19388-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the area that had the greatest concentration of Assyrians in the world [[Persecution of Christians by ISIL|until recently]] is located in the ''Assyrian Triangle'', a region which comprises the [[Nineveh plains]], southern [[Hakkari]] and the [[Barwari]] regions.&lt;ref name="War p. 70"&gt;The Origins of War: From the Stone Age to Alexander the Great By Arther Ferrill – p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; This is where some Assyrian groups [[Proposals for Assyrian autonomy in Iraq|seek to create an independent nation state]].&lt;ref&gt;Minorities in the Middle East: a history of struggle and self-expression By Mordechai Nisan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"/&gt;

The Assyrian homeland roughly mirrors the boundaries of ancient Assyria proper, and the later [[Achaemenid]], [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Roman empire|Roman]] and [[Sassanid]] provinces of Assyria ([[Athura]]/[[Assuristan]]) that was extant between the 25th century BC and 7th century AD. The region was dissolved as a geo-political entity following the [[Arab]] [[Islamic conquest of Persia#First conquest of Iraq (633)|Islamic conquest of Iraq]] in the late 7th century AD. Since the fall of the Iraqi [[Baath Party]] in 2003, and in the face of [[Islamic terrorism|violence]] against the indigenous Assyrian Christian community, there has been a growing movement for [[Assyrian independence]] or autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dūr-Katlimmu 2008 and beyond|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2010 |page=82 |chapter=Production and Consumption at Dūr-Katlimmu: A Survey of the Evidence|author=Frederick Mario Fales|editor=Hartmut Kühne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrian-populated cities in Iraq include those in the [[Nineveh Governorate]] region in northern [[Iraq]] such as [[Alqosh]], [[Tel Keppe]], [[Batnaya]], [[Bartella]], [[Tesqopa]], [[Karemlash]], [[Bakhdida]] and, up until 2014, [[Mosul]]. There is an Assyrian minority in the [[Dohuk Governorate]] cities of [[Zakho]] and [[Duhok]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], which are also located within the Assyrian triangle.&lt;ref&gt;Dalley, Stephanie (1993). "Nineveh After 612 BC." ''Alt-Orientanlische Forshchungen 20''. P.134.&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, the [[Tur Abdin]] region is the traditional cultural heartland for Assyrians and is the only remaining rural region in Turkey with a major Christian presence. However, today the majority of Assyrians in Turkey live in [[Istanbul]]. Northeastern Syria has in the latest century become a center for Assyrians, with much of the Assyrian population descending from refugees from Turkey that fled during the Assyrian Genocide and during later pogroms in Iraq. Major Assyrian population centras are [[Qamishli]], [[al-Hasakah]], [[Ras al-Ayn]], [[Al-Malikiyah]], [[Al-Qahtaniyah, al-Hasakah Governorate|Al-Qahtaniyah]] and the villages along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] in the [[Tell Tamer]] area.

The Assyrians, an indigenous ''pre-Arab'', ''pre-Kurdish'' and ''pre-Turkic'' people of [[upper Mesopotamia]], are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]], adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Church of the East]], an [[East Syrian rite]] sect as well as; the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]], or the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]]. They speak [[Neo-Aramaic]] languages, most common being; [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Turoyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Y Odisho|first=George|title=The sound system of modern Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic)|year=1998|publisher=Harrowitz|isbn=3-447-02744-4|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ON7BEtQvejcC&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=strabo%20atouria&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q=strabo%20atouria&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Assur|Aššur]] and [[Nineveh]] (modern day [[Mosul]]), which was the oldest and largest city of the ancient Assyrian empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nineveh |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Nineveh-ancient-city-Iraq |publisher=Max Mallowan}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BC. However it is likely that they were initially Sumerian-dominated administrative centres. In the late 26th century BC, [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], then the dominant [[Sumer]]ian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions "smiting [[Subartu]]" (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in ''c.'' the early 25th century BC, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] the king of the Sumerian state of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.&lt;ref&gt;Bertman, Stephen (2003).

Assyrians are eastern [[Aramaic]]-speaking, descending from pre-[[Islamic]] inhabitants of [[Upper Mesopotamia]]. The [[Old Aramaic language]] was adopted by the population of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] from around the 8th century BC, and these eastern dialects remained in wide use throughout Upper Mesopotamia during the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Roman]] periods, and survived through to the present day. The [[Syriac language]] evolved in [[Achaemenid Assyria]] during the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name="Brinkman"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Oxford companion to the Bible|chapter = Assyria|author = J. A.

Millard&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Assyrian period [[Duhok]] was named Nohadra (and also ''Bit Nuhadra''' or ''Naarda''), where, during the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]-[[Sassanid]] rule in Assyria (c.160 BC to 250 AD) as [[Beth Nuhadra]], gained semi-independence as one of a patchwork of [[Neo-Assyrian]] kingdoms in Assyria, which also included [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Assur]] and [[Beth Garmai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Société des études arméniennes, Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Association de la revue des études arméniennes|title=Revue des études arméniennes, Volume 21|pages=303, 309|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=17P9Tea_AoiG-waSs6i3Aw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=D_JfAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=nohadra&amp;q=nohadra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DN NAARDA], Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Christian period===
{{Main|Syriac Christianity}}
[[File:Rabban Hurmizd.jpg|thumb|[[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]].]]
[[Syriac Christianity]] took hold amongst the Assyrians between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD with the founding in Assyria of the [[Church of the East]] together with [[Syriac literature]].

The first division between [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] occurred in the 5th century, when Upper Mesopotamian based Assyrian Christians of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persian Empire]] were separated from those in [[The Levant]] over the [[Nestorian Schism]]. This split owed just as much to the politics of the day as it did to theological orthodoxy. [[Ctesiphon]], which was at the time the Sassanid capital, eventually became the capital of the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Church of the East]]. During the Christian era Nuhadra became an [[eparchy]] within the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] [[Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|metropolitanate of Ḥadyab]] ([[Erbil]]).&lt;ref name="nineveh.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parpola |first=Simo |title=ASSYRIAN IDENTITY IN ANCIENT TIMES AND TODAY |url=http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, many Syriac Christians within the [[Roman Empire]] rebelled against its decisions. The Patriarchate of Antioch was then divided between a Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian communion. The Chalcedonians were often labelled 'Melkites' (Emperor's Party), while their opponents were labelled as [[Monophysite]]s (those who believe in the one rather than two natures of Christ) and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobites]] (after [[Jacob Baradaeus]]). The [[Maronite Church]] found itself caught between the two, but claims to have always remained faithful to the [[Catholic Church]] and in communion with the [[Bishop (Catholicism)|bishop]] of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], the [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, 1864, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

[[File:Hasakah,armen.church.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Al-Hasakah]] and the Syrian Orthodox church of the city]]
Both Syriac Christianity and the Eastern Aramaic language came under pressure following the [[Arab]] [[Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia]] in the 7th century, and Assyrian Christians throughout the Middle Ages were subjected to [[Arabization|Arabizing]] [[superstrate]] influence. The Assyrians suffered a significant persecution with the religiously motivated large scale massacres conducted by the Muslim Turco-[[Mongol]] ruler [[Tamurlane]] in the 14th century AD. It was from this time that the ancient city of [[Assur]] was abandoned by Assyrians, and Assyrians were reduced to a minority within their ancient homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Henry, ed (1988). Light from the East: A Symposium on the Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Churches. Toronto, Canada. pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Schism]] occurred in 1552 AD, when a number of [[Assyrian Christians]] entered communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which, after initially naming their new followers ''The Church of Assyria and Mosul'', coined the term ''Chaldean Catholic'' in 1683 AD, giving rise to the modern [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] by 1830 AD. This term is purely theological however, the Assyrian Chaldean Catholics having no historical, ethnic, cultural or geographic link to the ancient inhabitants of [[Chaldea]] in south east Mesopotamia, who had disappeared into the native population of [[Babylonia]] by the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html |title=History of Ashur |publisher=Assur.de |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Upper Mesopotamia]] had an established structure of dioceses by AD 500 following the introduction of Christianity from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Massacres, Resistance, Protectors: Muslim-Christian Relations in Eastern Anatolia during World War I By David Gaunt – p. 9, map p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] by 605 BC Assyria remained an entity for over 1200 years under Babylonian, Achamaenid Persian, Seleucid Greek, Parthian, Roman and Sassanid Persian rule. It was only after the Arab-Islamic conquest of the second half of the 7th century AD that Assyria as a named region was dissolved.

The mountainous region of the Assyrian homeland, [[Barwari]], was part of the [[Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)#The diocese of Beth Nuhadra|diocese of Beth Nuhadra]] (current day [[Dohuk, Iraq|Dohuk]]) since antiquities and have seen a mass migration of Nestorians after the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] in 1258 and [[Timurlane]]'s invasion from central Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zHxsWspxGIIC&amp;pg=PA318 Islamic desk reference], E. J. van Donzel&lt;/ref&gt; Its Christian inhabitants were little affected by the Ottoman conquests, however starting from the 19th century [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Emir]]s sought to expand their territories at their expense. In the 1830s Muhammad Rawanduzi, the Emir of [[Soran Emirate|Soran]], tried to forcibly add the region to his dominion pillaging many Assyrian villages. [[Bedr Khan Beg]] of [[Bohtan]] renewed attacks on the region in the 1840s, killing tens of thousands of Assyrians in Barwari and [[Hakkari]] before being ultimately defeated by the [[Ottomans]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dgDi9qFT41oC&amp;pg=PA47 A modern history of the Kurds], David McDowall&lt;/ref&gt;

Syria and Upper Mesopotamia became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th century, following the conquests of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].

===Modern period===
During World War I the Assyrians suffered the [[Assyrian Genocide]] which reduced their numbers by up to two thirds. Subsequent to this, they entered the war on the side of the British and Russians. After World War I, the Assyrian homeland was divided between the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]], which would become the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] in 1932, and the [[French Mandate of Syria]] which would become the [[Syrian Arab Republic]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;David Gaunt, "The Assyrian Genocide of 1915", Assyrian Genocide Research Center, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akçam, Taner (2012).

[[File:Iraqvillagealqosh7.JPG|thumb|Traditional Christian Ceremony of "Oshana"]]
Assyrians faced reprisals under the [[Hashemite monarchy]] for co-operating with the British during the years after World War I, and many fled to the West. The Patriarch [[Shimun XXI Eshai]], though born into the line of Patriarchs at Qochanis, was educated in Britain. For a time he sought a homeland for the Assyrians in Iraq but was forced to take refuge in [[Cyprus]] in 1933, later moving to Chicago, Illinois, and finally settling near San Francisco, California.&lt;ref&gt;Travis, Hannibal.

Genocide Studies and Prevention, Vol. 1, No. 3, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrian [[Chaldean Christian]] community was less numerous and vociferous at the time of the British Mandate of Mesopotamia, and did not play a major role in the British rule of the country. However, with the exodus of [[Assyrian Church of the East]] members, the Chaldean Catholic Church became the largest non-Muslim religious denomination in Iraq, and some Assyrian Catholics later rose to power in the Ba'ath Party government, the most prominent being Deputy Prime Minister [[Tariq Aziz]]. The Assyrians of Dohuk boast one of the largest churches in the region named the Mar Marsi Cathedral, and is the center of an Eparchy. Tens of thousands of [[Yazidi]] and Assyrian Christian refugees live in the city as well due to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] invasion of Iraq in 2014 and the subsequent [[Fall of Mosul]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ishtartv.com/en/viewarticle,35601.html|title=Mar Narsi church – Dhouk|website=www.ishtartv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Assyrian population, an [[Jewish Aramaic#Modern dialects|Aramaic speaking Jewish population]] existed in the region for thousands of years, living mainly in Barwari, Zakho and Alqosh. However, All of the Barwari [[Jews]] either left or were exiled to [[Israel]] shortly after its independence in 1947. The region was heavily affected by the [[First Iraqi–Kurdish War|Kurdish uprisings during the 1950s and 60s]] and was largely depopulated during the [[Al-Anfal campaign]] in the 1980s, although some of its population later returned and their homes were subsequently rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFeZCFOiJ0MC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=matina+mountains+iraq&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nwd5JgUlUA&amp;sig=sBnE5DIheCHNziBvHnFPsWy9r0k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_45zRo7PNAhWGlx4KHToRBtwQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=matina+mountains+iraq&amp;f=false|title=The Neo-Aramaic Dialect of Barwar|first=Geoffrey|last=Khan|date=16 June 2018|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assur]], which is in the [[Saladin Governorate]], was put on [[UNESCO]]'s List of [[World Heritage]] in danger in 2003, at which time the site was threatened by a looming large-scale dam project that would have submerged the ancient archaeological site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1130/threats/|title=Ashur (Qal'at Sherqat)|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attacks on Christians====
{{main|2008 attacks on Christians in Mosul}}
Following the concerted attacks on Assyrian Christians in Iraq, especially highlighted by the Sunday, August 1, 2004 simultaneous bombing of six Churches (Baghdad and Mosul) and subsequent bombing of nearly thirty other churches throughout the country, Assyrian leadership, internally and externally, began to regard the Nineveh Plain as the location where security for Christians may be possible. Schools especially received much attention in this area and in Kurdish areas where Assyrian concentrated population lives. In addition, agriculture and medical clinics received financial help from the [[Assyrian diaspora]].&lt;ref name="griffis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffis|first1=Margaret|title=Militants Execute Civilians in Mosul; 101 Killed Across Iraq|url=http://original.antiwar.com/updates/2017/01/19/militants-execute-civilians-in-mosul-101-killed-across-iraq/|website=[[Antiwar.com]]|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As attacks on Christians increased in [[Basra]], [[Baghdad]], [[Ramadi]] and smaller towns. more families turned northward to the extended family holdings in the Nineveh Plain. This place of refuge remains underfunded and gravely lacking in infrastructure to aid the ever-increasing internally displaced people population.

In August 2014 nearly all of the non-Sunni inhabitants of the southern regions of the Plains, which include [[Tel Keppe]], [[Bakhdida]], [[Bartella]] and [[Karamlish]] were driven out by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] during the [[Northern Iraq offensive (August 2014)|2014 Northern Iraq offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/isis-iraq-communities-christians-yezidis-kurds | title='Isis has shattered the ancient ties that bound Iraq's minorities' | work=The Guardian | date=9 August 2014 | accessdate=11 August 2014 |author1=Chulov, Martin |author2=Hawramy, Fazel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/iraqi-militants-seize-christian-villages-1407404503|title=Barack Obama Approves Airstrikes on Iraq, Airdrops Aid|first1=Julian E.|last1=Barnes|first2=Jeffrey|last2=Sparshott|first3=Nour|last3=Malas|date=8 August 2014|publisher=|via=online.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering the town, ISIS looted the homes, and removed the crosses and other religious objects from the churches.

==Geography==
[[File:Harrry111111.JPG|thumb|220px|A [[waterfall]] in [[Zakho]].]]
[[Image:TigrisRiver.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tigris river]] just outside of [[Mosul]].]]

The Assyrian homeland is moderately elevated, being around {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} at the south in the Nineveh plains near [[Mosul]], to around {{convert|1900|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} in the northern periphery at the highest peaks, just above Zakho. The lower lands include plains, [[meadow]] grasses and rolling hills, which are predominantly located to the south and would feature sprawling [[sclerophyllous]] scrubland.

So-named, the Nineveh Plains have a topography that's made up of relatively flat, fertile [[plain]]s which lie on the foothills of the surrounding, rather [[forest]]ed, mountains. Rivers in the region include the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. Parts of them are situated in a [[riverine forest]], and therefore would assist [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Scripture Geography, p 57, by John Miles, 486 pages, Published 1846, Original from Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora and fauna===
Due to its relatively wet climate, plant species would include [[fir]]s, [[oak]]s, [[Conifer cone|conifers]], [[platanus]], [[willow]], [[olive trees]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[oriental plane]], [[cherry plum]], [[rose hip]]s, [[pistachio tree]]s, [[rosaceae]], [[Pyrus elaeagrifolia|pear]], [[Sorbus|mountain ash]] [[Populus|poplar]], which are also present in other areas of the autonomous [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] region. The [[Syrian Desert|desert]] in the south is mostly [[steppe]] and would thus feature [[xeric]] species such as, [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[tamarix]], [[date palm]], [[fraxinus]], [[poa]], [[white wormwood]] and [[chenopodiaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;Village on the Euphrates: From Foraging to Farming at Abu Hureyra, by A.M.T Moore, G.C. Hillman and A.J Legge, Published 2000, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals in the region include the [[Syrian brown bear]], [[wild boar]], [[gray wolf]], the [[golden jackal]], [[Indian crested porcupine]], the [[red fox]], [[goitered gazelle]], [[Eurasian otter]], [[striped hyena]], [[Persian fallow deer]], [[onager]], [[Mangar (fish)|mangar]] and the [[Euphrates softshell turtle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq's Marshes Show Progress toward Recovery|url=http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/good-iraqimarshes.html#cr|publisher=Wildlife Extra|accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird species found in the region include, the [[Dead Sea sparrow]], [[eastern rock nuthatch]], [[European nightjar]], [[hooded crow]], [[masked shrike]], [[Menetries's warbler]], [[pale rockfinch]], [[rufous-tailed scrub robin]], [[see-see partridge]] and [[squacco heron]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Sheikhly, O.F.; and Nader, I.A. (2013).

Group Bull. 30(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Owing to its latitude and altitude, the Assyrian homeland is cooler and much wetter than the rest of Iraq. Most areas in the region fall within the [[Mediterranean climate]] zone (''Csa''), with areas to the southwest being [[semi-arid]] (''BSh'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ishtartv.com/en/viewarticle,36256.html|title=Shaqlawa|website= Ishtar Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summers are very hot for worldwide standards, with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|36|C|F}} in the northernmost areas to scorching {{convert|40|C|F}} in the southwest, with lows averaging around {{convert|21|C|F}} to {{convert|24|C|F}}. Winters are strikingly cooler and wetter than other regions in Iraq with highs averaging between {{convert|9|C|F}} and {{convert|11|C|F}} and lows hovering around {{convert|3|C|F}}. At times, temperatures would occasionally reach [[freezing]], plummeting to {{convert|-2|C|F}}, providing [[frost]] and the occasional [[snowfall]]. Spring is fairly mild and damp. Autumn is warm and mostly dry.

Assyrian populations are distributed between the Assyrian homeland and the [[Assyrian diaspora]]. There are no official statistics, and estimates vary greatly, between less than one million in the Assyrian homeland,&lt;ref name="Skutsch2013" /&gt; and 3.3 million with the diaspora included,&lt;ref name="UNPO:Assyria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/7859 |title=UNPO: Assyria|website=www.unpo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly due to the uncertainty of the number of Assyrians in [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]. Since the 2003 [[Iraq War]], Iraqi Assyrians have been displaced into [[Syria]] in significant but unknown numbers. Since the [[Syrian Civil War]] began in 2011, Syrian Assyrians have been displaced into [[Turkey]] in significant but unknown numbers. The indigenous Assyrian homeland areas are "part of today's northern Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran and northeastern Syria".&lt;ref name="books.google.ca" /&gt;

Most of the Assyrians living in [[Syria]] today, in the [[Al Hasakah Governorate]] in villages along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur river]], descend from refugees that arrived there after the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and [[Simele massacre]] of the 1910s and 30s. Christian communities of [[Oriental Orthodox Syriacs]] lived in [[Tur Abdin]], an area in Southeastern Turkey, [[Assyrian Church of the East|Nestorian Assyrians]] lived in the [[Hakkari]] Mountains, which straddles the border of northern Iraq and Southern Turkey, as well as the [[Urmia Plain]], an area located on the western bank of [[Lake Urmia]], and [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] and [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholics]] lived in the [[Nineveh Plains]], an area located in Northern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. W.A. Wigram (1929). ''The Assyrians and Their Neighbours''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than half of [[Iraqi Christians]] have fled to neighbouring countries since the start of the [[Iraq War]], and many have not returned, although a number are migrating back to the traditional Assyrian homeland in the Kurdish Autonomous region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unpo.org/members/7859 Assyria].

Therefore, The area with the greatest concentration of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] on earth is located in Northern Iraq in the ''Assyrian Triangle'', a region which comprises the [[Nineveh plains]], southern [[Hakkari]] and the [[Barwari]] regions.&lt;ref name="War p. 70" /&gt;

Other ethnic groups that live in the region are [[Arabs]], [[Kurds]], [[Shabak people|Shabaks]], [[Armenians]], [[Yazidis]], [[Mandeans]], [[Kawliya]]/[[Romani people|Roma]], [[Circassians]] and [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]], and historically, there was a significant [[Iraqi Jewish]] population until the mid-20th century CE.

==Economy==
[[Image:Iraqvillagealqosh9.JPG|thumb|Old farming methods in Alqosh.]]
The Nineveh Plain appears to hold under its rich agricultural lands an extension of the petroleum fields tapped in 2006 by the Kurdish Regional Government in direct contract with foreign oil exploration companies. It is believed that this added incentive for absorption by the KRG of the region may lead to economic conflict with Sunni Arab tribes in the Mosul region itself.  Assyrians claim that without Nineveh Plain autonomous administration, the indigenous Assyrian presence in its ancient homeland could well disappear. There are some oil reserves in Nineveh Plains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousfreedomcoalition.org/2011/02/21/christian-leaders-unhappy-with-lack-of-action-on-nineveh-plain/|title=Christian Leaders Unhappy with Lack of Action on Nineveh Plain|website=www.religiousfreedomcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the inhabitants have practiced dry [[agriculture]] since ancient times and rely on the fertile plains to the south, growing agricultural products like grain, [[wheat]], [[beans]] and in the summer goods such as [[cantaloupe]] and [[cucumber]]. Farmers followed old non-technological methods in their farming for several centuries, and their livelihood was always threatened due to nature's betrayal in situations of drought or plant epidemics such as [[grasshopper]]s. Besides farmlands, other agriculture also occurs in grape [[vineyard]]s. [[Grapevine]]s spread all over the village and produce various types of grapes, among which are the black [[grape]]s that are well known in northern Iraq.

Modern agricultural machinery such as [[tractor]]s, harvester-threshers ([[reaper]]s), along with new methods of treating and curing plant epidemics now exist. However, [[irrigation]] is still a problem in the area, and farming still relies on rainfall.  Currently, dozen of farms now belong to the government and are deputized to their owners to use them, as most were taken during [[Saddam Hussein]]'s control. The Assyrian settlement of Alqosh enjoyed being an important trade center for the various [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]], [[Yazidi]], and Arab villages in the region and it houses a large market that receiving agricultural and animal products from across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/kurdistans-gushing-crude-spawns-conflict|title=Kurdistan's Gushing Crude Spawns Conflict|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of an Assyrian autonomous province==
{{Main|Proposals for Assyrian autonomy in Iraq}}

The Assyrian-inhabited towns and villages on the Nineveh Plain form a concentration of those belonging to Syriac Christian traditions, and since this area is the ancient home of the Assyrian empire through which the Assyrian people trace their cultural heritage, the Nineveh Plain is the area on which an effort to form an [[Assyrian independence|autonomous Assyrian entity]] has become concentrated. There have been calls by some politicians inside and outside Iraq to create an autonomous region for Assyrian Christians in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://208.78.42.109/display-article.html?id=1556871A70A893A757F49C432901DB9A Iraqi Christians hold critical meeting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704113149/http://208.78.42.109/display-article.html?id=1556871A70A893A757F49C432901DB9A |date=2011-07-04 }}, The Kurdish Globe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=3.1.1271835942 Dutch MP calls for autonomous Assyrian Christian region in north Iraq], AKI&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Transitional Administrative Law adopted in March 2004 in Baghdad, not only were provisions made for the preservation of Assyrian culture through education and media, but a provision for an administrative unit also was accepted. Article 125 in Iraq's Constitution states that: ''"This Constitution shall guarantee the administrative, political, cultural, and educational rights of the various nationalities, such as Turkomen, Chaldeans, Assyrians, and all other constituents, and this shall be regulated by law."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.assyrianamericancoalition.org/documents/policy/AtTheTippingPoint-NPProvinceSolutionFull.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014073944/http://www.assyrianamericancoalition.org/documents/policy/AtTheTippingPoint-NPProvinceSolutionFull.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqdemocracyproject.org/policy_alert_2.html |title=Iraq Sustainable Democracy Project |publisher=Iraqdemocracyproject.org |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Assyria Map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Assyrian populated areas]]
Since the towns and villages on the Nineveh Plain form a concentration of those belonging to Syriac Christian traditions, and since this area is the ancient home of the Assyrian empire through which these people trace their cultural heritage, the Nineveh Plain  is the area on which the effort to form an autonomous Assyrian entity have become concentrated.

On January 21, 2014, the Iraqi government had declared that Nineveh Plains would become a new province, which would serve as a safe haven for Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BetBasoo|first1=Peter|last2=Nuri Kino|title=Will a Province for Assyrians Stop Their Exodus From Iraq?|url=http://aina.org/releases/20140122133822.htm|publisher=[[Assyrian International News Agency]]|accessdate=6 December 2016|date=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the liberation of the Nineveh Plain from ISIL between 2016/17, all Assyrian political parties called on the [[European Union]] and [[UN Security Council]] for the creation of an Assyrian self-administered province in the Nineveh Plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europeanpost.co/iraqi-christians-ask-eu-to-support-the-creation-of-a-nineveh-plain-province/|title=Iraqi Christians ask EU to support the creation of a Nineveh Plain Province|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 28th-30 June 2017, a conference was held in [[Brussels]] dubbed,  ''The Future for Christians in Iraq''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nineveh.eu/|title=christians-in-iraq|website=christians-in-iraq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organised by the [[European People's Party]] and had participants extending from Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac organizations, including representatives from the Iraqi government and the KRG. The conference was boycotted by the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]], [[Sons of Mesopotamia]], [[Assyrian Patriotic Party]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. A position paper was signed by the remaining political organizations involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/352513487/The-Future-of-the-Nineveh-Plain|title=The Future of the Nineveh Plain - Government - Politics|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Dee and Edward Keeley.jpg|thumb|[[John Dee]] and [[Edward Kelley]] using a [[magic circle]] ritual to invoke a spirit in a church [[Cemetery|graveyard]].|340x340px]]

'''Black magic''' has traditionally referred to the use of [[supernatural]] powers or [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] for [[evil]] and selfish purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology | volume = Vol 1: A–L | edition = Fifth | year = 2001 | editor = [[J. Gordon Melton]] | publisher = Gale Research Inc. | title = Black Magic | isbn = 0-8103-9488-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the [[left-hand path and right-hand path]] dichotomy, black magic is the malicious, left-hand counterpart of the benevolent [[white magic]]. In modern times, some find that the definition of "black magic" has been convoluted by people who define magic or ritualistic practices that they disapprove of as "black magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-5286-6|author=Jesper Aagaard Petersen|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like its counterpart white magic, the origins of black magic can be traced to the primitive, ritualistic worship of spirits as outlined in [[Robert M. Place]]'s 2009 book, ''Magic and Alchemy''.&lt;ref name=place&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2rD9r0kFY20C&amp; ''Magic and Alchemy''] by [[Robert M. Place]] ([[Infobase Publishing]], 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike white magic, in which Place sees parallels with primitive [[shaman]]istic efforts to achieve closeness with spiritual beings, the rituals that developed into modern "black magic" were designed to [[invocation|invoke]] those same spirits to produce beneficial outcomes for the practitioner. Place also provides a broad modern definition of both black and white magic, preferring instead to refer to them as "high magic" (white) and "low magic" (black) based primarily on intentions of the practitioner employing them. He acknowledges, though, that this broader definition (of "high" and "low") suffers from prejudices because good-intentioned [[folk magic]] may be considered "low" while [[ceremonial magic]] involving expensive or exclusive components may be considered by some as "high magic", regardless of intent.&lt;ref name=place/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Pritchard. "Sorcery and Native Opinion". Africa: Journal of the International African Institute Vol. 4, No. 1 (Jan., 1931) , pp. 22-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Renaissance magic}}
[[File:Sprenger - Malleus maleficarum, 1669 - BEIC 9477645.tiff|thumb|''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', 1669 edition]]
During the [[Renaissance]], many magical practices and rituals were considered evil or irreligious and by extension, "black magic" in the broad sense. [[Witchcraft]] and non-mainstream [[Western esotericism|esoteric study]] were prohibited and targeted by the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=zambelli&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tp6PhNsz43EC&amp; ''White Magic, Black Magic in the European Renaissance''] by Paola Zambelli ([[Brill Publishers|BRILL]], 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[natural magic]] developed as a way for thinkers and intellectuals, like [[Marsilio Ficino]], abbot [[Johannes Trithemius]] and [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]], to advance esoteric and ritualistic study (though still often in secret) without significant persecution.&lt;ref name=zambelli/&gt;

While "natural magic" became popular among the educated and upper classes of the 16th and 17th century, [[Ritual magic|ritualistic magic]] and folk magic remained subject to persecution. 20th century author [[Montague Summers]] generally rejects the definitions of "white" and "black" magic as "contradictory", though he highlights the extent to which magic in general, regardless of intent, was considered "black" and cites [[William Perkins (theologian)|William Perkins]] posthumous 1608 instructions in that regard:&lt;ref name=summers&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qZPSWkRinHMC&amp; ''Witchcraft and Black Magic''] by [[Montague Summers]] (1946; reprint [[Courier Dover Publications]], 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|All witches "convicted by the Magistrate" should be executed. He allows no exception and under this condemnation fall "all Diviners, Charmers, Jugglers, all Wizards, commonly called wise men or wise women". All those purported "good Witches which do not hurt but good, which do not spoil and destroy, but save and deliver" should come under the extreme sentence.}}

In particular, though, the term was most commonly reserved for those accused of invoking [[demon]]s and other [[evil spirit]]s, those [[Curse|hexing]] or [[Curse|cursing]] their neighbours, those using magic to destroy crops, and those capable of leaving their earthly bodies and travelling great distances in spirit (to which the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' "devotes one long and important chapter"), usually to engage in devil-worship. Summers also highlights the etymological development of the term ''nigromancer'', in common use from 1200 to approximately 1500, ({{lang-la|Niger}}, black; {{lang-gr|Manteia}}, divination), broadly "one skilled in the black arts".&lt;ref name=summers/&gt;

In a modern context, the line between "white magic" and "black magic" is somewhat clearer and most modern definitions focus on intent rather than practice.&lt;ref name=place/&gt; There is also an extent to which many modern [[Wicca]] and [[witchcraft]] practitioners have sought to distance themselves from those intent on practising black magic. Those who seek to do harm or evil are less likely to be accepted into mainstream Wiccan circles or [[coven]]s in an era where benevolent magic is increasingly associated with [[new-age]] [[Gnosticism]] and self-help [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-73lyxpbSVIC&amp; ''Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft''] by [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] ([[SUNY Press]], 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satanism and devil-worship==
[[File:Martin van Maele - La Sorcière 06.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Illustration by [[Martin van Maële]], of a ''[[Witches' Sabbath]]'', in the 1911 edition of ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft|La Sorciere]]'', by [[Jules Michelet]].]]

{{main|Satanism}}
The influence of popular culture has allowed other practices to be drawn in under the broad banner of "black magic", including the concept of [[Satanism]].  While the invocation of demons or spirits is an accepted part of black magic, this practice is distinct from the worship or deification of such spiritual beings.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; The two are usually combined in medieval beliefs about [[witchcraft]].

Those lines, though, continue to be blurred by the inclusion of spirit rituals from otherwise "white magicians" in compilations of work related to Satanism. [[John Dee]]'s sixteenth century rituals, for example, were included in [[Anton LaVey]]'s ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'' (1969) and so some of his practises, otherwise considered white magic, have since been associated with black magic.  Dee's rituals themselves were designed to contact spirits in general and [[angel]]s in particular, which he claimed to have been able to do with the assistance of colleague [[Edward Kelley]].  LaVey's ''Bible'', however, is a "complete contradiction" of Dee's intentions but offers the same rituals as a means of contact with evil spirits and demons.&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mQrbsOWaOyUC&amp; ''Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture''] by Chris Mathews ([[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; LaVey's [[Church of Satan]] (with LaVey's ''Bible'' at its centre), "officially denies the efficacy of occult ritual" but "affirms the subjective, psychological value of ritual practice", drawing a clear distinction between.&lt;ref name="matthews" /&gt; LaVey himself was more specific:

{{quotation|White magic is supposedly utilized only for good or unselfish purposes, and black magic, we are told, is used only for selfish or "evil" reasons. Satanism draws no such dividing line. Magic is magic, be it used to help or hinder. The Satanist, being the magician, should have the ability to decide what is just, and then apply the powers of magic to attain his goals.}}

{{quotation|Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal - all of which are ruled by Satan, the personification of the Left Hand Path.}}

The latter quote, though, seems to have been directed toward the growing trends of Wiccanism and [[neo-pagan]]ism at the time.&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt;

== Chathan Seva in Hindusim ==
Chathan is actually a negative spirit of Lord Shiva. [[Chathan]] or [[vishnumaya]] is a deity worshipped by Hindus in Kerala. He is said to be the son of Lord Shiva, who took birth to kill the demon Jalandhara. In one such battle a demon was lead to a spilling of chathan's blood and there arose many “kuttichathans” or child chathans. There are many famous and not so famous temples where Chathan is being worshipped in kerala as the main or secondary deity.

Chathan seva is a kind of black magic done to satisfy Chathan for fulfilling some personal benefits of the person in whose name or expense the pooja is performed. It is said to bring wishes true and Its also done to bring destruction to enemies.

[http://devasthanam.com/ Peringottukara Devasthanam]  in Thrissur is one of the most famous Vishnumaya Kuttichathan Seva Temple and often considered as one of the biggest centers for black magic and occult.

==Shamanism==
In some areas, there are purported [[malevolent sorcerer]]s who masquerade as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink [[ayahuasca]] in their presence. Shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile.&lt;ref name="Campos 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman &amp; Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voodoo==
[[File:Vudu.jpg|thumb|A [[Voodoo doll]].]]
{{main|Louisiana Voodoo}}

Voodoo has been associated with modern "black magic"; drawn together in popular culture and fiction.  However, while hexing or cursing may be accepted black magic practices, Voodoo has its own distinct history and traditions that have little to do with the traditions of modern witchcraft that developed with European practitioners like [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Voodoo 2.0." Newsweek Global 163.9 (2014): 92-98. Academic Search Complete. Web. 19 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Carolyn Morrow. "Perceptions of New Orleans Voodoo: Sin, Fraud, Entertainment, and Religion". Nova Religion: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, Vol. 6, No. 1 (October 2002), pp. 86-101&lt;/ref&gt;

Voodoo tradition makes its own distinction between black and white magic, with sorcerers like the [[Bokor]] known for using magic and rituals of both.  But their penchant for magic associated with curses, poisons and [[zombie]]s means they, and Voodoo in general, are regularly associated with black magic in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2UNFPas9KcgC&amp; ''Voodoo Rituals: A User's Guide''] by Heike Owusu ([[Sterling Publishing Company]], 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black magic and religion==
The links and interaction between black magic and religion are many and varied. Beyond black magic's links to organised Satanism or its historical persecution by [[Christianity]] and its inquisitions, there are links between religious and black magic rituals. The [[Black Mass]], for example, is a [[sacrilege|sacrilegious]] parody of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Likewise, a [[saining]], though primarily a practice of white magic, is a Wiccan ritual analogous to a [[Infant baptism|christening or baptism]] for an [[infant]].&lt;ref&gt;"Black Mass." Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia (2014): 1p. 1. Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia. Web. 11 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmullen, Ramsay, and Eugene Lane. "From Black Magic To Mystical Awe." Christian History 17.1 (1998): 37. History Reference Center. Web. 19 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Seventeenth century priest, [[Étienne Guibourg]], is said to have performed a series of [[black mass]] rituals with alleged witch [[Catherine Monvoisin]] for [[Madame de Montespan]].&lt;ref name=summers2&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uV_kQksWgCoC&amp; ''Geography of Witchcraft''] by [[Montague Summers]] (1927; reprint [[Kessinger Publishing]], 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, [[al-Fatiha]], [[al-Falaq]], [[al-Nas]], [[al-Ikhlas]] and other [[Surahs]] are recited to protect against [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|sorcery]].

During his period of scholarship, [[A. E. Waite]] provided a comprehensive account of black magic practices, rituals and traditions in ''The Book of Black Magic and Ceremonial Magic''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WyJnZ44K5kAC&amp; ''The Book of Black Magic and Ceremonial Magic''] by [[Arthur Edward Waite]] (1911; reprint 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Other practitioners have expanded on these ideas and offered their own comprehensive lists of rituals and concepts. Black magic practices and rituals include:
* [[True name]] spells - the theory that knowing a person's true name allows control over that person, making this wrong for the same reason. This can also be used as a connection to the other person, or to free them from another's compulsion, so it is in the grey area.
* [[Immortality]] rituals - from a [[Taoist]] perspective, life is finite, and wishing to live beyond one's natural span is not with the flow of nature. Beyond this, there is a major issue with immortality. Because of the need to test the results, the subjects must be killed. Even a spell to extend life may not be entirely good, especially if it draws life energy from another to sustain the spell.&lt;ref&gt;"Immortality." Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia (2014): 1p. 1. Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia. Web. 11 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Necromancy]] - for purposes of usage, this is defined not as general black magic, but as any magic having to do with death itself, either through divination of entrails, or the act of raising the dead body, as opposed to [[resurrection]] or [[CPR]].&lt;ref&gt;"necromancy". Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed.). Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster. April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Curse]]s and [[Curse|hexes]] - a curse can be as simple as wishing something bad would happen to someone, or as complicated as performing a complex ritual to ensure that someone dies.&lt;ref&gt;"Hex." Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition (2013): 1. Literary Reference Center. Web. 11 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture and fiction==
Concepts related to black magic or described, even inaccurately, as "black magic" are a regular feature of books, films and other popular culture. Examples include:
* "[[Black Magic (Slayer song)|Black Magic]]" – track off the [[Slayer]] album ''[[Show No Mercy]]'' 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Slayer-Show-No-Mercy/release/404409|title=Slayer – Show No Mercy|author=|date=|website=Discogs|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Black Magic (Little Mix song)|Black Magic]]" – Lead single by British girl-group [[Little Mix]] released in May 2015, for their third studio album "Get Weird".
* ''[[The Devil Rides Out]]'' – a 1934 novel by Dennis Wheatley – made into a famous film by Hammer Studios in 1968.
* ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' – a 1968 horror novel in which black magic is a central theme.
* ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' – a 1996 film featuring four friends who become involved in white witchcraft but turn to black magic rituals for personal gain.
* The [[Harry Potter]] series – black magic, including various spells and curses, is referred to as "[[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Arts|the dark arts]]" against which students are taught to defend themselves.
* ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' – a [[video game]] in which white and black magic are simply used to distinguish between healing/defensive spells (such as a "cure") and offensive/elemental spells (such as "fire") and do not carry an inherent good or evil connotation.
* ''[[Charmed]]'' – a television series in which black magic is also known as "the black arts", "dark arts", "dark magic" or even "evil magic", and is used by demons and other evil beings.
* ''[[The Secret Circle (TV series)|The Secret Circle]]'' – A short-lived television series featuring witches, in which there are two kinds of magic. While traditional magic helps you to connect to the energy around you, more lethal and dangerous dark magic is rooted in the anger, fear and negativity inside you.  Only a few born with it can access dark magic and some are inherently stronger than others.
* ''[[The Power of Five]]'' is an entire series by Anthony Horowitz about black magic and evil sorcerers. The antagonists are all black sorcerers and are all practitioners of black magic; black magic is a means of summoning the Old Ones from their prison, Hell. Black magic often takes the form of mass murder and animation of inanimate objects.
* ''[[Night Watch (Lukyanenko novel)|Night Watch]]'' – In the ''Night Watch'' book (and movie) series the magicians are grouped into two sides "Light Others" and "Dark Others". The dark magicians are more motivated by selfish desires.
* ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)]]'' – The television series ''Supernatural'' features many events and characters that feature and participate in black magic.
* ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)]]'' – The first of the two Sherlock Holmes films directed by [[Guy Ritchie]] includes elements of black magic although they are later discovered to be false.
*[[Versailles (band)]] released a short film in 2009 which depicted zombies that were resurrected by [[Jasmine You]] through black magic.
* ''[[Pizza II: Villa]]'' – An Indian Tamil suspense supernatural thriller film, written and directed by debutant Deepan Chakravarthy.
* ''[[The Necromancers: Best of Black Magic and Witchcraft|The Necromancers: The Best of Black Magic And Witchcraft]]'' – A collection of folklores and stories about black magic edited by [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]].
* ''[[Odiyan]]'' – An upcoming 2018 Indian Malayalam language film starring [[Mohanlal]]. It is based on the legend of Odiyan, who in [[Kerala|Kerala folklore]] are men possessing shape-shifting ability, who can assume animal form and were used to assassinate or scare people in the dark during the pre-electricity period.

'''Computational humor''' is a branch of [[computational linguistics]] and [[artificial intelligence]] which uses [[computer]]s in [[humor research]]. It is a relatively new area, with the first dedicated conference organized in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Hulstijn, J, and Nijholt, A. (eds.). Proceedings of the International Workshop on Computational Humor. Number 12 in Twente Workshops on Language Technology, Enschede, Netherlands. University of Twente, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "computer model of a sense of humor" was suggested by
Suslov as early as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". I. General Algorithm. Biofizika SSSR 37, 318 (1992) [Biophysics 37, 242 (1992)]; https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2058.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation of the general scheme of information processing shows the possibility of a specific malfunction, conditioned by the necessity of a quick deletion from consciousness of a false version. This specific malfunction can be identified with a humorous effect on psychological grounds: it exactly corresponds to incongruity-resolution theory. However, an essentially new ingredient, the role of timing, is added to the well-known role of ambiguity. In biological systems, a sense of humor inevitably develops in the course of evolution, because its biological function consists of quickening the transmission of the processed information into consciousness and in a more effective use of brain resources. A realization of this algorithm in neural networks&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". II. Realization in Neural Networks. Biofizika SSSR 37, 325 (1992) [Biophysics {\bf 37}, 249 (1992)] https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2061.&lt;/ref&gt; justifies naturally Spencer's hypothesis on the mechanism of laughter: deletion of a false version corresponds to zeroing of some part of the neural network and excessive energy of neurons is thrown out to the motor cortex, arousing muscular contractions.

A practical realization of this algorithm needs extensive databases, whose creation in the automatic regime was suggested recently.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, How to Realize "a Sense of Humour" in Computers? https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3197.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this magistral direction was not developed properly and subsequent investigations accepted somewhat specialized colouring.

==Joke generators==

===Pun generation===
An approach to analysis of humor is classification of jokes. A further step is an attempt to generate jokes basing on the rules that underlie classification.

Simple prototypes for computer [[pun]] generation were reported in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Lessard, G. and Levison, M. (1992). Computational modeling of linguistic humour: Tom Swifties. In ALLC/ACH Joint Annual Conference, Oxford, pages 175–178.&lt;/ref&gt; based on a [[natural language generator]] program, [[VINCI (software)|VINCI]]. [[Graeme Ritchie (scientist)|Graeme Ritchie]] and [[Kim Binsted]] in their 1994 research paper described a computer program, JAPE, designed to generate question-answer-type [[pun]]s from a general, i.e., non-humorous, lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Binsted, Graeme Ritchie (1994) "A symbolic description of punning riddles and its computer implementation." Research Paper 688, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, 1994, reported at the International Conference on Humor and Laughter, Luxembourg, 1993
*(conference proceeding version of the above) An implemented model of punning riddles. In Proceedings of the Twelfth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-94), Seattle, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  (The program name is an acronym for "Joke Analysis and Production Engine".) Some examples produced by JAPE are:

:Q: What is the difference between leaves and a car?
:A: One you brush and rake, the other you rush and brake.

:Q: What do you call a strange market?
:A: A bizarre bazaar.

Since then the approach has been improved, and the latest report, dated 2007, describes the STANDUP joke generator, implemented in the [[Java programming language]].&lt;ref name=rmpwbd&gt;Graeme Ritchie, Ruli Manurung, Helen Pain, Annalu Waller, Rolf Black, Dave O'Mara. "[http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/g.ritchie/pages/papers/ijwcc07.pdf A practical application of computational humour]." In Cardoso, A. &amp; Wiggins, G. (Ed.) Proceedings of the 4th. International Joint Workshop on Computational Creativity, London, UK, 2007, pp. 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/standup-315.php STANDUP home page], with a link to free software download&lt;/ref&gt; The STANDUP generator was tested on children within the framework of analyzing its usability for language skills development for children with communication disabilities, e.g., because of [[cerebral palsy]]. (The project name is an acronym for "System To Augment Non-speakers' Dialog Using Puns" and an allusion to [[standup comedy]].) Children responded to this "language playground" with enthusiasm, and showed marked improvement on certain types of language tests.&lt;ref name=rmpwbd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/standup/cuttings/20060819_www.thecourier.co.uk.html "Laughter is the best therapy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610153820/http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/standup/cuttings/20060819_www.thecourier.co.uk.html |date=June 10, 2007 }}, ''The Courier'',  19 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5276366.stm "Joke software helps non-speakers"], ''[[BBC News]],'' 22 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The two young people, who used the system over a ten-week period, regaled their peers, staff, family and neighbors with jokes such as: "What do you call a spicy missile? A hot shot!" Their joy and enthusiasm at entertaining others was inspirational.

An application of [[machine learning]] techniques for the distinguishing of joke texts from non-jokes was described by Mihalcea and Strapparava (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Mihalcea, R. and Strapparava, C. (2006). "Learning to laugh (automatically): Computational models
for humor recognition." ''[[Computational Intelligence (journal)|Computational Intelligence]]'', 22(2):126–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takizawa ''et al.'' (1996) reported on a [[heuristic]] program for detecting puns in the [[Japanese language]].&lt;ref&gt;Osamu Takizawa, Masuzo Yanagida, Akira Ito, and Hitoshi Isahara (1996). "On Computational Processing of Rhetorical Expressions – Puns, Ironies and Tautologies". In (Hulstijn and Nijholt, 1996), 39–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A possible application for the assistance in [[language acquisition]] is described in the section "Pun generation". Another envisioned use of joke generators is in cases of steady supply of jokes where quantity is more important than quality. Another obvious, yet remote, direction is automated joke appreciation.

It is known {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} that humans interact with computers in ways similar to interacting with other humans that may be described in terms of personality, politeness, flattery, and in-group favoritism. Therefore, the role of humor in [[human-computer interaction]] is being investigated. In particular, humor generation in [[user interface]] to ease communications with computers was suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Rada Mihalcea, carlo Strapparava, "Technologies That Make You Smile: Adding Humor to Text-Based Applications", ''[[IEEE Intelligent Systems]]'', 2006, vol. 21, no.5, pp. 33–39.

Craig McDonough implemented the Mnemonic Sentence Generator, which converts [[password]]s into humorous sentences.  Basing on the [[Theory of humor#Incongruity|incongruity theory of humor]], it is suggested that the resulting meaningless but funny sentences are easier to remember. For example, the password AjQA3Jtv is converted into "Arafat joined Quayle's Ant, while TARAR Jeopardized thurmond's vase".&lt;ref&gt;Craigh McDonough (2001) "Using Natural Language Processing for random Passwords", Technical Report, [[CERIAS]], [[Purdue University]] (unpublished), as quoted by Mulder and Nijholt (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concepts''' are mental representations, abstract objects or abilities that make up the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

== Concepts in the representational theory of mind ==

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of concepts ==
{{main article|Abstract object}}

A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what concepts ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts – what they are really like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3–83|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept – or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

=== A priori concepts ===
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

===Embodied content===
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Ontology===
{{Main article|Ontology}}

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Mental representations ==
{{Main article|Mental representation}}

In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] – [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions – especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

=== Prototype theory ===
{{Main article|Prototype theory}}

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm" /&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member – the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

=== Theory-theory ===
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory–Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Conservation Plan''''' is an important publication written by [[James Semple Kerr]] in 1982, and revised many times. It was a landmark in Australian conservation. The document "...outlines the logical processes of the Burra Charter, and how to prepare a Conservation Plan to guide and manage change to a heritage item appropriately''. Subtitled, "a guide to the preparation of conservation plans for places of European cultural significance'' it has guided building conservation in Australia and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/the-conservation-plan/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; Publications &gt; The Conservation Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservation Plan is widely used by heritage practitioners and property owners in Australia, and worldwide as a primary guide to the process of researching, documenting and managing historic places in accordance with the [[Burra Charter]], through a logical process. First published by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) in 1982, it has subsequently been reprinted in expanded form over seven editions and twelve printing impressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Hanna, Bronwyn J.

'''''Dead Man Walking''''' is the first [[opera]] by [[Jake Heggie]], with a [[libretto]] by [[Terrence McNally]]. Based on the [[Dead Man Walking (book)|book of the same name]] by Sister [[Helen Prejean]], [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille|C.S.J.]], the work premiered on October 7, [[2000 in music#Opera|2000]], at the [[War Memorial Opera House]], produced by the [[San Francisco Opera]].

==Performance history==
The 2000 premiere production was commissioned by then-General Director [[Lotfi Mansouri]] and the stage director was [[Joe Mantello]]. Sets, costumes and lighting were designed by Michael Yeargen, Sam Fleming, and [[Jennifer Tipton]], respectively. 

The Australian premiere and first performance outside the United States&lt;ref name=shmith&gt;Michael Shmith, "The sister of mercy", ''Sunday Age'', 17 August 2003, Agenda, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; took place in August 2003 at the [[State Opera of South Australia]], with [[Teddy Tahu Rhodes]] as Joseph De Rocher and [[Kirsti Harms]] as Sister Helen.  Helen Prejean was in the audience.&lt;ref name=shmith/&gt; The production was nominated for six [[Helpmann Awards]], winning two: "Best Set Design" and "Best Male in an Operatic Performance". The opera has since been performed numerous times across the United States and in other countries.

The Canadian premiere took place in January 2006 in Calgary, Alberta, with [[Daniel Okulitch]] in the role of Joseph De Rocher. The European premiere was given in May 2006 at the [[Semperoper]] in Dresden, Germany. The same production had its opening night on September 26, 2007, at the [[Theater an der Wien]] in Vienna and also played at the [[Malmö Opera]] in Malmö, Sweden. In 2007 it was revived for limited run at the State Theatre in Sydney and that same year was given its university and Rocky Mountain regional premiere at the University of Colorado at Boulder.&lt;ref&gt;Blomster, Wes (19 October 2007). [http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13089935 "CU Opera presents regional premiere of Heggie's 'Dead Man Walking'"]. ''[[Daily Camera]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It was also produced in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, by the [[Union Avenue Opera Company]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Lavazzi, [http://www.timocel.com/walking_KDHX.html "''Dead Man Walking'' at Union Avenue Opera]", Operatic St. Louis / KDHX, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A new orchestration of the opera, for 31 musicians, prepared under Jake Heggie's direction, was premiered at the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]] Theater in San Francisco in February 2015 by Opera Parallèle.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, Alan (24 February 2015).

== Synopsis ==
:Place: [[Louisiana]]
:Time: 1980s

'''Prologue:''' A teenage boy and a teenage girl are parked near a secluded lake at night, on a date. They have the radio on in their car, and are [[making out]] to its music. The De Rocher brothers, hiding nearby, emerge from the shadows, quietly. One turns the radio off; the two brothers attack the teens. Anthony grabs the boy, who begins struggling; Joseph attacks the girl and begins to [[rape]] her. The boy continues struggling until Anthony shoots him once, at the base of the skull, [[Execution-style murder|execution-style]]; this causes the girl to scream. In a panic, Joseph stabs her until she is silent.

=== Act 1 ===
''Scene 1: Hope House, Sister Helen's mission, run by the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille]]''

Sister Helen, with the aid of some of the other sisters, is teaching the children a [[hymn]]; this hymn, "He Will Gather Us Around", becomes Helen's [[leitmotif]] during the course of the opera. After the children leave, Helen reveals to her colleagues that she has heard from an inmate on death row with whom she has been corresponding. He has asked her to be his spiritual adviser through his execution, and she has decided to accept. The sisters are shocked, warning Helen of the dangers of her position, but she is firm.

''Scene 2: The drive to the prison''

Helen drives to [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] (Angola) and muses on her acceptance of De Rocher's request. She is stopped by a motorcycle policeman for speeding, but he lets her off with a warning after a short humorous soliloquy; "I never gave a ticket to a nun before. Gave a ticket to an IRS agent once… got audited that year. Tell you what…"

''Scene 3: Angola State Prison''

Helen arrives at the prison and is met by Father Grenville, the prison chaplain, who conducts her inside.

''Scene 4: Father Grenville's office''

Father Grenville criticizes Sister Helen's choice to work with De Rocher, claiming that the man is unreachable; he tells her that she's in over her head. Helen responds that it is her duty to attempt to help the man. Father Grenville leaves her to meet with Warden Benton, who asks many of the same questions and also criticizes her decision. He conducts her to [[Death Row]] to meet with De Rocher.

''Scene 5: Death Row''

Warden Benton and Sister Helen walk through Death Row to reach the visiting room. They're heckled by the inmates (chorus) who in turn shout profanities at her and ask her to say prayers for them.

''Scene 6: Death Row visiting room''

Warden Benton conducts De Rocher into the visiting room. He is friendly and easy-going. They converse; he asks her to speak at the pardon board [[hearing (law)|hearing]] on his behalf to have his sentence commuted to life. He seems convinced that she will not return to help him; she assures him that such is not the case.

''Scene 7: The pardon board hearing''

Sister Helen is present with De Rocher's mother and two of his younger brothers, who plead with the pardon board on his behalf. One of Joseph's victims' parents lashes out at her in anger.

''Scene 8: The courthouse parking lot''

The four parents of De Rocher's victims speak angrily to his mother and to Sister Helen, who tries to calm both sides. The parents accuse her of not understanding their pain and sorrow. Word comes from the pardon board; De Rocher has not been granted commutation. Barring [[intercession]] from the [[governor]] for clemency, he is to die for his crime.

''Scene 9: Death Row visiting room''

De Rocher is convinced that Helen has abandoned him; she enters, late, and tells him that she has not and will not. He is angry and rejects all her suggestions to confess and make peace with his actions. The warden enters and tells Helen to leave at once.

''Scene 10: The prison waiting room''

Helen is trying to find money to buy food from the vending machine, having forgotten to eat. She begins to hear the voices, in her head, of the parents, the children at Hope House, Father Grenville, the motorcycle policeman, Warden Benton, and her colleagues, all telling her to stop trying to help De Rocher. The warden enters to tell her that the governor has refused to act to save him, and gives Helen some money for the machine. She stands for a moment, then faints.

=== Act 2 ===
''Scene 1: Joseph De Rocher's prison cell''

A guard enters and tells De Rocher, who is doing pushups, that his [[Capital punishment|execution]] date has been set for August 4. The guard leaves; Joseph muses on his fate.

''Scene 2: Sister Helen's bedroom''

Helen wakes up in terror from a nightmare, alarming Sister Rose, who begs her to stop working with De Rocher. Rose reminds her that she has not slept well since she began helping him. Helen says she cannot; the two women pray for the strength to forgive De Rocher.

''Scene 3: Joseph's cell''

It is the evening of the date set for the execution. De Rocher and Sister Helen are talking; they discover they share a common love for [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]. For the first time he admits that he is afraid. She reassures him, urging him to confess and make peace with what he has done; again he refuses. The warden enters and informs them that his mother is there to see him.

''Scene 4: The visiting room''

Mrs. De Rocher and her two younger sons have arrived. Joseph visits with them, and tries to apologize; she does not hear him, preferring to believe to the end that he is innocent. She complains that she baked him cookies, but was not allowed to bring them in. She asks Helen to take a last picture of the four of them together with the [[camera]] in her [[Handbag|purse]]. The guards lead Joseph away; she looks after him, reminiscing, near tears, eventually losing control. She thanks Helen for all that she has done; Helen promises to take the cookies for her.

''Scene 5: Outside the Death House''

Helen speaks with the victims' parents. One of them, Owen Hart, takes her aside and confesses that he is less sure of what he wants now than he was; he tells her that he and his wife have separated due to the stress they have felt. Helen tries to console him; they agree to part as "Fellow victims of Joseph De Rocher".

''Scene 6/7: Joseph's holding cell''

Helen and De Rocher converse for the last time; she asks him to confess to the murders. This time, something in him snaps; he breaks down and tells her the entire story. He expects Helen to hate him; instead, she says she forgives him, and that she will be "the face of love" for him. He thanks her. Father Grenville enters and begins the final preparations for the execution.

''Scene 8: March to the [[execution chamber]]/The execution chamber''

Guards, inmates, the warden, the parents, the chaplain, and protesters assembled outside the prison sing the [[Lord's Prayer]] as Sister Helen reads a passage from the [[book of Isaiah]]. They approach the death chamber, and Helen is separated from De Rocher. The warden asks if he has any last words; he says he does, and asks forgiveness from the parents of the murdered teenagers. The warden gives the nod, and the execution proceeds. De Rocher dies thanking Helen once again for her love; the opera ends as she stands over his body and sings her hymn one last time.

== Critical reaction ==
Critical reaction to the opera was generally favorable; in particular, critics praised the sharp, finely delineated performances by the principals and the simple yet effective production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.culturalresuena.es/2018/02/dead-man-walking-jake-heggie/|title=¿Venganza o perdón?

Many also found that McNally's [[libretto]] to be among the most finely crafted in recent memory: "the splendid libretto – by turns plainspoken and eloquent, with wonderful splashes of wry humor to lighten the tone when it most needs it – creates the structural backbone of this wrenching drama".&lt;ref name="SFG" /&gt; Although not all of it has been set to music, McNally gave the libretto to Heggie with the express instructions to use whatever portions of it he felt necessary, and to discard the rest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13029">'''Declinism''' is the belief that a [[society]] or [[institution]] is tending towards [[wiktionary:decline|decline]].

==History==
The belief has been traced back to [[Edward Gibbon]]'s work,&lt;ref name="Salon1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Laura|title=Culture is dead — again|url=https://www.salon.com/2015/06/14/culture_is_dead_%E2%80%94_again_its_the_end_of_civilization_as_we_know_it_and_maybe_we_feel_fine/|website=Salon|accessdate=17 April 2018|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', published between 1776 and 1788, where Gibbon argues that Rome collapsed due to the gradual loss of [[civic virtue]] among its citizens,&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, "Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian," ''Daedalus'' 105:3 (1976), 153–169; and in '''[[#Further reading|Further reading]]:''' Pocock, ''EEG'', 303–304; ''FDF'', 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt; who became lazy, spoiled and inclined to hire foreign [[mercenaries]] to handle the defence of state. He believed that that reason must triumph over superstition to save Europe's superpowers from a similar fate to the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Salon1"/&gt;

Spengler's book ''The Decline of the West'', which gave Declinism its popular name,&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"/&gt; was released in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] and captured the pessimistic spirit of the times. Spengler wrote that history had seen the rise and fall of several "civilizations" (including the Egyptian, the Classical, the Chinese and the Mesoamerican). He claimed these go in cycles, typically spanning 1,000 years. Spengler believed that not only is Western Civilization in decline, but that decline is inevitable.&lt;ref name="Salon1"/&gt;

==American declinism==
The [[United States]] in particular has a history of predicting its own downfall, beginning with European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funnell|first1=Antony|title=American Declinism: has collective fear finally become reality?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/futuretense/american-declinism/5865146|website=ABC Radio National|accessdate=29 June 2015|date=2014-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; So called '''American declinism''' has been a recurring topic in the [[politics of the United States]] since the 1950s.

“America is prone to bouts of 'declinism,'” ''[[The Economist]]'' has noted. Historian [[Victor Davis Hansen]] has identified several successive stages of American declinism. During the [[Great Depression]], out-of-work Americans viewed the proud, dynamic “New Germany” with envy. In the 1950s, the success of [[Sputnik 1]] and the spread of [[Communism]] led Americans to fear they were falling behind the [[Soviet Union]]. In the 1970s, Americans fretted over [[Japan|Japan's]] economic boom; two decades later, the [[European Union]] seemed the wave of the future. In the 21st century, America's worries have focused on the rise of [[China]], with its massive exports and new [[Megacity|megacities]]. Yet one after another of these concerns, Hansen points out, proved unfounded: “[[Fascism]] was crushed; Communism imploded; Japan is aging and shrinking; the European Union is cracking apart.”&lt;ref name="CBS News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanson|first1=Victor|title=Beware the boom in American "declinism"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/beware-the-boom-in-american-declinism/|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=CBS News|date=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 book, [[Thomas L. Friedman]] and [[Michael Mandelbaum]] argued that the United States was in the midst of “its fifth wave of Declinism.” The first had come “with the 'Sputnik Shock' of 1957,” the second with the [[Vietnam War]], the third with [[Jimmy Carter]]’s “malaise” and the rise of Japan, the fourth with the ascendancy of China.&lt;ref name="The American Interest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joffe|first1=Josef|title=Declinism’s Fifth Wave|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/12/09/declinisms-fifth-wave/|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=The American Interest|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American declinism can suddenly overtake commentators who had previously taken a sanguine view of the country's prospects. [[Robert Kagan]] has noted, for example, that the pundit [[Fareed Zakaria]], who in 2004 “described the United States as enjoying a 'comprehensive uni-polarity' unlike anything seen since [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]” had, by 2008, begun “writing about the 'post-American world' and 'the rise of the rest.'”&lt;ref name="New Republic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kagan|first1=Robert|title=Not Fade Away|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/99521/america-world-power-declinism|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=New Republic|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a piece which appeared in [[The Nation (United States)|''The Nation'']] on 13 June 2017, author [[Tom Engelhardt]] described [[Donald Trump]] as America's "first declinist candidate for president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Engelhardt|first1=Tom|title= Donald Trump Might Set a Record—for the Biggest Decline of American Power in History|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trump-might-set-a-record-for-the-biggest-decline-of-american-power-in-history/|accessdate=14 June 2017|publisher=''The Nation''|date=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Declinism==
Declinism has been found to be rather widespread in the [[United Kingdom]]. In a 2015 survey, 70% of Britons agreed with the statement that “things are worse than they used to be,” even though at the time Britons were in fact “richer, healthier and longer-living than ever before.”&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Jemima|title=Why we yearn for the good old days|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/11349364/Why-we-yearn-for-the-good-old-days.html|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also mentioned that many of the things that older people mourn from their youths were no longer existent in modern society.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

British historian [[Robert Tombs]] suggested that the [[United Kingdom]] has faced several 'bouts' of Declinism, as far back as the 1880s when [[German Empire|German]] competition in manufactured goods was first felt and then again in the 1960s and 1970s, with economic worries, rapid [[decolonisation]] and a perception of dwindling power and influence in every field. Tombs however, concluded that "Declinism is at best a distortion of reality" and denied suggestions that Britain was no longer the great power it once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tombs|first1=Robert|title=The myth of Britain’s decline|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/07/the-myth-of-britains-decline/|accessdate=17 April 2018|work=The Spectator|date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], declinism has been described as a "booming industry" with popular authors such as [[Michel Onfray]] writing books and articles exploring failings of France and the West.&lt;ref name="NYTFrance"/&gt; French Declinsim has been related to the [[counter-Enlightenment]] of the early 19th century, and also to the late 1970s with the end of three decades of post World War 2 economic growth. In modern times, the phenomenon has picked up velocity and cut across the political spectrum with several variations of  “déclinisme” emerging, from [[Catholic]] [[reactionaries]] to nonreligious thinkers questioning national identity and political corruption.&lt;ref name="NYTFrance"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel|title=France’s Obsession With Decline Is a Booming Industry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/books/france-michel-onfray-decadence.html|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=The New York Times|date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Declinism has been described as “a trick of the mind” and as “an emotional strategy, something comforting to snuggle up to when the present day seems intolerably bleak.”&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

One factor in declinism is the so-called “reminiscence bump,” meaning that older people tend “to best remember events that happened to them at around the ages of 10-30.”&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; As one source puts it, “[t]he vibrancy of youth, and the thrill of experiencing things for the first time, creates a 'memory bump' compared with which later life does seem a bit drab.”&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt; Gopnick suggests that “the idea of our decline is emotionally magnetic, because life is a long slide down, and the plateau just passed is easier to love than the one coming up.” Citing the widespread love of “old songs,” he writes: “The long look back is part of the long ride home. We all believe in yesterday.”&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"/&gt;

Another factor is the so-called positivity effect, meaning that “as people get older, they tend to experience fewer negative emotions, and they’re more likely to remember positive things over negative things.”

Both of these factors can lead people to experience declinism. But so, contrarily, can the “negativity bias,” meaning that “emotionally negative events are likely to have more impact on your thoughts and behaviours than a similar, but positive, event.”&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

==Function==

Alan W. Dowd quotes [[Samuel P. Huntington]] as saying that declinism “performs a useful historical function” in that it “provides a warning and a goad to action in order to head off and reverse the decline that it says is taking place.” Dowd himself agrees, saying that declinism at its best “is an expression of the American tendency toward self-criticism and continual improvement.”&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Alan|title=Declinism|url=http://www.hoover.org/research/declinism|accessdate=21 December 2016|publisher=Hoover|date=August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josef Joffe]], on the contrary, emphasizes the fact “that obsessively fretting about your possible decline can be a good way to produce it.”&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"/&gt; Similarly, Robert Kagan has expressed concern that Americans are “in danger of committing pre-emptive superpower suicide out of a misplaced fear of their own declining power.”&lt;ref name="New Republic"/&gt;

The '''demise of the Crown''' is the legal term for the end of a [[reign]] by a [[king]], [[queen regnant]], or [[emperor]], whether by [[death]] or [[abdication]].

==Commonwealth realms==
The term was coined in English law to signify the immediate transfer ([[Law French]] ''demise'', "sending down [the line of succession]", from Latin ''demiss''-[gender ending], the [[perfect participle]] of ''demittere'', having the same meaning), of sovereignty and [[royal prerogative]]s to the late king or queen's successor without [[interregnum]]. The word "[[demise]]" is sometimes mistakenly interpreted as referring to the death of the Sovereign rather than to the transfer of the Crown. This erroneous meaning is undermined by the principle in [[constitutional law]] of the continuity of the monarchy, as expressed in the ancient [[Medieval]] maxim "[[the Crown]] never dies" expressed by [[Sir William Blackstone]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Halsbury's Laws of England]] ''Crown and Royal family'' Volume 12 (2) &lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the Crown's demise, in the [[United Kingdom]], a meeting of the [[Accession Council]] is held in [[London]] in order to give directions for the proclamation of the late monarch's successor. This meeting is to arrange for the formalities; neither the identity nor the accession to the throne of the next monarch depends on it. The proclamation takes place at [[St James's Palace]], [[Charing Cross]], within the City Boundary at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]], and the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]]. In [[Canada]] the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] meets in [[Ottawa]] to perform the same functions, as does Australia's [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]] in [[Canberra]], the [[Executive Council of New Zealand]] in [[Wellington]] and equivalent bodies in the remaining [[Commonwealth realm|Realms]] as their shared Monarch holds each of the Crown separately from the others in a [[personal union]].

Historically, the demise of the Crown resulted in the immediate [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolution of Parliament]]. This no longer happens. The [[Succession to the Crown Act 1707]]  provides that in the event of the demise of the Crown, Parliament, if adjourned or prorogued, must meet as soon as possible and if sitting must immediately proceed to act without any summons in the usual form.&lt;ref name=lordscompanion&gt;{{cite web |last=Pownall |first=Michael |title=Companion to the Standing Orders and Guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords |at=Chapter 2 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso05.htm#a24 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |authorlink=Michael Pownall |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-10-847241-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, under the [[Representation of the People Act 1985]], if the demise of the Crown occurs during a [[general election]], the vote is postponed by fourteen days.

At the first meeting of Parliament under a new monarch there is no [[speech from the Throne]]. All [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] and members of the [[House of Lords]] take an [[oath of allegiance]] to the new Sovereign. The House votes an Address to the Crown in response to the official notification of the previous monarch's demise, expressing condolences upon the death of the previous monarch and pledging loyalty to his or her successor.

All [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|civil service]] and Crown offices also, traditionally, became vacant upon the demise of the Crown. As all staff were employees of the monarch, their employment would end upon the death of the monarch thus all civil servants would have to be rehired and swear out oaths to the new king or queen. The [[Demise of the Crown Act 1901]] in the UK, and similar legislation in other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, now makes this process unnecessary – they are all employees of [[the Crown]], rather than any particular Sovereign.

The demise of the Crown also brought all legal proceedings to an end, until this rule was abolished by the [[Demise of the Crown Act 1702]].

The [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of the new monarch usually occurs within eighteen months, but is not necessary to secure the succession.

==East Asia==
Similar terms are also used in East Asian civilizations, mostly due to [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese cultural influence]]:

===China===
In ancient [[China]], "駕崩" (jiàbēng, "mounting the collapse") or "晏駕" (yànjià) were used to refer to the passing of the [[Emperor of China]], the Empress, or the [[Empress Dowager]]. "宾天" (bīntiān) was also used as a euphemism, to show that the Emperor has become a guest in [[Tian|Heaven]].

The ''[[Book of Rites]]'' mentioned that different words were also used in [[Fengjian|feudal times]] when referring to the deaths of people, by their respective social classes: "薨" (hōng) was used for feudal vassals and higher officials, "卒" (zú) for the king's adviser, "不禄" (bùlù) for officials, and "死" (sǐ) for commoners. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/9/6/20/n2564210.htm Epochtimes.com] 「天子死曰『崩』，諸侯曰『薨』，大夫曰『卒』，士曰『不祿』，庶人曰『死』。」&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], "崩御" (hōgyo, "the Emperor has collapsed") is used as a respectful term to refer to the passing of the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] or any monarch. It also had an additional meaning, "to be hidden": as the Emperor of Japan was considered as a [[Arahitogami|descendant]] of the solar goddess [[Amaterasu]], his passing was also interpreted as "the sun has been hidden behind the clouds".

Other terms similar to those used in the ''Book of Rites'' are also used in Japan, in the event of a royal's passing. "薨御" (kōgyo) is used for the passing of the Empress of Japan, "薨去" (kōkyo) is used for the passing of the Crown Prince or a third-rank member of the Imperial Household, and "卒去" (sokkyo, shukkyo) is used for fourth-rank or fifth-rank members of the Imperial Household.

==Southeast Asia==
In [[Brunei]], "ليندوڠ" (lindung) is used in the [[Malay language]] to refer the passing of the [[Sultan of Brunei]] or the Raja Isteri. For other members of the royal family, "مڠکت" (mangkat) is used instead.

In [[Malaysia]], "مڠکت" (mangkat) is used in the [[Malay language]] to refer the passing of the [[Conference of Rulers|Malay Rulers]] and other members of the nine Malay royal families.

In [[Thailand]], "สวรรคต" (sà-wǎn-kót) is used in the [[Thai language]] to refer a high-ranking royal person like the [[King of Thailand]] and the [[Crown Prince of Thailand]]. The term was derived from the [[Sanskrit]] language term "svargagata" (स्वर्गगत), which means "has gone to [[Svarga|Heaven]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1681">'''"Dictated but not read"''' is a phrase used at the end of a text to warn that the written material has not been personally written or verified by the [[author]]. The material may have been [[Dictation (exercise)|dictated]] to a [[secretary]] when the author had no time to proofread or edit it. 

This practice is more common within the medical community, though its appropriateness is still debated.&lt;ref&gt;Shere S. ''Not reading and signing letters you have dictated is dangerous.'' BMJ. 2001 Apr 21;322(7292):992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7310/448 BMJ (British Medical Journal)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The phrase is used to indicate a need for extra care in reading the document so annotated. It may be intended as a [[disclaimer]] to limit [[legal liability]].

It may be used at the end of an article to warn the reader that the written material has not been personally written by the author, who likely dictated it to a secretary, but they did not have the time to write it themselves. Very busy people may be expected to sign off their article with such notation. However, it may be regarded as disrespectful, especially when the writer is deemed not busy.

It is commonly used to sign off on correspondence where formality takes a backseat to speedy communications, or where such correspondence is routine. When this is not the case, it may be a discourtesy to the recipient of the letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?z=y&amp;ean=9780671723651&amp;displayonly=EXC How to Win Friends and Influence People], ''Dale Carnegie''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''escalation archetype''' is one of possible types of system behaviour that are known as [[System Archetypes|system archetypes]].

The escalation archetype is common for situations of [[non-cooperative game]]s where each player can make own decisions and these decisions lead to the outcome for the player. However, when both player try to maximize their output (at the expense of the other one) they can get into a loop where each player will try harder and harder to surpass the opponent. While it can have favourable consequences it can also lead to [[self-destructive behaviour]].

== Structure ==

=== Elements of archetype ===

Escalation archetype system can be described using causal loop diagrams which may consist of balancing and reinforcing loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Bellinger|first=Gene|author-link=Gene Bellinger |title=Archetypes - Interaction Structures of the Universe|url=http://www.systems-thinking.org/arch/arch.htm#arches|website=Systems Thinking|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Balancing loop ====

Balancing loop is a structure representing [[negative feedback]] process. In such a structure, a change in system leads to actions that usually eliminate the effect of that change which means that the system tends to remain stable in time.

==== Reinforcing loop ====

Balancing loop is a structure representing [[positive feedback]] process. This reinforcing feedback causes that even a small change in the system can lead to huge disturbances, e.g. variable A is increased which leads to an increase of variable B which leads to another increase of A and so there might be an [[exponential growth]] over time.

=== Escalation archetype as balancing loops ===
The image below shows escalation archetype as two balancing loops. 
When X makes an action, it leads to a change in results of X relative to results of Y. Y then makes action to equalize the situation and the result again changes the balance and induces another action by X. As this repeats actions done by X and Y are bigger and bigger to keep up with other's actions and results.
[[File:Escalation Archetype - two balancing loops.jpg|framed|none|Escalation archetype as two balancing loops displayed as causal loop diagram]]

=== Escalation archetype as reinforcing loop ===
The causal loop diagram below shows escalation archetype as a single reinforcing loop. It can be read simply as that more action done by X creates bigger results of action done by X. The bigger results of X, the bigger difference between X and Y results. The bigger difference means more action by Y and more action by Y leads to bigger result of Y. The bigger result of Y leads to a smaller difference between X and Y, but the smaller is this difference, the bigger will be the action of X and it starts all over again.
[[File:Escalation archetype - one reinforcing loop.jpg|framed|none|Escalation archetype as one reinforcing loop displayed as causal loop diagram]]

The image below simplifies reinforcing loop and shows general idea of what happens. Increased activity of X leads to an increase of threat for Y which leads to an increased activity by Y. Increased activity by Y leads to increased threat for X which creates another potential for activity of X to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Senge|first1=Peter M.|title=The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization|date=2006|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-47764-4|page=199}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Arms race ===
A well known example of escalation archetype is the [[arms race]]. The idea is that in the arms race two (or more) parties are competing to have the strongest army and weapons. An example is the race in producing nuclear weapons by the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] that was an important factor in the [[Cold War]]. Over the time, each party can get temporarily a slight advantage, but then the other one produces or obtains in other way more weapons and gets the advantage on its side, temporarily. In the end, both parties have great military power that is very threatening not only to them but also to non-aligned parties.

=== Picking apples in an orchard ===

The escalation archetype can turn up in situations like picking apples in an orchard. Imagine a big apple orchard with a wealthy crop. An owner of such plantation cannot pick the whole harvest himself because there are simply too many trees. Therefore, he employs gatherers to do the work for him. He tries to figure a way how to measure the work they do so that he can reward them fairly. As he is suspicious that workers would work slowly he is hesitant to link the wage only to hours worked and he comes up with an idea. He divides workers into two groups and declares that the group which will harvest more apples will get a bonus to their regular wage.

Both groups start harvesting apples with passion and energy. First group X collects a pallet a little bit sooner than the second group Y. Therefore, the Y group motivates those who were a little bit slacking to increase their pace. Now Y is a little bit better so they not only catch up but even finish the second load before X group. The X comes with an idea that they should assign roles to their members – some will pick apples from the upper part of trees using ladders while some will collect those that are in the lower part of trees, other will load packs and one person will organise the work and help where necessary. This advantage enables X group to outrun the other again. While Y adapts the model of X, they make some changes and tweaks and soon they are the leading party. This improving of processes continues in several iterations until both parties are exceptionally effective in harvesting apples on the orchard. The owner can be really happy with the situation as containers are quickly being loaded with apples. Should everything continue this way, the orchard could be harvested in few hours with group X beating the group Y by a tenth of a percent. He could reward only the winning team or both teams because they were almost equally hardworking.

However, due to the fact that one group was always a little bit behind, the situation in the middle of day is bad for one of the groups which is slightly behind, let's say it is group Y. Now, they can continue working like up to that moment and they would finish second with a loss of a tenth of a percent. Or they can come up with another idea that would enable them to increase their production output. They have an idea that harvesting topmost apples is slower that harvesting the rest of them. Because of that they decide to skip these apples and only collect the others. This way, the situation escalated into a trouble. While Y could win the competition now, there will be considerable amount of apples left on trees. Or if both groups are instructed not to leave a single apple in the orchard they will have to stay much longer to finish these apples thus the owner will have higher costs for their wage.

Of course the owner could set a condition that none team could leave a tree that until it is fully harvested. That would help in some way to break the escalation archetype unless workers realize they are not punished for some other undesirable behaviour, for example being careless of tree condition after the harvest.

As can be seen in this example, the escalation archetype might bring positive results (faster harvesting) but it is necessary to monitor behaviour of the affected system to ensure long-term prosperity.

=== The attention fight ===

To avoid naming in this example of escalation archetype occurrence, behaviour of imaginary persons Amy, Betty, Cecile and Danielle is described.

Amy, Betty, Cecile and Danielle want to become famous celebrities with a lot of money, loving husband and amazing children. They already have many friends and everybody in the town knows each one of them. They all work hard to be best in their field of expertise and soon they are known to the whole country. They know of each other and try to work harder to become more famous than each other. This is when escalation archetype comes into play. They become the most famous celebrities in the country and each one of them realizes that to draw more attention than others they need to be unique and very special. As Amy starts to work even harder than before Betty notices that Amy's fame is growing more than hers and starts to work harder than Amy. This is noted by Cecile and she does what must be done - starts working more than anyone else. But there is also Danielle whose ambitions are not even slightly smaller, she wants to be the most famous celebrity and so she starts working even harder than anyone else. As Amy notices her effort is not sufficient, she does what is obvious - starts to work more than she was.

Now this cycle could repeat continuously until Amy, Betty, Cecile or Danielle dies of overwork. In the meanwhile some of them could start taking drugs with the presumption that it could boost their productivity and ability to concentrate or with the aim to get rid of depressions from working all the time. Another solution presumed by them as feasible would be some way of elimination the opponents - by false accusation or by pointing to their faults.

Or if they found it impossible to be better by simply working more, they could try to figure out some way how to attract attention by qualitative change instead of quantitative. This way Amy could say something shocking in TV. The issue is that due to escalation archetype being in place unfortunately. Betty could simply follow by saying something even more shocking or controversial. Then, Cecile would feel threatened and so she will come up with an idea that she could make controversial photographs. Then Danielle will try to surpass everyone and will do some action that will attract attention of media and public. And they would escalate this to extreme situation (as the behaviour can develop exponentially).

While at the beginning the competitiveness was beneficial for both Amy, Betty, Cecile, Danielle and public, in the long term many issues raised.

What could be a meaningful solution for these ladies? They could have set some limits themselves in their minds, for example how much time they are willing to work to achieve their desire to be a famous celebrity and what is alright to do and what is not. If they are not able to do so, there has to be some mechanism from outside to stop them - e.g. family or friend giving them an advice, as it would be difficult to set legal boundaries in this area.

=== Competing children ===

Tendency of parents to compare their children creates nourishing environment for escalation archetype. Parents tend to compare their kids with other children and among own kids. This creates pressure on children as they are expected to perform well.

Imagine a family with two kids named, for example, Lisa and Bartolomeo. Their parents are very much children-focused and hope their kids will get proper educations and live what they consider successful lives. They invest significant portions of both their family budget and time into both children and hope that this investment will pay off in the form of Lisa and Bartolomeo being successful in school and later in life.

Lisa and Bartolomeo are usual children with some hobbies who study diligently but without extreme passion. They simply do what they got to do. Their results are good but not perfect. So their parents come and start the escalation archetype by telling the kids that the one with better marks will go on special holiday of her or his choice. As both Lisa and Bartolomeo like travelling a lot, they start to study hard. To satisfaction of their parents  children's marks get soon better which is very positive outcome. Yet a problem arises. As they both study really hard to keep pace with the other one, something might go wrong.

For example, when Bartolomeo is very creative and skillful painter but not so talented in studying usual subjects like math or languages. Sooner or later he will reach his limits. Then to keep up the good marks he will have to abandon his painting hobby and his talent will be wasted. Or he will try to sustain great marks and then Bartolomeo will start cheating during exams.

However even when no negative effect happens there will be a difficulty how to reward children after Bartolome finishes second very closely. Should their parents appreciate only Lisa's effort or acknowledge also Bartolomeo's achievements. When they reward only Lisa, Bartolomeo could easily become demotivated and then it would be impossible to make use of positive effects of escalation archetype. On the other hand, rewarding both could mean the same and for both children as they realise that their extra effort does not have necessarily mean better outcome.

There is also an '''alternative version of how competition''' amongst children '''can be affected by escalation archetype'''. When all parents motivate children to improve in comparison to their peers, they will all study harder and harder while the differences amongst participating kids will remain relatively stable (and if teachers increase requirements they will even retain their marks). Under such simple circumstances most children might benefit from the competition nevertheless children with weaker intellectual skill may become isolated when they are no longer able to pursue others. Reversely in another alternative scenario where all children are demotivated to study for some reason, their results are worse and worse (and if teachers decrease requirements they will retain their marks while being less educated) and downward spiral is working in a way that situation gets worse and worse.

== Risks and opportunities ==

The dangers of systems with escalation archetypes are various. First, it might be difficult to identify the existence of archetype at the first sight. Then the behaviour of the system might look desirable at first and therefore requiring no immediate action. Another risk is a possibility of exponential growth within such structure. Finally the system might have different outcome in short term and long term.

Escalation archetype comes with a possibility to make a big change in the system with a little input or a small action done at the beginning (due to the fact that it behaves like reinforcing loop).

== Solution and optimization ==

To remove downward or upward spiral effect of escalation archetype there is a change in the system necessary which breaks the ongoing pattern. That change is typically switching the actors from [[non-cooperative game]] mode to [[cooperative game]] behaviour so that they stop escalating their actions to keep with others and rather find mutual solution and movement.

The '''flag of [[Brunei]]''' has a centered [[crest of Brunei]] on a [[yellow]] field cut by [[black]] and [[white]] diagonal stripes ([[parallelogram]]s at an angle). The yellow field represents the [[sultan of Brunei]]. The [[red]] [[crest of Brunei|crest]] consists of a [[crescent]] facing upwards, joined with a [[parasol]], with hands on the sides. Black and white stripes run across the flag.

In [[Southeast Asia]], yellow is traditionally the color of [[Royal family|royalty]], and the royal standards of [[list of Malaysian flags#Monarch|Malaysia]] and [[Royal Standard of Thailand|Thailand]], and the [[flag of Sarawak]], along with the presidential [[flag of Indonesia]], all use a yellow field as well. The crescent symbolizes [[Islam]], the parasol symbolizes monarchy, and the hands at the side symbolize the benevolence of the government. The black and white stripes represent Brunei's chief ministers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Geographic Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvl_AAAAMAAJ|year=1935|publisher=National Geographic Society|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were once joint-[[regent]]s and then – after the sultan came of age – senior advisors: the [[Pengiran]] [[Bendahara]] (First Minister, symbolised by a slightly thicker white stripe) and the Pengiran Pemancha (Second Minister, governing foreign affairs, symbolised by black), with the white stripe being roughly 12% wider than the black one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Flag Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDIrAQAAIAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Flag Research Center|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report: Brunei|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBofAQAAMAAJ|year=1946|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the crescent is the national motto in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: “Always render service with God's guidance” ({{lang|ar|الدائمون المحسنون بالهدى}}).
Below this is a banner inscribed with ''Brunei Darussalam'', which means ‘Brunei, the Abode of Peace’ ({{lang|ar|بروني دارالسلام‎}})

==History==

The flag in its present form, except for the crest, has been in use since 1906 when Brunei became a [[Protectorate#British and Commonwealth protectorates|British protectorate]], following the signing of an agreement between Brunei and Great Britain. Even though Brunei was only nominally independent after this, Bruneians retained certain symbols like the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horton|first=A. V. M.|title=The British residency in Brunei, 1906-1959|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDQvAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Centre for South-East Asian Studies|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crest was superimposed in 1959 after the promulgation of the Constitution of 29 September 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.information.gov.bn/VER2/content/view/594/188/1/7/ |title=The Brunei Darussalam State Flag |publisher=Information Department, Prime Minister's Office |accessdate=23 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design was retained when the country gained full independence on 1 January 1984 as ''Brunei Darussalam'' (Brunei, Abode of Peace).

The standard of Her Majesty the Raja Isteri is light yellow, incorporating the Sultan's crest on red background at the centre of the standard.

The Perdana [[vizier|Wazir]] has also a personal standard granted to him by His Majesty the Sultan. The standard is white superimposed in the centre with the state crest in light yellow. The crest is supported by ''si kikil'', a [[kris]] crossed by its sheath.

The personal standards of the Pengiran Bendahara, Pengiran Digadong, Pengiran Pemancha and Pengiran Temenggong (senior ministers) are white, green, black and red respectively.

The Sultan had also bestowed personal flags to lesser officials known as Pengiran Cheteria and to Pengiran and other subjects.

Among the Pengiran and dignitaries who are authorised to use personal standards are:

# Descendants of a sultan, down to four generations,
# Descendants of a ''wazir'', down to three generations,
# Descendants of a ''cheteria'', down to two generations,
# From ''[[mantri|menteri]]'' (non-noble officials) to ''damong'' (chiefs).

Their personal standards incorporate the state crest in red on a yellow background at the top left corner of the flags.

The '''national flag of Curaçao''' represents the country of [[Curaçao]] as well as the island area within the [[Netherlands Antilles]] from 1984 until [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|its dissolution]] in 2010. The flag was not flown for [[Curaçao and Dependencies]] for which the [[flag of the Netherlands]] was used.

The flag is a blue field with a horizontal yellow stripe slightly below the midline and two white, five-pointed stars in the [[Flag terminology|canton]]. The blue symbolises the sea and sky (the bottom and top blue sections, respectively) divided by a yellow stroke representing the bright sun which bathes the island. The two stars represent Curaçao and Klein Curaçao, but also 'Love and Happiness'{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}. The five points on each star symbolise the five continents from which Curaçao's people come.

The horizontal stripes have a ratio of 5:1:2 (blue:yellow:blue).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Curaçao|url = http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/cw.html|website = www.crwflags.com|accessdate = 2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stars have diameters 1/6 and 2/9 of the flag height. The centre of the smaller one is 1/6 the flag height from the left and top edges, and the centre of the larger is 1/3 from the left and top edges. The blue is [[Pantone]] 280, and the yellow, Pantone 102.

The flag was designed in 1984 by Martin den Dulk. Curaçao had organized a small competition to choose the annual flag that will represent them. Martin den Dulk was one of the many participants but his interpretation of the flag won the judges over. His design won first place and his flag became the flag of Curaçao.

After [[Aruba]]'s adoption of [[Flag of Aruba|its own flag]] (while still part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]), Curaçao received approval for a flag in 1979. Two thousand designs were submitted to a special council; ten were shortlisted, and the council decided on 29 November 1982. With some modifications, the flag was adopted on 2 July 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.es/USERS/jolle/antilla2.htm boletin8-history-antillas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602192253/http://www.ctv.es/USERS/jolle/antilla2.htm |date=2013-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international relations]], a '''frozen conflict''' is a situation in which [[war|active armed conflict]] has been brought to an end, but no [[peace treaty]] or other political framework resolves the conflict to the satisfaction of the combatants. Therefore, legally the conflict can start again at any moment, creating an environment of insecurity and instability.

The term has been commonly used for [[post-Soviet conflicts]], but it has also often been applied to other perennial [[territorial dispute]]s.&lt;ref name="tisdall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/22/frozen-conflict-spreads-across-globe |title=This dangerous new world of self-interested nations |author=Simon Tisdall |publisher=The Guardian |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots591=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=133740 |title=North and South Korea: A Frozen Conflict on the Verge of Unfreezing? |publisher=Isn.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12494503 |title=Europe: Frozen conflicts |publisher=The Economist |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[de facto]]'' situation that emerges may match the ''[[de jure]]'' position asserted by one party to the conflict; for example, [[Russia]] claims and effectively controls [[Crimea]] following the [[2014 Crimean crisis]] despite [[Ukraine]]'s continuing claim to the region. Alternatively, the ''de facto'' situation may not match either side's official claim. The [[division of Korea]] is an example of the latter situation: both the [[Republic of Korea]] and the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] officially assert claims to the entire peninsula; however, there exists a well-defined border between the two countries' areas of control.

Frozen conflicts sometimes result in [[partially recognized state]]s. For example, the [[Republic of South Ossetia]], a product of the frozen [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict]], is [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|recognized]] by eight other states, including five UN members; the other three of these entities are partially recognized states themselves.

==Examples==
{{History Of The Cold War}}
===In post-Soviet territories===
{{main|Post-Soviet conflicts}}
Following the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, a number of [[Post-Soviet conflicts|conflicts]] arose in areas of some of the [[post-Soviet states]], usually where the new international borders did not match the [[ethnic]] affiliations of local populations. These conflicts have largely remained "frozen", with disputed areas under the ''de facto'' control of entities other than the countries to which they are internationally recognized as belonging, and which still consider those areas to be part of their territory.

Since the ceasefire which ended the [[Transnistria War]] (1990–1992), the [[Russia]]n-influenced breakaway republic of [[Transnistria]] has controlled the easternmost strip of the territory of [[Moldova]]. The republic is internationally unrecognized, and Moldova continues to claim the territory.

Nagorno-Karabakh is a [[List of territorial disputes|disputed territory]], internationally recognized as part of [[Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.un.org/press/en/2008/ga10693.doc.htm|title=General Assembly adopts resolution reaffirming territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, demanding withdrawal of all Armenian forces|publisher=United Nations| date=14 March 2008| accessdate =30 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the region is governed by the [[Republic of Artsakh]] (formerly named Nagorno-Karabakh Republic), a ''de facto'' independent state with Armenian ethnic majority established on the basis of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Azerbaijan has not exercised political authority over the region since the advent of the [[Karabakh movement]] in 1988. Since the end of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] in 1994, representatives of the governments of [[Armenia]] and Azerbaijan have been holding peace talks mediated by the [[OSCE Minsk Group]] on the region's disputed status.

The [[Abkhaz–Georgian conflict]] and [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict]] have led to the creation of two largely unrecognized states within the internationally recognized territory of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The [[1991–92 South Ossetia War]] and the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)]], followed by the [[Russo-Georgian War]] of August 2008, have left the Russian-backed [[Republic of South Ossetia]] and [[Republic of Abkhazia]] in ''de facto'' control of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions in north and northwest Georgia.

In 2014, [[Crimea]] was occupied by the Russian troops without insignia while [[Ukraine]] was still recovering from large scale violence in the capital, and soon afterwards was admitted into the [[Russian Federation]]. This is widely regarded as an [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of the peninsula by Russia]], and is considered likely to result in another post-Soviet frozen conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/27/opinion/ukraine-crimea-russia/ Will Ukraine's Crimea region be Europe's next 'frozen' conflict?], CNN, Feb 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While there are similarities between Transnistria, Abkhazia and the 2014–2015 [[War in Donbass]], where the unrecognized [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Lugansk People's Republic]] have taken ''de facto'' control of areas in the [[Donbass]] region in eastern Ukraine, the conflict in Donbass is not a frozen conflict yet as ceasefire violations are keeping the fighting on a low burner. However, some experts predict a frozen future for this conflict as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepoliticon.net/analytics/291-ukraine-towards-a-frozen-future.html Rusif Huseynov.

===Others in Asia===
[[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have fought at least three wars over the disputed region of [[Kashmir]] in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1999|1999]]. India claims the entire area of the former princely state of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]], of which it administers approximately 43%. Its claims are contested by Pakistan, which controls approximately 37% of the region and urges for plebiscite in Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1209319 | title=PM Nawaz urges Ban Ki-moon for plebiscite in Kashmir | date=28 September 2015 | work=Dawn | accessdate=23 March 2017 | author=Irfan Haider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pkkh"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.defence.pk/forums/central-south-asia/233237-pak-india-dialogue-single-point-agenda-kashmir-pkkh-tv.html| title=PAK-INDIA Dialogue: Single-Point-Agenda: KASHMIR | date=4 February 2013 | agency=PKKH | accessdate=18 August 2013 | author=Durrani, Atiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining territory is controlled by the People's Republic of China, with which India is again in dispute and have fought the [[Sino-Indian War]].

The [[Cross-Strait relations|conflict between mainland China and Taiwan]] remains frozen since 1949. Both the [[People's Republic of China]] in the Mainland and the [[Republic of China]] in [[Taiwan]] consider the other to be part of its territory. While the latter especially is not recognized by a majority of countries and states internationally, it remains a ''de facto'' independent administration in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, and PRC's ''de facto'' administration remains in the Mainland.

The [[division of Korea]] was frozen from 1953, when a ceasefire ended the [[Korean War]]; until 27 April 2018, when the two countries agreed to [[April 2018 inter-Korean summit|end the war]] formally. Both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] governments claim the entire peninsula, while ''de facto'' control is divided along the military demarcation line in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].

Hostilities of the 1991 [[Gulf War]] ended when the [[United Nations]] and [[Iraq]] signed a [[ceasefire]] agreement on April 3, 1991; Kuwait was liberated from being annexed by Iraq and its sovereignty was recognized by the latter. Due to sporadic conflicts through the [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], the war remained frozen for the time being until 12 years later when the [[United States]] and its "[[Coalition of the willing]]" launched the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] and removed dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] from power over the non-compliance with [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq|UN Resolutions passed against Iraq]] following the 1991 war.

The [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] is a perennial conflict between [[Israel]] and its Arab neighbours, including the [[Palestinian territories]]. Israel refuses to recognize [[Palestinian statehood]] without an assured peace deal, while some Arab countries and groups refuse to recognize Israel. Israel has ''de facto'' control of [[East Jerusalem]] and claims it as its integral territory, although it is not internationally recognized as such. Similarly most of the [[Golan Heights]] are currently under ''de facto'' Israeli control and civil administration, whereas the international community rejects that claim.

===Others in Europe and Africa===
The dispute over the [[Kosovo status process|status of Kosovo]] remains frozen since the end of the [[Kosovo War]], fought in 1998–1999 between Yugoslav forces ([[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]]) and the ethnically Albanian [[Kosovo Liberation Army]]. The [[Kosovo]] region has been administered independently since the war, and the Republic of Kosovo declared its independence from [[Serbia]] in 2008, but it is not recognized by all countries worldwide, and Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/09/kosovo.eu|title=Ian Bancroft: A new frozen conflict in Kosovo?|last=Bancroft|first=Ian|date=2008-06-09|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jamestown.org/program/kosovo-russias-fifth-frozen-conflict/|title=KOSOVO: RUSSIA'S FIFTH FROZEN CONFLICT? - Jamestown|work=Jamestown|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Afghan society]] is consistent in its attitudes toward the underlying principles of gender. It is the application of these principles that varies from group to group; and there is a wide range of standards set for accepted female behavior, as well as differences in male attitudes toward correct treatment of women. Contradictions arise between traditional customary practices, many of which impinge on the [[rights of women]] and are alien to the spirit of [[Islam]], the other functioning [[Canon (sociology)|canon]] which emphasizes equality, justice, education and community service for both men and women. Further, the dictates of Islam are themselves subject to diverse interpretation among reformists, [[Islamists]] and [[ultraconservatives]]. Debates between these groups can be highly volatile.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;[[Nancy Hatch Dupree]] and [[Thomas E. Gouttierre]]. "Gender Roles". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/aftoc.html ''Afghanistan country study'']. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (1997). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender reform was central to the contentious issues which brought about the fall of [[King Amanullah]] in 1929. In 1959, the male-oriented government of Prime Minister [[Mohammed Daoud Khan|Daud Khan]] supported the voluntary removal of the [[veil]] and the end of seclusion for women. The 1964 [[Constitution of Afghanistan|Constitution]] automatically enfranchised women and guaranteed them the right to education and freedom to work.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==History==

For thirty years after 1959 growing numbers of women, most from urban backgrounds, functioned in the public arena with dignity, with no loss of honour to themselves or to their families. Nevertheless, family pressures, traditional attitudes and religious opposition continued to impose constraints which limited the degree to which women could find self-expression and control their lives.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Except in [[Kabul]] where women under the [[PDPA]] were encouraged to assume more assertive public roles, this evolutionary movement came to a halt in 1978. Conservative [[mujahidin]] leaders waging a [[jihad]] (struggle) against foreign encroachment, both military and ideological, were imbued with the belief that sexual anarchy and social ruin would result if women continued to move freely in public. These attitudes intensified under the [[Taliban]]. Mostly rural [[Pushtun]] from strongly patriarchal backgrounds, the Taliban projected ultraconservative interpretations of Islam and apply customary practices as societal ideals. In 1996, gender issues were again at the centre of heated debate.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Women==

All agree that differences between men and women exist and are best preserved through recognized standards of behavior. None dispute the centrality of women in the society. Respect for women is a notable characteristic and few wish to destroy this esteemed status, nor deny what Islam enjoins or [[Afghan culture]] values. The argument rages over definitions of precisely what constitutes honorable behavior for women in terms of modern realities, especially in the light of today's monumental reconstruction needs which demand full participation from every [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] citizen.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The current zealous need to protect women's morality stems from the fact that Afghan society regards women as the perpetrators of the ideals of the society. As such they symbolize honor—of family, community and nation—and must be controlled as well as protected so as to maintain moral purity. By imposing strict restraints directly on women, the society's most sensitive component symbolizing male honor, authorities convey their intent to subordinate personal autonomy and thereby strengthen the impression that they are capable of exercising control over all aspects of social behaviour, male and female.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The practice of [[purdah]], seclusion, ([[Persian language|Persian]], literally meaning curtain), including veiling, is the most visible manifestation of this attitude. This concept includes an insistence on separate spaces for men and women and proscriptions against interactions between the sexes outside the [[mahrammat]] (acceptable male guardians such as father, brother son and any other male with whom a woman may not marry). These restrictions severely limit women's activities, including access to education and employment outside the home. Many are largely confined to their homes.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Such restrictions are deemed necessary by conservative males because they consider women socially immature, with less moral control and physical restraint; women's [[hypersexuality]] precludes responsible behavior. Consequently, women are untrustworthy and must be kept behind the curtain so as not to disrupt the social order. The need for their isolation therefore is paramount.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

=== Roles for Women ===

The status and power of a girl increases as she moves from child to bride to mother to grandmother. A successful marriage with many sons is the principal goal of Afghan women, wholeheartedly shared by Afghan men. Women's nurturing roles are also crucial. This does not mean that women are confined to domestic roles. The stereotyping of Afghan women as [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] living lives of unremitting labor, valued by men solely for sexual pleasure and reproductive services is patently false.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} 

In Afghanistan, ranked the worst country in the world to be born a girl, some parents are [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/22/girls-boys-afghanistan-daughters-raised-as-sons-puberty-bacha-posh bringing up their daughters as sons]. Then comes puberty and the ‘bacha posh’ (Afghan girls raised as boys) are expected to switch back to their original gender role.

Women's work varies from group to group. Among most settled rural families, women participate in agricultural work only during light harvesting periods, and are responsible for the production of milk products. Some specialize in handicrafts such as carpet and felt making. In contrast, [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]] women plow the fields while the men herd the flocks and process the dairy products. [[Nomad]]ic women care for young lambs and kids and make a wide variety of dairy products, for sale as well as family use. They spin the wool sheared by men and weave the fabric from which their tents are made. Felt-making for [[yurt]] coverings and household rugs ia also a female activity. When on the move, it is the women who put up and take down the tents. The variations are endless.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Although statistics indicate that by 1978 women were joining the workforce in increasing numbers, only about eight percent of the female population received an income. Most of these women lived in urban centers, and the majority were professionals, technicians and administrators employed by the government which continued its strong support. A majority worked in health and education, the two sectors considered most appropriate for women as they are extensions of traditional women's roles. Others worked in the police, the army, and with the airlines; in government textile, ceramic, food processing and prefab construction factories. A few worked in private industry; a few were self-employed.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The current revival of conservative attitudes toward appropriate extradomestic roles for women and the criticism of women's visibility in public has largely impacted these professional women. Islamic texts do not delineate roles for women. What they imply is open to interpretation. What they command is equality and justice guaranteeing that women be treated as in no way lesser than men. Educated Afghan women are standing fast in their determination to find ways in which they may participate in the nation's reconstruction according to their interpretations of Islam's tenets. This is a powerful challenge now facing the society.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Private and Public Behaviour==

[[Afghan women]] view their [[human sexuality|sexuality]] more positively and question male maturity and self-control. In reality the differences between private and public behavior are significant. In private, there is a noticeable sharing of ideas and responsibilities and in many households individual charisma and strength of character surmounts conventional subordinate roles. Even moral misconduct can be largely overlooked until it becomes a matter of public knowledge. Then punishment must be severe for male and [[family honour]] must be vindicated. As a result, [[urban area|urban]] women are models of reticence in public and rural women appear submissive.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

A family's social position depends on the public behaviour of its female members. Stepping outside prescribed roles and behavioural norms in public results in moral condemnation and social ostracism. The dictates of society place a burden on both men and women to conform.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Men==

Under such circumstances gender roles necessarily follow defined paths. Male prerogatives reside in family economic welfare, politics, and relationships with outsiders; within the family they are expected to be disciplinarians and providers for aged parents. Female roles stress motherhood, child socialization and family nurturing. Even among professional career women, family responsibilities remain a top priority. Thus women's self-perception of their roles, among the majority, urban and rural, contributes to the perpetuation of patriarchal values.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Folklore==

Within the vast store of Afghan [[Folklore|folktale]]s covering religion, history and moral values, many reinforce the values governing male and female behavior. They illustrate what can or cannot be done, describe rewards and punishments, and define ideal personality types. Thus they perpetuate the existing gender order and through example make it psychologically satisfying.

==Consideration==

Some have urged the foreign aid community to revise aggressive campaigns to assure rights for Afghan women in education and employment. The Afghan community is already sharply divided over whether assistance to boys' education should be discontinued because there is a ban on education for girls. Family harmony must be undermined when women are favored over men in a declining job market.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

== Description ==
The Guayupe are a tribe of farmers living in the tropical mountain forests of the Eastern Ranges and the Llanos of Meta, Colombia. In [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] times they constructed pallisades around their villages consisting of houses around a central square with a ceremonial building in the middle.&lt;ref name=Onofrio_p438&gt;Onofrio, 1995, p.438&lt;/ref&gt; The Guayupe were an [[Muisca agriculture|agricultural]] society with [[yuca]] one of their main crops.&lt;ref name=Onofrio_p438/&gt; The Guayupe people went naked, only ornamented with [[gold]], feathers and shells.&lt;ref name=Onofrio_p438/&gt;

The Guayupe society was organised around the ''[[cacique]]s''; chiefs of the community. The ''cacique'' was regarded as an important person who lived by strict norms in the ceremonial activities; births, marriages and burials. When a ''cacique'' of the Guayupe died, the body was cremated and his successor had to drink his ash mixed with [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]].&lt;ref name=Onofrio_p438/&gt;&lt;ref name=ElTiempo1999/&gt; The society of the Guayupe was egalitarian; ''[[cacique]]s'' only had the use of stools and more feathers on their blankets. At every marriage, half of the bride treasure was going to the ''cacique''.&lt;ref name=Onofrio_p438/&gt;

They built canoes of wood and consumed [[cassava|yuca]] and [[tapioca|casabe]], fish and meat. They didn't eat bird meat.&lt;ref name=Onofrio_p438/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cultura&gt;{{es}} [http://culguayupe.blogspot.com.co/ Cultura Guayupe]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[List of Muisca scholars|scholar]] [[Pedro de Aguado]], the Guayupe defecated in the rivers around and not near their houses.&lt;ref&gt;Mácha &amp; Gómez, 2014, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
As in the [[Muisca religion]], the main gods were the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] who were husband and wife.&lt;ref name=Onofrio_p438/&gt;&lt;ref name=Granada&gt;{{es}} [http://granadameta.com/cultura-guayupe/ The Guayupe of Granada, Meta]&lt;/ref&gt; The supreme being of the Guayupe, in the Muisca religion called [[Chiminigagua]], was ''Inaynagui''.&lt;ref name=Granada/&gt;

The products the Guayupe used in their rituals were [[coca]] and [[tobacco]].&lt;ref name=Onofrio_p438/&gt; Cannibalism is not reported of the Guayupe.&lt;ref name=Onofrio_p438/&gt;

=== Modern age ===
In 1996, fifteen [[ceramic]] pots were found, pertaining to the Guayupe culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} 1996 - [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-436103 Fifteen Guayupe ceramic pots found in 1996] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, after the excavation of a Guayupe burial site, the museum of the Guayupe in [[Fuente de Oro]] was opened, containing bones, burial [[urn]]s, artefacts and plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://museoscomunitariosencolombia.blogspot.com.co/2011/04/museo-arqueologico-guayupe-puerto.html Museo arqueológico Guayupe]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009 yearly a ''Reina de Guayupe'', miss contest in Puerto Santander, located at {{convert|16|km|mi}} from the urban centre of Fuente de Oro,&lt;ref name=ElTiempo1999&gt;{{es}} 1999 - [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-944198 Guayupe museum] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt; is held among the Guayupe.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Moreno, 2012, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Moreno, 2012, p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Handbook of Middle American Indians''''' ('''HMAI''') is a sixteen-volume compendium on [[Mesoamerica]] , from the [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] to the late twentieth century. Volumes on particular topics were published from the 1960s and 1970s under the general editorship of [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wauchope, general editor. ‘’Handbook of Middle American Indians’’, 16 volumes.  Austin: University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt; Separate volumes with particular volume editors  deal with  a number of general topics, including archeology, cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, linguistics, with the last four substantive volumes treating various topics in Mesoamerican ethnohistory, under the editorship of [[Howard F.

Her story is sung by a [[scop]] during festivities in lines 1071-1158.

Hildeburh in her marriage to Finn thus acts as a  ''freothuwebbe'' or [[peace-weaver]] (an important concept in the poem). However, the peace was not kept and Hildeburh lost her brother, [[Hnæf]], son and husband in battle. Hildeburh's position as a link between the two kingdoms and her stoicism are central concepts to the story.

'''Incidental music''' is [[music]] in a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[television]] program, [[radio]] program, [[video game]], film, or some other presentation form that is not primarily musical. The term is less frequently applied to [[film]] music, with such music being referred to instead as the "[[film score]]" or "[[soundtrack]]".'''

Incidental music is often [[Background music|"background" music]], and is intended to add atmosphere to the action. It may take the form of something as simple as a low, ominous tone suggesting an impending startling event or to enhance the depiction of a story-advancing sequence. It may also include pieces such as [[overture]]s, music played during scene changes, or at the end of an [[act (theater)|act]], immediately preceding an interlude, as was customary with several nineteenth-century plays. It may also be required in plays that have [[musician]]s performing on-stage.

The use of incidental music dates back at least as far as [[Greek literature|Greek drama]]. A number of [[european classical music|classical]] [[composer]]s have written incidental music for various plays, with the more famous examples including [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Egmont (Beethoven)|''Egmont'' music]], [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Rosamunde|''Rosamunde'' music]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|''Midsummer Night's Dream'' music]], [[Georges Bizet]]'s [[L'Arlésienne (Bizet)|''L'Arlésienne'' music]], and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s music for [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]''. Parts of all of these are often performed in concerts outside the context of the play. Vocal incidental music, which is included in the classical scores mentioned above, should never be confused with the score of a [[Broadway musical|Broadway]] or [[film musical]], in which the songs often reveal character and further the storyline. Since the score of a Broadway or film musical is what actually makes the work a ''musical'', it is far more essential to the work than mere incidental music, which nearly always amounts to little more than a background score; indeed, many plays have no incidental music whatsoever.

Some early examples of what were later called incidental music are also described as [[semi-opera]]s, quasi-operas, [[masque]]s, [[vaudeville]]s and [[melodrama]]s.

The genre of incidental music does not extend to pieces designed for concert performance, such as overtures named after a play, for example, Beethoven's ''[[Coriolan Overture]]'' (written for [[Heinrich Joseph von Collin]]'s tragedy), or [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' fantasy-overture.

Modern composers of incidental music include [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Lorenzo Ferrero]], [[Irmin Schmidt]], [[Ilona Sekacz]], [[John White (composer)|John White]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].

==Types==

===Overture===
{{main|Overture}}
An ''overture'' is incidental music that is played usually at the beginning of a film, play, opera, etc., before the action begins. It may be a complete work of music in itself or just a simple tune. In some cases it incorporates musical themes that are later repeated in other incidental music used during the performance.

===Theme song===
{{main|Theme music}}
A ''theme song'' is a work that represents the performance and is often played at the beginning or end of the performance. Elements of the theme may be incorporated into other incidental music used during the performance. In films, theme songs are often played during [[credit roll]]s. A ''love theme'' is a special theme song (often in various modified forms) that accompanies romantic scenes involving the protagonists of a performance.

Theme songs are among the works of incidental music that are most commonly released independently of the performance for which they were written, and occasionally become major successes in their own right.

===Underscore=== &lt;!-- Courtesy comment [[Underscoring]] links here --&gt;
An ''underscore'' is a soft, noiseless soundtrack theme which accompanies the action in a performance. It is usually designed so that spectators are only indirectly aware of its presence. It may help to set or indicate the mood of a scene.

===Stinger===
A ''stinger'' is a very brief instant of music that accompanies a scene transition in a performance. Often the stinger marks the passage of time or a change in location. Stingers were used frequently in the American television series ''Friends'' (as one example){{citation needed|date=September 2015}} to mark scene transitions involving the passage of time or a change of location. Similar techniques are commonly used in many American sitcoms.

===Loop===
Short sequences of recorded music called ''loops'' are sometimes designed so that they can be repeated indefinitely and seamlessly as required to accompany visuals. These are often used as background music in documentary and trade films.

'''Isidore Lechat''' is a [[fictional character]], the main protagonist of the play ''Les affaires sont les affaires'' (''[[Business is business]]'') (1903) by French writer [[Octave Mirbeau]].
[[Image:Maurice de Féraudy by Maurice Clément.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice de Féraudy]], who created the part of Isidore Lechat in 1903]]

== A businessman == 

Isidore Lechat, nicknamed "Lechat-Tigre", is a ruthless businessman, a predator without any scruples. Rather than specializing in just one branch of trade, industry or finance, he has invested everything, for instance into the press, modern agriculture and electricity. Due to his extortion, he becomes rich and powerful in the French society of the Third Republic. Because of the newspaper that he created and his 50 millions francs, he seems untouchable and above the law, which is made only for the poor. Lechat enjoys impunity from both the government and the [[Catholic Church]]. For the playwright, Isidore Lechat is the product of an era of economic upheaval and global expansion of [[capitalism]] and the first phase of economic [[imperialism]].

However, [[Octave Mirbeau]] recognizes that this predator, who sows misery everywhere around him, is an "idealist" in his own way and that his projects are potentially progressive, because they contribute to the development of productive forces. The old aristocracy, embodied in the play by the old Marquis de Porcellet, is only a class parasite.

== A two faced man == 

Cynical and vulgar, Isidore Lechat is a ''nouveau riche'' who hides his extraordinary capacity to rob his victims behind the silver tongue of a ''bon vivant'' and disarms them. Nevertheless, he is totally blind in his private life; he does not realize that his wife is lost and unhappy, his beloved son Xavier is a slacker, his daughter Germaine is disgusted and is having love affair right in front of him. He also does not notice that Germaine prepares to flee his golden chains, rejecting Lechat's dreams of a good marriage.

Furthermore, the ''libido dominandi'' of Lechat is powerless over love and death: his son dies in an automobile accident, and her daughter goes away with her lover, Lucien Garraud. In addition, his formerly submissive wife becomes no longer afraid of him and judges him severely. Defeated, oppressed and humiliated, Lechat finds the strength to recover his self-control in order to seal a profitable deal, crushing the two swindlers who wanted to take advantage of his grief and fool him: business is business...

In spite of the disgust inspired by his cynicism and vulgarity, Isidore Lechat can also rouse a kind of admiration for his energy and his clearness in business, and even inspire pity when he loses his daughter, his son and his submissive wife in a single day.

Juliet Dove, a middle school girl, gets lured into a shop and is given a magical and incredibly strong crystal amulet. The amulet cannot come off and she realizes that she is in a story. In order for her to be free, she has to complete it. The amulet makes the person that wears it truly, strongly and deeply romantically attractive to the opposite gender. With the help of two rats that can talk, who are friends of the shop owner, she finds out the amulet was given to her by [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of [[Civil disorder|chaos]] and discord. She is embarrassed by the group of boys that follow her, as she has unwittingly captivated and charmed them to her [[romantic love]] and affections. She manages to solve the mystery and reunite two mythological romantic lovers, [[Cupid]] and [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]].

This is a '''list''' of '''conquistadors''' who were active in the conquest of terrains that presently belong to '''Colombia'''. The nationalities listed refer to the state the conquistador was born into; Granada and Castile are currently part of Spain, but were separate states at the time of birth of the early conquistadors. Important conquistadors and explorers were [[Alonso de Ojeda]], who landed first at Colombian soil and founded the first settlement ''Santa Cruz'',&lt;ref name=BancoConquista&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/historia/personajes_conquista Personajes de la Conquista a América] – [[Bank of the Republic (Colombia)|Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]], who founded the oldest still remaining city [[Santa Marta]], [[Pedro de Heredia]], who founded the important city of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in 1533, [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], who was the leader of the first and main expedition into the [[Andes]] (1536–1538), with his [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada|brother]] second in command and many other conquistadors, 80% of whom who didn't survive,&lt;ref name=BancoList&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/gennrgun/gennrgun9x.htm List of conquistadors of the expedition led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada] – [[Bank of the Republic (Colombia)|Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ConquistaGonzalo&gt;{{es}} [http://letras-uruguay.espaciolatino.com/aaa/bolivar_grimaldos_rafael/conquista_rapida_y_saqueo.htm Conquista rápida y saqueo cuantioso de Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nikolaus Federmann]] and [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]] who entered the Colombian interior from the northwest and south respectively.

As the term may have multiple meanings in multiple environments, research on locura is limited and conflicting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The term can be used loosely in Spanish when discussing madness in other psychological meaning, specifically describing a "deviance from the norm due to mental illness."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Besides for the implications found in the DSM-IV, the word is not used in English.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Classification ==
In the fourth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-IV]]), locura is classified as a culture-bound syndrome. Culture-bound syndromes can be found in an appendix of the manual named, ''Outline for Cultural Formulation and Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the [[DSM-5|DSM - 5]] does not include locura in its equivalent appendix named, ''Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=|first=|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|isbn=|edition=Fifth|location=Arlington, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One author chooses to describe the symptoms as correlating to a [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorder]] of conversive type.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Locura is thought to develop during times of stress or vulnerability in one's life, as well as the accumulation of difficulties or traumas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another possible cause is through the manifestation of supernatural maneuvers,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or maleficios (meaning "curses").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanishcentral.com/translate/maleficio|title=Maleficio - Spanish to English Translation {{!}} Spanish Central|website=www.spanishcentral.com|language=en_US|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-IV includes symptoms of incoherence, agitation, inability to follow rules of social interaction, unpredictability, and possible violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other sources include headache, fainting, convulsive attacks, difficulty in breathing, an urge to run away, hallucinations, and visions of people, visions, or demons.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History  ==
Locura has been examined in an indigenous group in [[Colombia]] called [[Emberá people|Embera]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After four members of the Embera community began exhibiting symptoms later described as, "repetitive episodes of what resembled a dissociative fugue disorder,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a local shaman explained that the outbreak could be attributed to a shaman from a different region. The local shaman attempted their own treatment, but the affected member's symptoms continued and after six months, they eventually chose to seek help in the closest province. Soon after they arrived, their local relatives began to develop the same symptoms. After five more individuals presented similarly, all nine members began seeking forms of treatment including care from different types of religious healers, psychiatrists, and antipsychotic drugs. After none of these tactics proved successful, a shaman from the [[Chocó Department|Chocó]] province in Columbia was brought to attempt treatment. The shaman's treatments reportedly reduced the frequency of the symptoms greatly in all of the patients and eliminated symptoms completely in two patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Race}}
'''Miscegenation''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˌ|s|ɛ|dʒ|ᵻ|ˈ|n|eɪ|ʃ|ən}}) is the mixing of different [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial groups]] through [[interracial marriage|marriage]], [[cohabitation]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual relations]], or [[Reproduction|procreation]], particularly mixing that is perceived to negatively impact the purity of a particular race or culture.&lt;ref name=dictionary.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/miscegenation | title=Miscegenation: Definition of Miscegenation at Dictionary.com |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=What Comes Naturally: Miscegenation Law and the Making of Race in America | author=Pascoe, Peggy | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2009 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mrjbk8zc7PgC | page=1-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-miscegenation is a prominent theme of [[white supremacy]].

Though the notion that racial mixing is undesirable has arisen at different points in history, it gained particular prominence in Europe during the [[Age of Discovery|era of colonialism]]. The term ''miscegenation'' entered the English language in the 19th century as [[racial segregation]] began to become more formalized in the [[United States]]. It was used specifically to refer to [[interracial marriage]] and interracial sexual relations,&lt;ref name=dictionary.com/&gt; and more generally to the process of [[genetic admixture]]. The term came to be associated with laws banning interracial marriage and sex, known as [[anti-miscegenation laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Downing |first1=Karen |last2=Nichols |first2=Darlene |last3=Webster |first3=Kelly |title=Multiracial America: A Resource Guide on the History and Literature of Interracial Issues |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g-fm97haJQEC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=2005 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-0-8108-5199-3 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''miscegenation'' is virtually always used to refer to racist ideologies. When speaking about mixed-race relationships in a more neutral context, terms such as  ''interracial'', ''interethnic'', or even ''[[transculturation|cross-cultural]]'' are more common in contemporary usage.

==Usage==
In the present day, the word ''miscegenation'' is avoided by many scholars, because the term suggests a concrete biological phenomenon, rather than a categorization imposed on certain relationships. The term's historical use in contexts that typically implied disapproval is also a reason why more unambiguously neutral terms such as ''interracial'', ''interethnic'' or ''cross-cultural'' are more common in contemporary usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Newman |first=Richard |editor=[[Kwame Anthony Appiah|Kwame Appiah]] and [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] |title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |edition=1st |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-00071-5 |page=1320 |chapter=Miscegenation |quote=Miscegenation, a term for sexual relations across racial lines; no longer in use because of its racist implications|title-link=Encyclopedia Africana }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term remains in use among scholars when referring to past practices concerning [[multiracial]]ity, such as anti-miscegenation laws that banned interracial marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pascoe | first1 = P. | title = Miscegenation Law, Court Cases, and Ideologies of "Race" in Twentieth-Century America | journal = The Journal of American History | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–69 | doi = 10.2307/2945474 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 2945474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish, Portuguese, and French, the words used to describe the mixing of races are ''mestizaje'', ''mestiçagem'' and ''métissage''. These words, much older than the term ''miscegenation'', are derived from the [[Late Latin]] ''mixticius'' for "mixed", which is also the root of the Spanish word ''[[mestizo]]''. (Portuguese also uses ''miscigenação'', derived from the same Latin root as the English word.) These non-English terms for "race-mixing" are not considered as offensive as "miscegenation", although they have historically been tied to the [[caste system]] ([[casta]]) that was established during the colonial era in Spanish-speaking Latin America. Some groups in South America, however, consider the use of the word ''mestizo'' offensive because it was used during the times of the colony to refer specifically to the mixing between the conquistadores and the indigenous people.

Today, the mixes among races and ethnicities are diverse, so it is considered preferable to use the term "mixed-race" or simply "mixed" (''mezcla''). In Portuguese-speaking Latin America (i.e., [[Brazil]]), a milder form of caste system existed, although it also provided for legal and social discrimination among individuals belonging to different races, since [[slavery]] for blacks existed until the late 19th century. Intermarriage occurred significantly from the very first settlements, with their descendants achieving high rank in government and society.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} To this day, there are controversies if Brazilian class system would be drawn mostly around socio-economic lines, not racial ones (in a manner similar to other former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonies). Conversely, people classified in censuses as black, brown ("pardo") or indigenous have disadvantaged social indicators in comparison to the white population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/periodicos/1075/cd_2010_trabalho_rendimento_amostra.pdf|format=PDF|title=Censo Demografico 2010|website=Biblioteca.ibge.gov.br|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/periodicos/545/cd_2010_educacao_e_deslocamento.pdf|format=PDF|title=Censo Demografico 2010 |website=Biblioteca.ibge.gov.br|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of miscegenation is tied to concepts of racial difference. As the different connotations and etymologies of miscegenation and ''mestizaje'' suggest, definitions of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], "race mixing" and [[multiracial]]ity have diverged globally as well as [[Historical definitions of race|historically]], depending on changing social circumstances and cultural perceptions. Mestizo are people of mixed white and indigenous, usually [[Amerindian]] ancestry, who do not self-identify as indigenous peoples or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. In Canada, however, the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], who also have partly Amerindian and partly white, often French-Canadian, ancestry, have identified as an ethnic group and are a constitutionally recognized [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal people]].

The differences between related terms and words which encompass aspects of racial admixture show the impact of different historical and cultural factors leading to changing [[social interpretations of race]] and ethnicity. Thus the [[Comte de Montlosier]], in exile during the [[French Revolution]], equated class difference in 18th-century France with racial difference. Borrowing [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]]' discourse on the "[[Nordic race]]" as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian "Gauls", he showed his contempt for the lowest [[social class]], the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]], calling it "this new people born of slaves ... mixture of all races and of all times".{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Etymological history==
''Miscegenation'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:miscere|miscere]]'', "to mix" and ''[[:wikt:genus|genus]]'', "kind". The word was coined in the U.S. in 1863, and the [[etymology]] of the word is tied up with political conflicts during the [[American Civil War]] over the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of [[slavery]] and over the [[racial segregation]] of [[African-Americans]]. The reference to ''genus'' was made to emphasize the supposedly distinct biological differences between whites and non-whites, though all humans belong to the same [[genus]], ''[[Homo]]'', and the same [[species]], ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.

The word was coined in an anonymous [[propaganda]] [[pamphlet]] published in New York City in December 1863, during the [[American Civil War]]. The pamphlet was entitled ''[[Miscegenation hoax|Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro]]''.&lt;ref name="hoaxes"&gt;{{cite web
|title=The Miscegenation Hoax

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It purported to advocate the intermarriage of whites and blacks until they were indistinguishably mixed, as a desirable goal, and further asserted that this was the goal of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The pamphlet was a hoax, concocted by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], to discredit the Republicans by imputing to them what were then radical views that offended against the attitudes of the vast majority of whites, including those who opposed slavery. There was already much opposition to the war effort.

The pamphlet and variations on it were reprinted widely in both the north and [[Confederate States of America|south]] by Democrats and Confederates. Only in November 1864 was the pamphlet exposed as a hoax. The hoax pamphlet was written by [[David Goodman Croly]], managing editor of the ''[[New York World]]'', a Democratic Party paper, and George Wakeman, a ''World'' reporter.

By then, the word ''miscegenation'' had entered the common language of the day as a popular [[buzzword]] in political and social discourse. The issue of miscegenation, raised by the opponents of [[Abraham Lincoln]], featured prominently in the election campaign of 1864.

In the United States, miscegenation has referred primarily to the intermarriage between whites and non-whites, especially blacks.

Before the publication of ''Miscegenation'', the word [[Amalgamation (history)|''amalgamation'']], borrowed from [[metallurgy]], had been in use as a general term for ethnic and racial intermixing. A contemporary usage of this metaphor was that of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s private vision in 1845 of America as an ethnic and racial smelting-pot, a variation on the concept of the [[melting pot]]. Opinions in the U.S on the desirability of such intermixing, including that between white [[Protestants]] and [[Irish Catholic]] immigrants, were divided. The term ''miscegenation'' was coined to refer specifically to the intermarriage of blacks and whites, with the intent of galvanising opposition to the war.&lt;ref name="hollinger"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hollinger | first1 = D.

All these laws primarily banned marriage between persons of different racially or ethnically defined groups, which was termed "amalgamation" or "miscegenation" in the U.S. The laws in Nazi Germany and laws in many U.S. states, as well as laws in South Africa, also banned sexual relations between such individuals.

In the United States, various state laws prohibited marriages between whites and blacks, and in many states they also prohibited marriages between whites and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or [[Asian American|Asians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karthikeyan|first=Hrishi |author2=Chin, Gabriel|year=2002|title=Preserving Racial Identity: Population Patterns and the Application of Anti-Miscegenation Statutes to Asian Americans, 1910–1950|journal=Asian Law Journal|volume=9|issue=1|ssrn=283998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., such laws were known as [[anti-miscegenation laws]].

In 1967, the [[United States Supreme Court]] unanimously ruled in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' that anti-miscegenation laws are [[unconstitutional]]. With this ruling, these laws were no longer in effect in the remaining 16 states that still had them.

The Nazi ban on interracial sexual relations and marriages was enacted in September 1935 as part of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], the ''Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre'' (The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour). The Nuremberg Laws classified [[Judaism|Jews]] as a race, and forbade extramarital sexual relations and marriage between persons classified as "Aryan" and "non-Aryan". Violation of this was condemned as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (lit. "race-disgrace") and could be punished by imprisonment (usually followed by deportation to a concentration camp) and even by death.

The [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]] in South Africa, enacted in 1949, banned intermarriage between different racial groups, including between [[Whites in South Africa|whites]] and non-whites. The [[Immorality Act]], enacted in 1950, also made it a criminal offense for a white person to have any sexual relations with a person of a different race. Both laws were repealed in 1985.

==History of ethnoracial admixture and attitudes towards miscegenation==

===Africa===
[[File:Jean Ping 080202-F-1644L-081 0YWDF.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean Ping]] the Deputy Prime Minister of [[Gabon]] who has a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] father and a black Gabonese mother was elected as Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union on 1 February 2008.]]
[[File:Jerry Rawlings 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jerry John Rawlings]], an ex-president of [[Ghana]], is the son of a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] father and a black Ghanaian mother.]]

Africa has a long history of interracial mixing with male [[Arab]] and European explorers, traders and soldiers having sexual relations with black African women as well as taking them as [[wife|wive]]s. Arabs played a big role in the [[African slave trade]] and unlike the [[Atlantic slave trade|trans-atlantic slave trade]] most of the black African slaves in the [[Arab slave trade]] were women. Most of them were used as [[sexual slave]]s by the Arab men and some were even taken as wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery and abolition in the Ottoman Middle East|author=Ehud R. Toledano|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-295-97642-6|pages=13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]] writes, during his expedition to Africa, about relationships between black women and white men: "The women are well disposed toward strangers of fair complexion, apparently with the permission of their husbands." There are several [[mulatto]] populations throughout Africa mostly the results of interracial relationships between Arab and European men and black women. In South Africa there are big mulatto communities like the Coloureds and [[Griqua people|Griqua]] formed by White colonists taking native African wives. In Namibia there is a community called the [[Rehoboth Basters]] formed by the interracial marriage of [[Dutch people|Dutch]]/[[German people|German]] men and black African women.

In the former [[Portuguese Africa]] (now known as [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Cape Verde]]) racial mixing between white [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and black Africans was fairly common, especially in Cape Verde where the majority of the population is of mixed descent.

There have been some recorded cases of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] merchants and labourers taking African wives throughout Africa as many [[Chinese people|Chinese]] workers were employed to build railways and other infrastructural projects in Africa. These labour groups were made up completely of men with very few Chinese women coming to Africa.

In West Africa, especially Nigeria there are many cases of Lebanese men taking African women. Many of their offsprings have gained prominent positions in Africa. Flight Lieutenant [[Jerry John Rawlings]], who has a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] father and a black Ghanaian mother became the president of Ghana. [[Jean Ping]], the son of a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] trader and a black Gabonese mother, became the deputy prime minister as well as the foreign minister of [[Gabon]] and was the Chairperson of the Commission of the [[African Union]] from 2009 to 2012. The president of [[Botswana]], [[Ian Khama]], is the son of Botswana's first president, [[Seretse Khama]], and a white (British) woman, [[Ruth Williams Khama]]. [[Nicolas Grunitzky]], who was the son of a white [[Germans|German]] father and a [[Togolese]] mother, became the second president of [[Togo]] after a [[coup]].

[[Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa|Indian]] men, who have long been traders in [[East Africa]], sometimes married among local African women. The [[British Empire]] brought many Indian workers into East Africa to build the [[Uganda Railway]]. Indians eventually populated South Africa, [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Rwanda]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zaire]] in small numbers. These interracial unions were mostly unilateral marriages between Indian men and East African women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorq.org/MeltingPot/article.aspx?d=Africa&amp;x=Indians|title=Jotawa: Afro-Asians in East Africa|publisher=Color Q World|accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Réunion====
The majority of the population of [[Réunion]] is defined as mixed race. In the last 350 years, various ethnic groups ([[Africa]]ns, [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]], [[Gujarati people|Gujarati Indians]], [[Tamil people|Tamil Indians]]) have arrived and settled on the island. There have been mixed race people on the island since its first permanent inhabitation in 1665.

====Madagascar====
There was frequent intermixing between the Austronesian and Bantu-speaking populations of Madagascar. A large number of the Malagasy today are the result of admixture between Austronesians and Africans. This is most evident in the [[Mikea people|Mikea]], who are also the last known Malagasy population to still practice a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Additional information is that most of the African admixture is patrilineal while most of the Austronesian admixture is matrilineal. This means that the majority of the intermixing were between black African males and Austronesian females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jean-Aimé Rakotoarisoa|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/01/03/1321860111 |title=Genome-wide evidence of Austronesian–Bantu admixture and cultural reversion in a hunter-gatherer group of Madagascar |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=936–941 |date=6 January 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2014 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1321860111|pmid=24395773 |last2=Razafindrazaka |first2=H. |last3=Pagani |first3=L. |last4=Ricaut |first4=F.-X. |last5=Antao |first5=T. |last6=Capredon |first6=M. |last7=Sambo |first7=C. |last8=Radimilahy |first8=C.|last9=Rakotoarisoa |last10=Blench |first10=R.

====Canada====

Canada had no laws against mixed marriage, but there were sometimes strong social pressures against it.  The [[Ku Klux Klan in Canada|Canadian Ku Klux Klan]] burned crosses at a gathering in [[Moose Jaw]], Saskatchewan, to discourage mixed marriages, and in 1930 were enlisted in [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]], [[Ontario]], to intimidate [[Isabella Jones and Ira Junius Johnson]] out of marrying.  [[Velma Demerson]] was imprisoned in 1939 for carrying the child of a Chinese father; she was deemed "incorrigible" under the [[Female Refuges Act]], and was physically experimented on in prison to discover the causes of her behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/mothers-day/the-canadian-marriage-at-150-a-look-back/article33962570/|title=Canada 150: A century and a half of marriage|newspaper=[[Globe and Mail]]|first1=Zosia|last1=Bielski|first2=Stephanie|last2=Chambers|date=2017-02-09|accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, "race mixing" between [[Black (people)|black]] and [[White (people)|white]] people was taboo in the United States. So-called [[anti-miscegenation laws]], barring blacks and whites from marrying or having sex, were established in [[colonial America]] as early as 1691.&lt;ref name="Frank W Sweet"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Frank Sweet is not a reliable source.

The first laws banning interracial marriage were introduced in the late 17th century in the slave-holding colonies of Virginia (1691) and Maryland (1692). Later these laws also spread to colonies and states where slavery did not exist.

It has also been argued{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that the first laws banning interracial marriage were a response by the planter elite to the problems they were facing due to the socio-economic dynamics of the plantation system in the Southern colonies. The bans in Virginia and Maryland were established at a time when slavery was not yet fully institutionalized. At the time, most forced laborers on the plantations were predominately white [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]]. Some historians have suggested that the at-the-time unprecedented laws banning interracial marriage were originally invented by planters as a [[divide and rule]] tactic after the uprising of servants in [[Bacon's Rebellion]]. According to this theory, the ban on interracial marriage was issued to split up the racially mixed, increasingly mixed-race labour force into whites, who were given their freedom, and blacks, who were later treated as slaves rather than as indentured servants. By forbidding interracial marriage, it became possible to keep these two new groups separated and prevent a new rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backintyme.com/essays/?p=22|title=Why Did Virginia's Rulers Invent a Color Line?|last=Sweet|first=Frank.

During and after slavery, most American whites regarded interracial marriage between whites and blacks as taboo. However, during slavery many white American men and women did conceive children with black partners. These children automatically became slaves if the mother was a slave or were born free if the mother was free, as slavery was [[matrilineal]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some children were freed by their slave-holding fathers or bought to be emancipated if the father was not the owner. Many children of these unions formed enclaves under names such as [[Colored]] and [[Gens de couleur]], etc.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Most mixed-raced descendants merged into the African-American ethnic group during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era.

Initially, [[Filipino Americans]] were considered "white" and were not barred from interracial marriage, with documented instances of interracial marriage of Filipino men and White women in Louisiana and Washington, D.C. However, by the late 19th century and early 20th century in California, Filipinos were barred from marrying white women through a series of court cases which redefined their racial interpretation under the law. During World War II, Filipino servicemen in California had to travel with their White fiancees to New Mexico, to be able to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Fabros, Jr. |first=Alex S. |date=February 1995 |title=When Hilario Met Sally: The Fight Against Anti-Miscegenation Laws |url=http://www.positivelyfilipino.com/magazine/when-hilario-met-sally-the-fight-against-anti-miscegenation-laws |magazine=Filipinas Magazine |via=Positively Filipino |location=Burlingame, California |publisher=Positively Filipino LLC |access-date=25 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Motion Picture [[Production Code]] of 1930, also known as [[Hays Code]], explicitly stated that the depiction of "miscegenation ... is forbidden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html|title=The Motion Picture Production Code of 1930|accessdate=17 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222092920/http://artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html|archive-date=22 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One important strategy intended to discourage the marriage of white Americans and Americans of partly African descent was the promulgation of the [[one-drop theory]], which held that any person with any known African ancestry, however remote, must be regarded as "black". This definition of blackness was encoded in the anti-miscegenation laws of various U.S. states, such as Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924]]. The plaintiffs in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', [[Mildred Jeter]] and [[Richard Loving]] became the historically most prominent interracial couple in the US through their legal struggle against this act.

Throughout American history, there has been frequent mixing between Native Americans and black Africans. When Native Americans invaded the European colony of Jamestown, Virginia in 1622, they killed the Europeans but took the African slaves as captives, gradually integrating them. Interracial relationships occurred between African Americans and members of other tribes along coastal states. During the transitional period of Africans becoming the primary race enslaved, Native Americans were sometimes enslaved with them. Africans and Native Americans worked together, some even intermarried and had mixed children. The relationship between Africans and Native-Americans was seen as a threat to Europeans and European-Americans, who actively tried to divide Native-Americans and Africans and put them against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/african-native-americans-share-rich-history |title=African &amp; Native Americans share a rich history |publisher=African American Registry |date=c. 2010 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th Century, some Native American women turned to freed or runaway African men due to a major decline in the male population in Native American villages. At the same time, the early slave population in America was disproportionately male. Records show that some Native American women bought African men as slaves. Unknown to European sellers, the women freed and married the men into their tribe. Some African men chose Native American women as their partners because their children would be free, as the child's status followed that of the mother. The men could marry into some of the matrilineal tribes and be accepted, as their children were still considered to belong to the mother's people. As European expansion increased in the Southeast, African and Native American marriages became more numerous.&lt;ref name="Mays2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy A.

From the mid 19th to 20th centuries, many black people and ethnic Mexicans intermarried with each other in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in South Texas (mostly in Cameron County and Hidalgo County). In Cameron County, 38% of black people were interracially married (7/18 families) while in Hidalgo County the number was 72% (18/25 families). These two counties had the highest rates of interracial marriages involving at least one black spouse in the United States. The vast majority of these marriages involved black men marrying ethnic Mexican women or first generation Tejanas (Texas-born women of Mexican descent). Since ethnic Mexicans were considered white by Texas officials and the U.S. government, such marriages were a violation of the state's anti-miscegenation laws. Yet, there is no evidence that anyone in South Texas was prosecuted for violating this law. The rates of this interracial marriage dynamic can be traced back to when black men moved into the Lower Rio Grande Valley after the Civil War ended. They married into ethnic Mexican families and joined other black people who found sanctuary on the U.S./Mexico border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/perspectives/border-love-rio-grande-african-american-men-and-latinas-rio-grande-valley-south-texas-1 |title=Border Love on the Rio Grande: African American Men and Latinas in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas (1850-1940) |publisher=The Black Past |date=10 June 2003 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 19th to 20th centuries, the Chinese that migrated were almost entirely of Cantonese origin.

After the Emancipation Proclamation, many Chinese Americans migrated to the Southern states, particularly Arkansas, to work on plantations.

In the mid 1850s, 70 to 150 Chinese were living in New York City and 11 of them married Irish women. In 1906 the ''New York Times'' (6 August) reported that 300 white women (Irish American) were married to Chinese men in New York, with many more cohabited. In 1900, based on Liang research, of the 120,000 men in more than 20 Chinese communities in the United States, he estimated that one out of every twenty Chinese men (Cantonese) was married to a white woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Benson Tong|title=Asian American children: a historical handbook and guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uK6xhcu-4hAC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=2 March 2012|year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33042-1|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s census showed 3500 Chinese men married to white women and 2900 Chinese women married to white men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-im2X0hbpv8C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=Chinese+men+white+women+3500+++america&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yy2XUb_ZM4HgOO2lgdgE&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chinese%20men%20white%20women%203500%20%20%20america&amp;f=false Love's revolution: interracial marriage] by Maria P.P.

Accusations of support for miscegenation were commonly made by slavery defenders against Abolitionists before the Civil War. After the war, similar charges were used by white [[racial segregation|segregationists]] against advocates of equal rights for African Americans. They were said to be secretly plotting the destruction of the white race through miscegenation. In the 1950s, segregationists alleged a [[Communism|Communist]] plot funded by the Soviet Union with that goal. In 1957, segregationists cite the [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] hoax ''[[A Racial Program for the Twentieth Century]]'' as evidence for these claims.

Asians were specifically included in some state laws. California continued to ban Asian/white marriages until the [[Perez v. Sharp]] decision in 1948.

In the United States, segregationists, including modern [[Christian Identity]] groups, have claimed that several passages in the [[Bible]],&lt;ref name="bibletools"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Topical.show/RTD/Nave/ID/3419/Miscegenation.htm|title=Miscegenation|work=Nave's Topical Bible|publisher=Bible Tools|accessdate=13 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the stories of [[Phinehas, son of Eleazar|Phinehas]] and of the so-called "[[curse of Ham]]", should be understood as referring to miscegenation and that certain verses expressly forbid it. Most theologians read these verses and references as forbidding interreligious marriage, rather than interracial marriage.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=====Hawaii=====
The majority of Hawaiian Chinese were Cantonese migrants from Guangdong with a minority from Hakka. If all people with Chinese ancestry in Hawaii (including the Chinese-Hawaiians) are included, they form about 1/3 of Hawaii's entire population. Many thousands of them married women of Hawaiian as well as Hawaiian/European and European origin. A large percentage of the Chinese men married Hawaiian and Hawaiian/European women. The 12,592 Asiatic-Hawaiians enumerated in 1930 were the result of Chinese men intermarrying with Hawaiian and part Hawaiian/European. Most Asiatic-Hawaiians men also married Hawaiians and European women (and vice versa). On the census some Chinese with little native blood would be classified as Chinese, not as Asiatic-Hawaiians due to dilution of native blood. Intermarriage started to decline in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GrvXiBNOsO0C&amp;pg=PA396|title=Interracial Marriage in Hawaii|journal=Nature|volume=140|issue=3546|author=Romanzo Adams|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=396|isbn=978-1-4179-9268-3|accessdate=14 July 2010|bibcode=1937Natur.140..665F|doi=10.1038/140665a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a904831799|title=Interethnic Marriage and Divorce in Hawaii A Panel Study of 1968 First Marriages|author=Margaret M.

About 300,000 Cantonese [[coolie]]s and migrants (almost all males) were shipped during 1849–1874 to Latin America; many of them intermarried and cohabited with the Black, Mestizo, and European population of Cuba, Peru, Guyana, and Trinidad.

In addition, Latin American societies also witnessed growth in both Church-sanctioned and common law marriages between Africans and the non colored.&lt;ref name="mtholyoke1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/latam/SLAVERY-ABOLITION.html |title=Black into White in Nineteenth Century Spanish America: Afro-American Assimilation in Argentina and Costa Rica |author=Lowell Gudmundson |journal=Slavery and Abolition |date=May 1984 |accessdate=11 April 2014 |volume=5 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Argentina=====
In Buenos Aires in 1810, only 2.2 percent of African men and 2.5 percent of African women were married to the non colored (white). In 1827, the figures increased to 3.0 percent for men and 6.0 percent for women. Racial mixing increased even further as more African men began enlisting in the army. Between 1810 and 1820 only 19.9% of African men were enlisted in the army. Between 1850 and 1860, this number increased to 51.1%. This led to a sexual imbalance between African men and women in Argentine. Unions between African women and non-colored men became more common in the wake of massive Italian immigration to the country. This led one African male editorial commentator to quip that, given to the sexual imbalance in the community, black women who "could not get bread would have to settle for pasta".&lt;ref name="mtholyoke1"/&gt;

=====Bolivia=====

During the colonial period, many black people often intermarried with the native population (mostly Aymara). The result of these relationships was the blending between the two cultures (Aymara and Afro-Bolivian).

After Bolivia's Agrarian Reform of 1953, black people (like indigenous people) migrated from their agricultural villages to the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz in search of better educational and employment opportunities. Related to this, black individuals began intermarrying with people of a lighter skin coloring such as blancos (whites) and mestizos. This was done as a means of better integration for themselves, and especially their children, into Bolivian society.&lt;ref name="WhittenTorres1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman E.

=====Costa Rica=====
The Chinese in Costa Rica originated from Cantonese male migrants. Pure Chinese make up only 1% of the Costa Rican population but, according to [[Jacqueline M. Newman]], as much as ten percent of the people in Costa Rica are Chinese, if counting the people who are Chinese, married to a Chinese, or of mixed Chinese descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flavorandfortune.com/dataaccess/article.php?ID=221 Chinese Food in Costa Rica by Jacqueline M. Newman]. Flavorandfortune.com. Retrieved 2 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Chinese immigrants since then have been Cantonese, but in the last decades of the 20th century, a number of immigrants have also come from Taiwan. Many men came alone to work, married Costa Rican women, and speak Cantonese. However, the majority of the descendants of the first Chinese immigrants no longer speak Cantonese and think of themselves as full Costa Ricans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret Tyler Mitchell|author2=Scott Pentzer|title=Costa Rica: a global studies handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0edCL8TY08gC&amp;pg=PA249|accessdate=2 March 2012|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-992-4|pages=249–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married Tican women (who are a blend of European, Castizo, Mestizo, Indian, Black).&lt;ref&gt;[http://philip.greenspun.com/cr/moon/people Costa Rica, People].

Many Africans in Costa Rica also intermarried with other races. In late colonial Cartago, 33% of 182 married African males and 7% of married African females were married to a spouse of another race. The figures were even more striking in San Jose' where 55% of the 134 married African males and 35% of the 65 married African females were married to another race (mostly mestizos). In Cartago itself, two African males were enumerated with Spanish wives and three with Indian wives, while nine African females were married to Indian males. Spaniards rarely cohabited with mulatto women except in the cattle range region bordering Nicaragua to the north. There as well, two Spanish women were living with African males.&lt;ref name="mtholyoke1"/&gt;

=====Cuba=====
120,000 Cantonese coolies (all males) entered Cuba under contract for 80 years. Most did not marry, but Hung Hui (1975:80) states there was a frequency of sexual activity between black women and Cantonese coolies. According to Osberg, (1965:69) the Chinese often bought slave women and freed them, expressly for marriage. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Chinese men (Cantonese) engaged in sexual activity with white and black Cuban women, and from such relations many children were born. (For a British Caribbean model of Chinese cultural retention through procreation with black women, see Patterson, 322-31).&lt;ref&gt;Identity, Rebellion, and Social Justice Among Chinese Contract Workers in Nineteenth-Century Cuba {{cite web|url=http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220035052/http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s an additional 30000 Cantonese and small groups of Japanese arrived; both immigrations were exclusively male, and there was rapid mingling with white, black, and mulato populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/topics/cuba Cuba — History.com Articles, Video, Pictures and Facts].

=====El Salvador=====

In El Salvador, there was frequent intermarriage between black male slaves and Amerindian women. Many of these slaves intermarried with Amerindian women in hopes of gaining freedom (if not for themselves, then their offspring). Many mixed African and Amerindian children resulted from these unions. The Spanish tried to prevent such Afro-Amerindian unions, but the mixing of the two groups could not be prevented. Slaves continued to pursue natives with the prospect of freedom. According to [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price's]] book ''Maroon Societies'' (1979), it is documented that during the colonial period that Amerindian women would rather marry black men than Amerindian men, and that black men would rather marry Amerindian women than black women so that their children will be born free. Price quoted this from a history by H.H. Bancroft published in 1877 referring to colonial Mexico. El Salvador's African population lived under similar circumstances, and the mixing between black men and native women was common during colonial times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjmjr.net/afromestizo/el_salvador.htm|title=Afromestizo|website=bjmjr.net|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807100042/http://www.bjmjr.net/afromestizo/el_salvador.htm|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Guatemala=====
There were many instances when black and mulatto men would intermarry with Mayan and other native women in Guatemala. These unions were more common in some regions than others. In Escuintla (called Escuintepeque at the time), the Pipil-speaking natives who lived at higher elevations tended to live away from the lowland coastal hot lands where black and mulatto men were concentrated. Yet, as black men grew in number during this period (1671–1701), a tendency developed for them to marry native women. In Zapotitlán (also known as Suchitepéquez), Spaniards were proportionately more significant than in Escuintla. Thus the smaller African population had less opportunity for endogamy and was disappearing by the early 18th Century as blacks married Mayans and mulattoes married mestizos and lower-ranking Spaniards. Finally in Guazacapán, a Pipil district that was 10% non native, church marriages between Mayas or Pipils and free mulattoes were rare. But black men frequently married Mayan women in informal unions, which resulted in a significant population of mestizaje here and throughout the coastal region. In the Valle de las Vacas, black male slaves also intermarried with Mayan women.&lt;ref name="Restall2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Restall |title=Beyond Black and Red: African-Native Relations in Colonial Latin America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HZE3pR9bRYYC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=mestiza+women+married+black+men#v=onepage&amp;q=mestiza%20women%20married%20black%20men&amp;f=false |year=2005 |publisher=UNM Press |isbn=978-0-8263-2403-0 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Jamaica and Haiti=====

In [[Haiti]], there is  a sizable percentage within the minority who are of [[Asian people|Asian]] descent. Haiti is also home to Marabou peoples, a half East Indian and half African people who descent from East Indian immigrants who arrived from other Caribbean nations, such [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] and African slave descendants. Most present-day descendants of the original Marabou are products of [[hypodescent]] and, subsequently, mostly of African in ancestry.

The country also has a sizable [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Chinese Haitian]] population. One of the country's most notable Afro-Asians is the late painter [[Edouard Wah]] who was born to a Chinese immigrant father and Afro-Haitian mother.

In Mexico, the concept of ''[[mestizaje]]'' (or ''the cultural and racial amalgamation'') is an integral part of the country's identity.

Such relationships were still not accepted by the church however. Black female slaves also did not gain any freedom from such unions.&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies1" /&gt;

=====Peru=====
About 100,000 Chinese coolies (almost all males) during 1849–1874 migrated to Peru and intermarried with Peruvian women of Mestizo, European, Ameridian, European/Mestizo, African and mulatto origin. Thus, many Peruvian Chinese today are of mixed Chinese, Spanish, African, or Ameridian ancestry. One estimate for Chinese-Peruvian mixture is about 1.3–1.6 millions. Asian Peruvians are estimated to be 3% of the population, but one source places the number of citizens with some Chinese ancestry at 4.2 million, which equates to 15% of the country's total population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php Taste of Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927041027/http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php |date=27 September 2013 }}.

In Peru and Cuba some Indian (Native American), mulatto, black, and white women engaged in carnal relations or marriages with Chinese men, with marriages of mulatto, black, and white woman being reported by the Cuba Commission Report and in Peru it was reported by the New York Times that [[Women in Peru|Peruvian black and Indian (Native) women]] married [[Chinese Peruvian|Chinese men]] to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of the men since they dominated and "subjugated" the Chinese men despite the fact that the labor contract was annulled by the marriage, reversing the roles in marriage with the Peruvian woman holding marital power, ruling the family and making the Chinese men slavish, docile, "servile", "submissive" and "feminine" and commanding them around, reporting that "Now and then&amp;nbsp;... he [the Chinese man] becomes enamored of the charms of some sombre-hued chola (Native Indian and mestiza woman) or samba (mixed black woman), and is converted and joins the Church, so that may enter the bonds of wedlock with the dusky señorita."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=82|edition=illustrated|year=2014|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=UNC Press Books|volume=Volume 4 of Wiley Blackwell Concise History of the Modern World|author=Elliott Young|quote=|location=|title=Alien Nation: Chinese Migration in the Americas from the Coolie Era Through World War II|series=The David J.

===Asia===
Inter-ethnic marriage in [[Southeast Asia]] dates back to the spread of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] to the region. From the 1st century onwards, mostly male traders and merchants from the [[Indian subcontinent]] frequently intermarried with the local female populations in [[Cambodia]], [[Burma]], [[Champa]], [[Central Thailand|Central Siam]], the [[Malay Peninsula]], and [[Malay Archipelago]]. Many [[Indianized kingdom]]s arose in Southeast Asia during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Streams of civilization|last=Albert Hyma|first=Mary Stanton|volume=1|publisher=Christian Liberty Press|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 9th century onwards, a large number of mostly male [[Arab]] traders from the Middle East settled down in the Malay Peninsula and Malay Archipelago, and they intermarried with the local [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]], [[Indonesia]]n and female populations in the islands later called the Philippines. This contributed to the spread of [[Islam in Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=Arab-Malays&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab and native intermarriage in Austronesian Asia|work=ColorQ World|url=http://www.colorq.org/MeltingPot/article.aspx?d=Asia&amp;x=ArabMalays|accessdate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th to the 17th centuries, many [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Arab people|Arab]] traders settled down within the maritime kingdoms of Southeast Asia and intermarried with the local female populations.

[[Sex tourism]] has emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and globalization. Sex tourism is typically undertaken internationally by tourists from wealthier countries. Author [[Nils Johan Ringdal|Nils Ringdal]] alleges that three out of four men between the ages of 20 and 50 who have visited Asia or Africa have paid for sex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment//reviews/love-for-sale-a-global-history-of-prostitution-by-nils-ringdal-trans-richard-daly-751462.html Love for Sale: a global history of prostitution by Nils Ringdal, trans Richard Daly].

[[Female sex tourism]] also emerged in the late 20th century in [[Bali]]. Tens of thousands of single women throng the beaches of Bali in Indonesia every year. For decades, young Balinese men have taken advantage of the louche and laid-back atmosphere to find love and lucre from female tourists—Japanese, European and Australian for the most part—who by all accounts seem perfectly happy with the arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2440&amp;Itemid=202 Bali Beach Gigolos Under Fire].

====China====
There have been various periods in the [[history of China]] where a number of [[Arab]]s, [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] from the western regions ([[Central Asia]] and [[West Asia]]) migrated to China, beginning with the arrival of [[Islam during the Tang dynasty]] in the 7th century. Due to the majority of these immigrants being male, some decided to intermarry with local [[Chinese people|Chinese]] females. Intermarriage was initially discouraged by the [[Tang dynasty]]. In 836 Lu Chun was appointed as governor of Canton, he was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and intermarriage between Chinese and foreigners. Lu enforced separation, banning interracial marriages, and made it illegal for foreigners to own property. Lu Chun believed his principles were just and upright.&lt;ref name=golden&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward H.

Chinese men also married Turkic [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] women in Xinjiang from 1880 to 1949. Sometimes poverty influenced Uyghur women to marry Chinese. These marriages were not recognized by local [[mullah]]s since Muslims women were not allowed to marry non-Muslim men under Islamic law. This did not stop the women because they enjoyed advantages, such as not being subject to certain taxes. Uyghur women married to Chinese also did not have to wear a [[veil]] and they received their husband's property upon his death. These women were forbidden from being buried in Muslim graves. The children of Chinese men and Uyghur women were considered as Uyghur.

One Chinese scholar Zhang Jingsheng wrote essays in 1924 and 1925 in various Chinese journals praising the advantages of miscegenation between Russians and Chinese, saying that interracial sex would promote greater understandings between the two peoples, and produce children with the best advantages of both peoples.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Bong, Inyoung A "White Race" without Supremacy: Russians, Racial Hybridity, and Liminality in the Chinese Literature of Manchukuo pages 137-190 from ''Modern Chinese Literature and Culture'', Volume 26, No. 1, Spring 2014 page 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang argued that Russians were taller and had greater physical strength than the Han, but the Chinese were gentler and kinder than the Russians, and so intermarriage between the two peoples would ensure children with the advantages of both.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Zhang wrote that the Russians were a tough "hard" people while the Chinese had a softer physique and more compassion, and miscegenation between the two would only benefit both.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Bong, InYoung A "White Race" without Supremacy: Russians, Racial Hybridity, and Liminality in the Chinese Literature of Manchukuo pages 137-190 from ''Modern Chinese Literature and Culture'', Volume 26, No. 1, Spring 2014 page 147.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhang mentioned since 1918 about one million Russian women who had already married Chinese men, and argued already the children born of these marriages had the strength and toughness of the Russians and the gentleness and kindness of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Zhang wrote what he ultimately wanted was an "Asia for Asians", and believed his plans for miscegenation were the best way of achieving this.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The South Korean historian Bong Inyoung wrote that Zhang's plans were based on a certain Social Darwinist thinking and a tendency to assign characteristics to various peoples in a way that might be considered objectionable today, but he was no racist as he did not see fair skin of the Russians as any reason why the Chinese should not marry them.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

European travellers noted that many Han Chinese in Xinjiang married Uyghur (who were called turki) women and had children with them.

Ever since the 1960s, African students were allowed by the Chinese government to study in China as friendly relations with Africans and African-related people was important to CCP's "Third World" coalition. Many African male students began to intermingle with the local Chinese women. Relationships between black men and Chinese women often led to numerous clashes between Chinese and African students in the 1980s as well as grounds for arrest and deportation of African students. The [[Nanjing anti-African protests]] of 1988 were triggered by confrontations between Chinese and Africans. New rules and regulations were made in order to stop African men from consorting with Chinese women. Two African men who were escorting Chinese women on a Christmas Eve party were stopped at the gate and along with several other factors escalated. The Nanjing protests lasted from Christmas Eve of 1988 to January 1989. Many new rules were set after the protests ended, including one where black men could only have one Chinese girlfriend at a time whose visits were limited to the lounge area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diaspora.northwestern.edu/mbin/WebObjects/DiasporaX.woa/wa/displayArticle?atomid=711 |title=Global Mappings: Nanjing Anti-African Protests of 1988–89 |work=Diaspora.northwestern.edu |date=1989-01-16 |accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state, fearing fraud marriages, has strictly regulated matters. In order to obtain government-issued identification (which is required to attend school), the children must be registered under the Chinese mother's family name.

====Hong Kong====
{{Main|Tanka people}}
Many Tanka women conceived children with foreign men. Ernest John Eitel mentioned in 1889 how an important change had taken place among Eurasian girls, the offspring of illicit connections: instead of becoming concubines, they were commonly brought up respectably and married to Hong Kong Chinese husbands. Many Hong Kong born Eurasians were assimilated into the Hong Kong society by intermarriage with the [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] population. A good example of a Cantonese Eurasian is [[Nancy Kwan]], a Hollywood sex symbol. Kwan was of Eurasian origin, born in 1939 in Hong Kong to a father who was a Cantonese architect and mother who is a model of British and Scottish descent. The martial artist [[Bruce Lee]] had a Cantonese father and a Eurasian mother.

Ernest John Eitel controversially claimed that most "half caste" people in Hong Kong were descended exclusively from Europeans having relationship with [[Tanka people|Tanka women]]. The theory that most of the Eurasian mixed race Hong Kong people are descended only from Tanka women and European men, and not ordinary Cantonese women, has been backed up by other researchers who pointed out that Tanka women freely consorted with foreigners due to the fact that they were not bound by the same Confucian traditions as the Cantonese, and having a relationship with a European man was advantageous for Tanka women, but Lethbridge criticized it as "a 'myth' propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community". Carl Smith's study in late 1960s on the protected women seems, to some degree, to support Ernest John Eitel's theory. Smith says that the Tankas experienced certain restrictions within the traditional Chinese social structure. Being a group marginal to the traditional Chinese society of the Puntis (Cantonese), they did not have the same social pressure in dealing with Europeans. The ordinary Cantonese women did not sleep with European men, thus the Eurasian population was formed mostly from Tanka and European admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Meiqi Lee |title=Being Eurasian: memories across racial divides |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVGd71y1Y-0C&amp;pg=PA262|year=2004 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-671-4 |page=262 |quote=EJ Eitel, in the late 1890s, claims that the 'half-caste population in Hong Kong' were from the earliest days of the settlement almost exclusively the offspring of liaisons between European men and women of outcast ethnic groups such as Tanka. Lethbridge refutes the theory saying it was based on a 'myth' propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community. Carl Smith's study in late 1960s on the protected women seems, to some degree, support Eitel's theory. Smith says that the Tankas experienced certain restrictions within the traditional Chinese social structure. Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations. The Tanka women did not have bound feet. Their opportunities for settlement on shore were limited. They were hence not as closely tied to Confucian ethics as other Chinese ethnic groups. Being a group marginal to the traditional Chinese society of the Puntis (Cantonese), they did not have the same social pressure in dealing with Europeans (CT Smith, Chung Chi Bulletin, 27). 'Living under the protection of a foreigner,' says Smith, 'could be a ladder to financial security, if not respectability, for some of the Tanka boat girls' (13 ).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Maria Jaschok|editor2= Suzanne Miers |title=Women and Chinese patriarchy: submission, servitude, and escape |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5o_t7VxHYAC&amp;pg=PA223 |accessdate=1 November 2011 |year=1994|publisher=Zed Books |isbn=978-1-85649-126-6 |page=223|quote=He states that they had a near-monopoly of the trade in girls and women, and that: The half-caste population in Hong Kong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the offspring of these Tan-ka people.

They invaded Hongkong the moment the settlement was started, living at first on boats in the harbour with their numerous families, gradually settling on shore. They have maintained ever since almost a monopoly of the supply of pilots and ships' crews, of the fish trade and the cattle trade, but unfortunately also of the trade in girls and women. Strange to say, when the settlement was first started, it was estimated that some 2,000 of these Tan-ka people had flocked to Hongkong, but at the present time they are about the same number, a tendency having set in among them to settle on shore rather than on the water and to disavow their Tan-ka extraction in order to mix on equal terms with the mass of the Chinese community.

The Portuguese had their wives, then, that came from abroad, but they could have no contact with the Chinese women, except the fishing folk, the tanka women and the female slaves. Only the lowest class of Chinese contacted with the Portuguese in the first centuries. But later the strength of Christianization, of the priests, started to convince the Chinese to become Catholic. […] But, when they started to be Catholics, they adopted Portuguese baptismal names and were ostracized by the Chinese Buddhists. So they joined the Portuguese community and their sons started having Portuguese education without a single drop of Portuguese blood.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the early intermarriages of people from China with Portuguese were between Portuguese men and women of [[Tanka people|Tanka]] origin, who were considered the lowest class of people in China and had relations with Portuguese settlers and sailors, or low class Chinese women.&lt;ref&gt;João de Pina-Cabral, p. 164: I was personally told of people that, to this day, continue to hide the fact that their mothers had been lower-class Chinese women – often even tanka (fishing folk) women who had relations with Portuguese sailors and soldiers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alibris.com"&gt;[http://www.alibris.com/search/books/isbn/9781157453604 Society of Macau: Macanese People, Public Holidays in Macau, Tanka People].

Very rarely did Chinese women of higher status agree to marry a Westerner. As Deolinda argues in one of her short stories, "even should they have wanted to do so out of romantic infatuation, they would not be allowed to. Macanese men and women also married with the Portuguese and Chinese; as a result some Macanese became indistinguishable from the Chinese or Portuguese population. Because the majority of the Chinese population who migrated to Macao was Cantonese, Macao became a Cantonese speaking society, and other ethnic groups became fluent in Cantonese. Most Macanese had paternal Portuguese heritage until 1974."&lt;ref name="alibris.com" /&gt; It was in the 1980s that Macanese and Portuguese women began to marry men who defined themselves ethnically as Chinese, which resulted in many Macanese with Cantonese paternal ancestry.&lt;ref name="Joaode" /&gt;

Literature in Macao was written about love affairs and marriage between the Tanka women and Portuguese men, like "A-Chan, A Tancareira", by Henrique de Senna Fernandes.&lt;ref&gt;João de Pina-Cabral, p. 164: Henrique de Senna Fernandes, another Macanese author, wrote a short story about a tanka girl who has an affair with a Portuguese sailor. In the end, the man returns to his native country and takes their little girl with him, leaving the mother abandoned and broken-hearted. As her sailorman picks up the child, A-Chan's words are: 'Cuidadinho ... cuidadinho' ('Careful ... careful'). She resigns herself to her fate, much as she may never have recovered from the blow (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Miu Bing Cheng, p. 173: Her slave-like submissiveness is her only attraction to him. A-Chan thus becomes his slave/mistress, an outlet for suppressed sexual urges. The story is an archetypical tragedy of miscegenation. Just as the Tanka community despises A-Chan's cohabitation with a foreign barbarian, Manuel's colleagues mock his 'bad taste' ('gosto degenerado') (Senna Fernandes, 1978: 15) in having a tryst with a boat girl … As such, the Tanka girl is nonchalantly reified and dehumanized as a thing (coisa). Manuel reduces human relations to mere consumption not even of her physical beauty (which has been denied in the description of A-Chan), but her 'Orientalness' of being slave-like and submissive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Miu Bing Cheng, p. 170: We can trace this fleeting and shallow relationship in Henrique de Senna Fernandes' short story, A-Chan, A Tancareira, (Ah Chan, the Tanka Girl) (1978). Senna Fernandes (1923–), a Macanese, had written a series of novels set against the context of Macao and some of which were made into films.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the handover of Macao to China in 1999 many Macanese migrated to other countries. Of the Portuguese and Macanese women who stayed in Macao, many married local Cantonese men, and so many Macanese also now have Cantonese paternal heritage. There are between 25,000–46,000 Macanese, but only 5,000–8,000 live in Macao, while most live in Latin America, the U.S., Portugal. Unlike the Macanese of Macao who are strictly of Chinese and Portuguese heritage, many Macanese living abroad have intermarried with the local population of the U.S. and Latin America and have only partial Macanese heritage.

The [[Indian subcontinent]] has a long history of inter-ethnic marriage dating back to [[ancient history]]. Various groups of people have been intermarrying for millennia in [[South Asia]], including speakers of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman languages]].

The origins and affinities of the approximately 1 billion people living on the subcontinent of India have long been contested. This is owing, in part, to the many different waves of immigrants that have influenced the genetic structure of India. In the most recent of these waves, [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking nomadic groups from the Near East, Anatolia and the Caucasus migrated to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11381027|year=2001|last1=Bamshad|first1=M.|last2=Kivisild|first2=T.|last3=Watkins|first3=W.

*[[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]] – "India is not the only Indo-European-speaking area that has not revealed any archaeological traces of immigration.

In [[Goa]], a [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colony in India]], during the late 16th century and 17th century, there was a community of over thousand [[Japanese slaves]] and traders, who were either [[Japanese Christians]] fleeing persecution in Japan,&lt;ref name=Leupp-52 /&gt; or young [[Japanese people|Japanese]] women and girls brought or captured as [[sexual slaves]] by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] traders and their South Asian ''[[lascar]]'' crew members from Japan.&lt;ref name=Leupp-49 /&gt; In both cases, they often intermarried with the local population in Goa.&lt;ref name=Leupp-52 /&gt; Some Portuguese also intermarried with local Goans prior to Goa's annexation by India, as well as with Goan emigres that settled in Portugal.

''[[Lakmé]]'', an opera by the Frenchman [[Léo Delibes]], deals with the romantic relationship between the British officer Gérald and the daughter of a Hindu high priest Lakmé (Laxmi in [[Sanskrit]]).

As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early-to-mid-19th century, interracial marriage became increasingly uncommon in India. Interracial relationships were also despised after the events of [[India's First War of Independence]], where Indian [[sepoy]]s rebelled against the British East India Company.

The idea of protecting British female chastity from the "lustful Indian male" had a significant influence on the policies of the [[British Raj]] in order to prevent racial miscegenation between the British females and the native Indian male population. While some restrictive policies were imposed on British females in order to protect them from miscegenation, most of these policies were directed against native Indian males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Converting Women|first=Eliza F.|last=Kent|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] US|year=2004|isbn=978-0-19-516507-4|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaul | first1 = S. | doi = 10.1353/dia.1996.0005 | title = Colonial figures and postcolonial reading | journal = Diacritics | volume = 26 | pages = 74–89 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurston described the colony of the Chinese men with their Tamil pariah wives and children: "Halting in the course of a recent anthropological expedition on the western side of the Nilgiri plateau, in the midst of the Government Cinchona plantations, I came across a small settlement of Chinese, who have squatted for some years on the slopes of the hills between Naduvatam and Gudalur, and developed, as the result of ' marriage ' with Tamil pariah women, into a colony, earning an honest livelihood by growing vegetables, cultivating coffee on a small scale, and adding to their income from these sources by the economic products of the cow.

[[International marriage (Japan)|Inter-ethnic marriage in Japan]] dates back to the 7th century, when [[China|Chinese]] and [[Korea]]n immigrants began intermarrying with the local [[Japanese people|Japanese]] population. In the 1590s, over 50,000 [[Korean people|Koreans]] were forcibly brought to Japan during [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea]], where they intermarried with the local population. In the 16th and 17th centuries, around 58,000 Japanese travelled abroad, many of whom intermarried with the local women in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=Leupp&gt;Leupp, pp. 52–3&lt;/ref&gt; During the anti-Christian persecutions in 1596, many [[Christianity in Japan|Japanese Christians]] fled to [[Macau]] and other [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]] such as [[Goa]], where there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders by the early 17th century. Intermarriage with the local populations in these Portuguese colonies also took place.&lt;ref name=Leupp-52&gt;Leupp, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders in Japan also intermarried with the local [[Christian]] women.&lt;ref&gt;Leupp, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 15th century, [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], Korean and other Far Eastern visitors frequented [[brothel]]s in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Leupp, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; This practice later continued among visitors from the "[[Western Regions]]", mainly European traders.&lt;ref name=Leupp-49&gt;Leupp, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; This began with the arrival of Portuguese ships to Japan in the 16th century. Portuguese visitors and their South Asian (and sometimes African) crewmembers often engaged in [[slavery in Japan]], where they bought Japanese slaves who were then taken to Macau and other Portuguese colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|the Americas]],&lt;ref name=Leupp-49 /&gt; and [[Portuguese India|India]].&lt;ref name=Leupp-52 /&gt; Later European East India companies, including those of the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] and [[East India Company|British]], also engaged in [[prostitution in Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Leupp, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage and sexual relations between European merchants and Japanese women was usual during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Cambria Press|year=2011|location=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A70rqmKB7ikC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=macao+Japanese+women#v=onepage&amp;q=macao%20Japanese%20women&amp;f=false|page=152|title=The Sakoku Edicts and the Politics of Tokugawa Hegemony|isbn=978-1-60497-738-7|author=Michael S.

A large-scale slave trade developed in which Portuguese purchased Japanese as slaves in Japan and sold them to various locations overseas, including Portugal itself, throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=HOFFMAN|first= MICHAEL|date=26 May 2013|title=The rarely, if ever, told story of Japanese sold as slaves by Portuguese traders |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/05/26/books/the-rarely-if-ever-told-story-of-japanese-sold-as-slaves-by-portuguese-traders/|newspaper=The Japan Times |accessdate=2014-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 2007|title=Europeans had Japanese slaves, in case you didn’t know… |url=http://www.japanprobe.com/2007/05/10/europeans-had-japanese-slaves-in-case-you-didnt-know/|newspaper=Japan Probe |location= |publisher= |accessdate=2014-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many documents mention the large slave trade along with protests against the enslavement of Japanese. Japanese slaves are believed to be the first of their nation to end up in Europe, and the Portuguese purchased large numbers of Japanese slave girls to bring to Portugal for sexual purposes, as noted by the Church in 1555. King Sebastian feared that it was having a negative effect on Catholic proselytization since the slave trade in Japanese was growing to massive proporations, so he commanded that it be banned in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25066328|title=Monumenta Nipponica (Slavery in Medieval Japan)|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|last=Nelson|first=Thomas|volume=59|pages=463–492|number=No. 4|date=Winter 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Sophia University|year=2004|location=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XoQMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Portuguese+and+other+Occidental+sources+are+replete+with+records+of+the+export+of+Japanese+slaves+in+the+second+half+of+the+sixteenth+century.+A+few+examples+should+serve+to+illustrate+this+point.+Very+probably,+the+first+Japanese+who+set+foot+in+Europe+were+slaves.+As+early+as+1555,+complaints+were+made+by+the+Church+that+Portuguese+merchants+were+taking+Japanese+slave+girls+with+them+back+to+Portugal+and+living+with+them+there+in+sin.+By+1571,+the+trade+was+being+conducted+on+such+a+scale+that+King+Sebastian+of+Portugal+felt+obliged+to+issue+an+order+prohibiting+it+lest+it+hinder+Catholic+missionary+activity+in+Kyushsu.&amp;dq=Portuguese+and+other+Occidental+sources+are+replete+with+records+of+the+export+of+Japanese+slaves+in+the+second+half+of+the+sixteenth+century.+A+few+examples+should+serve+to+illustrate+this+point.+Very+probably,+the+first+Japanese+who+set+foot+in+Europe+were+slaves.+As+early+as+1555,+complaints+were+made+by+the+Church+that+Portuguese+merchants+were+taking+Japanese+slave+girls+with+them+back+to+Portugal+and+living+with+them+there+in+sin.+By+1571,+the+trade+was+being+conducted+on+such+a+scale+that+King+Sebastian+of+Portugal+felt+obliged+to+issue+an+order+prohibiting+it+lest+it+hinder+Catholic+missionary+activity+in+Kyushsu.|quote= |volume=|page=463|title=Monumenta Nipponica: Studies on Japanese Culture, Past and Present, Volume 59, Issues 3-4|isbn=|others=Jōchi Daigaku|edition=|accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of the [[Shōwa era]], Japanese governments executed a eugenic policy to limit the birth of children with inferior traits, as well as aiming to protect the life and health of mothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioethics.jp/licht_genetics.html "The National Eugenic Law"] The 107th law that Japanese Government promulgated in 1940　(国民優生法) 第一条　本法ハ悪質ナル遺伝性疾患ノ素質ヲ有スル者ノ増加ヲ防遏スルト共ニ健全ナル素質ヲ有スル者ノ増加ヲ図リ以テ国民素質ノ向上ヲ期スルコトヲ目的トス, Kimura, Jurisprudence in Genetics&lt;/ref&gt; Family Center staff also attempted to discourage marriage between Japanese women and Korean men who had been recruited from the peninsula as laborers following its annexation by Japan in 1910. In 1942, a survey report argued that "the Korean laborers brought to Japan, where they have established permanent residency, are of the lower classes and therefore of inferior constitution&amp;nbsp;... By fathering children with Japanese women, these men could lower the caliber of the [[Yamato people|Yamato minzoku]]."

In 1928, journalist Shigenori Ikeda promoted 21 December as the blood-purity day (''junketsu de'') and sponsored free blood tests at the Tokyo Hygiene laboratory. By the early 1930s, detailed "eugenic marriage" questionnaires were printed or inserted in popular magazines for public consumption. Promoters like Ikeda were convinced that these marriage surveys would not only ensure the eugenic fitness of spouses but also help avoid class differences that could disrupt and even destroy marriage. The goal was to create a database of individuals and their entire households which would enable eugenicists to conduct in-depth surveys of any given family's genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/jennifer.robertson/files/blood_talks__eugenic_modernity_anthro___hist_2002.pdf |author=Robertson, J. |pmid=19499628|pages= 191–216 (205–206)|year=2002|title=Blood talks: Eugenic modernity and the creation of new Japanese|volume=13|issue=3|journal=History and Anthropology|doi=10.1080/0275720022000025547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian S. Kuznetsov, dean of the Department of History of the [[Irkutsk State University]], one of the first researchers of the topic, interviewed thousands of former internees and came to the following conclusion:What is more, romantic relations between Japanese internees and Russian women were not uncommon. For example, in the city of [[Kansk]], [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], about 50 Japanese married locals and stayed. Today many Russian women married Japanese men, often for the benefit of long-term residence and work rights.  Some of their mixed offspring stay in Japan while other's to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Crossing National Borders: Human Migration Issues in Northeast Asia, edited by Tsuneo Akaha, Anna Vassilieva [https://books.google.com/books?id=xrroO9pxJxcC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=Japanese+russian+marriage&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdqdHL-JfVAhXpC8AKHRrcDSgQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20russian%20marriage&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent venereal diseases and rape by Japanese soldiers and to provide comfort to soldiers and head off espionage, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] established "comfort stations" in the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] where around 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and China, were recruited or kidnapped by the [[Kempeitai]] or the [[Special Boarding Unit|Tokeitai]] as [[comfort women]].&lt;ref&gt;Yuki Tanaka, ''Hidden Horrors, Japanese War Crimes in World War II'', 1996, pp. 94–98., [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070418a5.html ''Evidence documenting sex-slaves coercion revealed''], "An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 women across Asia, predominantly Korean and Chinese, are believed to have been forced to work as sex slaves in Japanese military brothels", {{Harvnb|BBC|8 December 2000|Ref=BBC2000-12-08}};&lt;br /&gt;

One of the last eugenic measures of the Shōwa regime was taken by the [[Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko|Higashikuni]] government. On 19 August 1945, the Home Ministry ordered local government offices to establish a [[Recreation and Amusement Association|prostitution service for Allied soldiers]] to preserve the "purity" of the "Japanese race". The official declaration stated that: "Through the sacrifice of thousands of "[[Okichi]]s" of the [[Shōwa era]], we shall construct a [[wikt:dike|dike]] to hold back the mad frenzy of the occupation troops and cultivate and preserve the purity of our race long into the future...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', 2001, p. 538, citing Kinkabara Samon and Takemae Eiji, ''Showashi : kokumin no naka no haran to gekido no hanseiki-zohoban'', 1989, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Schrijvers]] in "''The GI War against Japan: American Soldiers in Asia and the Pacific during World War II''",&lt;ref name=het /&gt; rape "reflects a burning need to establish total dominance of the enemy". According to Xavier Guillaume, [[United States Army|US soldiers]]' rape of Japanese women was "general practice". Schrijvers states regarding rapes on Okinawa that "The estimate of one [[Okinawa]]n historian for the entire three-month period of the campaign exceeds 10,000. A figure that does not seem unlikely when one realizes that during the first 10 days of the occupation of Japan there were 1,336 reported cases of rape of Japanese women by American soldiers in [[Kanagawa]] prefecture alone".&lt;ref name=het&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=114661059720058 A Heterology of American GIs during World War II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707113121/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=114661059720058 |date=7 July 2007 }} by Xavier Guillaume, Department of Political Science, University of Geneva July 2003, (H-NET review of Peter Schrijvers.

====Korea====
Inter-ethnic marriage in [[Korea]] dates back to the arrival of [[Muslims in Korea]] during the [[Middle Ages]], when [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] navigators, traders and slaves settled in Korea and married local [[Korean people]]. Some [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]] and [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] eventually took place, owing to Korea's geographical isolation from the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/main/2002/11/06/39210_.html |title=Muslim society in Korea is developing and growing |work=[[Pravda]] |date=6 November 2002 |accessdate=23 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206221857/http://english.pravda.ru/main/2002/11/06/39210_.html |archivedate=6 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Korean clans that are descended from such intermarriages. For example, the [[Deoksu Jang clan]], claiming some 30,000 Korean members, views Jang Sunnyong, a [[Central Asia]]n who married a Korean female, as their ancestor.&lt;ref name=Grayson&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea: A Religious History|first=James Huntley|last=Grayson|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7007-1605-0|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another clan, Gyeongju Seol, claiming at least 2,000 members in Korea, view a Central Asian (probably an [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]) named Seol Son as their ancestor.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker |first=Don |title=Islam Struggles for a Toehold in Korea |journal=Harvard Asia Quarterly |date=Winter 2006 |url=http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/167/ |accessdate=23 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517214927/http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/167/ |archivedate=17 May 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goryeo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsinfo.co.kr/name/n06/n060213.html |work=Rootsinfo.co.kr (Korean language) |title=덕수장씨 |accessdate=20 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119133702/http://www.rootsinfo.co.kr/name/n06/n060213.html |archivedate=19 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are even cases of Korean kings marrying princesses from abroad. For example, the Korean text Samguk Yusa about the Gaya kingdom (it was absorbed by the kingdom of Silla later), indicate that in 48 AD, King Kim Suro of Gaya (the progenitor of the Gimhae Kim clan) took a princess (Princess Heo) from the "Ayuta nation" (which is the Korean name for the city of Ayodhya in North India) as his bride and queen. Princess Heo belonged to the Mishra royal family of Ayodhya. According to the Samguk Yusa, the princess had a dream about a heavenly fair handsome king from a far away land who was awaiting heaven's anointed ride. After Princess Heo had the dream, she asked her parents, the king and queen of Ayodhya, for permission to set out and seek the foreign prince, which the king and queen urged with the belief that God orchestrated the whole fate. That king was no other than King Kim Suro of the Korean Gaya kingdom.

6,423 Korean women married US military personnel as [[war bride]]s during and immediately after the [[Korean War]]. The average number of Korean women marrying US military personnel each year was about 1,500 per year in the 1960s and 2,300 per year in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Eui-Young Yu and Earl H.

Alexander Hamilton said that "The Tonquiners used to be very desirous of having a brood of Europeans in their country, for which reason the greatest nobles thought it no shame or disgrace to marry their daughters to English and Dutch seamen, for the time they were to stay in Tonquin, and often presented their sons-in-law pretty handsomely at their departure, especially if they left their wives with child; but adultery was dangerous to the husband, for they are well versed in the art of poisoning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Alexander |editor-last=Smithies |editor-first=Michael|date=1997 |title=Alexander Hamilton: A Scottish Sea Captain in Southeast Asia, 1689–1723 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=74FuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=thought+it+no+Shame+or+Disgrace+to+marry+their+daughters+to+English+and+Dutch+Seamen,+for+the+they+were+to+stay+in+,+and+often+presented+their+Son+in+Law+pretty+handsomely&amp;dq=thought+it+no+Shame+or+Disgrace+to+marry+their+daughters+to+English+and+Dutch+Seamen,+for+the+they+were+to+stay+in+,+and+often+presented+their+Son+in+Law+pretty+handsomely |publisher=Silkworm Books |edition=illustrated, reprint |page=205 |isbn=978-9747100457 |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malaysia and Singapore====
In West [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], the majority of inter-ethnic marriages are between [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]]. The offspring of such marriages are informally known as "[[Chindian]]", although the Malaysian government only classifies them by their father's ethnicity. As the majority of these intermarriages usually involve an Indian groom and Chinese bride, the majority of Chindians in Malaysia are usually classified as "[[Malaysian Indian|Indian]]" by the Malaysian government. As for the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], who are predominantly [[Muslim]], legal restrictions in Malaysia make it uncommon for them to intermarry with either the Indians, who are predominantly [[Hindu]], or the Chinese, who are predominantly [[Buddhist]] and [[Taoist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniels |first=Timothy P. |year=2005 |title=Building Cultural Nationalism in Malaysia |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-94971-2 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslims are required to convert to Islam in order to marry Muslims. However, this has not entirely stopped intermarriage between the Malays and the Chinese and Indians. The Muslim Chinese community is small and has only a negligible impact on the socio-economy and demography of the region.

It is common for [[Arabs in Singapore]] and Malaysia to take local Malay and [[Jawi Peranakan]] wives, due to a common [[Islam]]ic faith.&lt;ref name=Arab-Malays /&gt; The [[Chitty]] people, in Singapore and the [[Malacca]] state of Malaysia, are a [[Tamil people]] with considerable Malay descent, which was due to the first Tamil settlers taking local wives, since they did not bring along any of their own women with them. According to government statistics, the population of Singapore as of September 2007 was 4.68 million, of whom [[multiracial]] people, including [[Chindian]]s and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]], formed 2.4%.

In the East Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], intermarriage is common between [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and native tribes such as the [[Murut people|Murut]] and [[Dusun]] in Sabah, and the [[Iban people|Iban]] and [[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]] in Sarawak. This has resulted in a potpourri of cultures in both states where many people claiming to be of native descent have some Chinese blood in them, and many Chinese have native blood in them. The offspring of these mixed marriages are called 'Sino-(name of tribe)', e.g. Sino-Dusun. Normally, if the father is Chinese, the offspring will adopt Chinese culture and if the father is native then native culture will be adopted, but this is not always the case. These Sino-natives are usually fluent in [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[English language|English]]. A smaller number are able to speak Chinese dialects and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], especially those who have received education in vernacular Chinese schools.

====Myanmar (Burma)====
[[Burmese Muslims]] are the descendants of [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], [[Indian Muslims]], [[Arabs]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pashtun people|Pathans]], [[Chinese Muslims]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] who settled and intermarried with the local [[Bamar|Burmese]] population and other [[List of ethnic groups in Burma|Burmese ethnic groups]] such as the [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Karen people|Karen]], and [[Mon people|Mon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Harrassowitz| isbn=978-3-447-01357-4| last=Yegar| first=Moshe| title=The Muslims of Burma: a Study of a Minority Group| location=Wiesbaden| series=Schriftenreihe des Südasien-Instituts der Universität Heidelberg| year=1972| oclc=185556301| ref=CITEREFYegar1972| page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lay1973"&gt;{{cite journal| pages=109–11| last=Lay| first=Pathi U Ko| title=Twentieth Anniversary Special Edition of Islam Damma Beikman| journal=Myanmar Pyi and Islamic Religion| year=1973| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest Muslim group in [[Burma]] (Myanmar) are the [[Rohingya people]], who some believe are descended from Bengalis who intermarried with the native females in the [[Rakhine State]] after the 7th century, but this is just a theory. When Burma was ruled by the [[British India]] administration, millions of [[Burmese Indians|Indians]], mostly Muslim, migrated there. The small population of mixed descendants of Indian males and local Burmese females are called "Zerbadees", often in a pejorative sense implying mixed race. The [[Panthays]], a group of [[Chinese Muslims]] descended from [[West Asia]]ns and [[Central Asia]]ns, migrated from China and also intermarried with local Burmese females.&lt;ref name=Myanmar&gt;[http://www.colorq.org/MeltingPot/article.aspx?d=Asia&amp;x=BurmeseMuslims Muslim Communities in Myanmar]. ColorQ World&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Burma has an estimated 52,000 [[Anglo-Burmese people]], descended from [[British people|British]] and Burmese people. Anglo-Burmese people frequently intermarried with [[Anglo-Indian]] immigrants, who eventually assimilated into the Anglo-Burmese community.

The ''All India Digest'' said that when a [[Chinese in Burma|Chinese man]] married a Burmese woman, it must be proved that he adopted and followed the Burmese form of Buddhism before assuming that he followed Burmese Buddhism and that since many Chinese in Burma adopted Burmese names, adoption of a Burmese name was not proof enough for his adopting Burmese Buddhism, therefore, Chinese Buddhist customary law must be followed in cases involving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=577|edition=|year=1912|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=T.

The [[Philippines]] were originally settled by [[Australoid]] peoples called [[Negritos]] (different from other australoid groups) which now form the country's aboriginal community. Some admixture may have occurred between this earlier group and the mainstream [[Malayo-Polynesian]] population.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thangaraj | first1 = K. | last2 = Singh | first2 = L. | last3 = Reddy | first3 = A.

A considerable number of the population in the town of [[Cainta, Rizal]], are descended from [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] soldiers who mutinied against the [[Indian Army (1858–1947)|British Indian Army]] when the British briefly occupied the Philippines in 1762–63. These Indian soldiers, called [[Sepoy]], settled in towns and intermarried with native women. Cainta residents of Indian descent are very visible today, particularly in Barrio Dayap near Brgy. Sto Niño.

There has been a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] presence in the [[Philippines]] since the 9th century. However, large-scale migrations of Chinese to the Philippines only started during the Spanish colonial era, when the world market was opened to the Philippines. It is estimated that among [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], 10%–20% have some Chinese ancestry and 1.5% are "full-blooded" Chinese.&lt;ref name=ocac&gt;[http://www.ocac.gov.tw/english/public/public.asp?selno=1163&amp;no=1163&amp;level=B :: Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission, R.O.C. ::] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104195124/http://www.ocac.gov.tw/english/public/public.asp?selno=1163&amp;no=1163&amp;level=B |date=4 January 2011 }}.

According to the American [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Dr. H. Otley Beyer, the ancestry of [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] is 2% [[Arab]]. This dates back to when Arab traders intermarried with the local [[Malay race|Malay]] Filipina female populations during the [[History of the Philippines (Before 1521)|pre-Spanish history of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Arab-Malays /&gt; Major Arab migration to the Philippines coincided with the spread of [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam in the region]]. Filipino-Muslim royal families from the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] and the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] claim Arab descent even going as far as claiming direct lineage from [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Tagalog/Modules/Modules/MuslimMindanao/historical_timeline_of_the_royal.htm Historical Timeline Of The Royal Sultanate Of Sulu Including Related Events Of Neighboring Peoplesby Josiah C]. Seasite.niu.edu (30 August 2000). Retrieved 14 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Such intermarriage mostly took place around the [[Mindanao]] island area, but the arrival of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]] to the [[Philippines]] abruptly halted the spread of [[Islam]] further north into the Philippines. Intermarriage with [[Spanish people]] later became more prevalent after the [[Philippines]] was colonized by the [[Spanish Empire]].

When the Spanish colonized the Philippines, a significant portion of the Filipino population mixed with the Spanish. When the United States took the Philippines from Spain during the [[Spanish–American War]], much intermixing of Americans, both [[White American|white]] and [[Black American|black]], took place on the island of [[Luzon]] where the US had a Naval Base and Air Force Base, even after the USA gave the Philippines independence after World War II. First children and descendants of male Filipino population with Spanish surnames who intermarried with white American female population may be considered Spanish mestizos. The descendants of Filipinos and Europeans are today known as [[mestizo]]s, following the term used in other former Spanish colonies.

Much mixing with the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] also took place due to the [[war rape]]s of Filipina women during World War II. Today there is an increasing number of Japanese men marrying Filipina women and fathering children by them whose family remain behind in the Philippines and are financially supported by their Japanese fathers who make regular visits to the Philippines. Today mixed-race marriages have a mixed perception in the Philippines. Most urban centers like Manila and Cebu are more willing to accept interracial marriages than rural areas.

During the years following World War I, the [[French Army]] occupied the [[Rhineland]], utilising African soldiers amongst their forces. Their children were known as "[[Rhineland Bastards]]".

Beginning in 1933, the mainstream Nazi [[anti-Semitism]] considered the [[Jew]]s as being a group of people bound by close, so-called genetic (blood) ties, to form a unit, which one could not join or secede from. The influence of Jews had been declared to have a detrimental impact on Germany, in order to justify the discriminations and persecutions of Jews. To be spared from those, one had to prove one's affiliation with the group of the ''[[Aryan]] race'', as conceived by the [[Nazism|Nazis]].

It was paradoxical that neither genetic tests nor allegedly racial outward features in one's physiognomy determined one's affiliation, although the Nazis talked a lot about physiognomy, but only the records of the religious affiliations of one's grandparents decided it. However, while earlier the grandparents had still been able to choose their religion, their grandchildren in the Nazi era were compulsorily categorised as Jews, thus ''non-Aryans'', if three or four grandparents had been enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation, regardless of whether the persecuted themselves were Jews according to the [[Halachah]] (roughly meaning: Jewish by birth from a Jewish mother or by conversion), [[apostate]]s, [[irreligionist]]s or Christians.

The [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935 forbade persons ''racially'' regarded as so-called ''Aryans'' and ''non-Aryans'' to marry; this included all marriages where at least one partner was a German citizen. ''Non-Aryans'' comprised mostly Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent. The official definition of "Aryan" classified all non-Jewish Europeans as Aryans,&lt;ref&gt;the non-Jewish members of the European ''Volk'' are Aryans. . . .

Eventually children—whenever born—within a mixed marriage, as well as children from extramarital mixed relationships born until 31 July 1936, were discriminated against as [[Mischling]]e or crossbreed. However, children later born to mixed parents, not yet married as at the passing of the Nuremberg Laws, were to be discriminated against as [[Geltungsjude]]n, regardless of whether the parents had meanwhile married abroad or remained unmarried. Eventually children who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation were also subject to discrimination as Geltungsjuden.

[[Geltungsjude]]n were subjected to varying degrees of forced labour in 1940, partly ordered for all Jewish-classified spouses, either only for Jewish-classified husbands or only exempting Jewish-classified wives taking care of minor children. No documents indicate the exemption of a mixed marriage and especially of its Jewish-classified spouse from some persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;''Meldungen aus dem Reich: Auswahl aus den geheimen Lageberichten des Sicherheitsdienstes der SS 1939–1944'' (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1965; Reports from the Reich: Selection from the secret reviews of the situation of the [[SS]] 1939–1944; 1984 extended to 14 vols.), Heinz Boberach (ed. and compilator), Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv), &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1968, (dtv-dokumente; vol. 477) p. 208.

Systematic [[Deportation#Deportation in the Holocaust|deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent]] started on 18 October 1941.&lt;ref&gt;The earlier deportations of Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent from Austria and [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania]] (both to [[General Gouvernement|occupied Poland]]) as well as [[Baden]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] (both to [[Military Administration in Belgium and North France|occupied France]]) had remained a spontaneous episode.&lt;/ref&gt; German Jews and German Gentiles of Jewish descent living in ''mixed marriages'' were in fact mostly spared from deportation.&lt;ref&gt;At the [[Wannsee Conference]] the participants decided to include persons classified as Jews, but married to persons classified as Aryans, however, only after a divorce. In October 1943 an act, facilitating compulsory divorce imposed by the state, was ready for appointment, however, [[Hitler]] never granted the competent referees an audience. Pressure by the [[NSDAP]] headquarters in early 1944 also failed. Cf. Uwe Dietrich Adam, ''Judenpolitik im Dritten Reich'', Düsseldorf: 2003, pp. 222–234. {{ISBN|3-7700-4063-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that a mixed marriage ended by the death of the so-called Aryan spouse or the divorce of the Jewish-classified spouse, the Jewish-classified spouse residing within Germany was usually deported soon after unless the couple still had minor children not counted as Geltungsjuden.&lt;ref name="Beate Meyer 2006, p. 83"&gt;Beate Meyer, ''Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der Hamburger Juden 1933–1945'', Landeszentrale für politische Bildung (ed.), Hamburg: Landeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2006, p. 83. {{ISBN|3-929728-85-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1943 an attempt to deport the Berlin-based Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent, living in non-privileged mixed marriages, failed due to public protest by their in-laws of so-called ''Aryan'' kinship (see [[Rosenstraße protest]]). Also the Aryan-classified husbands and Mischling-classified children (starting at the age of 16) from mixed marriages were taken by the [[Organisation Todt]] for forced labour, starting in autumn 1944.

A last attempt, undertaken in February/March 1945, ended because the [[extermination camp]]s were already liberated. However, 2,600 from all over the Reich were deported to [[Theresienstadt]], of whom most survived the last months until their liberation.&lt;ref&gt;In summer 1945 all in all 8,000 Berliners whom the Nazis had classified as Jews because of 3 or 4 grandparents survived. Their personal faith – like Jewish, Protestant, Catholic or irreligionist – is mostly not recorded, since only the Nazi files which use the Nazi racial definitions report on them. 4,700 out of the 8,000 survived due to their living in a mixed marriage. 1,400 survived hiding, out of 5,000 who tried. 1,900 had returned from Theresienstadt.

With the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 the laws banning so-called mixed marriages were lifted again. If couples who had already lived together during the Nazi era had remained unmarried due to the legal restrictions then got married after the war, their date of marriage was legally retroactively backdated if they wished it to the date they formed a couple.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the ''Bundesgesetz über die Anerkennung freier Ehen'' (as of 23 June 1950, Federal law on recognition of free marriages).&lt;/ref&gt; Even if one spouse was already dead, the marriage could be retroactively recognised. In the [[West German Federal Republic of Germany]] 1,823 couples applied for recognition, which was granted in 1,255 cases.

====Hungary====

Starting in 1938, Hungary under [[Miklós Horthy]] passed a series of anti-Jewish measures in emulation of Germany's Nuremberg Laws. The first, promulgated on 29 May 1938, restricted the number of Jews in each commercial enterprise, in the press, among physicians, engineers and lawyers to twenty percent. The second anti-Jewish law (5 May 1939), for the first time, defined Jews racially: people with 2, 3 or 4 Jewish-born grandparents were declared Jewish. Their employment in government at any level was forbidden, they could not be editors at newspapers, their numbers were restricted to six per cent among theater and movie actors, physicians, lawyers and engineers. Private companies were forbidden to employ more than 12% Jews. 250,000 Hungarian Jews lost their income. Most of them lost their right to vote as well: before the second Jewish law, about 31% of the Jewish population of Borsod county (Miskolc excluded), 2496 people had this right. At the next elections, less than a month after this new anti-Jewish legislation, only 38 privileged Jews could vote.&lt;ref&gt;Braham, Randolph L. - Tibori Szabó, Zoltán, A Magyarországi Holokauszt Földrajzi Enciklopediája [The Geographic Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary].

====Iberian Peninsula====
[[File:Maler der Geschichte von Bayâd und Riyâd 002.jpg|thumb|''[[Hadith Bayad wa Riyad]]'' (12th century) was an [[Arabic literature|Arabic love story]] about an [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] female and a foreign [[Damascus|Damascene]] male.]]

In [[ancient history]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was frequently invaded by foreigners who intermarried with the native population. One of the earliest foreign groups to arrive in the region were the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Celts]] who intermarried with the [[Old European culture|pre-Indo-European]] [[Iberians]] in [[prehistoric Iberia]]. They were later followed by the [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and the Indo-European [[Roman conquest of Hispania|Romans]] who intermarried with the [[pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] during [[Classical Antiquity]].

They were in turn followed by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Visigoths]], [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]] and the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Sarmatians]] and [[Alans]] who also intermarried with the local population in [[Hispania]] during [[late Antiquity]]. In the 6th century, the region was reconquered by the [[Byzantine Empire]] (Eastern [[Roman Empire]]), when [[Byzantine Greeks]] also settled there, before the region was lost again to the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] less than a century later.

The offspring of marriages between Arabs and non-Arabs in Iberia (Berbers or local Iberians) were known as ''[[Muladi]]'' or ''Muwallad'', an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term still used in the modern [[Arab world]] to refer to people with Arab fathers and [[non-Arab]] mothers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kees Versteegh]], et al. ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics'', BRILL, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources consider this term the origin for the Spanish word ''[[Mulatto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgar.net/var/esclavos3.htm|title=La esclavitud en Huelva y Palos (1570–1587)|last=Izquierdo Labrado|first=Julio|language=Spanish|accessdate=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriatoday.ca/salloum-arab-lan.htm|title=The impact of the Arabic language and culture on English and other European languages|last=Salloum|first=Habeeb|publisher=The Honorary Consulate of Syria|accessdate=14 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630193414/http://www.syriatoday.ca/salloum-arab-lan.htm|archive-date=30 June 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Real Academia|Real Academia Española]] does not endorse such etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.es/rae-index.html |title=Real Academia Española |accessdate=9 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704122701/http://www.rae.es/rae-index.html |archivedate=4 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the term was mainly used during the time period of [[al-Andalus]] to refer to local Iberians (Christians and pagans) who converted to Islam or whose ancestors had converted. An example is the [[Banu Qasi]], a Muslim dynasty of Basque origin. In addition, many ''Muladi'' were also descended from ''[[Saqaliba]]'' ([[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]) slaves taken from Eastern Europe via the [[Arab slave trade]]. Collectively, Christian Europeans named all the Muslims of Iberia, "Moors", regardless of ethnic origin.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

After the [[Reconquista]], which was completed in 1492, most of the Moors were forced to either flee to Islamic territories or [[convert to Christianity]]. The ones who converted to Christianity were known as [[Morisco]]es, and they were often persecuted by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] as suspects of [[heresy]] on the basis of the ''[[Limpieza de sangre]]'' ("Cleanliness of blood") doctrine, under which anti-miscegenation laws were implemented in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Lacey]] (1983), ''Aristocrats'', p. 67, [[Little, Brown and Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone whose ancestors had miscegenated with the Moors or [[Jew]]s were suspected of secretly practicing [[Islam]] or [[Judaism]], so were often particularly monitored by the Inquisition. The claim to universal ''[[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalguía]]'' (lowest nobility) of the [[Basque people|Basques]] was justified by erudites like Manuel de Larramendi (1690–1766)&lt;ref name="Larramendi"&gt;de Larramendi, Manuel ''Corografía de la muy noble y muy leal provincia de Guipúzcoa'', Bilbao, 1986, facsimile edition of that from Editorial [[Ekin]], Buenos Aires, 1950.

Since there is no direct link between genetic makeup and religious affiliation, however, it is difficult to draw direct conclusions between their findings and forced or voluntary conversion.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{Cite journal

As was the case in other areas occupied by Muslims, it was acceptable in [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic marital law]] for a [[Muslim]] male to marry [[Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish females in southern Italy when under Islamic rule - namely, the [[Emirate of Sicily]] between the 8th and 11th centuries; and, of least importance, the short-lived [[Emirate of Bari]] between 847 and 871. In this case, most intermarriages were between [[Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] males from North Africa and the local [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italian]] females. Such intermarriages were particularly common in the [[Emirate of Sicily]], where one writer visiting the place in the 970s expressed shock at how common it was in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Emma Blake|contribution=The Familiar Honeycomb: Byzantine Era Reuse of Sicily's Prehistoric Rock-Cut Tombs|editor-last=Ruth M.

After a brief period when the [[Arab-Norman culture]] had flourished under the reign of [[Roger II of Sicily]], later rulers forced the Moors to either [[Conversion to Christianity|convert to Christianity]] or be expelled from the kingdom.

In [[Malta]], Arabs and Italians from neighbouring Sicily and [[Calabria]] intermarried with the local inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/core/article.php?id=270452 Alex E.

There are [[Maltese people]] are descended from such unions, and the [[Maltese language]] is descended from [[Siculo-Arabic]].

At times, the Italian city-states also played an active role in the [[Arab slave trade]], where Moorish and Italian traders occasionally exchanged slaves.

Already in the 17th century there were many marriages between Russian settlers and aborigines of [[Siberia]].
The Metis Foundation estimates that there are about 40,000 mixed-race Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Gribanova, Lyubov [http://www.nashi-deti.ru/articles/15/ "Дети-метисы в России: свои среди чужих"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104180141/http://www.nashi-deti.ru/articles/15/ |date=4 November 2008 }} (in Russian).

Many Chinese men, even those who had left wives and children behind in China, married local women in the 1920s, especially those women who had been widowed during the wars and upheavals of the previous decade. Their [[mixed race]] children tended to be given [[Names in the Russian Empire, Soviet Union and CIS countries|Russian forenames]]; some retained their fathers' [[Chinese surnames]], while others took on Russian surnames, and a large proportion also invented new surnames using their father's entire family name and given name as the new surname.

In 2017, ''The Moscow Times'' reported that "Mixed-race marriages are becoming more common in Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Love and Race in Modern Russia |url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/the-color-of-love-57131 |work=[[The Moscow Times]] |date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southeastern and Eastern Europe====
[[Vikings]] explored and eventually settled in territories in [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]-dominated areas of [[Eastern Europe]]. By 950 AD these settlements were largely Slavicized through intermarriage with the local population. Eastern Europe was also an important source for the [[Arab slave trade]] at the time, when ''[[Saqaliba]]'' (Slavic) slaves were taken to the [[Arab World]], where the women and girls often served in [[harem]]s, some of whom married their [[Arab]] masters. When the [[Mongol Empire]] annexed much of Eastern Europe in the 13th century, the [[Mongols]] also intermarried with the local population and often engaged in [[war rape]] during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]].

====Turkey====
[[File:Jean-Baptiste van Mour 010.jpg|thumb|Imaginary scene from the sultan's harem]]
In the 11th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory of [[Anatolia]] was conquered by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who came from [[Turkestan]] in [[Central Asia]]. Their [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman Turkish]] descendants went on to annex the [[Balkans]] and much of [[Eastern Europe]] in the 15th and 16th centuries. Due to [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic marital law]] allowing a [[Muslim]] male to marry [[Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish females, it was common in the [[Ottoman Empire]] for Turkish males to intermarry with European females. For example, various [[sultan]]s of the [[Ottoman Dynasty]] often had [[Greeks|Greek]] (''[[Rûm]]''), [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] (''[[Saqaliba]]''), [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], [[North Caucasus|Northcaucasian]] and French wives.

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], in addition to the Ottoman elites often taking large numbers of European wives and concubines (see [[#Southeastern and Eastern Europe|Southeastern and Eastern Europe]] section), there were also opportunities for the reverse, when the empire recruited young Christian boys (Europeans and Christian Arabs) to become the elite troops of the [[Turkish Empire]], the [[Janissaries]]. These Janissaries were stationed throughout the Turkish empire including the Middle-East and North Africa leading to inter-ethnic relationships between European men and women from the Middle East and North Africa.

The [[Imperial Harem|concubines of the Ottoman Sultan]] consisted chiefly of purchased slaves. Because Islamic law forbade Muslims to enslave fellow Muslims, the Sultan's concubines were generally of Christian origin. The mother of a Sultan, though technically a slave, received the extremely powerful title of ''Valide Sultan'', and at times became effective ruler of the Empire (see [[Sultanate of women]]). One notable example was [[Kösem Sultan]], daughter of a Greek Christian priest, who dominated the Ottoman Empire during the early decades of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Jay Winik (2007), ''The Great Upheaval''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable example was [[Roxelana]], the favourite wife of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].

Some of these European wives exerted great influence upon the empire as ''[[Valide Sultan]]'' ("Mother-Sultan"), some famous examples including [[Roxelana]], a Ukrainian harem slave who later became [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s favourite wife, and [[Nakşidil Sultan]], wife of [[Abdul Hamid I]], who according to legend may have been [[Aimée du Buc de Rivéry]], cousin of French Empress [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine]]. Due to the common occurrence of such intermarriages in the Ottoman Empire, they have had a significant impact on the ethnic makeup of the modern [[Turkish people|Turkish]] population in [[Turkey]], which now differs from that of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] population in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ottoman Empire, 1700–1922|last=Donald Quataert|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-63328-4|page=2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|authorlink=Institute of Turkish Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to intermarriage, the large harems of Ottoman sultans often consisted almost entirely of female [[Concubinage|concubines]] who were of Christian European origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The sultanate of women|publisher=Channel 4|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/harem.html|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan [[Ibrahim the Mad]], Ottoman ruler from 1640 to 1648, is said to have drowned 280 concubines of his harem in the Bosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2012/03/the-ottoman-empires-life-death-race/ The Ottoman Empire’s Life-or-Death Race]".

Intermarriage with non-European populations began as early as the [[First agricultural revolution|Agricultural Revolution]]. According to the Daily Mail (London) researchers have claimed to have found that a majority of British males have DNA that can be traced back to [[Middle East]]ern male farmers (from around present-day [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]) who around 8000 BC began migrating to Britain, introducing [[agriculture]] to the island, and settling down with local British females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1244654/Study-finds-Britons-descended-farmers-left-Iraq-Syria-10-000-years-ago.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Most Britons are descended from male farmers who left Iraq and Syria 10,000 years ago (and seduced the local hunter-gatherer women)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romani in Britain intermarried with the local population and became known to the Romani as the [[Romanichal]].

A Stanford team found the greatest diversity outside Africa among people living in the wide crescent of land stretching from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean to northern India. Not only was the region among the first colonized by the African migrants, they theorize, but the large number of European and East Asian genes among the population indicates that it has long been a human highway, with large numbers of migrants from both directions conquering, trading and generally reproducing along its entire length.

Inter-ethnic relationships were generally accepted in Arabic society and formed a fairly common theme in medieval [[Arabic literature]] and [[Persian literature]]. For example, the [[Persian people|Persian]] poet [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], who had himself married his [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] slave girl, wrote ''The Seven Beauties'' (1196).

A genetic anthropological study known as The Genographic Project has found what is believed to be faint genetic traces left by medieval [[Crusaders]] in the Middle East. The team has uncovered a specific DNA signature in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan that is probably linked to the 7th and 8th Christian crusades. The Crusaders originated from European kingdoms, mostly France, England and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7316281.stm Crusaders 'left genetic legacy']".

====Israel====
The modern State of Israel was established as a nation-state for the [[Jew]]ish people. The Jewish identity contains elements of religion (Judaism), ethnicity, and a sense of a common lineage.

Israeli law concerns itself with miscegenation based on Jewish ethnicity, not miscegenation based on race. Therefore, there are no restrictions on interracial marriages between Jews of different Jewish ethnic divisions, or between other co-religionists of different races, although social stigma may still exist. Furthermore, there is no legal impediment to inter-ethnic or inter-religious marriage per se, only that the state does not recognize them when they are solemnized within Israel.

Thus in Israel, all marriages must be approved by religious authorities, while civil marriages are legally recognized if performed abroad. Rules governing marriage are based on strict religious guidelines of each religion. Under Israeli law, authority over all issues related to Judaism in Israel, including marriage, falls under the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], which is Orthodox. [[Orthodox Judaism]] is the only form of Judaism recognized by the state, and marriages performed in Israel by non-Orthodox Rabbis are not recognized.

The Rabbinate prohibits marriage in Israel of halakhic Jews (i.e. people born to a Jewish mother or Jewish by conversion), whether they are Orthodox Jews or not, to partners who are non-Jewish or who are of Jewish descent that runs through the paternal line (i.e. not Jewish according to [[halakha]]), unless they undergo a formal conversion to Judaism. As a result, in the state of Israel, people of differing religious traditions cannot legally marry someone in another religion and multi-faith couples must leave the country to get married.

The only other option in Israel for the marriage of a halakhic Jew (Orthodox or not) to a non-Jew, or for that matter, a Christian to a non-Christian or Muslim to a non-Muslim, is for one partner to formally convert to the other's religion, be it to Orthodox Judaism, a Christian denomination or a denomination of Islam. As for persons with patrilineal Jewish descent (i.e. not recognized as Jewish according to halakha) who wish to marry a halakhic Jew (i.e., born to a Jewish mother or is Jewish by Orthodox conversion) who is Orthodox or otherwise, is also required to formally convert to Orthodox Judaism or they cannot legally marry.

According to a ''[[Haaretz]]'' article "Justice Ministry drafts civil marriage law for 'refuseniks{{'"}} 300,000 people, or 150,000 couples, are affected by marriage restrictions based on the partners' disparate religious traditions or non-halakhic Jewish status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/justice-ministry-drafts-civil-marriage-law-for-refuseniks-1.191997 |title=Justice Ministry drafts civil marriage law for 'refuseniks' |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |first=Yuval |last=Azoulay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Israeli Jews oppose mixed relationships between Jews and non-Jews, although it should be noted that this is not so much an Israeli phenomenon as a Jewish one, through fear of assimilation.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} There may also be an element in Israel that mixed relationships with Arabs represent an additional danger, politically as well as religiously: a 2007 opinion survey found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed intermarriage is equivalent to "national treason". A poll in 2014 found that three quarters of Israeli Jews and two thirds of Israeli Arabs would not marry someone from a different religion. Inter-faith relationships were opposed by 95 percent of [[Haredi Jews]], 88 percent of traditional and religious Jews and 64 percent of [[secular Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/204522/-percent-of-israeli-jews-oppose-intermarriage-ne/ |title=75 Percent of Israeli Jews Oppose Intermarriage, New Poll Says |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 August 2014 |website=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of 35 Jewish men, known as "Fire for Judaism", in [[Pisgat Ze'ev]] have started patrolling the town in an effort to stop Jewish women from dating Arab men. The municipality of [[Petah Tikva]] has also announced an initiative to prevent interracial relationships, providing a telephone hotline for friends and family to "inform" on Jewish girls who date Arab men as well as psychologists to provide counselling. The town of [[Kiryat Gat]] launched a school programme in schools to warn Jewish girls against dating local Bedouin men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1253198149221&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title='Protecting' Jewish girls from Arabs |newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090925/FOREIGN/709249932/0/rss |title=Israeli drive to prevent Jewish girls dating Arabs |publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |first=Jonathan |last=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 [[Maariv]] has reported that the [[Tel Aviv]] municipality has instituted an official, government-sponsored "counselling program" to discourage Jewish girls from dating and marrying Arab boys. ''[[The Times]]'' has also reported on a vigilante parents’ group policing the Jerusalem neighborhood of [[Pisgat Ze'ev]] to intimidate and discourage local Arab-Jewish couples. The Jewish anti-missionary group [[Yad L'Achim]] has also performed paramilitary "rescue operations" of Jewish women from non-Jewish husbands and celebrates the "rescued women" on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://coteret.com/2010/02/24/tel-aviv-presents-municipal-program-to-prevent-arab-boys-from-dating-jewish-girls/ |title=Tel Aviv presents: Municipal program to prevent Arab boys from dating Jewish girls |publisher=[[Coteret]] |date=4 February 2010 |first=Dimi |last=Reider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014 the marriage of a Muslim groom and a bride who had converted from Judaism to Islam attracted attention when the wedding was protested by [[Lehava]], an organisation opposing Jewish assimilation. An Israeli court allowed the protest to go ahead but ordered protesters to stay at least 200 metres away from the wedding venue in [[Rishon LeZion]]. In response a demonstration in support for the couple was also held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/rightwing-extremists-cant-break-the-love-of-a-muslim-man-and-jewish-woman-in-israel-20140818-1058hp.html |title=Right-wing extremists can't break the love of a Muslim man and Jewish woman in Israel |last1=Sobelman |first1=Batsheba  |date=18 August 2014 |website=[[smh.com.au]] |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
Miscegenation was a deliberate policy of the Western Australian Protector of Aborigines, [[A. O. Neville]], who hoped to "breed out" Aboriginal characteristics from the growing "half caste" population of Aborigines in Western Australia.  As a result, he failed to prosecute cases where half caste girls were sexually abused or raped by European Australian, who sought an evening on "the black velvet".  The children of such unions were often taken from their mothers and confined to "concentration camps" at Moore River and [[Carrolup]], as a part of the policy known as [[Stolen Generations]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

====New Zealand====
Miscegenation is a politically charged topic in New Zealand, although mixed marriages are very common and almost universally accepted. People who identify as Māori typically have ancestors ('tīpuna'&lt;ref&gt;Tīpuna, ancestors, grandparents {{cite web|title=Māori Dictionary|url=http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from at least two distinct ethnicities. Historically this has lent itself to the majority belief that "real" Māori were gradually disappearing from New Zealand and "one people" were forming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=Andrew|title=Justice and the Māori|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Auckland|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view held sway in New Zealand until the late 1960s and 70s, when a revival and re-establishment of Māori culture and tradition coincided with a rejection of the majority opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spoonley|first=Paul|title=Racism and Ethnicity|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Auckland|pages=38–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief that Māori were disappearing was partially founded on the reality of high and ongoing rates of intermarriage between Europeans and Māori before and since colonisation. During the revival of Māori culture and tradition this belief began to be challenged by redefining "Māori" as an ethnic identity as opposed to a racial category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spoonley|first=Paul|title=Racism and Ethnicity|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Auckland|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a person may have one European/Asian/Pacific parent and one Māori parent, but be considered no less "authentically Māori" than a descendent of two Māori.

Two-thirds of Māori births, half of Pacific births, and a third of white and Asian births belonged to more than one ethnic group.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10663627"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10663627 |title=Harawira comments hurt race relations |date=4 August 2010 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese colonies===
{{see also|Orfas del Rei}}
According to [[Gilberto Freyre]], a Brazilian sociologist, interracial marriage was commonplace in the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]], and was even supported by the court as a way to boost low populations and guarantee a successful and cohesive settlement. Thus, settlers often released [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] to become their wives. The children were guaranteed full [[Portuguese citizenship]], provided the parents were married. Some former Portuguese colonies have large [[multiracial|mixed-race]] populations, for instance, [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Mozambique]], [[Timor Leste]], [[Macau]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]. In the case of Brazil, the influential "Indianist" novels of [[José de Alencar]] ([[O Guarany]], [[Iracema]], and [[Ubirajara (novel)|Ubirajara]]) perhaps went farther than in the other colonies, advocating miscegenation in order to create a truly Brazilian race.&lt;ref&gt;Sá, Lúcia. Rain Forest Literature: Amazonian Texts and Latin American Culture. Minneapolis, Minnesota: U of Minnesota Press, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-8166-4325-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed marriages between [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and locals in former [[colonies]] were very common in all Portuguese colonies. Miscegenation was still common in Africa until the independence of the former Portuguese colonies in the mid-1970s. The case for miscegenation in Brazil started in the 1700's when gold was discovered in the heart of the country. This created a spectacular gold rush that lasted nearly 100 years. In this period close to a million men immigrated to Brazil in search of a quick fortune. Mostly were Portuguese. Since these men had no plans to bring their families, in the process they ended up fathering children with either African slaves or Native American women. And since the immigration during this period was overwhelmingly by males, this created a less strict society in terms of enforcing anti-racial laws.
However, Brazil was the last country in the western hemisphere to grant freedom to the slaves. And it only happened in 1888. When the slaves were freed, the plantation owners encouraged immigration from Europe as a form to replace the slaves. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, eugenics set foot in Brazil, and although it stated that the white race was superior to the other races, in the end, it somehow contributed to the continuation of the miscegenation of Brazil. With the Politica do Branqueamento (Whitening Policy), the Eugenics encouraged mulatto women (daughter of black and white parents)  to marry a white man. According to them,  the child would be born much whiter than her mother. 
And so the famous painting that perfectly describes their hopes, shows a black grandmother with her arms to the sky, thanking God for white grandchildren. You can see in the painting, a white man sitting at the door, and his wife, a mulatto woman, is holding the child. You can also see that the Mother is much darker than the daughter. And this painting reflected the hopes and dreams of the eugenists behind the Whitenning Policy in Brazil.

However, according to a study from the University of California at Berkeley, using data from over 1 million profiles of singles from online dating websites, whites were far more reluctant to date outside their race than non-whites. The study found that over 80% of whites, including whites who stated no racial preference, contacted other whites, whereas about 3% of whites contacted blacks, a result that held for younger and older participants. Only 5% of whites responded to inquiries from blacks. Black participants were ten times more likely to contact whites than whites were to contact blacks, however black participants sent inquiries to other blacks more often than otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2011/02/11/onlinedating/ In online dating, blacks more open to romancing whites than vice versa]".

Interracial marriage is still relatively uncommon, despite the increasing rate. In 2010, 15% of new marriages were interracial, and of those only 9% of Whites married outside of their race. However, this takes into account inter ethnic marriages, this meaning it counts [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|white Hispanics]] marrying [[non-Hispanic whites]] as interracial marriages, despite both bride and groom being racially [[white american|white]]. Of the 275,000 new interracial marriages in 2010, 43% were white-Hispanic, 14.4% were white-Asian, 11.9% were white-black and the rest were other combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204880404577226981780914906?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories|title=More Marriages Cross Race, Ethnicity Lines|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Theosophical University Press|accessdate=18 February 2012|first=Miriam|last=Jordan|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, interracial marriage has become more common over the past decades due to increasing racial diversity, and liberalizing attitudes toward the practice.

==Genetic admixture==
{{main|Genetic admixture}}
Sexual reproduction between two populations reduces the [[genetic distance]] between the populations. During the [[Age of Discovery]] which began in the early 15th century, European explorers sailed all across the globe reaching all the major continents. In the process they came into contact with many populations that had been isolated for thousands of years. The [[Tasmanian aboriginal]]s were one of the most isolated groups on the planet.&lt;ref name=Chasteen&gt;{{Cite book|title=Problems in modern Latin American history, sources and interpretations|first1=John Charles |last1=Chasteen|first2=James A |last2=Wood |publisher=Sr Books| url=https://books.google.com/?id=FxRdCirZ-voC&amp;lpg=PA4|year=2003|pages=4–10|isbn=978-0-8420-5060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many died from disease and conflict, but a number of their descendants survive today, often as mixed aboriginal and British. This is an example of how modern migrations have begun to reduce the genetic divergence of the human species.

[[New World]] demographics were radically changed within a short time following the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]].&lt;ref name=Chasteen/&gt; The colonization of the Americas brought Native Americans into contact with the distant populations of Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=Chasteen/&gt; As a result, many countries in the Americas have significant and complex [[multiracial]] populations. Furthermore, many who identify themselves by only one race still have multiracial ancestry.

Genetic studies indicate that the vast majority of African-Americans possess varying degrees of European admixture (the average Black American is 20% European) although studies suggest the Native American admixture in Black Americans is highly exaggerated; some estimates put average African-American possession of European admixture at 25% with figures as high as 50% in the Northeast and less than 10% in the south.&lt;ref name=23andme&gt;{{Smallcaps|Bryc}}, Katarzyna ''et al.''

The other 30% had African admixture ranging from 2% to 20% with an average of 2.3%.

Within the African-Americans population, the amount of African admixture is directly correlated with darker skin since less selective pressure against dark skin is applied within the group of "non-passing" individuals. Thus, African-Americans may have a much wider range of African admixture (&gt;0–100%), whereas European-Americans have a lower range (2–20%).

A small overlap exists such that it is possible that someone who identifies himself as [[white people|white]] may have more African admixture than a person who identifies himself as [[black people|black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sweet|first=Frank W. |title=Legal History of the Color Line: The Notion of Invisible Blackness|publisher=Backintyme Publishing|date=31 July 2005|page=542|isbn=978-0-939479-23-8 |url=http://backintyme.com/ad230.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Frank Sweet is not a reliable source.

A statistical analysis done in 1958 using historical census data and historical data on immigration and birth rates concluded that 21% of the white population had black ancestors.

===Admixture in Latin America===

====Background====
Prior to the European conquest of the [[Americas]] the demographics of Latin America was naturally 100% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]]. Today those who identify themselves as Native Americans are small minorities in many countries. For example, the CIA lists [[Demographics of Argentina#Indigenous peoples|Argentina's native population]] at 0.9%, [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Brazil's]] at 0.4%, and [[Uruguay]]'s at 0%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html CIA Factbook]. Cia.gov. Retrieved 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the range varies widely from country to country in [[Latin America]] with some countries having significantly larger [[Amerindian]] minorities. According to official statistics—as reported by the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] or CDI—Amerindians make up 10–14%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379167/Mexico Mexico]. Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; of the population of [[Demographics of Mexico|Mexico]].

[[File:Ignacio María Barreda - Las castas mexicanas.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of casta system in [[New Spain|Mexico]], 18th century]]

The early conquest of Latin America was primarily carried out by male soldiers and sailors from Spain and Portugal. Since they carried very few European women on their journeys the new settlers married and fathered children with Amerindian women and also with women taken by force from Africa. This process of miscegenation was even encouraged by the [[Spanish monarchy]] and it led to the system of stratification known as the [[Casta]]. This system had Europeans ([[Spanish people|Spaniards]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]) at the top of the hierarchy followed by those of [[mixed race]]. Unmixed Blacks and Native Americans were at the bottom. A philosophy of [[Racial whitening|whitening]] emerged in which Amerindian and African culture was stigmatized in favor of European values. Many Amerindian languages were lost as mixed race offspring adopted Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as their first languages. Only towards the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century did large numbers of Europeans begin to migrate to South America and consequently altering its [[Latin america#Demographics|demographics]].

In addition many [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]] were shipped to regions all over the Americas and were present in many of the early voyages of the [[conquistador]]s. [[Brazil]] has the largest population of African descendants outside Africa. Other countries such as [[Jamaica]], [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]] still have sizeable populations identified as [[Black people|Black]]. However countries such as [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] do not have a visible African presence today. Census information from the early 19th century shows that people categorized as Black made up to 30% of the population, or around 400,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fejerman | first1 = L. | last2 = Carnese | first2 = F.

The ideology of whitening encouraged non-whites to seek white or lighter skinned partners. This dilution of non-white admixture would be beneficial to their offspring as they would face less stigmatization and find it easier to assimilate into mainstream society. After successive generations of European gene flow, non-white admixture levels would drop below levels at which skin color or physical appearance is not affected thus allowing individuals to identify as white. In many regions, the native and black populations were simply overwhelmed by a succession of waves of European immigration.

Historians and scientists are thus interested in tracing the fate of Native Americans and Africans from the past to the future. The questions remain about what proportion of these populations simply died out and what proportion still has descendants alive today including those who do not racially identify themselves as their ancestors would have. Admixture testing has thus become a useful objective tool in shedding light on the demographic history of Latin America.

Unlike in the United States, there were no anti-miscegenation policies in Latin America. Though still a racially stratified society there were no significant barriers to gene flow between the three populations. As a result, admixture profiles are a reflection of the colonial populations of Africans, Europeans and Amerindians. The pattern is also sex biased in that the African and Amerindian maternal lines are found in significantly higher proportions than African or Amerindian Y chromosomal lines. This is an indication that the primary mating pattern was that of European males with Amerindian or African females. According to the study more than half the white populations of the Latin American countries studied have some degree of either Native American or African admixture ([[MtDNA]] or [[Y chromosome]]). In countries such as Chile and Colombia almost the entire white population was shown to have some non-white admixture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martínez Marignac|first=Verónica L.|author2=Bianchi Néstor O.|author3=Bertoni Bernardo|author4=Parra Esteban J.|year=2004|title=Characterization of Admixture in an Urban Sample from Buenos Aires, Argentina, Using Uniparentally and Biparentally Inherited Genetic Markers|journal=Human Biology| volume=76|issue=4|pages=543–57|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/human_biology/v076/76.4marignac.html| doi=10.1353/hub.2004.0058|pmid=15754971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonçalves|first=V.

===Admixture in the Philippines===
[[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|Historically]], admixture has been a common phenomenon in the Philippines. The Philippines were originally settled by [[Australoid]] peoples called [[Negritos]] which now form the country's aboriginal community. Admixture occurred between this earlier group and the mainstream [[Malayo-Polynesian]] population.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

There has been [[Indian Filipino|Indian migration]] to and influence in the Philippines since the precolonial era. About 25% of the words in the [[Tagalog language]] are [[Sanskrit]] terms and about 5% of the country's population possess Indian ancestry from antiquity.&lt;ref name=precolonial&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kmEVqnol?url=http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Pool/1644/precolonial.html Pre Colonial Period]. geocities.com&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] presence in the [[Philippines]] since the 9th century. However, large-scale migrations of Chinese to the Philippines only started during the Spanish colonial era, when the world market was opened to the Philippines. It is estimated that among [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], 10%–20% have some Chinese ancestry and 1.5% are "full-blooded" Chinese.&lt;ref name=ocac/&gt;

According to the American [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Dr. H. Otley Beyer, the ancestry of [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] is 2% [[Arab]]. This dates back to when Arab traders intermarried with the local [[Malay race|Malay]] Filipina female populations during the [[History of the Philippines (Before 1521)|pre-Spanish history of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Arab-Malays/&gt; A recent genetic study by [[Stanford University]] indicates that at least 3.6% of the population are [[European ethnic groups|European]] or of part European descent from both [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[United States]] colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Capelli | first1 = C. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = J.

Genetic evidence has shown that the [[Romani people]] ("[[Names of the Romani people|Gypsies]]") originated from the [[Indian subcontinent]] and mixed with the local populations in [[Central Asia]], the Middle East, and Europe. In the 1990s, it was discovered that Romani populations carried large frequencies of particular [[Y chromosome]]s (inherited paternally) that otherwise exist only in populations from [[South Asia]], in addition to fairly significant frequencies of particular [[mitochondrial DNA]] (inherited maternally) that is rare outside South Asia.

A study from 2001 by Gresham et al. suggests "a limited number of related founders, compatible with a small group of migrants splitting from a distinct caste or tribal group".&lt;ref name="David_Gresham"/&gt; Also the study pointed out that "genetic drift and different levels and sources of admixture, appear to have played a role in the subsequent differentiation of populations".&lt;ref name="David_Gresham"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Origins and Divergence of the Roma (Gypsies) |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=1314–1331 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1235543 |accessdate=2017-01-17 |pmid=11704928 |doi=10.1086/324681 |pmc=1235543 |year=2001 |last1=Gresham |first1=D. |last2=Morar |first2=B. |last3=Underhill |first3=P.

A 2004 study by Morar et al. concluded that the Romani are "a founder population of common origins that has subsequently split into multiple socially divergent and geographically dispersed Gypsy groups".&lt;ref name="Bharti_Morar"/&gt; The same study revealed that this population "was founded approximately 32–40 generations ago, with secondary and tertiary founder events occurring approximately 16–25 generations ago".&lt;ref name="Bharti_Morar"/&gt;

The [[national anthem]] of [[Bolivia]] (Himno Nacional de Bolivia), also known as '''Bolivianos, el Hado Propicio''' (Bolivians, a most Favorable Destiny) was adopted in 1851.  [[José Ignacio de Sanjinés]], a signer of both the Bolivian Declaration of Independence and the first Bolivian Constitution, wrote the lyrics. The music was composed by an [[Italian people|Italian]], Leopoldo Benedetto Vincenti.

==Lyrics==
The words of the Bolivian National Anthem are as follows (with parallel translation into English):

coronó nuestros votos y anhelos.&lt;br&gt;
Es ya libre, ya libre este suelo,&lt;br&gt;

The '''Nepalis''' ({{lang-ne|नेपाली}}) are citizens of the [[Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal]] under the provisions of [[Nepali nationality law]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawcommission.gov.np/en/documents/2015/08/nepal-citizenship-rules-2063-2006.pdf Nepal Citizenship Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legalnepal.com/Nepal_citizenship_act.pdf Nepal Citizenship Act 2006(in Nepali)&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to people of many different national and ethnic origins. As a result, people of Nepal do not equate their [[nationality]] with [[ethnic groups in Nepal|ethnicity]], but with [[citizenship]] and [[allegiance]]. Although citizens make up the majority of Nepali, non-citizen residents, dual citizen, and expatriates may also claim a Nepali identity. [[Nepal]]ese are descendants of migrants from parts of [[Indian Nepali|India]], [[Tibet]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and parts of [[Burma]] and [[Yunnan]], and much further traces origin to [[Iran]] and [[Central Asia]], along with [[indigenous peoples]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Nepal - Location Map (2013) - NPL - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|People having citizenship 
and allegiance of Nepal are Nepali]]
Local legends say that a Hindu sage named "Ne" established himself in the valley of Kathmandu in prehistoric times and that the word "Nepal" came into existence as the place was protected ("pala" in [[Pali]]) by the sage "Ne". It is mentioned in [[Vedic]] texts that this region was called Nepal centuries ago. According to the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', a [[rishi]] called "Ne" or "Nemuni" used to live in the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dangol |first=Amrit |url=http://www.aloneinkathmandu.com/2007/05/something-about-nepal.html |title=Alone in Kathmandu |publisher=Alone in Kathmandu |date=6 May 2007 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Pashupati Purana'', he is mentioned as a saint and a protector.&lt;ref&gt;Prasad, P. 4 ''The life and times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal''&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have practised [[tapasya|meditation]] at the Bagmati and Kesavati rivers&lt;ref&gt;Khatri, P. 16 ''The Postage Stamps of Nepal''&lt;/ref&gt; and to have taught there.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;W.B., P. 34 ''Land of the Gurkhas''&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the country is also identical in origin to the name of the [[Newar people]]. The terms "Nepāl", "Newār", "Newāl" and "Nepār" are phonetically different forms of the same word, and instances of the various forms appear in texts in different times in history. Nepal is the learned [[Sanskrit]] form and Newar is the colloquial [[Prakrit]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malla |first=Kamal P |url=http://www.kpmalla.com/?attachment_id=285 |title=Nepala: Archaeology of the Word |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322214352/http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Nepala.pdf |archivedate=22 March 2012 }} Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; A Sanskrit inscription dated 512 CE found in Tistung, a valley to the west of Kathmandu, contains the phrase "greetings to the Nepals" indicating that the term "Nepal" was used to refer to both the country and the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malla |first=Kamal P |url=http://www.kpmalla.com/?attachment_id=285 |title=Nepala: Archaeology of the Word |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322214352/http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Nepala.pdf |archivedate=22 March 2012 }} Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Majupuria |first1=Trilok Chandra |last2=Majupuria |first2=Indra |year=1979 |title=Glimpses of Nepal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jDNuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=nepal+nepar&amp;dq=nepal+nepar&amp;hl=ne&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XnGcUqXIHcH_rQfGvIHoDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwCA |publisher=Maha Devi |page=8 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open educational resource policies (OER policies)''' are principles or tenets adopted by governing bodies in support of the use of [[open content]]—specifically [[open educational resources]] (OER) -- and [[Open Educational Practices|practices]] in educational institutions. Such policies are emerging increasingly at the national, state/province, and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Giving Knowledge  for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI), OECD|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creative Commons]] defines (OER) policies as "legislation, institutional policies, and/or funder mandates that lead to the creation, increased use, and/or support for improving OER."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OER Policy Registry|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Policy_Registry|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; OER are learning materials that reside in the public domain or have been released under an [[free license|intellectual property license]] that permits their free use and re-purposing by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Educational Resources|url=http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education-program/open-educational-resources|publisher=William and Flora Hewlett Foundation|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== OER Policy Clearinghouses ==
[[Creative Commons]] hosts an open educational resources policy registry which lists 112 current and proposed open education policies from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OER Policy Registry|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Policy_Registry|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another resource for finding OER policies is the Open Educational Quality Initiative [http://www.oer-quality.org/clearinghouse/browse/ OPAL Best Practice Clearing House]. The OPAL Initiative is a partnership between seven organizations including the [http://www.icde.org International Council for Open and Distance Education] (ICDE), UNESCO, European Foundation for Quality, the Open University UK, Aalto University and the Catholic University Portugal. Led by the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, it is partly funded by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The OPAL Initiative | url = http://www.oer-quality.org/the-opal-initiative/ | website = OPAL Open Educational Quality Initiative | publisher = University Duisburg Essen | accessdate = 23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO OER Congress ==
On Friday 22 June 2012, the [[UNESCO]] World Open Educational Resources (OER) Congress released the [[UNESCO 2012 Paris OER Declaration|2012 Paris OER Declaration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2012 Paris OER Declaration|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/Events/Paris%20OER%20Declaration_01.pdf|newspaper=2012 World Open Educational Resources (OER) Congress  UNESCO, Paris, June 20–22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which called on governments to openly license publicly funded educational materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO World OER Congress releases 2012 Paris OER Declaration|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/all-news/news/unesco_world_oer_congress_releases_2012_paris_oer_declaration/|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Educational Resources Congress passes historic declaration|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/2012/open-educational-resources-congress-passes-historic-declaration/|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO member states unanimously approved the declaration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Cable|title=2012 Paris OER Declaration|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33089|newspaper=Creative Commons blog|date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which highlights the importance of [[open educational resources]] and gives recommendations to governments and institutions around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=J.M.|author2=Hoel, T.|title=Towards a Global Policy for Open  Educational Resources: The Paris OER Declaration and its  Implications|journal=White Paper 0.2|year=2012|url=http://monet.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/giotto/OpenScout_df6f1252-bfa6-11e1-a668-e13baff9bd23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies adopted by national councils of education ==
On January 17, 2014, the Council on Higher Education in South Africa published a ''[http://www.che.ac.za/announcements/white-paper-post-school-education-and-training White Paper for Post-School Education and Training]''. This paper emphasized open learning principles and set the stage for supporting national efforts to design and develop high-quality open educational resources. In response the [http://oeru.org/oeru-partners/university-of-south-africa/ University of South Africa (UNISA)]—one of the founding partners of the [http://wikieducator.org/OERu/Home OERu network] and a member of the 2012 Unesco OER conference in Paris—approved an Open Educational Resource (OER) Strategy in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Education Resources (OER) Strategy, 2014-2016 | publisher = University of South Africa (UNISA) | url = http://www.unisa.ac.za/contents/unisaopen/docs/OER%20Strategy%20%28final%29%20March%202014.pdf | date = 26 March 2014 | accessdate = 20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies adopted by research universities ==
An open-access policy enacted by the Faculty of a research university can empower them in choosing how to distribute their own scholarly work. If a faculty member wishes to grant exclusive rights to a publisher, they would first need to request a waiver from their faculty governance body. Some reasons to implement this kind of policy institution-wide are to:
# increase the overall impact of an institution's research contributions to the global knowledge economy, 
# individual faculty receive their institution's full support in a unified action to work with publishers to simplify procedures and broaden access to their scholarly work (allowing for greater possibilities for citations of their work - important for hiring, tenure and promotion decisions),
# take advantage of scholarly interactions with a greater diversity of readers, not just those who can afford to purchase the information from a vendor or attend an academic conference.

This kind of blanket policy provides support to those whose research is not part of a project that requires open access to the research done. For example, since the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310081557/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf February 2013 directive] from the [http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp United States Office of Science and Technology Policy], U.S. federal agencies have been developing their own policies on making research freely available within a year of publication.

SPARC, the [http://sparc.arl.org/about Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition], led the collaborative and open effort to create an "Open Access Spectrum" that demonstrates a more sophisticated approach is needed in discussions about the concept of openness in research communications. The [http://sparc.arl.org/resource/howopenisit "HowOpenIsIt? Guide] (as well as an FAQ document and slide deck) is available for download on the SPARC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Yaplee | first = Darlene | title = HowOpenIsIt? New Guide Released | website = Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) | publisher = Association of Research Libraries | url = http://sparc.arl.org/resource/howopenisit | place = Washington D.C. | accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another useful guide has been developed by members of the Harvard Office for Scholarly Communication, the Harvard Open Access Project, and the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. This online guide, "[https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies Good practices for university open-access policies]" is built on a wiki and is designed to evolve over time, according to the co-authors: Emily Kilcer, Stuart Shieber and Peter Suber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Good practices for university open-access policies | website = Harvard Open Access Project | publisher = Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Harvard University | place = Cambridge, MA | url = https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies | accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2013, the Faculty Board of the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) created an institution-wide Open Access Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Schaffhauser | first = Dian | title = Caltech Adopts Open Access Policy for Scholarly Writing | date = 6 January 2014 | url = http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/01/06/caltech-adopts-open-access-policy-for-scholarly-writing.aspx | newspaper= Campus Technology |location= Chatsworth, CA |publisher= 1105 Media Inc, Ed-Tech Group | accessdate = 2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = California Institute of Technology Open Access Policy, Approved by the Caltech Faculty Board on June 10, 2013 | url = http://library.caltech.edu/coda/OA_Policy_6.10.2013.pdf | last = Faculty Board | first = California Institute of Technology | accessdate = 2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that as of January 1, 2014, all Caltech faculty must agree to grant nonexclusive rights to Caltech to disseminate their scholarly papers either via the authors' own sites or to Caltech AUTHORS, the online repository. The goal is to encourage wider distribution of their work and to simplify the copyright process when posting research on faculty or institutional Web sites. The initiative was put in place to prevent publishers of those journals from threatening legal action or issuing takedown notices to authors who have posted their content on their own sites or to [http://authors.library.caltech.edu/ CaltechAUTHORS], an online repository for research papers authored by Caltech faculty and other researchers at Caltech.

==== Duke University ====
On March 21, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Geoffrey | last = Mock | title = Faculty Move Forward on Open Access Policy | website = DukeToday | publisher = Office of News and Communications, Duke University | date = 21 March 2010 | url = http://today.duke.edu/2010/03/accessvote.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Duke University]] Academic Council voted to support the University Library's new data repository, [http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/ DukeSpace], with a blanket policy to provide open access to their scholarly writings. The policy allows for faculty members to opt out at any time, and it is regularly reviewed to determine its effectiveness.

Duke also in 2010 joined the [http://www.oacompact.org/ Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity] (COPE) and established a fund to help Duke faculty members to cover any [[author fees]] required to publish in open access journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Access at Duke University | website = Duke University Libraries | url = http://library.duke.edu/research/openaccess | publisher = Duke University | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Harvard University ====
On February 12, 2008, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of [[Harvard University]] approved their [https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/hfaspolicy Open Access Policy], granting to the President and Fellows of Harvard to "make available his or her scholarly articles and to exercise the copyright in those articles ... in a nonexclusive, irrevocable, paid-up, worldwide license..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Open Access Policy, Voted February 12, 2008 | website = Office for Scholarly Communication | publisher = Harvard University Library | location = Cambridge, MA | url = https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/hfaspolicy | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several other schools within the University now participate in the Open Access Policies supported by the Office for Scholarly Communication: the Graduate School of Design, the School of Education, the Business School, the Law School, the Kennedy School of Government, the Divinity School, and the School of Public Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Access Policies | website = Office for Scholarly Communication | publisher = Harvard University Library | location = Cambridge, MA  | url = https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University's open-access repository is called [https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/ DASH] (Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard) which is where the faculty upload their scholarly articles for access by all.

==== Massachusetts Institute of Technology ====
Adopted by a unanimous vote on March 18, 2009, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) Faculty adopted an open access policy. The policy applies to "all scholarly articles written while the person is a member of the Faculty except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the Faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MIT Faculty Open Access Policy | website = Scholarly Publishing @ MIT | publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology | url = http://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/mit-open-access/open-access-at-mit/mit-open-access-policy/ | accessdate = April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIT online repository is called [http://dspace.mit.edu/login DSpace@MIT] and it was designed to work seamlessly with Google Scholar. The Faculty revised and updated the policy in 2010 to take into consideration the various issues associated with the MIT librarians' discussions with publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holton|first=Richard|title=Maintaining Our Resolutions: Implementing the MIT Faculty Open Access Policy|journal=MIT Faculty Newsletter|date=November–December 2010|volume=XXIII|issue=2|url=http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/232/holton.html|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Princeton University ====
In 2010 the Dean of the Faculty of [[Princeton University]] appointed an ad-hoc committee of faculty and the University Librarian to study the question of open access to faculty publications - and in March 2011, the committee recommended several changes to the Faculty rules to allow for a blanket policy for open access to Princeton faculty scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Memo to the Faculty Advisory Committee on Policy from the Ad-hoc Faculty Committee to study Open Access | url = http://www.princeton.edu/dof/policies/publ/fac/open-access-policy/open-access-report.pdf |  website = Office of the Dean of the Faculty | publisher = Princeton University | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty approved an open access policy on September 19, 2011, which was last revised in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Access Policy | website = Office of the Dean of the Faculty | publisher = Princeton University | url = http://www.princeton.edu/dof/policies/publ/fac/open-access-policy/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stanford University ====
On June 26, 2008, the [[Stanford University]] Graduate School of Education (GSE) were the first in that school to grant permission to the University to make their scholarly articles publicly accessible and to exercise the copyright in a "nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license ... provided that the articles are properly attributed to the authors not sold for a profit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GSE Open Access Motion | website = Stanford Graduate School of Education | publisher = Stanford University | url = https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty-research/open-archive/open-access-motion | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://openarchive.stanford.edu/ GSE Open Archive] houses and makes publicly available the GSE authors' working papers as well as published articles. Between May 21-24th, 2013, the Stanford GSE doctoral students voted in favor of a motion to enact an Open Access policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GSE Student Open Archive Motion | website = Stanford Graduate School of Education | publisher = Stanford University | url = https://openarchive.stanford.edu/content/gse-student-open-archive-motion | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, however, despite the strong case made by Professors John Willinsky and Juan Pablo Alperin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = John | last = Willinsky | first2 = Juan Pablo | last2 = Alperin | title = The academic ethics of open access to research and scholarship | website = Open Archive | publisher = Stanford University | url = https://openarchive.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Wilinsky_Alperin_0.pdf | year = 2011 | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; no other Stanford academic units have stepped forward.

==== University of California ====
On July 24, 2013, the Academic Senate of the [[University of California]] (UC) approved the UC Open Access Policy for all 8,000 plus faculty at their ten campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UC Open Access Policy | website = Office of Scholarly Communication | publisher = University of California | url = http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some confusion at the local campuses led to online postings of journal articles whose copyright was already owned by publishers. For example, in December 2013, the academic publishing company [http://www.elsevier.com Elsevier] sent several UC faculty notices to take down certain journal articles posted openly on their campus webpages, e.g., on the department websites or faculty profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Elsevier Takedown Notices for Faculty Articles on UC Sites | website = Office of Scholarly Communication | publisher = University of California | url = http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2013/12/elsevier-takedown-notices/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UC Open Access Policy protected those faculty who had correctly uploaded their articles to the UC [http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/publishing-tools/ eScholarship] repository. In another case of misunderstanding by the faculty about open access, in March 2014 the University received a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) takedown notice for nine articles owned by the American Society for Civil Engineers (ASCE). The UC faculty authors had uploaded to eScholarship the publisher-formatted articles between 2004 and 2008, before the UC Open Access Policy had been enacted and in violation of the publisher's agreement with the authors when they gave their copyrights to the ASCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ASCE Takedown Notices | website = Office of Scholarly Communication | publisher = University of California | url = http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2014/03/asce-takedown-notices/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== University of Colorado Boulder ====
In 2014 the Faculty Assembly of the University of Colorado Boulder approved the CU Boulder [http://scholar.colorado.edu/openaccess.html Open Access Policy] "in order to allow for broad dissemination of their research." They granted to The Regents of the University of Colorado "a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to their scholarly work, as long as the works are properly attributed to the authors and not used for commercial purposes"—and that the individual faculty would retain full ownership of the material. Authors at UC Boulder are expected to inform publishers about the University's policy and that they "have granted a pre-existing License."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CU Boulder Open Access Policy|url=http://scholar.colorado.edu/openaccess.html|website=CU Scholar Institutional Repository|publisher=University of Colorado Boulder|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital repository, [http://scholar.colorado.edu/ CU Scholar], is maintained by the University Libraries and functions under a [http://scholar.colorado.edu/policies.html set of policies] derived from the Open Access Policy. Contributions from the CU Boulder community can include working papers and technical reports, published scholarly research articles, completed manuscripts, digital art or multimedia, conference papers and proceedings, theses and dissertations, Undergraduate Honors theses, journals published on campus, faculty course-related output primarily of scholarly interest, and data sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policies|url=http://scholar.colorado.edu/policies.html|website=CU Scholar Institutional Repository|publisher=University of Colorado Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chancellor's Executive Committee recently approved the new policy, following the lead of the Council of Deans and the Office of the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolkan|first1=Joshua|title=CU Boulder Adopts Open Access|url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/05/18/cu-boulder-adopts-open-access.aspx|website=Campus Technology|publisher=1105 Media Inc. Ed-Tech Group|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== University of Kansas ====
In 2005 the University of Kansas (KU) created [https://web.archive.org/web/20051101213846/https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/ KU ScholarWorks], a digital repository for scholarly work created by KU faculty and staff. Faculty Senate President Lisa Wolf-Wendel, professor of education leadership and policy studies, approved a new policy, "[http://policy.ku.edu/governance/open-access-policy Open Access Policy for University of Kansas Scholarship]" on April 30, 2009, in order to provide the broadest possible access to the journal literature authored by KU faculty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Governance Policy: Open Access Policy for University of Kansas Scholarship | website = KU Policy Library | publisher = The University of Kansas |  accessdate = 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, under a faculty-initiated policy approved by Chancellor Robert Hemenway, KU became the first U.S. public university to implement an open access policy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite web | first = Rebecca | last = Smith | title = KU becomes first U.S. public university to pass an open access policy | website = KU News | publisher = The University of Kansas | url=http://archive.news.ku.edu/2009/june/26/openaccess.shtml | accessdate= 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless a KU author sought a waiver, all articles must be submitted to [https://web.archive.org/web/20051101213846/https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/ KU ScholarWorks]. "[http://openaccess.ku.edu/sites/openaccess.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/OA_implement_process_Fac_Senate_endorsed2-11-2010.pdf Processes to Implement the KU Open Access Policy]" were endorsed by the Faculty Senate in February 2010. Theses and dissertations at the University of Kansas are also openly available, however in 2010 KU Graduate Studies established a policy that a student may request permission to embargo its publication for six months, one year or two years. Graduates earning the KU Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing or PhD in English (Literature and Creative Writing track) may request a permanent embargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Graduate Studies Policy: Embargo Policy for Theses and Dissertations | website = KU Policy Library | publisher = The University of Kansas | url = http://policy.ku.edu/graduate-studies/embargo-policy | accessdate = 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/|title=Home - Higher Education Funding Council for England|last=England|first=Higher Education Funding Council for|website=www.hefce.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidized the JISC Academy Open Educational Resources Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jisc.ac.uk/|title=Jisc|website=Jisc|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. JISC refers to a membership organization that provides digital solutions for United Kingdom education and research initiatives. The JISC/HE OER Programme (Phase 3 from October 2011 – October 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/52748/|title=JISC/HE Academy OER Programme: Phase 3 Synthesis and Evaluation Report|last=L.|first=McGill,|last2=I.|first2=Falconer,|date=2013-02-01|website=oro.open.ac.uk|access-date=2018-06-27|last3=A.|first3=Littlejohn,|last4=H.|first4=Beetham,}}&lt;/ref&gt; was meant to build on sustainable procedure indicated in the first two phases eventually expanding in new directions that connect Open Educational Resources to other fields of work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cronin|first=Catherine|date=2017-08-15|title=Openness and Praxis: Exploring the Use of Open Educational Practices in Higher Education|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/3096|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|issn=1492-3831}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This third phase involved important stakeholders emphasizing fresh challenges and insights about the effect of OER and Open Educational Practice.

During this stage, the concept of electronic books and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) also emerged. MOOCs &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/distance-learning/moocs-(massive-open-online-courses)/|title=MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;offer courses at the University level without having to finish the whole programme. Many students get the chance to study premium courses online frequently at no cost. HEFCE made significant investments through the JISC and Academy from 2009 until 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openeducationalresources.pbworks.com/w/page/24838291/Open%20Educational%20Resources%20Programme|title=Open Educational Resources infoKit / Open Educational Resources Programme|website=openeducationalresources.pbworks.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The objective was to encourage sharing and reusing of resources which provide benefits to higher education in the United Kingdom. More than 80 projects obtained funding during the UK OER Programme. Substantial investments were channelled towards the development of Open Educational Resources even as the benefits for stakeholders have not been explained properly. Sufficient evidence is needed to prove this point. One criticism is that many such programmes are not technically and educationally accessible to a worldwide audience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jisc.ac.uk/full-guide/open-educational-resources|title=Open educational resources (OERs) {{!}} Jisc|website=Jisc|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Pandora's Tower'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Pandora's Tower: Until I Return to Your Side'''''|パンドラの塔 君のもとへ帰るまで|Pandora no Tō: Kimi no Moto e Kaeru Made}}&lt;!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --&gt;}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Ganbarion]] for the [[Wii]]. The game released in May 2011 in Japan, April 2012 in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories, and April 2013 in North America: while [[Marvelous USA|Xseed Games]] published the game in North America, Nintendo was the publisher in all other regions. Focusing on the efforts of protagonist Aeron to rid his love Elena of a curse that is turning her into a monster, the player explores thirteen towers, solving environmental puzzles and taking part in platforming while battling enemies&amp;mdash;a key part of gameplay is the Oraclos Chain, a weapon that aids in both combat and navigation. Depending on the strength of Aeron's relationship with Elena, multiple endings can be reached.

Development began in 2006 following the completion of ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'' as Ganbarion's first original title. The main concept was born from the desire to create a game scenario based around purification and love. Character numbers and plot twists were kept to a minimum to focus attention on Elena's plight. Due to recurring problems implementing the relationship mechanics and working with the Wii's controls, ''Pandora's Tower'' went through an extended development period. Despite releasing in Europe, Nintendo did not plan a North American release: prior to the announcement of Xseed Games picking up the title, a fan campaign called [[Operation Rainfall]] drew considerable attention to the title. Upon release, ''Pandora's Tower'' had modest commercial success and was met with mixed to positive reviews; praise went to the story and elements of combat, while the control scheme and graphics were faulted.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Pandora's Tower screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Main character Aeron solving a puzzle inside one of the Thirteen Towers.]]
''Pandora's Tower'' is an [[action role-playing game]] where players take the role of Aeron as he explores a fortress called the Thirteen Towers, suspended above a ravine known as the Scar, on a quest to cure his lover Elena of a curse.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m1.nintendo.net/docvc/RVL/EUR/SX3P/SX3P_R.pdf|title=Pandora's Tower European Manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=3 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117154538/http://m1.nintendo.net/docvc/RVL/EUR/SX3P/SX3P_R.pdf|archivedate=17 November 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay1"/&gt; Aeron can be controlled through both the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] or the [[Classic Controller]]. The base from which Aeron explores the Thirteen Towers is the Observatory, a building on the edge of the Scar. In the Observatory, Aeron can save his progress, and interact with Elena and the merchant Mavda.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; The main objective when inside the Thirteen Towers is the reach the Masters, powerful monsters housed at the top of each tower in a locked room which act as the game's bosses. These rooms must be accessed by solving puzzles throughout each Tower to unlock the door. On his way through the Towers, Aeron must fight numerous smaller enemies: he can perform a basic melee attack, and a charged attack which deals higher damage and will trigger additional attacks if the player times a button press with the appearance of a targeting ring around Aeron.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comv4u/pandoras_tower_gameplay_details/|title=Pandora's Tower Gameplay Details|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=3 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418235436/http://andriasang.com/comv4u/pandoras_tower_gameplay_details/|archivedate=18 April 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt;

Aeron's main weapon is the Oraclos Chain, an artifact that can be used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used to rip armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the longer it is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comvbh/pandoras_tower_weapons/|title=The Weapons of Pandora's Tower|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=28 April 2011|accessdate=3 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225044851/http://andriasang.com/comvbh/pandoras_tower_weapons/|archivedate=25 December 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puzzles within the Towers include activating levers and switches, manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within the Towers. The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can swing from one platform to another. Elements within the Towers, such as what enemies are active and what items may be found, vary with the time of day Aeron visits them.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;

While Aeron is within the Towers, a time counter is displayed, showing the advancement of Elena's curse. As Aeron defeats both normal enemies and the Masters of each Tower, he gathers flesh from them which he must give to Elena to eat and reverse the curse's effects, resetting the timer: the amount of reversion is dependent on the quality of flesh, which deteriorates over time after being extracted. Elena's state is also tied to the Affinity gauge; giving her flesh, talking with her, giving her gifts and asking her to help with tasks raise the meter, but delaying reverting Elena's transformation causes it to decrease.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; The strength of Aeron's relationship with Elena directly impacts the game's ending.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; Items and equipment are created and stored in the Observatory, with Mavda using materials brought back from the Towers to create new equipment for Aeron. She can also repair equipment that has been damaged in combat while equipped to Aeron, and upgrade existing weapons and equipment with new materials.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt; If the time limit is exceeded and Elena completes her transformation, or Aeron falls in battle, the game ends and restarts from the last active save.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay1"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting and characters===
''Pandora's Tower'' is set on the fictional continent of Imperia: once divided into ten kingdoms, the now-nomadic Vestra tribe were stripped of their kingdom. The dominant religion of Imperia is Aios, a polytheistic system worshiping nature as personified by twelve deities. Though once united through the ancient War of Unification which began the Unified Era, Imperia has seen recent conflicts as three kingdoms sought to break free from the powerful kingdom of Elyria.&lt;ref name="PandoraAndriaSetting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PandoraGuide"/&gt;

During the game's present, the war has ended but tensions are still high on both sides. The game's primary setting is the Okanos region at the Thirteen Towers, a giant fortress suspended above a giant chasm called the Scar, held in place by thirteen giant chains said to keep the Scar from growing. Initially built five centuries before, a disastrous magical experiment caused the Towers to be infested by monsters. Fifty years prior to the start of the game, a new experiment involving the monsters triggers the Scar's creation.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PandoraAndriaSetting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comut4/pandoras_tower_story/|title=Pandora's Tower Background Story|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054616/http://andriasang.com/comut4/pandoras_tower_story/|archivedate=4 March 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PandoraGuide"&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:パンドラの塔 君のもとへ帰るまで: 任天堂公式ガイドブック|trans-title=Pandora's Tower: Until I Return to Your Side: Nintendo Official Guidebook|publisher=[[Shogakukan]] |isbn=4-09-106485-X |language=Japanese |date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main protagonist is Aeron, a former soldier from the kingdom of Athos. Three years prior to the start of the game, a wounded Aeron was given shelter by Elena, an Elyrian. Despite their countries being at war, Elena nurses him and the two eventually became lovers. They are accompanied on their journey to the Thirteen Towers by Mavda, a woman of the Vestra tribe who is the current guardian of the Towers. Her tribe have the ability to manipulate the chains of fate, and gives Aeron the Oraclos Chain weapon to both aid him in his quest and maintain a connection with Elena.&lt;ref name="PandoraAndriaSetting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PandoraGuide"/&gt;

===Plot===
While singing at Elyria's Harvest Festival, Elena is struck by a curse that forces her to flee the Elyrian army with Aeron. They are led by Mavda to the Thirteen Towers, with Elena having been partially transformed into a monster by this point. Mavda reveals that the only way to lift the curse from Elena and prevent her transformation is to feed her the flesh of "Masters", powerful beings living inside the Towers. Given the Oraclos Chain, Aeron explores the Towers and kills each of its Masters, returning to give their flesh to Elena. Each time she eats Master Flesh, she receives visions detailing the events behind the Towers' creations. Five hundred years before, in an attempt to end the War of Unification, the people of Elyria and the Vestra decided to embody the twelve deities of Impedia in physical forms&amp;mdash;the Towers' Masters&amp;mdash;with a thirteenth vessel providing balance between them in a project dubbed Experiment Zero.&lt;ref name="QUOTEgame"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A husband and wife who had lost their son as a result of the war offered themselves as the raw material of the final Master, but the woman's unknown pregnancy caused an imbalance that transformed the Masters into monsters. The husband and baby were rescued using the Oraclos Chain, but the wife became Zeron, a dark monster consumed with a want to reunite with her descendant and bring 'peace' to the land. The Vestra sealed the Masters in the Towers and guarded them, while the wife's child eventually became Aeron's ancestor. The wife's jealous want of her descendants caused her to curse people who grew close to them, with Elena being the latest victim of the curse. The Vestra brought each afflicted person to the Towers in the hopes that the Masters would be destroyed and Experiment Zero ended: Mavda was the latest guardian of the Towers. Four hundred and fifty years later, the Elyrian Army recreated the Masters as living weapons: without the knowledge and help of the Vestra, the Elyrians instigated a drastic geological upheaval that created the Scar, which acted as a portal to the netherworld.&lt;ref name="QUOTEgame"/&gt;

====Endings====
Depending on the players actions and the strength of Aeron's relationship with Elena, the game has six possible endings.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;
*If the counter runs out and Elena is consumed by the curse, Aeron returns to find her transformed into a monster, and allows himself to be killed by her. Leading an army of monsters, Elena unites Elyria under her rule. This scene is a "Game Over" scenario.&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Game Over}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending D: Broken Chain''': Following the defeat of the Ninth Master, Elena attacks Aeron and then transforms, forcing him to kill her to put an end to her misery. In the epilogue, it is revealed that the Thirteen Towers' curse continued, and that Elena and Aeron were forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending D: Broken Chain}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending C: Still Together''': Returning after defeating the final two Masters, Aeron finds Elena in a monstrous form and is forced to fight her. They had then captured by the Elyrian army, who were led to them by Mavda. Mavda suggests using Elena's new powers, guided by her continued love for Aeron, to unite Impedia under Elyria's rule. The epilogue reveals that this did happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending C: Still Together}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending B: All For You''': After eating all the Master Flesh, Elena becomes Zeron's host, and Aeron fights her on top of the Thirteen Towers. Despite returning to human form, Elena says Zeron is still inside her, and to end Experiment Zero she commits suicide by throwing herself into the Scar as Mavda closes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending B: All For You}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending A: Together Forever''': Events play out as in Ending B, but Zeron explains that the Scar was created to stop Elyria from creating biological weapons. Despite Zeron's defeat, Elena is still cursed, and decides to end Experiment Zero. Aeron chooses to join her, and the two throw themselves into the Scar, using the chain to close it as they fall. The epilogue reveals that the land continued to be plagued by war, and that the Vestra passed down Aeron and Elena's tale as a legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending A: Together Forever}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending S: Unbreakable Bond''': Events proceed roughly as in Ending A, except that Elena is purged of the curse. Aeron must then destroy a monstrous Zeron, saving Elena one last time. The two then leave while Mavda uses the chain to destroy the Thirteen Towers, sacrificing herself to end their evils. In the epilogue, it is revealed that the kingdoms manage to end the War of Independence after the closing of the Scar, the Vestra are granted new lands to settle on by Elyria after Elyria's king receives a letter from Mavda detailing events at the Towers, and Aeron and Elena lived happily together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending S: Unbreakable Bond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The first stages of development began in late 2006 after the completion of ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]''. Up to that point, developer [[Ganbarion]] had only ever worked on licensed titles, and the team wanted to do something original. When Nintendo asked whether they wished to work on an original [[intellectual property]] due to being impressed by their work, Ganbarion accepted and pitched them the idea. The initial concept was how something pure had been corrupted and needed to be purified once again, with the main theme being love. The concept of the heroine needing to eat meat did not come until much later, when producer Chikako Yamakura was talking with another staff member about the then-prevalent fashion for [[ekiben]], boxed lunches served on trains, and the idea came to her "out of the blue". Only the basic elements of the story had been decided by then, and despite reservations by [[Nintendo]]'s then-CEO [[Satoru Iwata]], the project was greenlit as Iwata felt that they deserved the chance to work on a fresh project. The long development cycle was the result of continuous problems faced by the team which ran from the use of the Wii remote to mixed responses from testers on the mechanics surrounding Elena which necessitated some aspects surrounding the character to be scrapped and redone from scratch. This latter measure needed to be undertaken just a year before the game's release. Despite this, the final game came out relatively close to their initial vision.&lt;ref name="IwataInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Pandora-s-Tower-for-Wii/Iwata-Asks-Pandora-s-Tower-for-Wii/1-The-Jump-Super-Stars-Connection/1-The-Jump-Super-Stars-Connection-205394.html|title=Iwata Asks: Pandora's Tower for Wii|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo UK]]|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=15 January 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZzYOMzk8?url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Pandora-s-Tower-for-Wii/Iwata-Asks-Pandora-s-Tower-for-Wii/1-The-Jump-Super-Stars-Connection/1-The-Jump-Super-Stars-Connection-205394.html|archivedate=13 July 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's title went through multiple revisions during development, with Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami saying that he went through discussions with Yamakura about ten times and Yamakura stated that about five thousand titles had been suggested. The Japanese subtitle, "''Until I Return To Your Side''", was proposed and approved at a fairly early stage. The final title was only decided two months before the mastering process began.&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt; The Oraclos Chain was present in early concepts as a means of contrasting with Elena's feminine image, and was born as a gameplay device from discussions on how to best create an action-based experience with limited controls.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt; Alongside this, the team wanted to make the game suitable for gamers not comfortable with action games, so upgrades and equipment repair were added. The boss battles were designed to make players pull on all their available resources, creating puzzles that would leave players satisfied upon completion.&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"/&gt; No original music was created for the game, with it instead using samples from western classical music that fitted the concept. While original music was considered, it was dropped as staff felt it would be "too powerful" for an overseas audience.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;

According to director Toru Haga, creating an original world and scenario after their time working on licensed properties was challenging.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/37186/pandoras-tower-interview-we-want-players-to-feel-elenas-suffering/|title=Pandora's Tower interview - we want players to feel Elena's suffering|last=East|first=Thomas|publisher=''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=15 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103111348/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/37186/pandoras-tower-interview-we-want-players-to-feel-elenas-suffering/|archivedate=2014-11-03|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the Laws, the deities of Impedia, was based on the [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophical]] concept of "[[Yin and yang|yin yang]] [[Wu Xing|wu xing]]": each "Law" was an aspect or element of the world, which balanced against each other and had two opposing counterparts representing each element. If one part vanished, the balance would be disrupted and the natural would be adversely effected, as portrayed in the game.&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/04/16/interview-why-pandoras-tower-has-a-creepy-merchant-lady-and-more/|title=Interview: Why Pandora's Tower Has A Creepy Merchant Lady And More|last=Sahdev|first=Ishaan|publisher=Siliconera|date=16 April 2013|accessdate=15 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912062217/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/04/16/interview-why-pandoras-tower-has-a-creepy-merchant-lady-and-more/|archivedate=12 September 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts influenced the design of the Towers: the first three were designed around [[Wood (Wu Xing)|wood]], [[Earth (Wu Xing)|earth]] and [[Water (Wu Xing)|water]], then later towers representing [[Metal (Wu Xing)|metal]] and [[Fire (Wu Xing)|fire]]. Each tower was divided into "male" (yang) and "female" (yin) halves.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; This concept was applied so as to keep the Towers from being repetitive for players, using different shades and designs while retaining their shared symbolic color.&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"/&gt; The law against eating meat present in the world was inspired by a social phenomenon noted by Yamakura where men and women approached each other counter to popular views on gender relationships, translated as "carnivorous girls and herbivorous boys": this concept gave birth to the scenes of Elena having trouble eating the flesh offerings.&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt;

According to Haga, the story's main theme was saving Elena from the curse and then returning to a normal life.&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"/&gt; The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was kept to a minimum so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman who did not want to be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt; Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"/&gt;

''Pandora's Tower'' was first announced in January 2011 during Nintendo's three-quarterly financial report, which was followed shortly by the opening of the official website.

A North American release for ''Pandora's Tower'' was unconfirmed, with Nintendo giving no comment on the matter.

On aggregate site [[Metacritic]], ''Pandora's Tower'' received a score of 73/100 based on 48 critic reviews, denoting "mixed or average" reception.&lt;ref name="PTmeta"/&gt; [[Destructoid]]'s Tony Ponce praised the game's premise and how fleshed out Elena was despite her role as a damsel in distress, but felt that there was too much background lore, and that Aeron's lack of personality hurt the relationship aspect.&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt; Andrew Fitch, writing for ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', praised the world design, but faulted the lack of character development given to Aeron and Elena.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Matt Edwards referred to the game's plot as "a soppy and yet surprisingly sinister love story", saying that moments between the couple raised a genuine smile.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; [[IGN]]'s Chris Schilling said that while the story was "slight", it was bolstered by a good localization and voice acting, in addition to darker elements in the plot and during cutscenes.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Ashton Raze praised Aeron and Elena's romance as "a grounded, human [story] in a world of monsters".&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Heidi Kemps, writing for [[Joystiq]], noted genuine emotion in the relationship mechanics of Aeron and Elema,&lt;ref name="JoyReview"/&gt; while Steve Hogarty of ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' referred to the scenario as "a boy-meets-girl love story with a [[Clive Barker]] twist" in addition to praising its dark tone.&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt; The game's time limit mechanic and its impact on Elena's condition divided opinion: some praised its implementation,&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt; but some critics noted that it might put too much pressure on the player.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JoyReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt;

Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' praised the gameplay for being both fun and accessible for those not used to action games, with further praise going to the control scheme.&lt;ref name="FamiReview"/&gt; ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', reviewing the Japanese version, praised the combat's versatility despite some faults, but found the puzzle elements tedious and criticized the camera.&lt;ref name="CVGreview"/&gt; The gameplay was generally praised by Ponce despite some repeating puzzles and enjoyed both the extensive post-game content and level of challenge.&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt; In contrast, Fitch found combat repetitive, criticized the fact that enemies respawned after leaving each area, and found elements from the dungeon design to the relationship mechanics poorly implemented when compared to other similar Japanese titles. Despite this, he did enjoy the variety of dungeon designs and the mechanics employed in boss battles.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt; Edwards praised the overall gameplay mechanics, particularly noting the chain's gameplay options and the game's difficulty curve, although he noted that the normal melee combat lacked sophistication when compared to other titles available at the time.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; Schilling felt that the Oraclos Chain mechanics helped keep the combat interesting in addition to challenging boss battles, but found standard combat repetitive.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Raze echoed many of these sentiments, but found that repetitive enemy design and an awkward camera hampered the experience.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Kemps found normal weapon combat boring when compared to the Chain, and felt that each available control scheme had advantages and drawbacks related to them.&lt;ref name="JoyReview"/&gt; Hogarty enjoyed the boss battles, but found overall combat repetitive and faulted both the controls and the fixed camera.&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt;

The music was praised by ''Famitsu'', but one reviewer that it would be "nice if the graphics were better".&lt;ref name="FamiReview"/&gt; ''Computer and Video Games'' praised the voice acting and music, but noted frequent drops in framerate.&lt;ref name="CVGreview"/&gt; Ponce panned the English voice work, saying that it added to the unlikeliness of Aeron and Elena's relationship in addition to poor lip-syncing, and called the textures "very ugly" despite a large color spectrum.&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt; Edwards also noted the variety of colors and dungeon design found in the Towers, but noted that the game's pace left little time to admire them.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; Schilling felt that the art design was hampered by technical limitations and praised the choral musical elements,&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; while Raze praised both the character designs and soundtrack.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Kemps called the character and environment design "superb" despite technical limitations,&lt;ref name="JoyReview"/&gt; and Hogarty praised the boss monsters' designs and scenic variety.&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt;

'''Paper clothing''', in the form of women's [[dress]]es and other clothes made from disposable [[cellulose]] fabric, was a short-lived [[fashion]] [[novelty item]] in the United States in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Paton 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paton|first=Kathleen |title=Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion|year=2005|volume=3|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|isbn=0-684-31394-4|pages=15–16|editor=Steele, Valerie|chapter=Paper dresses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual [[paper]] and [[papier-mâché]] clothes and accessories (especially [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] costumes) were used as early as the 19th century. The American [[Scott Paper Company]] developed mass-produced paper fashion in 1966 as a marketing stunt. Customers could send a coupon and $1.25 to receive a dress made of "Dura-Weve", a cellulose material patented in 1958.&lt;ref name="Paton 2005" /&gt;

These "Paper Caper" dresses, which featured a red [[bandanna]] print or a black and white [[op art]] pattern, kicked off a fashion craze. 500,000 of them were produced, and other manufacturers soon followed suit. By 1967, paper dresses sold in major department stores for about $8 ($61 in 2018&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=15.00&amp;year1=196701&amp;year2=201807|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|website=data.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;) apiece, and entire paper clothing boutiques were set up by companies such as [[Abraham &amp; Straus]] and [[I. Magnin]]. At the height of demand, [[Mars Hosiery]] made 100,000 dresses a week.&lt;ref name="Paton 2005" /&gt; Other items made of paper included underwear, men's vests, bridal gowns (expensive at $15, or $114 in 2018&lt;ref name="bls.gov"/&gt;), children's [[pinafore]]s ("just the thing for ever-sprouting sprouts") and even rain coats and bikinis ("good for two to three wearings").&lt;ref name="TIME 1967"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fashion: Real Live Paper Dolls|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836820,00.html|accessdate=5 September 2010|newspaper=[[Time Magazine]]|date=March 17, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the novel materials used for such clothes were "[[Kaycel]]" by [[Kimberly-Stevens]] (93% cellulose and 7% [[nylon]], "fire resistant unless washed"), "[[Ree-may]]" by [[Du Pont]] (a "[[spunbonded]]" [[polyester]]) and "[[Webril]]" by [[Kendall &amp; Sons Ltd|Kendall]] (a nonwoven [[rayon]]).&lt;ref name="TIME 1967" /&gt;

The paper dress captured the vibrant, youthful, optimistic and [[consumerist]] ''[[zeitgeist]]'' of 1960s America so precisely the fashion press speculated about paper garments taking over the entire clothes market. The dresses were whimsical, often featured eye-catching [[pop art]]-like patterns, shapes for the customer to color, or advertisements (such as the "[[Souper Dress]]" featuring [[Andy Warhol]]'s "[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]"). They were just one of many newly disposable items – like cutlery, plates, pens, lighters, and razors – consumers were embracing; the "Paper Caper" sales pitch ran: "Won't last forever…who cares? Wear it for kicks—then give it the air." &lt;ref name="Paton 2005" /&gt;

As the novelty appeal of paper clothes wore off, their downsides became more apparent: they were generally ill-fitting and uncomfortable, their garish colors could rub off, they were often [[flammable]], and eventually ended as waste. By 1968, paper clothing had disappeared from the market.&lt;ref name="Paton 2005" /&gt;

While no longer encountered in mass-market fashion, the same cellulose fabrics are still employed to make disposable garments for work environments, such as [[hospital gown]]s, [[scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]], and [[coverall]]s. The paper dresses of the 1960s also still inspire contemporary fashion designers, including [[Yeohlee]] and [[Vivienne Tam]], who have on occasion incorporated paper into their designs.&lt;ref name="Paton 2005" /&gt;

'''Phobos''' is the name of two fictional comic book characters appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]] characters. The first appeared in ''[[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]], Sorcerer Supreme'' #32 (August 1991) in a story written by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jean-Marc Lofficier]].

The second and current Phobos first appeared in the 2006 ''Ares: God of War'' mini-series (written by [[Michael Avon Oeming]]; art by [[Travel Foreman]]). He is the son of [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], step-brother to [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]], and a member of the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]].

Due to the nature of gods in the [[Marvel Universe]], in addition to the [[retcon]] surrounding the current Phobos ([[#Fictional character biography|see below]]) the relationship between the two has not been explicitly explained.

==Original==

===Publication history===
The original Phobos first appeared in the "A Gathering of Fear" storyline in ''[[Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Doctor Strange'' (vol. 3), started off as ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'', renamed ''D. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' in issue #4&lt;/ref&gt; #32 (August 1991) written by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jean-Marc Lofficier]]. He reappeared in "The Great Fear" storyline in DS:SS #39 (March 1992).

===Fictional biography===
Phobos and his brother [[Deimos (Marvel Comics)|Deimos]] are sons of [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] and [[Nox (Marvel Comics)|Nox]] (posing as [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]]) but were killed by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] in their first appearance.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #32 (August 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Later the [[Fear Lords]] release so much fear that Nox is able to bring her sons back, creating them from the [[Darkforce]] but they were eventually defeated again.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #39 (March 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Phobos meets his final fate when [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] assaults Olympus and kills him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Ares: God of War'' #3 (March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alexander==

===Publication history===
The current Phobos, Alexander, first appeared in the ''[[Ares (comic book)|Ares]]'' limited series in 2006 written by [[Michael Avon Oeming]]. Here, he is manipulated by [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] into becoming a warrior until his father, Ares, saves him many years later, a young adult with god-like powers.&lt;ref name="Ares 2006"/&gt; This ending is ignored for future storyline purposes.

The character returns, [[retcon]]ned by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and reduced to a ten-year-old boy with no specialized training in ''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' #1, then reappears in the [[Secret Invasion]] crossover, in ''Mighty Avengers'' and the ''Secret Invasion'' limited series. Once [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] started, he began appearing regularly in ''Secret Warriors''.

===Fictional character biography===
The current Phobos is a young boy named Alexander Aaron.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''Ares: God of War'' #1 (March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2006 ''Ares: God or War'' mini-series, Alexander is taken from his father, Ares, by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]], and then kidnapped by the Japanese god [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]]. Mikaboshi, in an attempt to destroy the Marvel pantheons, trains and manipulates Alex for at least five Olympian years - which vary substantially from human years in that years can pass to the gods while simultaneously only a few days or months passing for humans - under the guise of a mother-figure who eventually turns him into a deadly swordsman. He is saved from the evil deity when the combination of Zeus and Ares's influences broke his brainwashing. Their salvation apparently eliminates his skills.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Brian Michael Bendis then ret-conned these events in ''Mighty Avengers''. When Alex / Phobos is first approached by fellow Secret Warrior Daisy, he is once again a young boy, untrained, and aware that his father is the god Ares (''Mighty Avengers #13''). (The general story of Mikaboshi destroying the Marvel pantheons and Zeus' sacrifice remains canon however).&lt;ref name="Incredible Hercules #117"&gt;''Incredible Hercules'' #117&lt;/ref&gt; It's at this point that Daisy reveals to Alex that he is Phobos.&lt;ref name="ma13"/&gt; After this, he begins to gain fear like powers, having inherited the original's abilities. However, in Mighty Avengers #13 he scared off a couple of boys, and after that he lied to Daisy that he doesn't have any powers, but she doesn't believe him. After talk with her he says 'that explains so much' because he realises then that he's new Phobos, and was born mortal, but after drinking Mikaboshi's blood he became god and now he has fear powers and Daisy told him who he really is (new god of fear). In that issue Ares tells him that he's an Avenger right now and he cannot worry about his grades.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

During the Secret Invasion storyline, Alex is recruited by [[Nick Fury]] for his team of [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]].&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion''&lt;/ref&gt; Post-invasion, he remains a member of the team and has shown evidence of additional pre-cognitive powers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, his father has noticed his absence upon receiving a truancy notice.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]], Ares followed Alex and Daisy to one of Fury's base, where he discovers his son's affiliation with the former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director. Fury tells Ares that his son has potential. Ares ultimately accepts his son's decision, meaning that he doesn't need to hide his allegiance anymore.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; Phobos later pilots a Fury [[Life Model Decoy]] to assist [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] but they are captured by the Thunderbolts. As soon as [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] shoots the LMD in the head, Phobos reveals himself, inflicting Osborn with the fear that he will lose his mind soon enough.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Warriors'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Siege (comics)|Siege]], Phobos tried to tag along with the other secret warriors to help the [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]], but Nick Fury wouldn't let him, because he knew his father would die and he didn't want him to witness it. When the fiasco was over, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] confronted Phobos telling him that Ares was dead and he offered to take him to see his next of kin in Mount Olympus. However, he declined his offer. Thor offered that if he ever changed his mind, he would take him there. Although he had mixed feelings with his dad, he still felt sad that he died.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Phobos is now in Elysium after having been stabbed and killed by [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]] wielding the sword Godkiller. His last appearance had his father proud of his actions as they were reunited in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Warriors'' #22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Both versions of Phobos control the power of fear, a power that has been seen to cause victims to run for their lives as well as attack their partners. Certain characters have proven immune to this ability (i.e. Nick Fury, Gorgon) - citing they lack fear as the reason.&lt;ref name="Secret Warriors 2009"&gt;''[[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]]'' #3 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The current version of Phobos (Alex) was at one time a highly trained swordsman and possessed strength and endurance similar to other Olympian gods in the Marvel universe,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; however this has since been ret-conned.&lt;ref name="ma13"/&gt; ''Secret Warriors'' #10 re-establishes his training with a sword. He was denied use of it by his father Ares, who required him to be proficient in all forms of arms before returning his sword.

Currently he, like the previous Phobos, can instill fear in others. Additionally, he has shown evidence of pre-cognitive powers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

When utilizing his fear based powers, Alex's eyes glow. The color has shown to vary between white and red. Whether this is simply due to the artist's rendering or the level of power usage is unknown.&lt;ref name="Secret Warriors 2009"/&gt;

==Relationship between the two characters==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2011}} 
Currently, it is unclear whether the original Phobos and the current Alex are actually two separate characters. Examining their respective first appearances it would appear that they are, as both have distinct personalities and ability sets. In fact, their father Ares even explicitly states that both are separate individuals within the 2006 ''Ares: God of War'' mini-series.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

However, this mini-series takes place before Brian Michael Bendis [[retcon]]ned the origin and abilities of Alex. Within the mini-series Alex had grown well into his late teens, had acquired a mastery of almost all forms of weaponry, and was well aware of his divine heritage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, when Alex next appears in ''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' #13 he is barely 10, has no combat experience, and is aware that his father is the god Ares. It is also in ''Mighty Avengers'' #13 that Alex is first identified as Ares' son Phobos, and displays abilities similar to the original version of the character.&lt;ref name=ma13&gt;''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' #13 (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it would appear that Bendis retconned the events of the mini-series and that Alex and Phobos are potentially the same character.

Adding to the confusion, based on the events in ''The Incredible Hercules'' #117 it seems that parts of the ''Ares: God of War'' mini-series are, in fact, still considered canon. Namely, Mikaboshi's plot and attempt to destroy the divine pantheons in the Marvel Universe. Since Alex's capture and development were central to Mikaboshi's plan, yet also directly contradict his later appearances in ''Mighty Avengers'' and ''Secret Warriors'', the current status of both characters remains unclear.&lt;ref name="Incredible Hercules #117"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ma13 /&gt;

According to the ''Thor &amp; Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica'', the original Phobos and the current Alex are two separate characters.  More specifically, they are half-brothers.  The Phobos profile indicates that the original Phobos (and his brother Deimos) were killed during Mikaboshi's invasion of Olympus, and that Alexander inherited the fear-based powers of his slain older half-brother following his return to Earth.&lt;ref name="encyclopaediamythologica"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]], [[Greg Pak]], [[Fred Van Lente]] &amp; [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller =  Kevin Sharpe | Inker = Kevin Sharpe | Story =  | Title = Thor &amp; Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica| Issue = 1 | Date = July 2009| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Reign: New Nation #1'' states the ''Ares: God of War'' limited series as the first appearance of Alex. However, this does not indicate if he is meant to be related to the previous Phobos, such as in a re-imagining or reincarnation.

[[Image:Encounter73.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Encounter'', watercolor, 44X56cm, 1973]]
'''''Place des Martyres''''' is the title of a series of over 250 [[watercolor]]s and [[drawing]]s executed in [[New York city|New York]] and [[Beirut]] between 1971 and 1974 by [[Nabil Kanso]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nabil Kanso: Place des Maryres: Works on Paper'', 76th Street Gallery, Catalog, New York, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects of the works in the series are based on the women headquartered in the red-light district of [[Beirut]] city center called el Bourj, and after [[World War I]]&lt;ref&gt;Prior to WWI, el Bourj was called Place des Canons in reference to the Cannons placed by Russian in 1773 and France in 1860, Hanssen, Jens: ''Fin de siecle Beirut: The Making of an Ottoman Provincial Capital'', p. 255, Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; named [[Place des Martyrs, Beirut|Place des Martyrs]] French for [[Martyr]]s’ Place&lt;ref&gt;Pre-civil war el Bourj was rectangular shaped area measuring about 300 meters long and 150 meters wide, Baedeker, Karl, ''Palestine and Syrian: With the Chief Routes Routes Through Mesopotania and Babylonis'', p. 279, Harvard University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in memory of dozens of [[Arab]] [[nationalism|nationalists]] who were [[hanging|hanged]] in 1915-16 during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghassan Tueni|Tueni, Ghassan]], and Sassine, Fares, ed.: ''el Bourj'', pp.216-217, Editions Dar An-Nahar, Beirut, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Watercolors==
The watercolors in the ''Place des Martyres'' series consists of approximately 170 works in 3 sizes of 44X56cm, 35X51cm, and 31X41cm. They are characterized by transparent deep colors of red, orange, yellow, blue, and black embodying figurative imagery representing both real and imaginary scenes of the gaudy life in the city center district adjoining Place des Martyrs. Painted in the atmosphere of [[Lebanese Civil War|pre-civil war]] Beirut, the compositions depict [[Human sexuality|sexualized]] encounters and interactions of figures in various sensual situations and entertainment settings. They make references to works of such artists as  [[Degas]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Rouault]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]],&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Gordon, "Kanso", Arts Magazine, June, 1972 and February, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Laurencin|Laurencin]] and [[Pascin]] whose “Sensual spirit seems to inspire the aquarelles and inhabit Kanso’s figures, which in a semi-erotic round, covet, touch, caress, move, and seem to emerge from a pagan fresco where time is consecrated to dance, perfume, and moments propitious to dialogue, exchange, comparison, and fleeting occasions.”&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Evremond, "Kanso", 76th Street gallery, France-Amerique, January 13, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that the depicted figures “assume the poses of interpretive dance without being self-conscious.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Gordon, "Kanso at 76th Street gallery", Arts Magazine, February, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the images contain poetic and [[bawdy|bowdlerized]] words reflecting [[irony|ironic]] and [[humor]]ous tones with allusion to Beirut sexual market place and its social life and culture. They show scenes of figures in the street, at the café, bar, salon, or intimate setting, and engaged in conversation, flirtation, relaxation, or transaction for the pleasure of the [[senses]]. The figures reflect a blend of “expressive faces, beseeching, flirtatious, charming, sleepy, talkative, reluctant, and pensive.”&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Brown: "Kanso", Arts Magazine, February, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawings==
The 80 drawings in the series seem to exist alongside the watercolors with shared expressions, subjects and thematic qualities. They fall in sizes of 45X40cm, 45X30cm,  35X27cm, and divide themselves in two parts in which around 50 are done in pen and ink with broad cross-hatched black lines contrasting the light and dark areas, and around 30 sketch line drawings and wash embodying humorous writings. Some of the imagery portray “lovers and nudes using heavy brush and ink technique,”&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Schwartz (artist)|Schwartz, Barbara]]: "Kanso at 76th Street", ''Art News'', April, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and rendered in “sympathetic Germanic style.”&lt;ref&gt;Bowles, Jerry: "Kanso", ''Art News'', July, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Same-sex marriage]]''' has been legal in the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] since 3 June 2014. An ordinance to legalise such marriages was approved by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] on 28 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1108/pdfs/uksi_20141108_en.pdf|title=Overseas Marriage (Armed Forces) Order 2014|date=28 April 2014|work=Legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All residents of the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] are either members of the [[British Armed Forces|British]] or [[United States Armed Forces|American]] armed forces or associated contractors assigned to the [[Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia]]. American soldiers are permitted to marry; however, [[United States Navy]] regulations prohibit any married couple from being stationed together on [[Diego Garcia]], whether in a military or civilian capacity. Therefore, one member of the couple would be immediately reassigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/milpersman/1000/1300Assignment/Documents/1300-314.pdf|title=MILPERSMAN 1300-314|date=3 August 2014|work=public.navy.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synthetic Virology''' is the scientific discipline engaged in the study and engineering of synthetic, man-made [[Virus#Synthetic Viruses|Viruses]].

It is a multidisciplinary research field, at the crossroad of [[Virology]], [[Synthetic Biology]], [[Computational Biology]], and [[DNA Nanotechnology]] from which it borrows and integrates its concepts and methodologies. There are a wide range of applications for synthetic viral technology such as medical treatments, investigative tools, and reviving organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cello|first=Jeronimo|last2=Paul|first2=Aniko V.|last3=Wimmer|first3=Eckard|date=2002-08-09|title=Chemical Synthesis of Poliovirus cDNA: Generation of Infectious Virus in the Absence of Natural Template|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/297/5583/1016|journal=Science|language=en|volume=297|issue=5583|pages=1016–1018|doi=10.1126/science.1072266|issn=0036-8075|pmid=12114528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructing ''de novo'' Synthetic Viruses==

Advancements in genome sequencing technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heather|first=James M.|last2=Chain|first2=Benjamin|date=2016-01|title=The sequence of sequencers: The history of sequencing DNA|journal=Genomics|volume=107|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2015.11.003|issn=0888-7543|pmc=4727787|pmid=26554401}}&lt;/ref&gt; and oligonucleotide synthesis paved the way for construction of synthetic genomes based on previously sequenced genomes. Both RNA or DNA viruses can be made using existing methods. RNA viruses have historically been utilized due to the typically small genome size and existing reverse transcription machinery present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Stauft|first=Charles B|title=Synthetic Viruses|date=2018-02-16|work=eLS|pages=1–7|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0027771|isbn=9780470015902|last2=Wimmer|first2=Eckard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first man-made infectious viruses generated without any natural template were of the Polio virus and the φX174 bacteriophage. With synthetic live viruses, it is not the whole viruses that are synthesized, but rather their genome at first, both in the case of DNA and RNA viruses. For many viruses, viral RNA is infectious when introduced into a cell (during infection or after reverse transcription.) These organisms are able to sustain an infectious life cycle upon introduction ''in vivo''.

==Applications for Synthetic Viruses==

This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimmer|first=Eckard|last2=Mueller|first2=Steffen|last3=Tumpey|first3=Terrence M|last4=Taubenberger|first4=Jeffery K|date=2009-12|title=Synthetic viruses: a new opportunity to understand and prevent viral disease|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819212/|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=27|issue=12|pages=1163–72|doi=10.1038/nbt.1593|issn=1087-0156|pmc=2819212|pmid=20010599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to synthesize viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. As of March 2014, the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.

Synthetic viruses have been researched as potential gene therapy tools as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guenther|first=Caitlin M.|last2=Kuypers|first2=Brianna E.|last3=Lam|first3=Michael T.|last4=Robinson|first4=Tawana M.|last5=Zhao|first5=Julia|last6=Suh|first6=Junghae|date=2014-11|title=Synthetic Virology: Engineering Viruses for Gene Delivery|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4227300/|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology|volume=6|issue=6|pages=548–558|doi=10.1002/wnan.1287|issn=1939-5116|pmc=4227300|pmid=25195922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Burman: His Life and Notions''''' (1882) is a book about the peoples and customs of Burma (now [[Myanmar]]). First published under the pseudonym [[Shway Yoe]], the book was written by the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] journalist and [[British Overseas Territories|British Colonial]] administrator [[James George Scott]]. The book caused a sensation when it was first published because it was considered impossible that a Burman could write so well in English - Shway Yoe's unbiased tone and positive curiosity is also one reason that the author was presumed Burmese by the British.

The book is most noteworthy in the fact that the author made an extremely detailed and unparallelled description of the Burmese people and their culture, from their [[Pagoda festival|pagoda festivals]] to their lacquer, traditions, religion, dressing, food, and almost any category related.

'''''The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations''''' is a 2006 book by [[Ori Brafman]] (author of the 2010 book ''Click: The Magic of Instant Connections'' {{ISBN|978-0-385-52905-1}}) and [[Rod Beckstrom]] is an exploration of the implications of the recent rise of [[decentralized]] organizations such as [[Grokster]] and [[YouTube]]. The book contrasts them to centralized organizations, such as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', using compendia of knowledge as examples. The [[spider]] and [[starfish]] [[analogy]] refers to the contrasting biological nature of the respective organisms, starfish having a decentralized neural structure permitting [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]].

In addition to giving historical examples of decentralized organizations such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and the [[Apache]]s and analyzing their nature in contrast to centralized organizations, the book considers conflict between centralized and decentralized organizations, including the "If you can't beat them, join them" solution of creating hybrid organizations such as [[Citizendium]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} A chapter towards the end of the book explores the concept of the "sweet spot", the optimal mix of decentralized and centralized attributes.

==Summary==
&lt;!-- ch 1 --&gt;
[[Donald B. Verrilli Jr.|Don Verelli]] was an attorney who championed the effort for [[MGM]] to crack down on the [[peer-to-peer]] music website [[Grokster]]. But although the record labels won the lawsuits, other groups such as [[Kazaa]], and [[eMule]] surfaced. The authors compare the record companies to "spiders" &amp;ndash; organizations under the control of a central brain or leader &amp;ndash; while the smaller organizations are more like "starfish" &amp;ndash; if a limb is severed, the remaining parts are able to regenerate the entire body, resulting in two or more starfish. The spider organization is compared to the [[Aztec Empire]] which fell when [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] was defeated by [[Hernán Cortés]] and his Spanish army, but the starfish organization is compared to the [[Apache indians|Apaches]], who decentralized and became nomadic, and of which the Spanish army could not defeat.

&lt;!-- ch 2 and 3  --&gt;
Dave Garrison of [[Netcom (United States)|Netcom]] attempts to explain the Internet to executives in Paris, but is met with questions such as who would run the Internet. The authors look into the starfish [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], which survives and thrives even away from the founder. They also look into the history of the music industry since the 19th century from live performers to recording on small labels to ownership from the big five record companies to [[Napster]] and P2P. They list questions that determine whether an organization is more like a spider or a starfish. The authors discuss some founders of starfish organizations: [[Niklas Zennstrom]] and [[Skype]]; [[Craig Newmark]] and [[Craigslist]]. They discuss the formation of the [[Apache Software Foundation|Apache software model]] and how editors work on [[Wikipedia]] articles. They then discuss the starfish self-organization of participants in the [[Burning Man]] festival.

&lt;!-- ch. 4, 5 --&gt;
American lawyer [[Granville Sharp]]'s decision to defend the freedom of a slave named Jonathan Strong leads him to connect with the [[Quakers]] and to advocate for the abolition of the slave trade. The authors use Sharp's story to illustrate five foundational principles called the Five Legs: 1) Circles; 2) The Catalyst; 3) [[Ideology]]; 4) The Preexisting Network; 5) The Champion. They apply the Five Legs to the story of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] who served as the catalyst to the [[women's rights movement]] with [[Susan B. Anthony]] as the champion. They then focus on some examples of catalysts: [[Jimmy Wales]] of Wikipedia; Deborah Alvarez-Rodriguez, who worked for the city of San Francisco and later Goodwill; entrepreneur [[Auren Hoffman]] and Josh Sage. They list a set of catalyst's tools including: Genuine Interest in Others, Loose Connections, Mapping, Desire to Help, Meet People Where They Are, [[Emotional Intelligence]], Trust, Inspiration, Tolerance for Ambiguity, Hands-Off Approach and Receding. They contrast the work of a catalyst with that of a CEO.

&lt;!-- ch. 6 - 8 --&gt;
Using the [[Animal Liberation Front]] as an example of a decentralized group similar to [[Al-Qaeda]], the authors suggest three strategies of dealing with decentralized groups: Changing Ideology (or introducing better competing ideologies), Centralizing Them (Cow Principle, what defeated the Apaches), and Decentralizing Yourself (If you can't beat 'em, join 'em) The authors suggest organization uses a hybrid model that blends both centralized and decentralized concepts, such as with [[eBay]]. They also cite other instances of hybrids such as [[Amazon.com]] letting volunteer reviewers contribute and [[Intuit]] having a TaxAlmanac website for people to help each other. The authors discuss [[Peter Drucker]]'s assessment of [[General Motors]]'s management process, how it led to [[Toyota]] taking over the auto industry, and how they later collaborated on the [[NUMMI]] plant. Similarly the [[iTunes]] model of pricing single songs has been a "sweet spot" for Apple and their [[online music store]], and other companies are moving to an [[open-source model]] with their software.

&lt;!-- Ch. 9 --&gt;
The authors use a series of analogies throughout their book, summarizing their thoughts with Ten Rules: [[Diseconomies of scale]], The network effect, The power of chaos, Knowledge at the edge, Everyone wants to contribute, Beware the [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra response]], Catalysts rule, The values are the organization, Measure Monitor and Manage, and Flatten of be flattened.
&lt;!-- 
==Concepts==
===Catalysts===
The book identifies a set of people the authors call "catalysts", who tend to be skilled at creating decentralized organizations. The authors list several abilities and behaviors (called "The Catalyst's Tools") that "catalysts" have in common, including:
# Genuine interest in others.
# Numerous loose connections, rather than a small number of close connections.
# Skill at social mapping.
# Desire to help everyone they meet.
# The ability to help people help themselves by listening and understanding, rather than giving advice ("Meet people where they are").
# [[Emotional intelligence]].
# Trust in others and in the decentralized network.
# Inspiration (to others).
# Tolerance for ambiguity.
# A hands-off approach. Catalysts do not interfere with, or try to control the behavior of the contributing members of the decentralized organization.
# Ability to let go. After building up a decentralized organization, catalysts move on, rather than trying to take control.
 
This book has some similarities to books like ''[[The Tipping Point (book)|The Tipping Point]]'', by [[Malcolm Gladwell]], as both identify certain sets of people who are important to change in a society or an organization, and try to define the attributes that people belonging to these sets have in common.  The theoretical base draws richly from complexity writers in management, such as Ralph Stacey, [[Margaret Wheatley]], [[Dee Hock]], Doug Griffin, Patricia Shaw, John Holland, and [[Robert Axelrod]], among others.  The book provides an original and accessible way to see these principles in action.

"A leader is best when people barely know that he exists; not so good when people obey and acclaim him; worst when they despise him." (p115) (Lao-tzu)

"As a catalyst, it's all about letting go and trusting the community." (p111)

=== The Major Principles of Decentralization ===
# When attacked, a decentralized organization tends to become even more open and decentralized (p21)
# It's easy to mistake starfish for spiders (p36)
# An open system doesn't have central intelligence; the intelligence is spread throughout the system (p39)
# Open systems can easily mutate (p40)
# The decentralized organization sneaks up on you (p41)
# As industries become decentralized, overall profits decrease (p45)
# Put people into an open system and they’ll automatically want to contribute (p74)
# When attacked, centralized organizations tend to become even more centralized (p139)

=== Decentralized Networks ===

'''''Totentanz''''' ({{lang-en|Dance of the Dead}}): '''Paraphrase on ''Dies irae''''', or ''Danse macabre'' [[List of compositions by Franz Liszt (S.1 - S.350)|S.126]], is the name of a [[symphonic]] piece for solo [[piano]] and [[orchestra]] by [[Franz Liszt]], which is notable for being based on the [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] [[plainchant]] melody ''[[Dies Irae]]'' as well as for daring stylistic innovations. The piece was originally planned in 1838 and completed in 1849; it was then revised twice, however, in 1853 and 1859.

== Obsession with death ==
Some of the titles of Liszt’s pieces, such as ''Totentanz'', ''[[Funérailles]]'', ''[[La lugubre gondola]]'' and ''[[Harmonies poétiques et religieuses|Pensée des morts]]'', show the composer's [[fascination with death]]. In the young Liszt we can already observe manifestations of his obsession with death, with religion, and with heaven and hell. According to [[Alan Walker (musicologist)|Alan Walker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Walker | first=Alan | authorlink=Alan Walker (musicologist)| title=Franz Liszt: The Virtuoso Years 1811-1847 | publisher=Faber and Faber | date=1983 | page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liszt frequented Parisian "hospitals, gambling casinos and asylums" in the early 1830s, and he even went down into prison dungeons in order to see those condemned to die.

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Dance of Death (CCLXIIIIv).jpg|thumb|''[[The Dance of Death]]'' (''Totentanz'') from [[Liber Chronicarum]] [Nuremberg Chronicle], 1493, attr. to [[Michael Wolgemut]] ]]

== Sources of inspiration ==
In the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] age, due to a fascination with everything [[Medieval]], the aspect of fantastic or grotesquely macabre [[irony]] often replaced the original moral intent. A musical example of such irony can be found in the last movement of the ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' by [[Hector Berlioz]] which quotes the medieval (Gregorian) ''[[Dies Irae]]'' ([[Day of Judgment]]) melody in a shockingly modernistic manner. In 1830 Liszt attended the first performance of the symphony and was struck by its powerful originality. Liszt’s ''Totentanz'' (Dance of Death), a set of [[Variation (music)|variations]] for piano and orchestra, also paraphrases the ''Dies Irae'' plainsong.

[[Image:Buonamico Buffalmacco 001.jpg|left|thumb|350px|''The Triumph of Death'', c. 1355]]
Another source of inspiration for the young Liszt was the famous [[fresco]] "Triumph of Death" by [[Francesco Traini]] (at Liszt's time attributed to [[Andrea Orcagna]] and today also to [[Buonamico Buffalmacco]]) in the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]], [[Pisa]].  Liszt had eloped to Italy with his mistress, the [[Marie d'Agoult|Countess d’Agoult]], and in 1838 he visited Pisa.  Only ten years later, Liszt’s first sketches materialized into a complete version of his ''Totentanz''. Revisions followed in 1853 and 1859, and its final form was first performed at [[The Hague]] on 15 April 1865 by Liszt’s student [[Hans von Bülow]], to whom the work is dedicated.

== Stylistic innovations ==
Since it is based on Gregorian material, Liszt’s ''Totentanz'' contains Medieval sounding passages with [[canon (music)|canonic]] [[counterpoint]], but by far the most innovative aspect of the scoring is the shockingly modernistic, even [[percussive]], nature of the piano part.  The opening comes surprisingly close to the introduction in [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]’s [[Sonata for two pianos and percussion|Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion]], a work composed almost a hundred years later.  This may be no coincidence since Bartók frequently performed Liszt’s ''Totentanz''.  Other modernistic features are the [[toccata]] like sections where the pianist’s repeated notes beat with diabolic intensity and special sound effects in the orchestra—for example, the ''[[col legno]]'' in the strings sound like shuddering or clanking bones. [[Richard Pohl]] (an early biographer) notes, "Every variation discloses some new character—the earnest man, the flighty youth, the scornful doubter, the prayerful monk, the daring soldier, the tender maiden, the playful child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Pohl | first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Pohl | title=Franz Liszt. Studien und Erinnerungen: Gesammelte Schriften über Musik und Musiker'', vol.2'' | publisher=Leipzig: Bernhard Schlicke | date=1883 | page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Danse macabre franz liszt.jpg|right|thumb|400px|opening measures]]

== Extant versions ==
Like most Liszt pieces, a number of versions exist.  Next to Liszt's first version of the ''Totentanz'' a second ''[[Psalm 130|De Profundis]]'' version was prepared from Liszt's manuscript sources by [[Ferruccio Busoni]] (1919).  The standard version is the final and third version of the piece (1859). Liszt also wrote versions for two pianos (S.652) and solo piano (S.525). Edited by [[Emil von Sauer]], the original edition for two pianos, however, merely incorporated the solo part of Liszt's rendering for piano and orchestra, with a transcription of the orchestral accompaniment in the second piano.&lt;ref name="IMSLP_a"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Emil von Sauer|von Sauer, Emil]] |url=http://imslp.org/wiki/Totentanz,_S.126_%28Liszt,_Franz%29 |title=Petrucci Music Library &amp;#124; Totentanz &amp;#124; S.126 (Liszt, Franz) |publisher=Imslp.org |date=2013-10-05 |accessdate=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. [[Andrey Kasparov]] has since re-imagined this setting as a work for piano duo.&lt;ref name="Campbell_ab"&gt;{{cite web|author=Campbell, John |url=http://www.artsongupdate.org/Reviews/NorfolkChamberConsort/NorfolkChamberConsort17.htm |title=Artsong Update &amp;#124; Reviews &amp;#124; Norfolk Chamber Consort: Berlin Philharmonic Wind Quintet with Andrey Kasparov, Piano |publisher=Artsongupdate.org |date=2014-02-17 |accessdate=2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It shows to great effect the breadth of the ''Totentanz'', when distributed evenly between two performers.

== Notable performers ==
Besides the performances by [[Hans von Bülow]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Ferruccio Busoni]], performances of historic significance include those of the Liszt student [[José Vianna da Motta]] (1945 - Port Nat S IPL 108), as well as [[Georges Cziffra]] (EMI 74012 2), [[Claudio Arrau]], [[Jorge Bolet]] (Decca), [[Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli]] (1961 - Arkadia HP 507.1;  1962 - Memoria 999-001), [[Michel Béroff]] (EMI Classics), [[Byron Janis]] (RCA), [[Martha Argerich]], [[Krystian Zimerman]] (Deutsche Grammophon), [[Arnaldo Cohen]] (Naxos and BIS), and [[Raymond Lewenthal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21089">'''Virtual volunteering''' refers to [[volunteering|volunteer]] activities completed, in whole or in part, using the [[Internet]] and a home, school, telecenter, or work computer or other Internet-connected device, such as a smart-phone (a cell phone with Internet functions) or personal digital assistant (PDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Last Virtual Volunteering Guidebook: Fully Integrating Online Service Into Volunteer Involvement|last=Cravens|first=Jayne|publisher=Energize, Inc|year=2014|isbn=978-0-940576-65-0|location=Philadelphia, PA 19144 USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual volunteering is also known as '''online volunteering''',  '''remote volunteering''' or '''e-volunteering'''.

==In practice==

In one study,&lt;ref&gt;Dhebar, B. B., &amp; Stokes, B. (2008). A nonprofit manager's guide to online volunteering. Nonprofit Management and Leadership, 18 (4), 497–506.&lt;/ref&gt; over 70 per cent of online volunteers chose assignments requiring one to five hours a week and nearly half chose assignments lasting 12 weeks or less.  Some organizations offer online volunteering opportunities which last from ten minutes to an hour. A unique feature of online volunteering is that it can be done from a distance. People with restricted mobility or other special needs participate in ways that might not be possible in traditional face-to-face volunteering. Likewise, online volunteering may allow people to overcome social inhibitions and [[social anxiety]], particularly if they would normally experience disability-related labeling or stereotyping. This empowers people who might not otherwise volunteer. It can build [[self-confidence]] and [[self-esteem]] while enhancing skills and extending networks and social ties.  Online volunteering also allows participants to adapt their program of volunteer work to their unique skills and passions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;State of the World's Volunteerism Report 2011: Universal Values for Global Well-being, United Nations Volunteers, {{ISBN|978-9211012460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People engaged in virtual volunteering undertake a variety of activities from locations remote to the organization or people they are assisting, via a computer or other Internet-connected device, such as:

* researching subjects (e.g. for [[Wikia]] projects)
* writing software (see [[open-source software]] which is often made by volunteers)
* fixing software (e.g. [[Community patch]]es)
* creating [[web page]]s
* editing or writing proposals, press releases, newsletter articles, etc.
* translating documents (e.g. [[Fan translation]]s)
* developing material for a curriculum
* designing a [[database]]
* designing [[graphics]]
* scanning documents
* providing legal, business, medical, agricultural or any other expertise
* counseling people
* [[Online tutoring|tutoring]] or [[E-mentoring|mentoring]] students
* moderating [[online discussion]] groups
* writing songs
* creating a [[podcast]]
* editing a video
* monitoring the news
* [[Internet Pastoral care]]
* answering questions
* [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] photos and files
* managing other online volunteers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsvolunteers.ca/vvfacts/general.html#examples |title=What are examples of virtual volunteering? |accessdate=5 October 2009 |publisher=AIDSvolunteers.ca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701081617/http://www.aidsvolunteers.ca/vvfacts/general.html#examples |archive-date=1 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serviceleader.org/old/vv/examples.html |title=examples of virtual volunteering |accessdate=5 October 2009 |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519041848/http://www.serviceleader.org/old/vv/examples.html |archivedate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theextraordinaries.org/2008/11/make-a-difference-from-home-be-a-virtual-volunteer.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903075911/http://www.theextraordinaries.org/2008/11/make-a-difference-from-home-be-a-virtual-volunteer.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 September 2009 |title=Make a Difference From Home: Be a Virtual Volunteer |accessdate=5 October 2009 |publisher=theextraordinaries.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the developing world, innovative synergies between volunteerism and technology typically focus on [[mobile communication]] technologies rather than the Internet. Around 26 per cent of people worldwide had Internet access in 2009. However, Internet penetration in low-income countries was only 18 per cent, compared to over 64 per cent in developed countries. While the costs of fixed broadband Internet are falling, access still remains unaffordable to many.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). (2010). Measuring the information society . Geneva, Switzerland: ITU&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, online volunteering is developing rapidly. Online volunteers are "people who commit their time and skills over the Internet, freely and without financial considerations, for the benefit of society."&lt;ref&gt;Dhebar &amp; Stokes, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Online volunteering has eliminated the need for volunteerism to be tied to specific times and locations. Thus, it greatly increases the freedom and flexibility of volunteer engagement and complements the outreach and impact of volunteers serving in situ. Most online volunteers engage in operational and managerial activities such as fundraising, technological support, communications, marketing and consulting. Increasingly, they also engage in activities such as research and
writing and leading e-mail discussion groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Online ''[[micro-volunteering]]'' is also an example of virtual volunteering and [[crowdsourcing]], where volunteers undertake assignments via their [[PDA]]s or [[smartphones]]. These volunteers either aren't required to undergo any screening or training by the nonprofit for such tasks, and do not have to make any other commitment when a micro-task is completed, or, have already undergone screening or training by the nonprofit, and are therefore approved to take on micro-tasks as their availability and interests allow. Online micro-volunteering was originally called "byte-sized volunteering" by the Virtual Volunteering Project, and has always been a part of the more than 30-year-old practice of online volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofit.about.com/od/volunteers/a/microvol.htm |title=Volunteering - Get the Most From Volunteer Experience |publisher=Nonprofit.about.com |date=2014-05-14 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of both micro-volunteering and crowdsourcing is [[ClickWorkers]], a small NASA project begun in 2001 that engaged online volunteers in scientific-related tasks that required just a person's perception and common sense, but not scientific training, such as identifying craters on Mars in photos the project posted online; volunteers were not trained or screened before participating. The phrase "micro-volunteering" is usually credited to a San Francisco-based nonprofit called The Extraordinaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weeks |first=Linton |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106118736 |title=The Extraordinaries: Will Microvolunteering Work? |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amy Farnsworth |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Responsible-Tech/2009/0804/smart-phone-app-lets-you-do-good-deeds-in-your-spare-time |title=Smart-phone app lets you do good deeds in your spare time |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/assignment_7&amp;id=7162300 |title=San Francisco-based website offers micro-volunteering platform &amp;#124; abc7news.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

The practice of virtual volunteering to benefit nonprofit initiatives dates back to at least the early 1970s, when [[Project Gutenberg]] began involving online volunteers to provide electronic versions of works in the public domain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;
{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a new [[nonprofit organization]] called [[Impact Online]] (now called [[VolunteerMatch]]), based in Palo Alto, California, began promoting the idea of "virtual volunteers".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Impact Online received a grant from the [[James Irvine Foundation]] to launch an initiative to research the practice of virtual volunteering and to promote the practice to nonprofit organizations in the US. This new initiative was dubbed the [[Virtual Volunteering Project]], and the web site was launched in early 1997.&lt;ref&gt;

| location = [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; After one year of operations, the Virtual Volunteering Project moved to the Charles A. Dana Center at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]. In 2002, the Virtual Volunteering Project moved within the university to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]]. The first two years of the Virtual Volunteer Project were spent reviewing and adapting [[telecommuting]] manuals&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and existing volunteer management guidelines with regarding to virtual volunteering, as well as identifying organizations that were involving online volunteers. By April 1999, almost 100 organizations had been identified by the Virtual Volunteering Project as involving online volunteers and were listed on the web site.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

| location = [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the growing numbers of nonprofit organizations, schools, government programs and other not-for-profit entities involving online volunteers, the Virtual Volunteering Project stopped listing every such organization involving online volunteers on its web site in 2000, and focused its efforts on promoting the practice, profiling organizations with large or unique online volunteering programs, and creating guidelines for the involvement of online volunteers. Until January 2001, the Virtual Volunteering Project listed all telementoring and teletutoring programs in the USA (programs where online volunteers mentor or tutor others, through a nonprofit organization or school). At that time, 40 were identified.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1999, the [[NetAid|NetAid.org]] initiative was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative included an online volunteering component, today known as the [[United Nations Volunteers#Online Volunteering|UN Online Volunteering service]]. It went live in 2000 and has been managed by [[United Nations Volunteers]] since its inception. It quickly attracted a high number of people ready to support organizations working for development. In 2003, several thousand people already contributed to the UN's Online Volunteering service – volunteers with very diverse backgrounds, including university graduates, private sector employees, and retirees.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; While the UN's Online Volunteering service became independent, NetAid continued as a joint project of [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] and Cisco Systems. It aimed "to utilize the unique networking capabilities of the Internet to promote development and alleviate extreme poverty across the world".&lt;ref&gt;

==Current state==

Online volunteering has been adopted by thousands of nonprofit organizations and other initiatives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; There is no organization currently tracking best practices in online volunteering in the USA or worldwide, how many people are engaged in online volunteering, or how many organizations utilize online volunteers, and studies regarding volunteering, such as reports on volunteering trends in the USA, rarely include information about online volunteering (for example, a search of the term ''virtual volunteering'' on the [[Corporation for National Service]]'s "Volunteering in America" yields no results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Volunteering and Civic Life in America |url=http://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov/ |title=volunteeringinamerica.gov. Retrieved 24 September 2009 |publisher=Volunteeringinamerica.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On IVCO's Forum Discussion Paper 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivco2015.org/conference/document/1005_Global_indicators_to_measure_volunteer_impact(Megan,%20Peter).pdf Megan Haddock &amp; Peter Devereux, Forum Discussion Paper 2015: Documenting the Contribution of Volunteering to the SDGs]&lt;/ref&gt; it is recommended that a collective measurement tool developed as part of a global measurement framework should also capture online volunteering.

The [[United Nations Volunteers#Online Volunteering|UN's Online Volunteering service]] connects organizations working in or for the developing world with online volunteers. It does have statistics available regarding numbers of online volunteers and involving organizations (i.e. NGOs, other civil society organizations, a government or other public institutions, United Nations agencies or other intergovernmental institutions) that collaborate online via their platform. In 2013, all 17,370 online volunteering assignments offered by development organizations through the Online Volunteering service attracted applications from numerous qualified volunteers. About 58 percent of the 11,037 online volunteers were women, and 60 percent came from developing countries; on average, they were 30 years of age. More than 94 percent of organizations and online volunteers rated their collaboration as good or excellent in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;About the UNV Online Volunteering service, Statistics: https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/about/statistics.html&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organizations]] with limited resources in particular, the impact of online volunteer engagement is significant: 41% involve UN Online Volunteers for technical expertise that is not available internally. According to the same impact evaluation carried out in 2014, in many instances, organizations without access to online volunteers would have difficulties achieving their own peace and development outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unv.org/annual-report-2014/pdf/Chapter_6.pdf UNV Annual Report 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, UNV unveiled a redesigned website and launched two additional services: The 1-click query to allow organizations to reach out to half a million people to provide real-time data for their projects, and its new employee online volunteering solution for global companies. Inclusive multi-stakeholder partnerships emerged as a necessity to achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), and the first private sector partner of the Online Volunteering service is based in Brazil ([[Samsung Electronics]] Latin American Office).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unv.org/news/samsung-and-unv-announce-innovative-partnership-promote-volunteerism-achieving-sustainable|title=Samsung and UNV announce an innovative partnership to promote volunteerism for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - UNV|work=unv.org|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other matching services, such as [[VolunteerMatch]] and [[Idealist (organization)|Idealist]], also offer virtual volunteering positions with nonprofit organizations in addition to traditional, on-site volunteering opportunities. VolunteerMatch currently reports that about 5 percent of its active volunteer listings are virtual in nature. As of June 2010, its directory included more than 2,770 such listings including roles in interactive marketing, fundraising, accounting, social media, and business mentoring. The percentage of virtual listings has dropped since 2006, when it peaked at close to 8 percent of overall volunteer opportunities in the VolunteerMatch system.

[[Wikipedia]] and other [[Wikimedia Foundation]] endeavors are examples of online volunteering, in the form of crowdsourcing or micro-volunteering; the majority of Wikipedia contributing volunteers aren't required to undergo any screening or training by the nonprofit for their role as researchers, writers or editors, and do not have to make a specific time commitment to the organization in order to contribute service.

Many organizations involved in virtual volunteering might never mention the term, or the words "online volunteer," on their web sites or in organizational literature. For example, the nonprofit organization Business Council for Peace ([[Bpeace]]) recruits business professionals to donate their time mentoring entrepreneurs in conflict-affected countries, including [[Afghanistan]] and [[Rwanda]], but the majority of these volunteers interact with Bpeace staff and entrepreneurs online rather than face-to-face; yet, the term virtual volunteering is not mentioned on the web site. Bpeace also engages in online micro-volunteering, asking for information leads from its supporters, such as where to find online communities of particular professionals in the USA, but the organization never mentions the term micro-volunteering on its web site.  Another example is the [[Electronic Emissary]], one of the first K-12 online mentoring programs, launched in 1992; the web site does not use the phrase virtual volunteering and prefers to call online volunteers online [[subject matter expert]]s.

Evolving forms of volunteerism will enhance opportunities for people to volunteer. The spread of technology connects ever more rural and isolated areas. NGOs and governments are beginning to realise the value of South-to-South international volunteerism, as well as diaspora volunteering, and are dedicating resources to these schemes. Corporations are responding to the "social marketplace" by supporting [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] initiatives that include volunteerism. New opportunities for engaging in volunteerism are opening up with the result that more people are becoming involved and those already participating can expand their commitment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A phenomenon that is still quite new, but growing rapidly, is the formal integration of online employee volunteering programmes into the infrastructure and business plan of companies.

The '''Woman's Building''' was a [[non-profit]] arts and education center located in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The Woman's Building focused on [[feminist art]] and served as a venue for the [[women's movement]] and was spearheaded by artist [[Judy Chicago]], [[graphic designer]] [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] and [[art historian]] [[Arlene Raven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/jan/15/2012/womans-building|title=Los Angeles’ Woman’s Building remembered {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center was open from 1973 until 1991.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Woman's Building records, 1970-1992 | work=[[Archives of American Art]] | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/womans-building-records-6347/more#biohist | accessdate=15 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its existence, the [[Los Angeles Times]] called the Woman's Building a "feminist mecca."&lt;ref name="LAT1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jan Breslauer | year=1992 | title=Woman's Building Lost to a Hitch in 'Herstory' | work=Business Closings | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-07/entertainment/ca-1544_1_feminist-art | accessdate=15 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Womansbuilding.jpg|thumb|right|Woman's Building, c. 1978]]

===Feminist Studio Workshop===

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''The time: mid-'70s. The place: the Feminist Studio Workshop, later to become the Woman's Building.''&lt;br/&gt;
''The quest: to find themselves, to make art, to change the culture.''"&lt;br/&gt; - Jan Breslauer, 1992&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1973, [[CalArts]] teachers artist [[Judy Chicago]], [[graphic designer]] [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] and [[art historian]] [[Arlene Raven]] were finally finished with trying to offer feminist education in a male-dominated institution like CalArts. That year they quit CalArts and founded the Feminist Studio Workshop (FSW).&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt; FSW was one of the first independent [[art schools]] for women, and revolved around a workshop environment, allowing women to develop their artistic skills and knowledge outside a traditional educational environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/womans-building|title=The Woman's Building {{!}} Los Angeles Conservancy|website=www.laconservancy.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of FSW was that [[art]] should not be separated from activities related to the [[women's movement]]. FSW originally met in de Bretteville's home, and in November 1973 the three women began renting a workshop space in a vacant building near [[MacArthur Park]],&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt; calling it the Woman's Building after a building from the [[1893 World's Columbian Exposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcet.org/departures-columns/the-legacy-of-the-womans-building-and-how-it-lives-on|title=The Legacy of the Woman's Building and How it Lives On|website=KCET|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSW sublet space in the building to [[performance art]] groups, the Sisterhood Bookstore, the Associated Women's Press, local chapters of the [[National Organization for Women]] and the Women's Liberation Union, and three galleries: [[Womanspace Gallery]], Gallery 707, and Grandview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chicago|first=Judy|title=Through the Flower: My Struggle as A Woman Artist|year=1975|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New building===

In 1975, the building that FSW was renting was sold, and they, along with the other tenants, moved to a former [[Standard Oil Company]] building from the 1920s. In the 1940s the building had been converted into a [[warehouse]], consisting of three floors of open space, making it ideal for FSW's classes and exhibitions.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; The space was the first arts organization to locate itself in [[downtown Los Angeles]], contributing to the revitalization of the area during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt; FSW became the main tenant as the previous smaller tenants left, and decided to hire an administrator and create a [[board of directors]] to handle the growth of the organization. FSW obtained funding from memberships, tuition, fund-raising and [[grants]].&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt;

Numerous programs and groups formed out of FSW. They offered a two-year program in interdisciplinary arts, such as performing, graphics, video and writing. Deena Metzger started the writing program which included an ongoing writing series.  Readers in the series included [[Meridel LeSueur]], [[Honor Moore]], [[Audre Lorde]], and [[Adrienne Rich]]. They also hosted large-scale exhibitions, media and social events. From 1976 to 1980 the Feminist Art Workers toured the [[Midwest]] with interactive performance and [[installation art]]works. A performance group called the Waitresses formed, who performed in restaurants using the [[waitress]] as a [[metaphor]] for women in society. The Incest Awareness Project consisted of a series of interactive exhibitions from 1978–79, including a video installation, ''Equal Time and Equal Space'', directed by [[Nancy Angelo]], in which audience members would sit surrounded by [[video monitors]] playing videos of [[incest]] survivors sharing their experiences. A group piece, ''In Mourning and in Rage'', created by [[Suzanne Lacy]] and Leslie Labowitz, featured 10 tall women, wearing 7-foot-tall head extensions, draped in black, standing on the steps of the [[Los Angeles City Hall]]. Each woman represented a victim of the [[Hillside Strangler]] and a statistic of violence against women. Works such as these are credited with shaping the contemporary performance art scene.&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt;

Artist [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] designed a necklace of an [[eyebolt]] on a chain, meant to represent "strength without a fist"; members of the FSW in 1978-79 made 500 of these necklaces to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Woman's Building.&lt;ref name="Woman's Building People"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womansbuilding.org/people.htm|title=Woman's Building People|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woman's Building People"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sistersofjam.com/category/hello-sheila/|title=Hello Sheila!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 artists from the Woman's Building issued a nationwide call for lesbian artists to organize exhibitions of their work as part of the [[Great American Lesbian Art Show]] (GALAS).&lt;ref name="WBT"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Woman's Building Timeline | work=| publisher= | url=http://womansbuilding.org/timeline.htm| accessdate=2 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final decade===
[[File:Women in Design.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]]'s poster for the Women in Design conference held at the Woman's Building in 1975. Woman's Building records, [[Archives of American Art]], [[Smithsonian Institution]].]]
In 1981 the Feminist Studio Workshop closed, due to the diminishing demand for [[alternative education]]. With FSW's closure, the programs of the Woman's Building were altered to cater to the needs of working women. The building's hours were reduced and two thirds of it rented to artists for studio space. That year all three of the founding members left, and former students [[Terry Wolverton]], [[Sue Maberry]] and [[Cheri Gaulke]] led the organization. They also began the Vesta Awards, an annual fundraiser.&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt; That year, the Woman's Building founded the Women's Graphic Center Typesetting and Design, a for-profit business designed to strengthen their finances and support the artistic endeavors of the Building. They provided [[phototypesetting]], [[graphic design]], production and [[printing]] services. However, in 1988 the Women's Graphic Center closed, and the income for staff salaries disappeared. Wolverton served as sole executive director from 1988 to April 1989 before leaving. [[Pauli De Witt]] replaced Wolverton, staying only briefly and failing to rescue the organization financially. After she left, a 13-member board ran the Woman's Building.&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt; The Woman's Building never recovered and despite pushes to move to another location,&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt; they closed the gallery and performance space in 1991.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; They continued to hold the Vesta Awards, with keynote speaker [[Lucy Lippard]] and proceeds going towards an [[oral history]] of the organization.&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt;

==Legacy==

In 1991, Sandra Golvin, President of the Board of Directors, donated the Woman's Building records to the Smithsonian's [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; Other archival collections of materials are at the [[Getty Research Institute]] and the ONE Archives, both in Los Angeles.

The Woman's Building and its legacy was the subject of a major exhibition called ''Doin It In Public: Feminism and Art at the Woman's Building'' at the [[Ben Maltz Gallery]] at [[Otis College of Art and Design]] in 2011/2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artpractical.com/review/from_los_angeles_doin_it_in_public/|title=From Los Angeles: Doin’ It In Public: Feminism and Art at the Woman’s Building {{!}} Art Practical|last=Magers|first=Susannah|website=Art Practical|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was part of the Getty initiative, Pacific Standard Time.&lt;ref name="WBH"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Woman's Bulilding: Doin' It in Public | work=| publisher= | url=http://www.otis.edu/ben-maltz-gallery/womans-building| accessdate=23 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was accompanied by a 2-volume catalog, and a website that includes historical information about the Woman's Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/16/doin-it-in-public-exhibition_n_1281983.html|title=Influential Feminist Exhibition Comes To LA|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; June 8, 2018 the L.A. City Council designates the Woman's Building as a Historic Cultural Monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/status-update-the-womans-building-earns-historic-cultural-monument-designation-9567962|title=Status Update: The Woman’s Building Earns Historic Cultural Monument Designation|last=Weekly|first=LA|date=2018-06-14|work=L.A.

The academic discipline of '''Women's Writing''' as a discrete area of [[literary criticism|literary studies]] is based on the notion that the experience of women, historically, has been shaped by their gender, and so women writers by definition are a group worthy of separate study: "Their texts emerge from and intervene in conditions usually very different from those which produced most writing by men."&lt;ref&gt;Blain, Virginia, Isobel Grundy, and Patricia Clements, eds. ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English''. New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1990. viii-ix.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a question of the subject matter or political stance of a particular author, but of her [[gender]], ''i.e.'' her position as a woman within the literary world. Women's writing, as a discrete area of literary studies and practice, is recognized explicitly by the numbers of dedicated journals, [[list of organizations for women writers|organizations]], [[list of organizations for women writers#Literary awards which focus on gender|awards]], and [[list of organizations for women writers#Organizations and conferences|conferences]] which focus mainly or exclusively on texts produced by women. Women's writing as an area of study has been developing since the 1970s. The majority of English and American literature programmes offer courses on specific aspects of literature by women, and women's writing is generally considered an area of specialization in its own right.

==Distinct category ==
[[File:Virginia Woolf 1927.jpg|thumb|[[Virginia Woolf]]]]
The broader discussion women's cultural contributions as a separate category has a long history, but the specific study of women's writing as a distinct category of scholarly interest is relatively recent.  There are examples in the 18th century of catalogues of women writers, including [[George Ballard (biographer)|George Ballard]]'s ''Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain Who Have Been Celebrated for their Writing or Skill in the Learned Languages, Arts, and Sciences'' (1752); [[John Duncombe]]'s ''Feminiad'', a catalogue of women writers; and the ''Biographium faemineum: the female worthies, or, Memoirs of the most illustrious ladies, of all ages and nations, who have been eminently distinguished for their magnanimity, learning, genius, virtue, piety, and other excellent endowments''.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Janet, ed. ''British Women Writers: a critical reference guide''. London: Routledge, 1989. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, women have been treated as a distinct category by various [[Misogyny|misogynist]] writings, perhaps best exemplified by [[Richard Polwhele]]'s ''[[The Unsex'd Females]]'', a critique in verse of women writers at the end of the 18th century with a particular focus on [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and her circle.

Earlier discussion of women's broader cultural contributions can be found as far back as the 8th century BC, when [[Hesiod]] compiled ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' (attr.), a list of heroines and goddesses. [[Plutarch]] listed heroic and artistic women in his ''[[Moralia]]''. In the medieval period, [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] used mythic and biblical women as moral exemplars in ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (On Famous Women) (1361–1375), directly inspiring [[Christine de Pisan]] to write ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' (1405).

Women writers themselves have long been interested in tracing a "woman's tradition" in writing. [[Mary Scott (poet)|Mary Scott]]'s ''The Female Advocate: A Poem Occasioned by Reading Mr Duncombe's Feminead'' (1774) is one of the best known such works in the 18th century, a period that saw a burgeoning of women writers being published. In 1803, [[Mary Hays]] published the six volume ''Female Biography''. And, [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) exemplifies the impulse in the modern period to explore a tradition of women's writing. Woolf, however, sought to explain what she perceived as an absence; and by the mid-century scholarly attention turned to finding and reclaiming "lost" writers.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, Claire, ed.''[[List of women in Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature|The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature]]''. Prentice Hall, 1992. vix; Salzman, Paul. Introduction, ''Early Modern Women's Writing''. Oxford UP, 2000. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many to reclaim: it is common for the editors of dictionaries or anthologies of women's writing to refer to the difficulty in choosing from all the available material.&lt;ref&gt;Blain et al. vii; Todd xv; Spender, Dale, and Janet Todd. ''Anthology of British Women Writers''. Harper Collins, 1989. xiii; Buck ix-x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Busby, Margaret, ed. ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'', Cape, 1992, p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade publishers have similarly focused on women's writing recently: since the 1970s there have been a number of [[Literary magazine|literary periodicals]] (such as ''Fireweed'' and ''[[Room (magazine)|Room of One's Own]]'') which are dedicated to publishing the creative work of women writers, and there are a number of [[List of women's presses|dedicated presses]] as well, such as the [[Second Story Press]] and the Women's Press. In addition, collections and anthologies of women's writing continue to be published by both trade and [[Academic publishing|academic presses]].

The question of whether or not there is a "women's tradition" remains vexing; some scholars and editors refer to a "women's canon" and women's "literary lineage," and seek to "identify the recurring themes and to trace the evolutionary and interconnecting patterns" in women's writing,&lt;ref&gt;Spender &amp; Todd xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; but the range of women's writing across time and place is so considerable that, according to some, it is inaccurate to speak of "women's writing" in a universal sense: Claire Buck calls "women's writing" an "unstable category."&lt;ref&gt;Buck xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, women writers cannot be considered apart from their male contemporaries and the larger literary tradition. Recent scholarship on race, class, and sexuality in literature further complicate the issue and militate against the impulse to posit one "women's tradition." Some scholars, such as Roger Lonsdale, maintain that something of a commonality exists and that "it is not unreasonable to consider" women writers "in some aspects as a special case, given their educational insecurities and the constricted notions of the properly 'feminine' in social and literary behaviour they faced.".&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, Roger ed. ''Eighteenth-Century Women Poets''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989. xliii.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the term "women's writing" implies, then, the belief that women in some sense constitute a group, however diverse, who share a position of difference based on gender.

== Rediscovering ignored works from the past==
In the West, the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] prompted a general revelation of women's historical contributions, and various academic sub-disciplines, such as [[women's history]] and women's writing, developed in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.  Much of this early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975, and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels by written by women.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra M. Gilbert, "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel]." ''New York Times'', May 4, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels. There has been commensurate growth in the area of [[List of biographical dictionaries of women writers|biographical dictionaries of women writers]] due to a perception, according to one editor, that "[m]ost of our women are not represented in the 'standard' reference books in the field."&lt;ref&gt;Blain et al. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread interest in women's writing developed alongside, influenced, and was influenced by, a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]], [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole-scale expansion of what is considered "literature," and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary," (such as children's writing, journals, letters, and travel writing, among many others)&lt;ref&gt;Blain x; Buck x.&lt;/ref&gt; are now the subjects of scholarly interest. Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so that one now sees work on the "female gothic"&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976). See also Juliann E. Fleenor, ed., ''The Female Gothic'' (Montreal: Eden Press, 1983) and Gary Kelly, ed., ''Varieties of Female Gothic'', 6 vols (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Women in science fiction|women's science fiction]], for example.

==Distinctions==
In Robert Silverberg’s introduction to [[James Tiptree Jr.]]’s "[[The Girl Who Was Plugged In]]," he expressed the sentiment that the pseudonym must belong to a man, as the syntax and lexicon used in the short story were undeniably masculine. Silverberg compares Tiptree’s writing to that of Hemingway, saying that the masculinity is found in the fact that the writing was "simple, direct, and straightforward" and uses the style of "relying on dialog broken by bursts of stripped down exposition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tiptree Jr.|first1=James|last2=Silverberg|first2=Robert|title=Warm Worlds and Otherwise|date=1975|publisher=Ballatine|location=New Yor|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later proven to be wrong, as Tiptree is actually Alice Sheldon, a female writer.  
This raises the question about whether or not male and female writers have definite difference in the way that they write, and if there are certain parameters that define "women’s writing". In fact, multiple studies support the fact that there are dissimilarities that exist between the two.

=== Academic writing ===
In academic writing, there are marked differences between them in syntax and structure between women's writing and men's writing. Studying the differences between masters’ theses of men and women shows that their sentences often contain more components, meaning that they form more complicated ideas. By studying the number of T-units- the shortest phrase that can still be split into different components (often a sentence) - in comparison to the number of clauses, one can see that women use almost twice as many clauses as sentences.
Men, on the other hand, only have a ratio of about .70 clauses per sentence, suggesting that they present just one idea per sentence.  Similarly, women used about 21% more cohesive devices in their writing than men did, indicating that they carried ideas into multiple sentences or phrases more often, presenting a more complicated argument. Women also tended to use paraphrasing rather than direct quotation when integrating information from outside sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shirzad|first1=F.|last2=Musavi|first2=Kh.|last3=Atmani|first3=S.|last4=Azizeh|first4=Kh.|last5=Ahranjani|last6=Iraji|first6=S.|title=Gender Differences in EFL Academic Writing|journal=International Journal of Academic Research Part B|date=2013|volume=5|issue=4|pages=79–87}} See p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children ===
In addition, the article "Gender Differences in EFL Writing" states that "research on gender differences in writing have mostly been conducted among children. Punter and Burchell’s study (1996) on the GCSE English language exam in the UK primary school discovered that girls scored better in imaginative, reflective, and empathetic writing while boys scored better in argumentative and factual writing",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shirzad|first1=F.|last2=Musavi|first2=Kh.|last3=Atmani|first3=S.|last4=Azizeh|first4=Kh.|last5=Ahranjani|last6=Iraji|first6=S.|title=Gender Differences in EFL Writing|journal=International Journal of Academic Research Part B|date=2013|volume=5|issue=4|pages=79–87}} See p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides evidence for the stance that there is an ingrained difference in the writing of men and women, one that starts very early on in life. This, however, is not the case for everybody, as shown by Alice Sheldon's "The Girl Who Was Plugged In," which was believed to be written by a man based on the type of language used. Further evidence for the difference between written word of boys and girls is provided in Written Communication. Analysis of the assignments of eighth graders shows that the girls consistently scored higher on their assignments than the boys, even when the boys showed an increased or above average proclivity towards writing. The article even states that the writing behaviors of girls are "more desirable" in the public school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jihyun|title=Can Writing Attitude and Learning Behavior Overcome Gender Difference in Writing?|journal=Written Communication|date=2013|volume=30|issue=2|pages=164–193}} See p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The studies show that when all factors are the same, including learning behavior and attitude, girls are still more successful in writing classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jihyun|title=Can Writing Attitude and Learning Behavior Overcome Gender Difference in Writing?|journal=Written Communication|date=2013|volume=30|issue=2|pages=164–193}} See p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creative writing ===
These "more desirable" traits extend on into adulthood, as study in the use of creative or emotional language in adults shows the same results. Examination on the differences in description of color shows that women have greater "emotionality" in regards to it. Women generally use more descriptive language than men. Men used less, and are referred to as having less "emotionality" overall. There is no correlation between emotionality and age for men, but there is for women. This supposed ingrained difference between men and women is supported further by the fact that there seems to be no difference in different countries/cultures. "Interestingly, such results have been reported across many cultures. Yang (2000) studied male and female Chinese speakers who were undergraduate English majors and found women possessed more color vocabulary (both in English and in Chinese), were more elaborate in the Chinese translations of the color words." While this may have something to do with the supposed superiority of women in identifying shades of color, it also shows that the language they use to describe it is more vivid and detailed with "emotionality," and this difference persists throughout races and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arthur|first1=Heather|last2=Johnson|first2=Gail|last3=Young|first3=Adena|title=Gender Differences in Color: Content and Emotion of Written Description|journal=Social Behavior and Personality|date=2007|volume=35|issue=6|pages=827–835}} See p. 829.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Coding ===
The stylistic differences between the syntax and lexicon of men and women extends even beyond written communication. In other applications of communication the same rift exists. In computer programming and coding, women are believed to write code that is more user-friendly, containing comments that explain how to use it, and easy to understand variables, while code written by men tends to be cryptic and obscure. Emma McGrattan, a programmer located in Silicon Valley, says she can accurately determine whether code was written by a man or a woman just by looking at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bair|first1=Bettina|title=Do Women Write Better Code?|url=http://mailman.cse.ohio-state.edu/pipermail/ocwic/2008-June/000129.html|website=Wall Street Journal Blogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women’s code may be different than men’s, but that does not make it [[Feminism|feminist]] by nature. Feminist code does exist, mainly through the lens of its purpose. The online programming projects [[Women Writers Project|WWO]] and the Orlando project were feminist archive projects meant to collect the works of women throughout history. Women’s styles of writing have bled into the digital coding world, and emerged as feminist practices. Jacqueline Wernimont says of the archives, "Digital archives unite two historically gendered fields — computer and archival sciences. Literary scholars who depend on archival or rare book materials still confront, whether they acknowledge it or not, the legacy of an institutional form through which patriarchal power exercised the authority to determine value, classification, and access." Because men and their ways of addressing literature have been in charge for so long, women have to sort through to digitally archive what is most important in a feminist sense. The styles of men’s writing influence how they have viewed literature as the authority in the field, but as women have become more relevant, their styles and strategies of writing have come into the light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wernimont|first1=Jacqueline|title=Whence Feminism? Assessing Feminist Interventions in Digital Literary Archives|journal=Digital Humanities Quarterly|date=2013|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000156/000156.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
