'''1862 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Baseball]]==
'''National championship'''
* [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] champion – [[Brooklyn Eckfords]]
'''Events'''
* [[NABBP|National Association]] membership drops from 55 to 33 clubs, shedding every one outside greater New York except the Victory club of [[Troy, New York|Troy]], which plays only local matches.
* Death of [[Jim Creighton]], aged just 21 and the sport's first great player, perhaps from organ damage sustained on the field.  A memorial is established at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]].

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* [[Joe Coburn]] challenges [[John C. Heenan]] for the American Championship.  Heenan refuses to fight and Coburn claims the title.&lt;ref name="JH"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/heenan.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – John C. Heenan].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 28 January — [[Jem Mace]] successfully defends his British Championship against [[Tom King (boxer)|Tom King]], winning in the 43rd round.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mace-j.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Jem Mace].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 26 November — Tom King becomes British Champion after defeating Jem Mace at Medway in the 21st round.&lt;ref name="TK"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/king-t.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Tom King].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* 26 August — [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] v. [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven|All-England Eleven]] at [[The Oval]]. [[Edgar Willsher]] of All-England is no-balled six times in succession by [[John Lillywhite]] for [[overarm bowling|bowling with his hand above the shoulder]]. For some years previously, Willsher and others have bowled in this way and the incident at The Oval puts the issue into context. The drama is exaggerated when Willsher and the other eight professionals in the England team walk off the field. Play continues next day but with a replacement umpire.
'''England'''
* Most runs – [[Thomas Hayward (cricketer)|Thomas Hayward]] 661 @ 31.47 (HS 117)
* Most wickets – [[George Tarrant]] 96 @ 10.07 (BB 8–16)

==[[Football]]==
'''Events'''
* An impromptu team formed in Nottingham around this time is understood to have been the original [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].  Although County will be formally constituted in December 1864, the club will celebrate its centenary in 1962.
* Invention of the [[India rubber]] bladder enables the modern ball to be created with the bladder inside a hard outer casing, at first made of leather.  During the days of "mob football", the ball in an organised game had often been an inflated [[pig's bladder]] but in fact it could have been made of any material (for example, tin can football is still played now) with no rules about its size either.  In certain games that were somewhat less civilised, such as among soldiers after a battle, human skulls are known to have been used.
* 29 December — [[Bramall Lane]], which opened as a cricket ground in 1855, hosts its first football match between [[Sheffield F.C.]] and [[Hallam F.C.]] under [[Sheffield Rules]].  Bramall Lane will become the home of first [[Sheffield Wednesday]] (1867–1887) and then of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] from 1889.  It is the oldest stadium in the world that stages professional football matches.

==[[Golf]]==
'''Major tournaments'''
* [[1862 Open Championship|British Open]] – [[Tom Morris, Sr.|Tom Morris senior]]

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''England'''
* [[1862 Grand National|Grand National]] – [[The Huntsman]]
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Hurricane 
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – The Marquis
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Caractacus (horse)|Caractacus]]
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – Feu de Joie 
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – The Marquis
'''Australia''' 
* [[Melbourne Cup]] – [[Archer (horse)|Archer]] (second successive title)
'''Canada'''
* [[Queen's Plate]] – Palermo

==[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]]==
'''The Boat Race'''
* 12 April — [[Oxford University Boat Club|Oxford]] wins the 19th [[The Boat Race 1862|Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]]

==[[Ski jumping]]==
'''Events'''
* First recorded competition held in [[Trysil]]

'''América Managua''' is a [[Nicaragua]]n [[Football (soccer)|football]] team who last played at the local top level in the 2010/2011 season.

==History==
It is based in [[Managua]], and has been for long time the most successful team of the capital city and the one with the most fanatics in the area.

They won their first league title in 1985 coached by [[Florencio Leiva]], after just being promoted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/imprimir.php/33970 Tras la hazaña]&amp;nbsp;– El Nuevo Diario {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time a newly promoted side won the Nicaraguan league title. They played in the second division for several years and almost disappeared due to  bankruptcy.
At the end of the 2004–2005 season, Deportivo América won promotion to the top division after beating [[Scorpión FC]] in the [[Segunda División de Nicaragua|Second Division]] championship final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/nica05.html Nicaragua 2004/05] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219042039/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/nica05.html |date=February 19, 2014 }}&amp;nbsp;– RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011 the club decided not to show up for a replay against [[Real Madriz]] risking the chance of being expelled from Nicaraguan football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/deportes/103638 ¿El fin del América?]&amp;nbsp;– El Nuevo Diario {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replay was ordered by [[Nicaraguan Football Federation|FENIFUT]] after [[Xilotepelt]] accused América chairman Eliécer Trillos of bribing the Madriz team who lost the game 1–7 to save América from relegation and sent Xilotepelt down on goal difference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2011/04/05/deportes/56916-acusan-al-america Acusan al América] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309011019/http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2011/04/05/deportes/56916-acusan-al-america |date=March 9, 2014 }}&amp;nbsp;– La Prensa {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''caber toss''' is a traditional [[Scotland|Scottish]] athletic event in which competitors toss a large tapered pole called a "caber".  It is normally practised at the [[Highland games|Scottish Highland Games]]. In Scotland the caber is usually made from a [[Larch]] tree and is typically {{convert|19|ft|6|in}} tall and weighs {{convert|175|lb}}. The term "caber" derives from the Gaelic word ''cabar'', which refers to a wooden beam.

The person tossing the caber is called a "tosser" or a "thrower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Caber Tossing |volume=4 |page=917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said to have developed from the need to toss [[Trunk (botany)|log]]s across narrow chasms (in order to cross them), lumberjacks needing to transport logs by throwing them in streams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=English|first1=Nick|title=Caber Tossing: Why Hurling Trees Is the Most Delicate Strength Sport|url=https://barbend.com/caber-tossing-highland-games-strength-sport/|website=BarBend|accessdate=20 December 2016|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by lumberjacks challenging each other to a small contest.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The record for most caber tosses in 3 minutes is currently held by Danny Frame (Canadian). He managed to perform 16 successful caber tosses on 20 July 2018 at the Heart of the Valley Festival in Middleton, Nova Scotia, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecasket.ca/sports/danny-frame-sets-caber-toss-world-record-with-16-flips-at-middleton-festival-228056/|title=Danny Frame sets caber toss world record with 16 flips at Middleton festival {{!}} The Casket|website=www.thecasket.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective and technique==
The primary objective is to toss the caber so that it turns end over end, falling away from the tosser.  Ideally it should fall directly away from the tosser in the "12 o'clock" position.  The distance thrown is unimportant.

The tosser balances the caber upright, tapered end downwards, against his or her shoulder and neck, the caber being supported by stewards or fellow-competitors while being placed into position.  The tosser then crouches, sliding his interlocked hands down the caber and under the rounded base, and lifts it in his cupped hands. 

While standing he must balance the caber upright; this is not easy with the heavier end at the top, and less-experienced tossers may be unable to stop the caber falling to one side after lifting it. The tosser then walks or runs a few paces forward to gain momentum, and flips the tapered end upwards so that the large end hits the ground first, and, if well tossed, the caber falls directly away from the tosser.

Weight and strength are clearly essential for success, but technique is also important for balancing the caber when lifting it, and flipping up the held (tapered) end to promote a clean toss.

==Scoring==
{{EB1911 poster|Caber Tossing}}
The straightest end-over-end toss scores highest.  If the caber lands on its end but falls back towards the thrower, the score is lower than for any end-over-end throw but is based upon the maximum vertical angle that the caber achieved (side-judging may involve a second judge).

The '''Canton Bulldogs–Massillon Tigers betting scandal''' was the first major scandal in professional [[American football|football]] in the United States. It refers to a series of allegations made by a [[Massillon, Ohio|Massillon]], Ohio newspaper charging the [[Canton Bulldogs]] coach, [[Blondy Wallace]], and [[Massillon Tigers]] [[End (American football)|end]], [[Walter East]], of conspiring to [[match fixing|fix]] a two-game series between the two clubs. One account of the scandal called for Canton to win the first game and Massillon was to win the second, forcing a third game—with the biggest gate—to be played legitimately, with the 1906 [[Ohio League]] championship at stake. Another account accused Wallace and East of bribing Massillon players to throw a game in the series. Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to damage the club's reputation. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had indeed thrown the second game and it remains unknown if there was ever a match-fixing agreement, the scandal tarnished the Bulldogs name and reportedly helped ruin professional football in [[Ohio]] until the mid-1910s.

==Rivalry==
[[File:1906 Canton-Massillion Scandal Cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Cartoon promoting the now famous 1906 series between Massillon and Canton.]]

From 1905 until 1906, the Bulldogs and Tigers were arguably the best two teams in the country. Located just 15 miles apart in [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark County]], both teams were constantly fighting to recruit the best players in football. In fact the Bulldogs, or Canton Athletic Club as they were called at the time, formed their football team in 1905 with the sole objective of beating the Tigers, who had won every Ohio League championship since 1903.&lt;ref name="PFRA1"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Challenge From Canton | journal=Coffin Corner | publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association | pages=1–6 | url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Challenge_From_Canton.pdf | author=PFRA Research | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505011557/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Challenge_From_Canton.pdf | archivedate=May 5, 2012 | df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Both teams spent lavish amounts of money to bring in ringers from out-of-town. The very first Canton-Massillon game was played on November 30, 1905. The game was the season finale for both clubs. Up until that finale game, Massillon had [[1905 Massillon Tigers season|posted an 8–0 record]], while Canton [[1905 Canton Bulldogs season|posted an 8–1 record]], with only a 6–0 loss against the [[Latrobe Athletic Association]] from [[Pennsylvania]]. Massillon went on to win the game 14–4. The victory brought the Tigers the Ohio League championship for the third consecutive season.&lt;ref name="PFRA1"/&gt;

==1905–06 off-season==

===Financial charges===
In the off-season prior to the 1906 season, a news story in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' alleged that the Canton Athletic Club was financially broke and could not pay its players for the final game of 1905. The club denied the allegation and insisted that every dollar promised had indeed been delivered. Many Canton followers believed the story had originated in Massillon as a trick to discredit their team and make it tougher for Canton to recruit players for 1906. Massillon coach, [[E. J. Stewart|Ed Stewart]], who had newspaper connections, was believed by Canton to have planted the story. However, while Canton was in fact losing money in 1905, a group of area businessmen shouldered the losses.
&lt;ref name="PFRA2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Blondy Wallace and the Biggest Football Scandal Ever |journal=PFRA Annual |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |volume=5 |year=1984 |pages=1–16 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uzZ0BFPf?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |archivedate=December 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a counter-charge, Canton insisted that the Tigers were also deeply in debt. However, a statement by the Tigers showed $16,037.90 in receipts and only $16,015.65 in expenditures. The only problem with Massillon's figures was that they only listed salaries, including railroad fare, at $6,740.95, which means the players were getting only about $50 per game. However, it is believed, like with Canton, that Massillon's area boosters picked up whatever losses the Tigers incurred during 1905.&lt;ref name=booksgoogle&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCnbhSRZpgIC | title=Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football | first=Robert W. | last=Peterson | isbn=0-19-511913-4 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

===Recruitment===
For the 1906 season, Canton's coach Blondy Wallace signed the entire 1905 Massillon Tigers' [[backfield]] to play for Canton.&lt;ref name=xRfnvszlOF8C/&gt; While in Massillion, Ed Stewart was promoted from head coach to manager, replacing [[J.J. Wise]]. Meanwhile, [[Sherburn Wightman]], who played under [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]], while attending the [[University of Chicago]], was named the team's new coach.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

An earlier agreement between the two clubs called for each home team to receive 60 percent of the gate admission and reserved seating rights. However, Massillon disliked the deal because Canton would receive more money for the games, since their stadium was larger, and the game at Canton would be played in October, instead of the November weather to be seen in Massillon. This led the Tigers to ask that the game, to be held in Massillon, be played on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], when every football fan would attend regardless of the weather. However that October, Wallace traveled to [[Pennsylvania]] to recruit players for the upcoming game against Massillon. There he scheduled a Thanksgiving Day game against the Latrobe Athletic Association, who was the top team in Pennsylvania, and one of the toughest squads in the country. The Latrobe squad featured star [[quarterback]] [[John Brallier]], and dealt Canton a defeat in 1905.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

Finally, the teams agreed to play two games of football against other and share equally the gate receipts. Both games were to be played in November. The Canton home game was slated for Friday, November 16; while the Massillon home game come on Saturday, November 24, the weekend before Thanksgiving. However, many Tigers followers felt that the allegedly scheduled Canton-Latrobe game was only scam to get Massillon to agree to lesser terms. Therefore, language was added to the agreement that if Massillon did anything to disrupt the Canton-Latrobe game, they'd lose all of their gate money from their first game at Canton to the Bulldogs. The money from the November 16 was held in a Canton bank. To ensure that the Thanksgiving Day game between Latrobe and Canton was legitimate, the gate money from the second Bulldogs-Tigers was also kept on hold, this time at Merchants' National Bank, in Massillon. If the Canton-Latrobe game never occurred, then Massillon would be entitled to all of Canton's gate money from the second Canton-Massillon game. Each team was also required to put up a $3,000 bond, as insurance that each team would show on the game days.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

===Game 1===
{{details|1906 Canton Bulldogs season}}
{{details|1906 Massillon Tigers season}}

To prepare for their series against Massillon, Blondy Wallace took his team on the campus of [[Penn State University]] to conduct drills and practices. There Nittany Lions coach, [[Tom Fennell]], gave Canton, now officially called the "Bulldogs", special instructions in the use of the [[forward pass]]. The much anticipated first Canton-Massillon game was finally held at Canton's [[Mahaffey Park]]. It was the biggest football game yet in Ohio, even bigger than the clubs' 1905 game. The [[Bell Telephone Company]] even had men stationed in the grounds observing. As fast as a play was made, it was telegraphed to every major city in the United States.&lt;ref name=seanlahman&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean|last=Lahmen|title=Canton vs. Massillon, 1906|work=In Lahmen's Terms|url=http://seanlahman.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first game went to Canton by a score of 10–5.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

Big games, like these, always brought out theories of a fix. However, Massillon's Ed Stewart stated that it would be impossible to fix the coming game, stating that an entire team, not just certain players would have to be involved. [[Big Bill Edwards|"Big Bill" Edwards]], a former player from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] officiated the game, and kept both teams in check. 

However things became more heated for second game. The Tigers vowed to defeat Canton with their same roster from November 16, while Bell Telephone again announced it would telegraph a play-by-play account of the second game. The only roster change occurred when the Bulldogs signed [[Eddie Wood]], a regular [[End (American football)|end]] from the Latrobe Athletic Association, to play in the rematch for an injured player named Gilchrist. Meanwhile, Stewart announced that "Big Bill" Edwards would be unavailable to referee because he'd be officiating that year's [[The Game (Harvard-Yale)|Yale-Harvard game]]. Edward Whiting of [[Cornell University]], who'd umpired the first game at Canton, agreed bring a replacement referee with him.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=seanlahman/&gt;

Prior to the start of the game, a disagreement over which ball to use occurred. Massillon showed up with a ball, several ounces lighter than the [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] brand ball Canton was used to. Blondy Wallace protested that ball made by Spalding was the norm, however, Massillon was adamant about keeping the lighter ball, which was provided to the Tigers by Ed Stewart. Wallace's protest fell on deaf ears, and was told by game's officials that he could either accept the lighter ball or forfeit both the game and the $3,000 guarantee. Historians believe that reason for Massillon's insistence for lighter ball was to help their kicking game. The Bulldogs, coming off of their 10–5 win a week ago, was favored to win the game. However, Massillon outplayed Canton and won the rematch 13–6 and was named the Ohio League's 1906 champions for the fourth straight year.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=xRfnvszlOF8C/&gt;&lt;ref name=seanlahman/&gt;

==Scandal==
Once the game was over, Canton's coach, Blondy Wallace, in a show of sportsmanship, joined the Massillon celebration and congratulated the Tigers on their championship. However, the evening after the second game at the Courtland Hotel Bar, a brawl erupted among several of the Canton players and fans over allegations that the game had been fixed.&lt;ref name=seanlahman/&gt; [[Jack Cusack]], who would become the owner and manager of the Canton Bulldogs from 1912 until 1915, wrote in his book ''Pioneer in Pro Football'' that the fight was started by Cusack's neighbor, Victor Kaufmann, a physician who suffered heavy betting losses on the disputed contest. Cusack stated that he went with Kaufmann to the Courtland Hotel Bar, where Kaufman loudly made allegations of a fix. A large bar fight started in the hotel's bar area and quickly spread onto the street. Police were then called to break-up the disturbance, but Cusack and Kaufmann reportedly avoided arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jack |last=Cusack |title=Pioneer in Pro Football |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/09-An-320.pdf |work=Professional Football Researchers Association |number=8 |year=1987 |accessdate=February 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311103506/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/09-An-320.pdf |archivedate=March 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Massillon's Ed Stewart, through his newspaper ''Massillon Independent'', charged that an actual attempt was made to bribe some of the Tiger players into throwing the game and that Blondy Wallace had been involved.&lt;ref name=seanlahman/&gt; One story suggested that Canton players had bet large amounts of money on themselves to win, while approaching the Massillon players and asking them to throw the game in exchange for a share of Canton's winnings.

Some Canton followers then wondered if Wallace threw the game to Massillon in order to collect on some of the game's wagers. At first the play-calling strategy of Wallace was the focus of suspicion, but as the scandal grew, a number of contradictory allegations came out.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt; Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to ruin the club's reputation before their final game against the Latrobe Athletic Association on Thanksgiving Day. Canton's counter-charge was that the scandal was designed by the Tigers to cripple the Bulldogs financially by destroying the gate revenue for the Latrobe game. Massillon could not prove the charge, however, the stands were almost empty for the Thanksgiving Day Latrobe-Canton game, leaving Canton unable to pay their players.&lt;ref name=xRfnvszlOF8C&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRfnvszlOF8C | title=Outside the Lines | first=Charles K. | last=Ross | isbn=0-8147-7496-2 | publisher=[[NYU Press]] | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inaccuracies and outcomes==

===Harry March===
In 1934 ''[[Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs]]'', a historically inaccurate book documenting early professional football, was published. The book documented the scandal and was used by sports historians for the next 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848634,00.html | work=Time | title=Sport: Football, Oct. 12, 1936 | date=October 12, 1936 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of this book was [[Harry March|Dr. Harry A. March]] was a former player at [[Mount Union College]], an executive for the [[New York Giants]] from 1925 to 1936 and later an organizer of the second [[American Football League (1936)|American Football League]]. However, March also practiced medicine in Canton in 1906 and was named one of the Bulldogs team doctors.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pro&gt;"Pro Football, Its Ups and Downs" Harry March, J. B. Lyon Company, Albany, NY 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the incident, March stated that Wallace persuaded an unnamed Canton player to deliberately throw the game. When accused by his teammates, this player said he had simply obeyed orders. The player then quickly left town, on the first available train, while still in his uniform. The [[Professional Football Researchers Association]] has identified this player, as Eddie Wood of Latrobe. March gave the impression that he was running for his life from angry fans and teammates. However, even before the second Canton-Massillon game began, it was announced that Wood would be on the first train back to Latrobe, once the game ended. Not to mention that when Wood returned on the following Thursday with the Latrobe team, he was not attacked by the fans or his ex-Canton teammates. Also Wood scored the Bulldogs only score of the game. As for following Wallace's orders, Wood often crashed the middle of the field on defense, allowing the Tigers to escape outside. However, Massillon was historically known for running up the middle of field.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

===Ed Stewart===
Massillon manager Ed Stewart never stated that which Canton-Massillon game was fixed. Instead his accusation was that an attempt had been made to bribe some Massillion players before the first game. According to Stewart, Massillon players, [[Tiny Maxwell]] and [[Bob Shiring]] had been solicited to throw the first game by [[Walter East]], a [[baseball]] player-turned end, who claimed to be backed by $50,000. Maxwell and Shiring then reported the offer to Tigers' coach Sherburn Wightman and the scandal ended before it began. East was then released by the Tigers. Only then was Wallace named by Stewart of being East's accomplice.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

===Walter East and Sherburn Wightman===
When East returned to [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], he accused the Tiger's coach Sherburn Wightman of masterminding the scandal. According to East, Wightman had first asked him to solicit Maxwell and Shiring and have them throw the game, he then had East find a backer who would pay Wightman $4,000. However Wightman backed out of the deal at the last minute. He later went on to add that no member of the Bulldogs or their backers, as far as he knew, were connected with the deal. He finally stated that the only reason that Stewart went public on scandal was to ruin the attendance for the Canton-Latrobe game. East then gave the ''[[Akron Beacon-Journal]]'' a copy of a contract in which Wightman agreed to have the first Canton-Massillon game thrown for $4,000. The contract was signed by East, Wightman and John T. Windsor, one of the owners of East's Akron baseball team.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt; It should also be noted that East, boasted of fixing a college football game, as well as a baseball game in 1905. Meanwhile, Windsor admitted to his part in the scheme, backing up East's story. He said that he never even met Wallace.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

In an interview to ''The Plain Dealer'', Wightman stated that the contract signed by himself, East and Windsor was done in accordance with instruction from Ed Stewart and the backers of the Massillon team. He stated that he reported East's scheme to Stewart, and was told to go along with deal to see which Massillon players would agree to throwing the game and then remove them from the team. He then stated that he kept up the act until he had the signatures of East and Windsor down on paper. Only then was East released from the team. Stewart defended the coach, agreeing that Wightman had entered into the contract with East and Windsor at the behest of the Tiger backers in order to get the goods on the fixers.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

Back in Akron, Walter East was seen as being the hapless victim of a crooked team. He was retained as manager of the Akron baseball team for the 1907 season. However, he was later fired after the team began losing.

===Blondy Wallace===
[[File:1906 canton bulldogs team.jpg|right|300px|thumb|1906 Canton Bulldogs: (Back L-R) Jack Ernst, [[Clark Schrontz]], Tom Thorpe, Dave Cure, [[Blondy Wallace]], Ed Murphy, [[Dan Policowski|"Bullet" Riley]] and Townsend (Front L-R) Sheldon, [[Jack Lang (American football)|Jack Lang]], Reemsnyder, [[Vince Stevenson]], [[Lynn Sweet (American football)|"Pop" Sweet]] and [[Paul Steinberg]].]]

The scandal caused Wallace to file a [[libel]] lawsuit against Stewart and the ''Massillon Independent'' for $25,000, with Wallace claiming that his good name and professional credit have been ruined due to the paper's story. However, his libel suit never came to trial, and it is believed that he may have settled the case out of court. By this time, Wallace was too deep in debt to turn down any reasonable cash offer. He later became a [[rum-running|bootlegger]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] and was, for a time, under federal indictment. As for the scandal, the lack of a trial left the details of the events still disputed by historians and football fans alike. Because Wallace possibly settled out of court, there was no real conclusion to the fix scandal—just charges and countercharges.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt; Due to Harry March's book, Wallace was seen as being responsible for the scandal for the next 70 years.

===The Bulldogs===
The Bulldogs defeated Latrobe 16–0 in front of their smallest crowd in years, 1,200 fans. Canton blamed the scandal for the small crowd, however, some believe that once the Bulldogs lost to Massillon, many fans lost interest in football. Therefore, regardless of a scandal, the game's attendance still would have fallen well below expectations. Canton players were not paid as a result, in addition. To help pay for the Latrobe team's expenses an effort was established in Latrobe, which raised part of the team's $300 expense debt, and the balance of the money was borrowed by the YMCA so that it could be paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Latrobe, PA: Cradle of Pro Football |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |volume=2 |issue=Annual |year=1980 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-An-052.pdf |first=Robert |last=Van Atta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326165729/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-An-052.pdf |archivedate=March 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Tigers traveled to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to beat the "All-Western" team. The attendance for that game was a mere 2,000 spectators.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt;

The timing of the betting scandal being made public damaged Canton far more than Massillon. Many allegations stated that Canton threw the second game of series, however, if the story had broken after Massillon's earlier loss to Canton, the Tigers would have been more damaged. However, the scandal engulfed both teams and forced them to fold. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had indeed thrown the game, it so tarnished Canton's name that virtually no one attended the Latrobe game. The Bulldogs, including Wallace, were now broke. A story by the ''Pittsburgh Post'' estimated that team still owed its players $6,000 for the 1906 season. A benefit game between Massillon and Canton to help pay the Bulldog players only drew 500 fans and resulted in a 5–5 tie.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt; The proceeds from the game was only enough to get the remaining Canton players a train ticket home.

===The Tigers===
The Tigers were also financially broke. However, the team still had enough money to pay its players. The [[1907 All-Massillons season|Massillon-area fielded a team of locals in 1907]]. The "All-Massillons" under Sherburn Wightman went on to win the 1907 Ohio league championship. Wightman and Stewart were still held in high regard in Massillon.&lt;ref name="Glamourless"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glamourless Gridirons: 1907–09 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1–5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Glamourless_Gridirons.pdf |author=PFRA Research |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326054129/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Glamourless_Gridirons.pdf |archivedate=March 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on Ohio pro-football==
The scandal was thought to have ruined professional football in Ohio until the mid 1910s. However, the argument can be made that the expense of placing all-star teams on the field each week, also put a hamper on the sport. The ''Canton Morning News'' put a $20,000 price tag on the Massillon Tigers 1906 team, while many speculate that the cost of the Bulldogs probably even higher. Still others contend that the games involving top teams like Canton and Massilon were too one-sided and lacked excitement. Many towns in Ohio still fielded clubs over the next several years, and these new pros were consisted more of hometown talent, with only the occasional ringer.&lt;ref name="PFRA2"/&gt; [[Peggy Parratt]], Massillon's quarterback, stayed in Massillon for the [[1907 All-Massillons season|1907 season]], but he then began moving from team to team in the region, racking up Ohio League titles on a nearly annual basis. A second incarnation of the Bulldogs would be established in [[1911 Canton Bulldogs season|1911]] and would later go to win [[List of NFL champions|two championships]] in the [[National Football League]]. The diminished stature of Ohio pro football led to other areas of the country building top professional teams, including the [[Washington Vigilants]].&lt;ref name="Glamourless"/&gt;

Fulham won.&lt;ref name=DC9&gt;Waghorn, ''Dawn of Cricket'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a return at [[Parsons Green]] on Tuesday, 10 August 1731, which Fulham won by 3 [[run (cricket)|runs]].&lt;ref name=DC9/&gt; On Tuesday, 26 June 1733, Fulham again hosted Chelsea at Parsons Green, this time for 30 guineas, but the result of this match is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, ''FL18C'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday, 16 August 1736, there was an inter-county match on the common between [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]]. The stake was 50 guineas and Middlesex won by 9 runs.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, ''FL18C'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The last match found in the records was on Thursday, 10 and Friday, 11 September 1789 when Chelsea played [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) in Marlborough Gardens, Chelsea. This match, which was of dubious status, was probably drawn after a postponement.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, ''FLPVC'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Euler''' (ISU Abbreviation 'Eu') is an edge jump in [[figure skating]] derived from the [[loop jump]]. It is launched from the back outside edge and is landed on the opposite foot and edge. It has also been known as the ''Half Loop'' or ''Thoren'' jump after [[Per Thorén]]. Eulers are usually used to link other jumps in a jump combination, such as 'Axel + Euler + Salchow'.

The Euler jump was known as the 'Half Loop' jump in [[International Skating Union]] regulations prior to the 2018/19 season where the name was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isu.org/docman-documents-links/isu-files/documents-communications/isu-communications/17142-isu-communication-2168/file|title=SINGLE &amp; PAIR SKATING : Scale of Values, Levels of Difficulty and Guidelines for marking Grade of Execution, season 2018/19|website=Isu.org|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29165">The '''[[FIDE Women's Grand Prix]] 2013–14''' is a series of six [[chess]] tournaments exclusively for women, which formed part of the qualification cycle for the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2015]]. The winner of the Grand Prix was decided in the last stage in Sharjah, UAE, when rating favorite and reigning world champion [[Hou Yifan]] overtook second seeded [[Koneru Humpy]] to win her third straight Grand Prix cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.chessbase.com/post/sharjah-09-ju-wenjun-leads-hou-yifan-wins-gp&lt;/ref&gt; For the third time running, Koneru Humpy finished runner-up to Hou Yifan.

With the overall win Hou Yifan earned the right to play the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2016]] in a ten-game match.

==Format==
Eighteen women players were to be selected to compete in these tournaments. Each player agrees and will contract to participate in exactly four of these tournaments.  Players must rank their preference of tournaments once the final list of host cities is announced and the dates are allocated to each host city.

Each tournament is a 12-player, single [[round-robin tournament]]. In each round players scored 1 point for a win, ½ point for a [[draw (chess)|draw]] and 0 for a loss. Grand prix points were then allocated according to each player's standing in the tournament: 160 grand prix points for first place, 130 for second place, 110 for third place, and then 90 down to 10 points by steps of 10. In case of a tie in points the grand prix points are shared evenly by the tied players.
Players only counted their best three tournament results. The player with the most grand prix points is the winner.

# Fourth result not already taken in the top three results.
# Number of actual game result points scored in the four tournaments.
# Number of first places (in case of a tie – points given accordingly).
# Number of second places (in case of a tie – points given accordingly).
# Number of wins.
# Drawing of lots.

==Schedule==
The fifth stage was moved from Tiblisi to Lopota.&lt;ref&gt;http://chess-news.ru/en/node/15386&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth stage was moved from [[Erdenet]], Mongolia to Sharjah, UAE, the world's largest chess club.

'''Globe International Ltd.''' is a global producer and distributor specialising in purpose-built apparel, footwear and skateboard hardgoods (decks, wheels, trucks, etc.) brands for the boardsports, street fashion and workwear markets. The company was founded in 1985 by three Australian brothers. Globe International's core business is divided between proprietary brands, licensed brands and distributed brands, and its products are sold in more than 100 countries worldwide. The company's international offices are located in [[Melbourne]], Los Angeles, San Diego, Hossegor, London, Sydney, the Gold Coast, Australia and [[Shenzhen]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.globecorporate.com/index.html|website=Globe International|publisher=Globe International Ltd|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globe International Annual Report 2017|date=22 September 2017|publisher=Globe International Ltd|location=Melbourne|page=25|url=https://www.globecorporate.com/pdfs/Globe_International_Annual_Report_2017.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is listed on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] and operates in the following three segments: Australasia, North and South America and Europe.

== History ==

The foundation of Globe International was established in the 1980s, with the founding of Hardcore Enterprises, an Australian-based company specialising in products that appealed to the skateboard and street fashion markets. In 1985, former Australian skateboarding champions [[Peter Hill (entrepreneur)|Peter]] and [[Stephen Hill (Skateboard and Streetwear Entrepreneur)|Stephen Hill]], along with brother and current Globe International CEO [[Matt Hill (CEO)|Matt Hill]], began Hardcore which would later develop into one of the world's largest skateboard distribution companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skateboarding.com.au/downunder/brands/globe-shoes/|title=Globe Shoes|publisher=Skateboarding.com.au|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hills cited that they were unsatisfied with the lack of quality skate products they required, and thus they went into business to import US skate products to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aussie Rules Skateboarding|url=http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000012155/news/aussie-rules-skateboarding/|publisher=Transworld Skateboarding|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=14 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hills continued to promote skateboarding, writing two books on the subject&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The skateboard book : blast! / [Peter Hill, Stephen Hill]|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2368209|work=Catalogue|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=14 August 2012|author=National Library of Australia|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skate hard / [Peter Hill and Stephen Hill]|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1942098|work=Catalogue|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=14 August 2012|author=National Library of Australia|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and producing skate videos. Through constant promotions, tours, contests, video and magazine advertising, Hardcore became a driving force behind the skateboarding explosion during the mid-1980s in Australia and New Zealand. The first diversification company "Die Hard Pty Ltd" was founded in 1987 as a clothing and accessories division of the business. Die Hard's first licensed label was [[Vision Street Wear|Vision Streetwear]].

Die Hard went on to produce premier labels under license for the Australian and New Zealand markets such as [[Stüssy]], [[Mossimo]], [[Freshjive]], [[Paul Frank Industries|Paul Frank]], [[Eckō Unltd.]], Counter Culture, Split, Girl Star, Undergirl and [[World Industries]]. The Hills also co-founded the [[streetwear]] brand [[MOOKS clothing company|Mooks]] which also operated under the Die Hard umbrella.  Die Hard became known as Globe International's Streetwear Division and was one of the largest suppliers of branded youth clothing in Australia and New Zealand when it was sold to [[Pacific Brands]] in 2006.

In 1995, Globe International established its US operation in Los Angeles, where the Globe brand is now a part of the American [[boardsport]]s sub-culture and a key supplier to major retailers of boardsports apparel, footwear and skateboard hardgoods.

In 2001, Globe International listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and achieved the Initial Public Offer goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.transworld.net/4344/uncategorized/globe-shoes-goes-public-in-australia/ "Globe Shoes Goes Public in Australia" 25-May-2001,  ''Transworld Business'', retrieved 2-Nov-2011 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Globe hits the boards with a cool 52% jump|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=25 May 2001|author=Mark Todd|location=Australia|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Globe International acquired Kubic Marketing, a holding company that owned World Industries and [[Dwindle Distribution]], which at the time, was the parent company for skateboard brands such as [[Enjoi]], [[Blind Skateboards|Blind]], Darkstar and [[Tensor Trucks|Tensor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.transworld.net/4568/uncategorized/globe-buys-kubic/ "Globe Buys Kubic" 5-Jul-2002,''Transworld Business'', retrieved 2-Nov-2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Acquiring Dwindle, a company founded by professional skateboarders [[Rodney Mullen]] and Steve Rocco, made Globe International one of the world's biggest skateboard companies. In 2003, Globe International established its European headquarters, located along the south-west surf coast of France in Hossegor.  As of 2017, the European office sells directly in the major boardsports markets of the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Netherlands, and Austria, among others. All other significant markets in Europe are serviced by third-party distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Globe International|title=Investor presentation|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150821/pdf/430pl15kq6n7jj.pdf|website=ASX|publisher=Australian Securities Exchange|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having established a stable of proprietary brands and an international distribution network in 2006, Globe International made a strategic decision to divest itself of its licensed Australian Streetwear Division to Pacific Brands and focus on further international expansion of the company's proprietary brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Balanced approach pays off for Globe International|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/balanced-approach-pays-off-for-globe-international/story-e6frg8zx-1225946353284|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=The Australian|date=2 November 2010|author=Blair Speedy|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Globe International added to its brand portfolio by acquiring Europe's number one skateboard brand Cliché and expanding it through international markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DWINDLE DISTRIBUTION ACQUIRES CLICHÉ SKATEBOARDS|url=http://business.transworld.net/18159/news/dwindle-distribution-acquires-cliche-skateboards/|work=Transworld Business|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=25 May 2013|author=Transworld|date=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Globe International re-entered the Australian streetwear market and established a new division entitled "4Front Distribution", a company that is currently responsible for the Australian distribution of brands such as Stüssy, Obey and Misfit. Globe also moved its Melbourne headquarters to the inner-city suburb of [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]] during the same year, occupying a building that was formerly owned by chocolate company [[Cadbury's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globe International Headquarters|url=http://www.australiandesignreview.com/interiors/2183-globe-international-headquarters|work=Australian Design Review|publisher=Niche Media|accessdate=25 May 2013|author=Domingo Antonio Robledo|author2=Stu Morley|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globe operates its own factory to manufacture the skateboards and trucks that it distributes under Globe and Dwindle. The DSM (Douglas Street Manufacturing) Premium Woodshop is located in Shenzhen, China, with skateboard icon Rodney Mullen closely involved in its production practices from its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DSM Video|url=http://vimeo.com/42739299|work=30shot on Vimeo|publisher=Vimeo LLC|accessdate=19 September 2013|author=30shot|format=Video upload|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSM imports maple logs from Canada's Great Lakes region for the production of its decks. A 2013 ''TransWorld SKATEboarding'' article likened DSM's approach to the sourcing and treatment of wood; "as the sandwich shop that prepares all of their meat from the whole animal versus others who order their cuts from a wholesaler. DSM has the in-house butcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tested Development|journal=TransWorld SKATEboarding|date=November 2013|volume=31|issue=11|pages=84–97|url=http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000186182/photos/inside-issue-november-2013-product-issue/|author=Luke Callahan|publisher=Grind Media, LLC|issn=0748-7401}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSM was first publicly announced in 2003 and caused a widespread surprised reaction in the skateboard industry, as production had previously been solely based in North America and concern was raised about job losses. Globe CEO Matt Hill, stated at the time: "When you get down to the labor issues, if we sell a lot more boards, then we’ll create jobs here (in the U.S.A.), it’ll open a lot more doors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dwindle Makes Moves|url=http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000013006/news/dwindle-makes-moves/|work=TransWorld Skateboarding|publisher=GrindMedia|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=27 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the company launched a book 'Unemployable: 30 Years of Hardcore, Skate and Street'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jason Boulter|title=Unemployable: 30 Years of Hardcore, Skate and Street|date=December 2015|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Australia Pty Ltd|location=Port Melbourne|isbn=9780500500637|pages=708|url=http://www.thameshudson.com.au/item_details.php?id=19797|accessdate=9 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216154216/http://www.thameshudson.com.au/item_details.php?id=19797|archivedate=16 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate its 30th anniversary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Blanche Clark|title=Globe International: Melbourne’s Hill brothers turn love of skateboarding into $150m empire|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/globe-international-melbournes-hill-brothers-turn-love-of-skateboarding-into-150m-empire/news-story/a2460a87bba92d32fd194216397cece6?nk=42ed5a31fe506d72e0b8bb6b62b10c43-1454975923|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=Herald Sun|publisher=Herald and Weekly Times|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet The Brothers Behind Globe, Australia's Most Iconic Skate/Surf Brand|url=http://www.oystermag.com/meet-the-brothers-behind-globe-australias-most-iconic-skatesurf-brand|website=Oyster Magazine|publisher=Inception Digital Pty Ltd|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Eloise Mahoney|title=Unemployable: the story of skating success|url=http://desktopmag.com.au/features/unemployable-the-story-of-skating-success/|website=Desktop Magazine|publisher=Niche Media Pty Ltd|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held launches in Melbourne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robert Brown|title=Interview: Rodney Mullen on being unemployable|url=https://www.acclaimmag.com/culture/interview-rodney-mullen-on-being-unemployable/|website=ACCLAIM|publisher=ACCLAIM Magazine Pty Ltd|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joe Hammeke|title="Unemployable" Book Release Party Photos|url=http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/trash/unemployable-book-release-party-photos/|website=Thrasher Magazine|publisher=High Speed Productions, Inc|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jan Kliewer|title=Chris Haslam on the Launch of Globe's UnEmployable Book|url=https://kingpinmag.com/news/new-skateboard-products/chris-haslam-on-launch-of-globes-unemployable-book.html|website=Kingpin Skateboarding|publisher=Factory Media|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the company acquired the American brand, Salty Crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Simon Evans|title=Solomon Lew along for ride as Globe buys 50 per cent of Salty Crew|url=http://www.afr.com/business/retail/clothing-and-accessories/solomon-lew-along-for-ride-as-globe-buys-50-per-cent-of-salty-crew-20170228-guno1g|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=Australian Financial Review|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the company operates a number of branded "Globe" retail stores in four Australian locations: [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], Melbourne, Victoria; [[Torquay, Victoria]]; [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], [[Bondi Beach, Sydney]], two stores in Hossegor, France&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|url=http://www.globe.tv/aus/contact/|work=Globe.tv|publisher=Globe International Limited|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055005/http://www.globe.tv/aus/contact/|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and single stores in Hong Kong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Drew Pulig|title=Skate Legend Rodney Mullen Helps Launch Globe’s Hong Kong Flagship Store.

The company has produced numerous films and short films, incorporating both skateboarding and surfing subcultures. Between 2007 and 2010, the brand released a series of six short films entitled ''United By Fate'', directed by Joe "Joe G" Guglielmino,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globe – United By Fate|url=http://www.skatevideosite.com/skatevideos/globe-united-by-fate/video-parts|work=Skatevideosite.com|publisher=Skatevideosite.com|accessdate=18 May 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featuring all of the skate team members during that period. The inaugural episode of ''United By Fate'' featured Canadian skateboarder Paul Machnau, while the final instalment was a compilation of footage from different team members, such as Jake Duncombe, Louis Lopez and [[Chris Haslam (skateboarder)|Chris Haslam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globe – United By Fate|url=http://www.skatevideosite.com/skatevideos/globe-united-by-fate/soundtrack|work=Skatevideosite.com|publisher=Skatevideosite.com|accessdate=18 May 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:hardcourt tennis court curtiss park saline michigan.JPG|thumb|Tennis hardcourt, Curtiss Park, [[Saline, Michigan]]]]
A '''hardcourt''' (or '''hard court''') is a surface or floor on which a [[sport]] is played, most usually in reference to [[tennis court]]s. They are typically made of rigid materials such as [[asphalt]] or [[concrete]], and covered with acrylic material to seal the surface and mark the playing lines, while providing some cushioning.&lt;ref name=ByAPT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsbyapt.com/types-tennis-courts/ |title=Types of Tennis Courts  |publisher=Advanced Polymer Technology |date=October 22, 2012 |website=SportsByAPT |access-date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ertheo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ertheo.com/blog/en/type-tennis-courts/ |title=What type of tennis courts are there and how do they influence the tennis player’s game? |publisher=Ertheo |date=July 17, 2017 |website=ertheo.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote="...about cushioning..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, hardwood surfaces were also in use in indoor settings, similar to an indoor [[basketball court]], but these surfaces are rare now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/09/18/wta-finals-singapore-courts |title=WTA Finals in Singapore are played on unique wooden hard court surface |last=Newcomb |first=Tim |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=September 18, 2015 |website=si.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote=Possible wood comeback?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis==
Tennis hard courts are made of synthetic/acrylic layers on top of a concrete or asphalt foundation and can vary in color. These courts tend to play medium-fast to fast because there is little energy absorption by the court, like in [[grass court]]s.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |last=Murray |first=Judy |date= |title=Hard courts take centre stage at the Australian Open and the US Open. |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/skills/5274588.stm |website=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC Sports |access-date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball tends to bounce high and players are able to apply many types of spin during play. Flat balls are favored on hard courts because of the extremely quick play style. Speed of rebound after tennis balls bounce on hard courts is determined by how much sand is in the synthetic/acrylic layer placed on top of the asphalt foundation. More sand will result in a slower bounce due to more friction.&lt;ref name=CoachUp&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.coachup.com/nation/articles/different-types-of-tennis-courts |title=Different Types of Tennis Courts |publisher=CoachUp, Inc. |date=August 1, 2016 |website=CoachUp.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote="about sand in court to slow it down"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/08/21/how-us-open-makes-courts-colors-science |title=The science behind creating the U.S. Open courts and signature colors |last=Newcomb |first=Tim |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=August 21, 2015 |website=si.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote="...layered...cushioned..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[Australian Open]] currently use hard courts and it is the predominant surface type used on the professional tour.&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web |url=http://livehealthy.chron.com/comparison-tennis-court-surfaces-4144.html |title=Comparison of Tennis Court Surfaces |last=Reason |first=Leigh |publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]] |date=April 30, 2005 |website=LiveHealthy.chron.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote="...Majors on Hardcourt..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OTI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinetennisinstruction.com/tenniscourtsurface.html |title=Tennis Court Surface: Pros And Cons Of The Different Surfaces |publisher="Florian Meier &amp; Partner GbR" |website=OnlineTennisInstruction.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote="...In the United States Tennis is played primarily on hard courts...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance===
There are numerous hardcourt maintenance methods which are commonly used to keep these facilities in top condition. Some of these include brushing, pressure washing with a cleaning solution and applying chemical treatments to prevent the growth of moss and algae. Anti-slip paint is also applied to hardcourts to give better playing qualities which enhance player safety and performance.&lt;ref name=10s&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10-s.com/Your-New-Court/Choosing-a-Tennis-Surface |title=Choosing a Tennis Surface |publisher=10-S Tennis Supply |website=10-s.com |access-date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johnny Unitas Stadium''' at '''Minnegan Field''' is a multi-purpose sports [[stadium]] in [[Towson, Maryland]], United States.

==History==
The stadium opened in 1978 as Towson Stadium when the Towson Tigers were in their 9th year of collegiate play and their final year of Division III. The new, lighted facility had 5,000 seats. The name of the stadium was changed to Minnegan Stadium in 1983 to honor former Towson coach and athletic director [[Donald Minnegan|Donald "Doc" Minnegan]].

The sports complex began a $32 million renovation beginning in 1999. The renovations, which were completed in 2002, added 6,000 seats, artificial turf, an entry-level plaza, concession stands, new restrooms, ticket booths, a four-tier press box, a field house, and a promenade that connects the northside and southside seating areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://towsontigers.com/sports/2014/7/14/unitasstadium.aspx|title=Towson University Athletics - Johnny Unitas® Stadium|website=Towsontigers.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is named for the [[Baltimore Colts]]' [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[quarterback]] [[Johnny Unitas]], who had taken a job trying to find a corporate sponsor for the stadium with Towson University weeks before his death in 2002.  In fact, Unitas threw his last public pass at the re-opening of the facility (as Towson Stadium) just a few days before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towsontigers.com/johnnyu/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824203946/http://www.towsontigers.com/johnnyu/index.asp |archivedate=2007-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His widow, Sandy, felt it appropriate to honor him by having the stadium named for him instead, with fund-raising in his name taking the place of the money that a corporate naming would have supplied.

In 2008, the Unitas Stadium [[scoreboard]] was replaced with a 16:9 full video scoreboard. The new scoreboard stands where the previous scoreboard was placed. The old incandescent light scoreboard was recycled and a new smaller LED scoreboard was installed in the opposite endzone.

In May 2012, new "Fieldturf Revolution" was installed in the Stadium.

==Tenants==
[[File:UnitasStadiumScoreboard.JPG|thumb|right|200px|New Unitas Stadium Scoreboard]]
It is the home field for the Towson Football, Men's &amp; Women's Lacrosse, and the Women's Track and Field team. The annual Fall Pep Rally is held at the stadium.

In addition to Towson events, the stadium has also been used for high school football and lacrosse events, the Under 19 World Lacrosse Championship, Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association Lacrosse Championships, several [[NCAA Division I]] Women's Lacrosse Championships as well as competition in the [[NCAA Division I]] Men's Lacrosse Championships.

The [[Washington Bayhawks|Baltimore Bayhawks]] of [[Major League Lacrosse]] used Johnny Unitas Stadium as their home stadium from 2004 to 2006.

The 2008 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Final Four and Championship were held in Johnny Unitas Stadium, where [[Northwestern University]] defeated the [[University of Pennsylvania]] 10-6, giving the Wildcats their fourth NCAA title in a row in the sport.

The 2009 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Final Four and Championship were held in Johnny Unitas Stadium where [[Northwestern University]] defeated [[University of North Carolina]] 21-7. This was the Wildcats fifth title in a row in Women's Lacrosse.

The 2010 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Final Four and Championship were held in Johnny Unitas Stadium where [[University of Maryland]] defeated [[Northwestern University]] 13-11. This was the Terps 10th NCAA title in Women's Lacrosse.

The Under Armour All-American Lacrosse Game for High School Athletes has been played at Unitas since 2006, its inaugural year.

==Field house==
On April 26, 2003 the final renovations to the stadium were completed with the construction of the four-story, {{convert|48000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} field house located in the stadium's west end zone area. The field house features offices, meeting rooms, locker rooms, class rooms, a film editing room an athlete learning center, an athletic training room and an equipment room. The rooftop patio treat guests to a view of athletic contests.

===The Minnegan Room===
The Minnegan room on the third floor of the field house is named after longtime faculty member, athletic director and coach [[Donald Minnegan|"Doc" Minnegan]]. It is a multipurpose room that has a top view of the action on the field as well as the stadium. The Minnegan room can accommodate up to 200 guests.

===Ford-Vetter Athletic Sports Medicine Facility===
This is an area that serves the student-athletes' medical needs. This {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility includes separate taping, treatment, rehabilitation, and hydrotherapy areas.

The '''Stadium Ladhof''' is a stadium in [[Colmar]] France particularly known for hosting the matches of Football Club of Colmar (known for a time as [[:fr:Football Club de Colmar|Colmar Stadium 77]]) until [[1986 in association football|1986]].  It is currently used by the Portuguese FC and FC Colmar Spaniards, two regional amateur clubs.

The stadium has a capacity of &lt;span&gt;1,500 &lt;/span&gt;seats, including 240 seats in the assises.

It is located on 2 Ladhof Street, [[Colmar]].  It should not be confused with [[Francs Stadium|Francs stadium]] or  the [[:fr:Colmar Stadium|Colmar Stadium]], the other two main stadiums in the city.

==  History  ==
The stadium was inaugurated on 21 September 1947. From that date, it hosts the home games of FC Colmar, becoming [[:fr:Football Club de Colmar|Colmar Stadium 77]] in [[1977 in association football|1977]]. There will be played encounters of [[:fr:Championnat de France amateur de football (1948-1971)|CFA]] in 1948-1949, of [[:fr:Championnat de France de football de Division 3 (1971-1993)|Division 3]] soccar in 1978-1979, and [[:fr:Championnat de France de football de Division 4|Division 4]] soccar in 1979-1980.

On 26 December 1964 FC Colmar played [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|FC Sochaux]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;in at Ladhof Stadium.

After the dissolution of Colmar Stadium 77 in [[1986 in association football|1986]], the stadium was occupied by small amateur clubs in Colmar.

The term "'''last-minute goal'''" is used in sport, primarily [[association football]], to describe a [[Goal (sport)|goal]] scored very late in a game, usually one that affects the outcome of the game. The definition of a "last-minute goal" commonly used is one scored either in the final or penultimate minute of regulation time or [[extra time]], or during [[stoppage time]] or [[injury time]].

Last-minute goals are often noteworthy if it allows the scoring team to either take the lead or to equalise. For example, in the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final]], which [[Spain national football team|Spain]] won 4–0 the last goal was scored in the 88th minute, or the [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|Brazilian 7-1 defeat to Germany]], in which Brazil scored the last goal in the 90th minute, but it was irrelevant to the final outcome of the match. 

The "[[golden goal]]", briefly used to decide extra time in some tournaments, is not usually considered a last-minute goal, unless they were scored late into extra time. Penalties scored in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|shootout]] are not considered last-minute goals.

==Notable last-minute goals==

This list of last-minute goals includes notable goals from higher levels of national or international football among major tournaments and qualifying matches.

===Continental cup competition===
Only matches in the semi-finals and final of European club competitions that changed the outcome of the tie.
* '''[[1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]] – [[Real Zaragoza]] vs. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], 10 May 1995''': In the final minute of [[Overtime (association football)|extra time]] (timed at 119:16), with the match heading to penalties, a 40-yard shot from Real Zaragoza's [[Nayim]] cleared Arsenal goalkeeper [[David Seaman]], winning the cup for Zaragoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiYt3iNWau0|title=Nayim Long Game Winning Goal ZARAGOZA VS ARSENAL 1995|date=20 January 2007|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]]''' (and '''[[The Treble]]''') – '''[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] vs. [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], 26 May 1999''': United scored two last-minute goals against Bayern to clinch the trophy and the Treble. Bayern led 1–0 going into injury time, but goals from [[Teddy Sheringham]] and [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] turned the game on its head assisted by [[David Beckham]]'s two corners and won the match for United. The goals, timed at 90'+0:36 and 90'+2:17, came so late that the trophy already had Bayern ribbons attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/353842.stm|title=United crowned kings of Europe|date=26 May 1999|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2005/matches/round=2212/match=84043/index.html 6 April], Middlesbrough began its second leg trailing 2–0 on aggregate and a vital goal from [[FC Basel|Basel]] made it 3–0 on aggregate. [[Mark Viduka]] scored twice and [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]] once to level the series on aggregate, but Middlesbrough still trailed by virtue of away goals. [[Massimo Maccarone]] completed the comeback, sending Middlesbrough to the semi-final. A similar situation unfolded nearly three weeks later on 27 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2005/matches/round=2213/match=84078/index.html|title=UEFA Europa League 2005/06 - History - Middlesbrough-Steaua – UEFA.com|first=|last=uefa.com|website=Uefa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Middlesbrough headed into its second leg trailing 1–0 to [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]]. Middlesbrough allowed two goal in 24 minutes and trailed 3–0 on aggregate. Maccarone scored in the 33rd minute.

Barcelona, its own high standards, were poor on the night, failing to register one shot on target. Chelsea had six penalty appeals turned down, and Barcelona had to play almost half an hour with ten men. Then, with the clock timed at 90'+2:10, [[Andrés Iniesta]] scored for Barcelona to give them the crucial away goal that sent them to the final, and ultimately victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and The Treble.

As time ticked away, the game seemed to be set as a win for Chelsea until a [[Dante (footballer)|Dante]] free-kick for Bayern bounced off of a Chelsea defender and into the path of [[Javi Martínez]], who slotted the ball past [[Petr Čech]]. This sent the game to a penalty shoot-out that Bayern won 5–4, handing them their (and Germany's) first ever UEFA Super Cup.

In 2004, Terek Grozny was playing in Russia's First Division but without a home stadium, as due to war in Chechnya, Terek Grozny often played its home matches in [[Pyatigorsk]]. One of Terek Grozny's key players that season was [[Andrei Fedkov]] — his winning goal against [[FC Shinnik Yaroslavl|Shinnik Yaroslavl]] on 5 May 2004 sent Terek Grozny to the Russian Cup final. But on 9 May 2004, Chechen President [[Akhmad Kadyrov]] was assassinated during a Victory Day parade in Grozny.

Arsenal had to beat championship rivals Liverpool by two clear goals or more to win the title; any other result would mean an eighteenth title for Liverpool. Arsenal, the away team, led 1–0 at 90 minutes, and in the last minute of injury-time (90'+1:22), [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] ran through the Liverpool defence and scored a dramatic goal to win the title for the Gunners. This match is often remembered for commentator [[Brian Moore (commentator)|Brian Moore]]'s famous phrase "It's up for grabs now!" as Thomas ran through to score.
* '''[[1996–97 Ekstraklasa]] – [[Legia Warsaw]] vs. [[Widzew Łódź]], 18 June 1997''': Going into the penultimate match of the season; Widzew was one point ahead of Legia.

Neither team could find the net until late on in the second half, when [[Carl Asaba]] burst into the City penalty area in the 81st minute and punted the ball high into the net. Then in the 87th minute, Gillingham doubled their lead as [[Robert Taylor (footballer)|Bob Taylor]] scored Gillingham's second. However, in the 90th minute, City's [[Kevin Horlock]] ran onto a loose ball outside the box and smashed a shot through a crowd of players to bring the score to 2–1. Then, on 90+5 minutes, the ball was fed in to [[Paul Dickov]] in the Gillingham penalty area, who, falling backwards, managed to lever a shot over the sliding challenge of [[Adrian Pennock]], which rocketed into the top corner. No more goals were scored in extra-time, so the match went to penalties, where City won 3–1. City keeper [[Nicky Weaver]] saved two of Gillingham's penalties. Dickov and [[Vince Bartram]], Gillingham's keeper and Dickov's best man, swapped shirts at the end of the match.
* '''[[2000–01 Bundesliga]] – [[Hamburger SV]] vs. [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], 19 May 2001''': The final day of the Bundesliga season saw Bayern Munich in the lead to [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] by three points. Due to their inferior goal difference, Bayern needed at least a draw at their match at Hamburg to secure the championship, while Schalke faced [[SpVgg Unterhaching]] at home and managed to win 5–3. In the 90th minute of the Bayern match, a goal by [[Sergej Barbarez]] put Hamburg 1–0 up and, believing that Schalke had won their first Bundesliga championship for over 40 years, Schalke fans ran onto the pitch to celebrate the title, despite though the match in Hamburg not being over. In the third minute of extra time, Hamburg goalkeeper [[Mathias Schober]], who ironically was on loan from Schalke for the second half of the season, picked up an alleged back pass with his hands and referee [[Markus Merk]] awarded an indirect free-kick for Bayern about eight metres from the Hamburg goal. Bayern defender [[Patrik Andersson]] shot the ball through the wall of Hamburg defenders into the net, making Bayern league champions for the 17th time in its history. Schalke would later be dubbed "champion of hearts" due to their close loss of Bundesliga title they believed to have already won.
* '''[[2004–05 Scottish Premier League]] – [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] vs. [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], 25 May 2005''': The final day of the Scottish Premier League season saw Celtic and their [[Old Firm]] rivals [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] battling it out for the league title. Both teams were winning their respective matches; Celtic were 1–0 up against Motherwell at [[Fir Park]] whilst Rangers were winning 1–0 against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] at [[Easter Road]]. As things stood, Celtic would win the SPL title by just two points, but Motherwell striker [[Scott McDonald]] scored an unlikely equaliser in the 88th minute. This meant that Rangers would win the title on goal difference as long as they beat Hibernian. Then, less than two minutes later, as Celtic pushed forward to try to salvage the title, McDonald was able to score again and give Motherwell a 2–1 win. Rangers hung on to win and were crowned champions, winning the league by a single point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/23/match.motherwell|title=Celtic crash with two minutes to go|last=McCarra|first=Kevin|date=25 May 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, McDonald signed for Celtic two years later and helped ''them'' to win the title in the [[2007–08 Scottish Premier League|2007–08 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/45404/Celtic-claim-SPL-title|title=Celtic claim SPL title|date=22 May 2008|work=[[Daily Express]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[2006–07 Scottish First Division]] – [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]] vs. [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]], 28 April 2007''': The final day of the Scottish First Division season saw Gretna and [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] battling it out for the league title, and promotion to the [[Scottish Premier League]]. Having been 12 points clear of St Johnstone with five games to play, a four-game winless streak had seen Gretna's lead cut down to just one point. With St Johnstone having won their final match of the season, Gretna knew that they had to win otherwise St Johnstone would be promoted to the SPL. With the score at 2–2 entering stoppage time, as things stood St Johnstone would be promoted, but in an extremely dramatic finish, [[James Grady]] broke clear in the 90th minute and scored to make it 3–2 to Gretna and win them the match and their third consecutive league title (having won the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 2005 and the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 2006), and with it, promotion to the SPL at St Johnstone's expense. The result also relegated Ross County to the Second Division. Gretna's promotion victory was all the more amazing considering the fact that they had been playing [[Non-League football]] in England just six years earlier.
* '''[[2006–07 La Liga]] – [[Real Zaragoza]] vs. [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], 10 June 2007''': In the penultimate match of the season, Real Madrid were second in the table, losing 2–1 against Zaragoza and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in first, winning 2–1 against [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]], both in the 88th minute. In a turn of events, [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] scored the equaliser at [[La Romareda]]. Seventeen seconds later, [[Raúl Tamudo]] also levelled for Espanyol at [[Camp Nou]], claiming the title for Madrid.
* '''[[2007–08 Premier League]] – [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] vs. [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], 26 April 2008''': Going into this game, [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] found themselves on the brink of relegation and knew anything less than a win and they would surely have no chance of staying up. At half time, they were 2–0 down and mathematically relegated thanks to results elsewhere. However, the introduction of much maligned striker [[Diomansy Kamara]] sparked an incredible fightback by the cottagers. In the 70th minute, he pulled one back before [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] converted a rebounded penalty to make it 2–2 with ten minutes remaining. Kamara then fired a 92nd-minute winner to give Fulham an incredible 3–2 win, which proved to be the catalyst for a late survival bid that saw them win their final two games and remain in the league on goal difference.
* '''[[2007–08 Persian Gulf Cup]] – [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]] vs. [[Sepahan F.C.|Sepahan]], 17 May 2008''': Persepolis won the 2007–08 Persian Gulf Cup in the final game of the season at the [[Azadi Stadium]] after [[Sepehr Heidari]] scored a header, timed at 90+6', to give them a 2–1 result against Sepahan. Persepolis needed to win this final game of the season at home to win the title, while eventual runners-up Sepahan only needed to avoid defeat to win the league instead.
* '''[[2009–10 Israeli Premier League]] – [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]] vs. [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]], 15 May 2010''': To win the title, Hapoel had to win their final match of the season in the stadium of their great rivals, while [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] also had to drop points against [[Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.|Bnei Yehuda]]. Both matches were tied at 1–1 going into stoppage time, but Hapoel's [[Eran Zahavi]] scored in the 92nd minute to win the match and the title for his team.
* '''[[2011 A-League Grand Final]], 13 March 2011''': The game to decide the [[A-League|Australian champions]] was goalless in the first 90 minutes. In the first half of [[Overtime (association football)|extra time]], the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]] scored two goals to seemingly clinch the title. However, [[Brisbane Roar FC|Brisbane Roar]] scored two goals in three minutes, including one with almost the last kick of the match, to draw level and send the game to [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]]. Brisbane then went on to win 4–2 on penalties.
* '''[[2012 A-League Grand Final]] – [[Brisbane Roar FC|Brisbane Roar]] vs. [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]], 22 April 2012''': In the A-League Grand Final Brisbane sought to become the first back-to-back champions after their dramatic victory in the previous season's final. In front of a packed out [[Suncorp Stadium]], the first half ended goalless, however Perth received the lead in the 51' minute thanks to an [[Ivan Franjic]] own goal. Brisbane proceeded to hurl attack after attack at the Perth defense and finally in the 84' minute, [[Besart Berisha]] equalized with a stunning header thanks to an assist from [[Thomas Broich]]. The game seemed destined for extra time when, in the very last play of the game, Berisha weaved through the Perth defense before attempting a shot on goal, but taking an air swing. In controversial circumstances referee Jared Gillett awarded a penalty to the home side. Berisha calmly slotted the penalty and Brisbane were champions again.
* '''[[2011–12 Premier League]] – [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] vs. [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], 13 May 2012''': Manchester City and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] went into the final game of the season level on points, though City had the superior goal difference by eight. With five minutes added to the total of 90 minutes, and QPR having a lead of 1–2 with ten men, most of City fans lost their hopes since Manchester United were leading against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], Manchester City won a corner on 90+2 minutes. [[David Silva]] stepped up to take the crucial corner and as he sent the ball into the middle, [[Edin Džeko]] scored a header to equalize the game. Two minutes passed without any kind of important goal attempts and right before the last extra minute in the added time, [[Sergio Agüero]] attempted a one-two with [[Mario Balotelli]], and after getting the ball in his feet back again, Agüero got past [[Nedum Onuoha]] and drove the ball into the back of the net as City triumphed in their campaign. Dzeko's headed goal occurred at 90'+1:15 and Aguero's goal at 90'+3:20 – the latter just 13 seconds after Manchester United's match against Sunderland had concluded at the [[Stadium of Light]].
* '''[[2011–12 La Liga]] – [[Rayo Vallecano]] vs. [[Granada CF|Granada]], 13 May 2012''': Heading into its season finale against fellow strugglers Granada, Rayo lost nine of its last ten matches and was outscored 30–12 in those matches. Its survival efforts needed help from [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] and [[Atlético Madrid]], who were facing [[Real Zaragoza]] and [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] respectively. Zaragoza led 1–0 in an ill-tempered match and would add an stoppage time goal to win at Getafe 2–0, while Villarreal allowed a late goal by [[Radamel Falcao]] in the 88th minute at home. Yet, Rayo and Granada were still scoreless as the match approached injury time. [[Raúl Tamudo]], however, scored one minute into stoppage time to save Rayo from relegation with a 1–0 victory. With those results, Rayo, Zaragoza and Granada (despite the loss) survived at Villarreal's expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/us/en/report/327683/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901|title=Rayo Vallecano v Granada live football scores - Soccer scores and live video - ESPNFC.com|date=26 May 2014|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526065725/http://www.espnfc.com/us/en/report/327683/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901|archivedate=26 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/us/en/report/323689/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901|title=Villarreal v Atletico Madrid live football scores - Soccer scores and live video - ESPNFC.com|date=25 May 2014|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525213445/http://www.espnfc.com/us/en/report/323689/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/us/en/report/323693/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901|title=Getafe v Real Zaragoza live football scores - Soccer scores and live video - ESPNFC.com|date=26 May 2014|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526044143/http://www.espnfc.com/us/en/report/323693/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901|archivedate=26 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[2012–13 Football League One]] – [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] vs. [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], 27 April 2013''': Brentford and Doncaster went into the final game of the League One season with both sides needing to win to secure promotion to the [[Football League Championship]]. Doncaster were in the second automatic promotion spot before the game, with Brentford in third. A draw at full-time would have been enough to see Doncaster promoted. In the 94th minute of the game, Brentford were awarded a penalty, which was taken by [[Marcello Trotta]]. The penalty was missed, hitting the crossbar, and after a goalmouth scramble, was cleared to [[Billy Paynter]] who ran down field, crossing the ball to [[James Coppinger]] who tapped the ball into an empty net in the 96th minute of the game, securing a 1–0 win as well as Doncaster's promotion to the Championship and consigning Brentford to the play-offs.
* '''[[2012–13 Football League Championship]] – [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] vs. [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] vs. [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], 4 May 2013:''' Watford and Hull City were both fighting for 2nd place and automatic promotion to the [[2013–14 Premier League]]. Hull were 2–1 up and in the 91st minute, they were awarded a penalty which could have sealed their 2nd place spot. Hull missed their penalty, and in the 93rd minute, Cardiff were awarded a penalty, which was converted by [[Nicky Maynard]], bringing the score to 2–2. After a serious injury delayed the match, the Watford game was fifteen minutes behind the Hull game, so with the score at 1–1, Watford knew that a win would secure their promotion to the Premier League. In the 89th minute Leeds scored to make it 2–1. The scores stayed that way and promotion for Hull was assured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2319364/Hull-2-Cardiff-2--match-report-Tigers-promoted-Premier-League.html|title=Hull 2 Cardiff 2: Bruce leads Tigers back into Premier League and a £100m payday after day of high drama at the KC Stadium|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[2012–13 Football League Championship]] – [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] vs. [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], 12 May 2013''': Leicester won the first match at home 1–0, and with the score 2–1 to Watford, the game was heading to overtime. But in the 90+6' minute, Leicester were given a penalty after a foul on [[Anthony Knockaert]] in the box. However, Watford goalkeeper [[Manuel Almunia]] saved Knockaert's penalty and the following rebound. Watford gained hold of the ball and started a counterattack; a cross was swung in to Leicester's penalty area, [[Jonathan Hogg]] headed the ball down and [[Troy Deeney]] thumped it in with a half-volley to seal the victory for Watford on aggregate. The goal was timed at 90'+6:52.
* '''[[2013–14 Football League Championship]] – [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] vs. [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], 3 May 2014''': Heading into the final day of the 2013–14 Football League Championship, [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] led Birmingham by one point in the race to avoid relegation to the Football League One. Doncaster, however, had a poorer goal differential entering its match at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Birmingham travelled to Bolton needing to earn a better result than Doncaster to avoid relegation to England's third tier of football for the first time in 20 years. The visitors trailed 2–0 with 14 minutes remaining, but [[Nikola Žigić]] scored two minutes later to put Birmingham in contention. However, Leicester had scored in the 75th minute to go up, and had the results stayed that way, Doncaster would be safe. Three minutes into stoppage time, however, [[Paul Caddis]] headed from close range to ensure Birmingham would stay in the Football League Championship for the 2014–15 season. The 1–0 loss at Leicester sent Doncaster to the third division.
* '''2013–14 2. Bundesliga Relegation-Promotion Play-off – [[Arminia Bielefeld]] vs [[SV Darmstadt 98|Darmstadt 98]], 19 May 2014''': Darmstadt qualified for the second division of the Bundesliga in one of the most dramatic circumstances in history after it matched Arminia's 3–1 first leg road victory with a 3–1 road result after 90 minutes in the second leg to force extra time. Then, after [[Kacper Przybyłko]] put Arminia ahead on aggregate, Darmstadt would have stayed in the third division of the Bundesliga until [[Elton da Costa]], having come on the 112th minute, scored two minutes into stoppage time at the end of the second half to send Darmstadt through on away goals. Its qualification to the 2. Bundesliga was all the more impressive considering the club finished 16th the prior season and was supposed to be relegated to the Regionalliga, except that one team was not granted a license, thus sparing Darmstadt relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/2bundesliga/relegation-abstieg/2-bundesliga-relegation-fb-1/2013-14/1/1965450/spielbericht_arminia-bielefeld-10_sv-darmstadt-98-98.html |title=Arminia Bielefeld – SV Darmstadt 98 2:4, 2.

* '''[[2014 Football League Championship play-off Final]] – [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] vs [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], 24 May 2014''': Nearly nine years after scoring the only goal to send [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] into the Premier League in a play-off final, [[Bobby Zamora]] scored in the 90th minute to send QPR back to the Premier League with a 90th-minute goal in a 1–0 victory over Derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher |first=Paul |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27452294 |title=BBC Sport – Derby County 0–1 Queens Park Rangers |publisher=BBC |date=2014-05-24 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[2013–14 Segunda División|2013–14 Segunda Division Play-off Final]] – [[UD Las Palmas|Las Palmas]] vs. [[Córdoba CF|Córdoba]], 22 June 2014''': Despite finishing seventh in the [[2013–14 Segunda División]], Córdoba qualified for the end-of-season promotion play-offs as [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s [[FC Barcelona B|reserve team]] finished third, but, as a reserve team, were ineligible to play in [[La Liga]]. Córdoba reached the final by defeating [[Real Murcia]] and set up a meeting with sixth-placed Las Palmas. After a scoreless first leg, Las Palmas opened the scoring early in the second half on a goal from [[Apoño]]. The lone goal would have been enough to send Las Palmas back to La Liga for the first time in 12 years. However, home supporters of Las Palmas had invaded the pitch before the match finished and the game had to be halted for ten minutes. After order was restored, Cordoba had roughly 30 seconds remaining when [[Ulises Dávila]], on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], scored the tying goal to send Córdoba to La Liga for the first time in 42 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/138/spain/2014/06/23/4905144/las-palmas-cordoba-la-liga-play-off-ends-with-pitch-invasion |title=Las Palmas – Cordoba La Liga play-off ends with pitch invasion |website=Goal.com |date=2014-06-23 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[2016-17 EFL League Two]] – [[Newport County F.C.|Newport County]] vs. [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], 6 May 2017''': Newport County went into the match just two points above [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]], needing a win to confirm their stay in the [[English Football League|Football League]]. A brace by Hartlepool United's [[Devante Rodney]] put his side 2–1 up against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], leaving Newport County in 23rd and seven minutes away from relegation as they were drawing 1–1 at the time. In the 89th minute, Newport County defender [[Mark O'Brien (footballer, born 1992)|Mark O'Brien]] chested a cross down and volleyed it into the bottom corner from inside the penalty box, putting his team 2–1 up and sending Hartlepool United back into 23rd position. It was O'Brien's second goal in his career, his first for Newport County, and ultimately proved to be the game-winning goal for Newport County, who stayed up in League Two. Despite defeating Doncaster Rovers, Hartlepool United wound up being relegated from the Football League after 96 years. The result also proved to be unfortunate for Doncaster Rovers, as their fourth consecutive loss cost them the League Two title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39753913 |title=Hartlepool United 2–1 Doncaster Rovers |website=bbc.com |date=2017-05-06 |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
Only matches in the World Cup knockout stage, Olympic finals and the semi-final or final of continental competitions are included in this section.
* '''[[1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|1990 FIFA World Cup Round of 16]] – [[England national football team|England]] vs [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], 26 June 1990''': With the match scoreless in regulation, England and Belgium was still scoreless as the match headed toward the end of extra time and onto penalty kicks. However, England had an opportunity on a free kick, and [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]], who had just earned his first cap for England nearly seven months earlier, scored in the 119th minute. That goal would also be his [[David Platt (footballer)#International goals|first]] ever goal for England, as England advanced with a 1–0 victory. The goal by Platt at the time was the latest goal ever scored at a World Cup, a record broken in 2006.
* '''[[1992 Summer Olympics]] [[Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics#Gold Medal Match|final]] – [[Poland national football team|Poland]] vs. [[Spain national football team|Spain]], 8 August 1992''': With the game tied 2–2, [[Kiko Narváez]] scored the winning goal (his second of the game and fifth of the tournament) for Spain in the 90th minute as Spain won the gold medal in a 3–2 victory.
* '''[[1998 FIFA World Cup]] [[1998 FIFA World Cup#Quarter-finals|quarter-final]] – [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] vs. [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], 4 July 1998''': The quarter-final between Argentina and Netherlands looked to be heading for extra-time until [[Dennis Bergkamp]] netted a 90th-minute winner from a {{convert|60|yd|sing=on}} pass by [[Frank de Boer]] to take the Dutch into the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in 20 years. For the Netherlands, it was the second straight knock-out game decided on a late goal – on 29 June, Edgar Davids scored two minutes into stoppage time as the Netherlands eliminated Yugoslavia with a 2–1 victory in Toulouse, France.
* '''[[UEFA Euro 2000 Final]] – [[France national football team|France]] vs [[Italy national football team|Italy]], 2 July 2000''': [[Marco Delvecchio]] gave Italy the lead in the 55th minute and they held on until the final minute of injury time, when [[Sylvain Wiltord]] crashed a low drive past Italian keeper [[Francesco Toldo]] to take the game into [[overtime (sports)|extra time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/816194.stm |title= France 2 Italy 1|date=2 July 2000|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; France won the game in extra-time.
* '''[[2004 AFC Asian Cup#Semi-finals|2004 Asian Cup Semi-final]] – [[Japan national football team|Japan]] vs [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]], 3 August 2004''': Japan avoided a major upset against a pesky Bahrain squad and qualified for the final thanks to a 90th-minute goal from Yuji Nakazawa. His third goal of the tournament helped Japan avoid extra time by winning 4–3 against Bahrain.
* '''[[2004 Copa América Final]] – [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] vs [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], 25 July 2004''': The Argentinians got the lead at the 87th minute.

* '''[[2006 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|2006 FIFA World Cup Round of 16]] – [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] vs [[Italy national football team|Italy]], 26 June 2006''': In Australia's first World Cup since 1974, the Socceroos had outdone all expectations and had qualified for the Round of 16, and were drawn against Italy. With the match scoreless after 90 minutes of regular time played, it seemed as if the match would go to extra time to decide it. However, with less than a minute to go Fabio Grosso burst into Australia’s penalty box and was awarded a controversial penalty, which was scored by Francesco Totti, thus eliminating Australia from the World Cup. Totti's goal against Australia remained the latest goal scored in regulation at a FIFA World Cup until 2018, when [[Neymar]] scored against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].
* '''[[2006 FIFA World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup#Semi-finals|semi-final]] – [[Germany national football team|Germany]] vs. [[Italy national football team|Italy]], 4 July 2006''': The game was even at 0–0 and looked set to be heading to a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] when, in the last minute of extra-time, [[Fabio Grosso]] scored for Italy. As Germany pushed for a quick equaliser, they allowed Italy to counterattack, and [[Alessandro Del Piero]] added a second to give Italy a 2–0 win and send them through the final, and eventual World Cup glory. Italy also won their round of 16 match against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] with a 95th-minute penalty from [[Francesco Totti]]. ; Grosso &amp; Del Piero's goals remained the latest goals scored in any FiFA World Cup match until the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], when [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Round of 16#Germany vs Algeria|Germany played against Algeria]] in the 2014 World Cup round of 16.
* '''[[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup#Semi-finals|2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Semi-finals]] – [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]] vs. [[England women's national football team|England]], 1 July 2015''': In the second semi-final match, reigning champions Japan faced England, who reached the semi-finals for the first time. Both teams scored one goal each in the first half of the match from penalties. The score was still 1–1 until the second minute of stoppage time, when [[Laura Bassett]] committed an own goal while attempting to clear the ball off the English goaline. Japan moved on to lose their title to U.S., their former opponent in the final round four years ago in [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|Germany]], after a 2–5 defeat. England, however, went on to beat Germany 1–0 to secure third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Callaghan|first1=Shane|title=Result: Last-gasp Laura Bassett own goal denies battling England|url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/england-women/womens-world-cup-2015/result/result-last-gasp-bassett-own-goal-denies-england_231430.html|website=Sports Mole|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other notable examples include  [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final]] - [[Spain national football team|Spain]] vs [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]: [[Andrés Iniesta]] scored the only goal of the match in the 116th minute, giving Spain the World Cup victory; [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]] - [[Germany national football team|Germany]] vs [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]: [[Mario Gotze]] scored the only goal of the match in the 113th minute, giving Germany the World Cup victory.

==In fiction==
*The last-minute goal is often used in fiction due to the dramatic nature and possibility for a [[cliffhanger]] ending. It was used frequently in the television football drama ''[[Dream Team (TV series)|Dream Team]]'', with the show finishing at the end of its final series on a fictional last-minute goal for [[Harchester United F.C.|Harchester United]] to win the Premier League.
*The real-life last-minute goal, scored by [[Michael Thomas (footballer born 1967)|Michael Thomas]], was used as a plot device in the novel ''[[Fever Pitch]]'' by [[Nick Hornby]] and subsequent films of the same name.
*In the film ''[[Mike Bassett: England Manager]]'', [[England national football team|England]] score a last-minute winner against old [[Argentina and England football rivalry|rivals]] [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (which parodies both [[Hand of God goal|the Hand of God]] and [[Goal of the Century|Maradona's Goal of the Century]] which were scored against England) to save Bassett's job. In addition to this, a last-minute goal by [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] allows Bassett's England to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].

[[File:Football-Formation-LB.svg|thumb|300px|Base 4–3 defense, the central middle linebacker in blue]]
[[File:Chicago_Bears_vs_Green_Bay_Packers_4.jpg|thumb|top|300px|In white jerseys, [[Lance Briggs]] (55) and [[Brian Urlacher]] (54) of the Chicago Bears, are positioned as linebackers on [[Lambeau Field]] in 2011]]

A '''linebacker''' ('''LB''' or '''backer''') is a playing position in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]].  Linebackers are members of the [[defensive team]], and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the [[line of scrimmage]], behind the [[defensive linemen]], and therefore "back up the line." Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a "two-point [[Stance (American football)|stance]]" (as opposed to the defensive linemen, who put one or two hands on the ground for a "[[three-point stance]]" or "four-point stance" before the ball is [[Snap (gridiron football)|snapped]]).

The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run protection or extra pass protection based on the particular defensive [[American football plays|play]] being executed. Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing. A [[Blitz (gridiron football)|blitz]] occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed [[Gap (American football)|gap]]. When a blitz is called by the defense, it is mainly to [[Quarterback sack|sack]] or hurry the opposing offense's [[quarterback]].

Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense, due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass protection, when required. Similar to the "free safety" position, linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap, to determine their role during that particular play.

==History==
[[Image:Germany Schulz.JPG|thumb|right|160px|[[Germany Schulz]], the sport's first linebacker.]]
Before the advent of the [[two-platoon system]] with separate units for offense and defense, the player who was the team's [[Center (American football)|center]] on offense was often, though not always, the team's linebacker on defense. Hence today one usually sees four defensive linemen to the offense's five or more. Most sources claim coach [[Fielding H. Yost]] and center [[Germany Schulz#Innovations: The .22spiral snap.22 and the .22roving center.22|Germany Schulz]] of the [[University of Michigan]] invented the position.&lt;ref&gt;''Big Ten Football, Its Life and Times, Great Coaches, Players, and Games'', page 193, Mervin D. Hyman, Gordon S. White, Macmillan, 1977, {{ISBN|0-02-558070-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2548264/the_newark_advocate/|title=First linebacker found|date=October 30, 1974|page=27|work=The Newark Advocate|accessdate=June 4, 2015|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2548263/the_pantagraph/|title=More Trivia|date=September 10, 1967|page=28|work=The Pantagraph|accessdate=June 4, 2015|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Lewis, "Once Over Lightly," ''The Long Beach Independent'', July 29, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{College Football HoF/url|id=1242}}|title=Germany Schulz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulz was Yost's first linebacker in 1904 when he stood up from his usual position on the line. Yost was horrified at first, but came to see the wisdom in Schulz's innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Bingay, "A Little About This and That: How Schulz Entered Michigan Still A Mystery," ''The Morning Herald'', May 1, 1951; ; "Frankly Speaking: Schulz' Great Grid Exploits Reviewed," ''The Long Beach Press-Telegram,'' April 17, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Thomas Dunn|William Dunn]] of [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn St.]] was another [[Big Ten Conference|Western]] linebacker soon after Schulz.

However, there are various historical claims tied to the linebacker position, including some before 1904. For example, [[Percy Given]] of [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] is another center with a claim to the title "first linebacker," supposedly standing up behind the line well before Schulz in a game against [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=oEKQVLjyFIueNsCjg7gD&amp;id=4ck3AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22percy+given%22+georgetown&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=percy+given|page=128|year=1962|title=Football Immortals|author=Alexander M.

In the East, [[Ernest Cozens]] of [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]] was "one of the first of the roving centers,"&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ernest B. Cozens|work=Pennsylvania Gazette|page= 751|date=June 28, 1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CO8sAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; another, archaic term for the position, supposedly coined by [[Hank Ketcham (American football)|Hank Ketcham]] of [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Henry 'Hank' Ketcham player profile |publisher=College Football Hall of Fame |url={{College Football HoF/url|id=1338}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter E.

In professional football, [[Cal Hubbard]] is credited with pioneering the linebacker position. He starred as a [[defensive tackle|tackle]] and [[end (American football)|end]], playing off the line in a style similar to that of a modern linebacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueY58Dlnn30C&amp;pg=PA62|author=Richard Whittingham|title=What a Game They Played: An Inside Look at the Golden Era of Pro Football|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

A [[Jack of all trades, master of none|jack-of-all-trades]], the middle linebacker can be asked to blitz (though they often blitz less than the outside linebacker), cover, spy the [[quarterback]], or even have a deep middle-of-the-field responsibility in the [[Tampa 2]] defense. In standard defenses, middle linebackers commonly lead the team in tackles. The terms ''middle'' and ''inside'' linebacker are often used interchangeably;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Football All-Stars: The Nfl's Best|last=Bradley|first=Michael|page=55|ISBN=0823936902|date=2003|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are also used to distinguish between a single middle linebacker playing in a [[4–3 defense#Linebackers|4–3 defense]], and two inside linebackers playing in a [[3–4 defense#Linebackers|3–4 defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/patriots/2008-08-05-mayo_N.htm|title=Mayo leaning on 'old guys' to pick up Pats system on the fly|work=[[USA Today]]|last=Weisman|first=Larry|date=August 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 3–4 defense, the larger, more run-stopping-oriented linebacker is usually still called "Mike", while the smaller, more pass protection/route coverage-oriented player is called "Will".  "Mikes" usually line up towards the strong side or on the side the offense is more likely to run on (based on personnel matchups) while "Wills" may line up on the other side or even a little farther back between the defensive line and the secondary.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Outside linebacker===
The outside linebacker (OLB), sometimes called the "Buck, Sam, and Rebel" is usually responsible for outside containment.  This includes the strongside and weakside designations below. They are also responsible for blitzing the quarterback.

====Strongside linebacker====
The strongside linebacker (SLB) is often nicknamed the "Sam" for purposes of calling a [[Blitz (gridiron football)|blitz]]. Since the strong side of the [[offensive team]] is the side on which the [[tight end]] lines up, or whichever side contains the most personnel, the strongside linebacker usually lines up across from the tight end. Often the strongside linebacker will be called upon to tackle the [[running back]] on a play, because the back will be following the tight end's block.  He is most often the strongest linebacker; at the least he possesses the ability to withstand, shed, and fight off blocks from a tight end or fullback blocking the backside of a pass play. The linebacker should also have strong [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] abilities in pass situation to cover the tight end in man on man situations. He should also have considerable quickness to read and get into coverage in zone situations. The strongside linebacker is also commonly known as the left outside linebacker (LOLB).

====Weakside linebacker====
The weakside linebacker (WLB), or the "Will" in 4–3 Defense, sometimes called the backside linebacker, or "Buck", as well as other names like Jack or Bandit&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe"/&gt; must be the fastest of the three, because he is often the one called into pass coverage. He is also usually chasing the play from the backside, so the ability to maneuver through traffic is a necessity for the Will. The Will usually aligns off the [[line of scrimmage]] at the same depth as Mike. Because of his position on the weakside, the Will does not often have to face large interior linemen one on one unless one is pulling. In coverage, the Will often covers the back that attacks his side of the field first in man coverage, while covering the weak flat in Texas Loop or hook/curl areas in zone coverage. The weakside linebacker is also commonly known as the right outside linebacker (ROLB).

==Formations==
The number of linebackers is dependent upon the [[Formation (American football)#List of Defensive formations|formation]] called for in the play; formations can call for as few as none, or as many as seven.  Most defensive schemes call for three or four, and they are generally named for the number of linemen, followed by the number of linebackers (with the 46 defense being an exception).  For example, the 4–3 defense has four defensive linemen and three linebackers; conversely, the 3–4 defense has three linemen and four linebackers.

===4–3 defense===
{{Main|4–3 defense}}
In the 4–3 defense there are four down linemen and three linebackers. The middle linebacker is designated "Mike" (or "Mac") and two outside linebackers are designated "Sam" and "Will" according to how they line up against the offensive formation. If there is a strong call, the linebacker on the strongside is called "Sam", while the linebacker on the weakside is called "Will". The outside linebacker's job is to cover the end to make sure a run doesn't escape, and to watch the pass and protect from it. The middle linebacker's job is to stop runs between the [[Tackle (American football position)|tackles]] and watch the entire field to see the play develop. On pass plays, the linebackers' responsibilities vary based upon whether a man or zone coverage is called. In a zone coverage, the linebackers will generally drop into hook zones across the middle of the field. However, some zones will send the outside linebackers into the flats (area directly to the left and right of the hash marks, extending 4–5 yards downfield). In a man-to-man call, the "Sam" will often cover the tight end with help from a safety over the top, while at other times, the "Sam" and "Will" will be responsible for the first man out of the backfield on their side of the center, with the "Mike" covering if a second man exits on that side of the field.

In the "[[Tampa 2]]" zone defense the middle linebacker is required to drop quickly into a deep middle zone pass coverage thus requiring a quick player at this position.

===3–4 defense===
{{Main|3–4 defense}}
[[File:Linebacker34.svg|thumb|Base 3–4 defense]]
In the 3–4 defense there are three linemen playing the line of scrimmage with four linebackers backing them up, typically two outside linebackers and two inside linebackers. The weak side inside linebacker is typically called the "Will," while the strong side or middle inside linebacker is called the "Mike".  "Sam" is a common designation for strong outside linebacker, while the other position is usually called "Jack" and is often a hybrid DE/LB. Usually, teams that run a 3–4 defense look for college defensive ends that are too small to play the position in the pros and not quite fluid enough to play outside linebacker in a 4–3 defense as their "Jack" linebacker.

The idea behind the 3–4 defense is to disguise where the fourth rusher will come from. Instead of the standard four down-linemen in the 4–3, only three players are clearly attacking on nearly every play. A key for running this defense successfully is having a defensive front of three large defensive linemen who command constant double teams. In particular, the nose tackle, who plays over the offensive center, must be able to hold ground and to occupy several offensive blockers to allow the linebackers to make plays. The focus of the 3–4 defensive line is to occupy offensive linemen thus freeing the linebackers to tackle the running back or to rush the passer or otherwise drop into pass coverage.

Generally, the primary responsibilities for both outside linebackers are to stop the run and rush the quarterback in passing situations, in which they line in front of the tackles like true defensive ends. The outside linebackers in a 3–4 defense are players who are very skilled at rushing the quarterback and they would be playing defensive end in a 4–3 defense. When it comes to the inside linebackers, one is generally a run-stuffing player who is better able to handle offensive linemen and stop running backs when the offense features a running play, while the other is often a smaller, faster player who excels in pass coverage. However, the smaller or cover LB should also be able to scrape and plug running lanes decently.

The design concept of the 3–4 defense is to confuse the offensive line in their blocking assignments, particularly in pass blocking, and to create a more complex read for the quarterback. Many 3–4 defenses have the ability to quickly hybrid into a 4–3 on the field.

===46 defense===
{{main|46 defense}}
In the 46 defense there are four linemen, three linebackers and a safety who is moved up behind the line of scrimmage. Thus, it appears as if there are 4 linebackers, but it is really 3 linebackers with one safety playing up with the other linebackers.

Three of the defensive linemen are over both of the offensive guards and the center, thereby making it difficult to double team any one of the three interior defensive linemen. This can also take away the ability of the offense to pull the guards on a running play, because this would leave one of the defenders unblocked, or, at best, give another lineman a very difficult block to make on one of the defenders. The safety, like the linebacker, can blitz, play man-on-man, play zone, or drop back into deep coverage like a normal safety would do. The 46 is used in heavy run situations to stop the run, when a team wants to bring lots of pressure, or merely to confuse the [[quarterback]] and offensive line.

===4–4 defense===
This defense is effective at run-stopping but is weaker than a 4–3 defense at pass coverage because it uses only three defensive backs.  One of the outside linebackers is usually called into either blitz or pass coverage to make up for the missing DB.  In the NFL and college football, this alignment is used mainly in short yardage situations or near the goal line.  It is commonly used in high school football.

[[File:New York Red Bulls vs CD FAS (15264450902).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Squad number, as depicted on an [[association football]] jersey.]]

In [[team sport|team]] sports, the '''number''', often referred to as the '''uniform number''', '''squad number''', '''jersey number''', '''shirt number''', '''sweater number''', or similar (with such naming differences varying by sport and region) is the number worn on a player's [[uniform]], to identify and distinguish each player (and sometimes others, such as coaches and [[official (sports)|officials]]) from others wearing the same or similar uniforms. The number is typically displayed on the rear of the [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]], often accompanied by the surname.  Sometimes it is also displayed on the front and/or sleeves, or on the player's shorts or headgear. It is used to identify the player to officials, other players, official scorers, and spectators; in some sports, it is also indicative of the player's position.

The [[International Federation of Football History and Statistics]], an organization of association football historians, traces the origin of numbers to a 1911 [[Australian rules football]] match in Sydney,&lt;ref name="IFFHS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iffhs.de/?3e1d08361d1529774c8c03fcf8031f |title=Droll facts: 1911 |author=IFFHS Team |others=Dr. Alejandro Rodón (trans.) |accessdate=8 January 2010 |website=www.iffhs.de }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2014}} although photographic evidence exists of numbers being used in Australia as early as May 1903.&lt;ref name=austfb-jpg1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australianfootball.com/uploads/default/images/page_content/2012/07/5becd.FitzVColl1903.jpg |title=Maroons and Magpies fight for points in Sydney |website=australianfootball.com |date=May 1903 |format=JPG |accessdate=4 August 2013}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Player numbers were used in a Queensland vs. New Zealand [[rugby union|rugby]] match played on 17 July 1897, in Brisbane, Australia, as reported in the ''[[Brisbane Courier]].''&lt;ref name=tbc-17jul1897&gt;{{cite news |title=Football - New Zealand v.

[[File:Ronaldinho_corner.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Brazilian star [[Ronaldinho]] wore number 10 during his tenure on [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], then switching to number 80 when he was traded to [[AC Milan|Milan]]]]

In association football, numbers were traditionally assigned based on a player's position or reputation on the field, with the starting 11 players wearing 1 to 11, and the substitutes wearing higher numbers. The [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] would generally wear number 1, then defenders, midfield players and forwards in ascending order.

Numbers being assigned to each player in a squad was initiated for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]], where each man in a country's 22-man squad wore a specific number from 1 to 22 for the duration of the tournament. In 1993, England's [[The Football Association|Football Association]] switched to persistent squad numbers, abandoning the mandatory use of 1–11 for the starting line-up. It became standard in the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]] in the 1993–94 season, with names printed above the numbers. Most European top leagues adopted the system over the next five years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

It is common for players to change numbers within a club as their career progresses. For example, [[Cesc Fàbregas]] was first assigned the number 57 on arrival at [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] in 2003. On promotion to the first team squad he was switched to number 15 before inheriting his preferred number 4 following the departure of [[Patrick Vieira]].

Very high numbers, the most common being 88, are often reserved and used as a placeholder, when a new player has been signed and played by the manager prior to having a formal squad number. However, in some countries these high numbers are well used, in some cases because the players preferred number is already taken or for other reasons. On joining [[A.C. Milan]]; [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Mathieu Flamini]] all wore numbers reflecting the year of their birth (76, 80 &amp; 84 respectively), because their preferred numbers were already being worn.

==Australian rules football==
[[File:Port Adelaide number panel 1910.png|thumb|right|140px|Squad numbers first appeared on [[Australian rules football]] guernseys when clubs travelled interstate. Pictured is a {{AFL Por}} player in [[Western Australia]] during 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33369597 |title=PORT ADELAIDE V. GOLDFIELDS. |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Western Argus]] |volume=XVI, |issue=822 |location=Western Australia |date=9 August 1910 |accessdate=5 November 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[Australian rules football]], players traditionally wear numbers on the backs of their [[Guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]]s, although some competitions (the [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] is one example) may feature teams who wear smaller numbers on the front, usually on one side of the chest. The number being worn is usually not relevant to the player's position on the ground, although occasionally a club will allocate the number 1 guernsey or an otherwise prestigious number to the team [[Captain (Australian rules football)|captain]] (such as the [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] football club, which allocates number 17 to its team captain in honour of [[Jack Dyer]], who wore that number with distinction). [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] assigns number 1 to the team captain. In these situations, it is usually customary for players who relinquish the captaincy to switch to another.

[[Australian Football League|AFL]] clubs generally do not retire numbers (although [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] temporarily retired the no. 5 between 1998 and 2005 after the retirement of [[Gary Ablett, Sr.|Gary Ablett Sr.]]), but instead will often choose to give their more prestigious numbers to highly touted draftees or young up-and-coming players who are shown to have promise and may share certain traits with the previous wearer, such as position or playing style. For example, as of 2010, [[Michael Hurley (footballer)|Michael Hurley]] inherited the no. 18 jumper left vacant by the retired [[Matthew Lloyd]], effectively keeping the no. 18 in [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon's]] goal-square for another era.

Sons of famous players will often take on their father's number, especially if they play at the same club. [[Sergio Silvagni]] and his son [[Stephen Silvagni|Stephen]], for example, both wore number 1 for [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], with Stephen's son [[Jack Silvagni|Jack]] later following suit. [[Matthew Scarlett]] wore his father [[John Scarlett (footballer)|John's]] no. 30 at [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]. In contrast, some sons of famous players also prefer to take on other numbers in the hopes that it will reduce the burden of having to fulfill high expectations. Notable examples of this are [[Gary Ablett, Jr.|Gary Ablett Jr.]] at Geelong (who wore no. 29 instead of his [[Gary Ablett, Sr.|father's]] no. 5) and [[Jobe Watson]] at Essendon, who passed up [[Tim Watson|Tim's]] no. 32 in favour of no. 4.

Clubs will often feature retiring champions "passing on" their famous guernsey numbers to the chosen successors, usually in ceremonial fashion, such as a club function or press conference.

The highest number worn in a VFL/AFL game is number 65 by Andrew Witts of Collingwood for seven games in 1985. With the demise of Reserves and Under 19's teams and, consequently, smaller club playing lists, it is unlikely that any player will play AFL-level football wearing so high a number again.

==American football==
{{Main|Uniform number (American football)}}

===NFL===
[[File:Peyton Manning Broncos 2012.JPG|thumb|right|160px|Quarterbacks, like [[Peyton Manning]], generally possess a squad number from 1 to 19.]] {{main|National Football League uniform numbers}}

The [[National Football League|NFL]] has used uniform numbers since its inception; through the 1940s, there was no standard numbering system, and teams were free to number their players however they wanted. An informal tradition had arisen by that point that was similar to the modern system; when the [[All-America Football Conference]], which used a radically different numbering scheme, merged with the NFL in 1950, the resulting confusion forced the merged league to impose a mandatory system of assignment of jersey numbers in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packers.com/history/record_book/results_and_rosters/all_time_jersey_numbers/ Packers.com » History » Record Book » Results And Rosters » All Time Jersey Numbers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092731/http://www.packers.com/history/record_book/results_and_rosters/all_time_jersey_numbers/ |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was updated and made more rigid in 1973, and has been modified slightly since then.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://football.about.com/cs/football101/a/bl_numbersystem.htm Football 101 – Uniform Numbering System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers are always worn on the front and back of a player's jersey, and so-called "TV numbers" are worn on either the sleeve or shoulder. The [[Cincinnati Bengals]] were the last NFL team to wear jerseys without TV numbers on a regular basis in [[1980 NFL season|1980]], though since then several NFL teams have worn [[throwback uniforms]] without them, as their jersey designs predated the introduction of TV numbers. Players' last names, however, are required on all uniforms, even throwbacks which predate the last name rule. Since [[2008 NFL season|2008]], TV numbers have not been mandatory under NFL rules{{Citation needed|reason=There has not been an article mentioning this, and proof needs to be shown.|date=January 2012}}.

Some uniforms also feature numbers either on the front, back, or sides of the helmet (in pro football, these were most prominently worn on the [[San Diego Chargers]] "powder-blue" uniforms).  Players have often asked the NFL for an exception to the numbering rule; with very few exceptions (see, for example, [[Keyshawn Johnson]]), these requests are almost always denied.

Below is the numbering system established by the NFL.  It has been primarily unchanged since 1973, though small changes have been made on occasion since then, including opening up the 10-19 range for wide receivers in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alder|first1=James|title=Rules Changes for the '04 NFL Season |url=http://football.about.com/od/nationalfootballleague/a/04rulechanges.htm|website=About.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opening 40-49 up to linebackers in 2015, with the latter decree being named the "Brian Bosworth rule", who wanted to wear 44, but was ordered to change it to 55.&lt;ref&gt;http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/25/nfl-passes-brian-bosworth-rule-linebackers-can-now-wear-jerseys-numbered-40-49/&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, numbers 50-59 were opened to defensive linemen; the first benefactor was [[Jerry Hughes]].

* '''1–9''': [[quarterbacks]], [[placekicker|kickers]], and [[Punter (football position)|punters]]
* '''10–19''': quarterbacks, kickers, punters, and [[wide receiver]]s
* '''20–39''': [[running back]]s and [[defensive back]]s
* '''40–49''': running backs, defensive backs, [[linebackers]], and [[tight end]]s
* '''50–59''': linebackers, [[Lineman (American football)|defensive linemen]], and [[Center (American football)|center]]s
* '''60–79''': [[offensive linemen]] and [[defensive linemen]]
* '''80–89''': wide receivers and tight ends
* '''90–99''': linebackers and defensive linemen

Numbers 0 and 00 are no longer allowed, but they were issued in the NFL before the number standardization in 1973.  [[George Plimpton]] wore 0 during a brief preseason stint as [[quarterback]] for the [[Detroit Lions]]. [[Jim Otto]] ("aught-oh") wore number "00"  during most of his career with the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Wide receiver [[Ken Burrough]] of the [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] also wore "00" during his NFL career in the 1970s.

This NFL numbering system is based on a player's ''primary'' position. Any player wearing any number may play at any position at any time (though players wearing numbers 50–79 or 90-99 must let the referee know that they are playing out of position by reporting as an "ineligible number in an eligible position"). It is not uncommon for running backs to line up at wide receiver on certain plays, or to have a lineman or linebacker play at fullback or tight end in short yardage situations. If a player changes primary positions, he is not required to change his number unless he changes from an eligible position to an ineligible one or vice versa. In preseason games, when teams have expanded rosters, players may wear numbers that are outside of the above rules. When the final 53-player roster is established, they are reissued numbers within the above guidelines.

===College and high school===

In [[college football]] and [[high school football]], a less rigid numbering system is employed.  The only rule is that members of the offensive line (centers, guards, and tackles) that play in ''ineligible'' positions (those that may not receive forward passes) must wear numbers from 50 to 79.  Informally, certain conventions still hold, and players often wear numbers in the ranges similar to their NFL counterparts; though the lowest numbers are often the highest prestige, and thus are often worn by players at any position.  Kickers and punters are frequently numbered in the 40's or 90's, which are the least in-demand numbers on a college roster.  The increased flexibility in numbering of NCAA rosters is needed because NCAA rules allow 85 scolarship players and rosters of over 100 players total; thus teams would frequently exhaust the available numbers for a position under the NFL rules.

One oddity of college football is that the same squad number can be shared by two (or more) players, e.g., an offensive and a defensive player.  Usually one of the players is a reserve who rarely plays but there are exceptions:   In the 2009 and 2010 seasons, that same number (5) was worn by [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] starting [[quarterback]] [[Stephen Garcia]] and starting [[cornerback]] [[Stephon Gilmore]]. Gilmore was also used as a [[Wildcat formation|wildcat]] quarterback in games against [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] in 2009 and [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]] in 2010. The player change, since both players wore the same number, caused some confusion among opposing defenses, but was legal, since both players were not on the field at the same time.  In [[2012 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|2012]], the No. 5 was worn by two [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] starters—quarterback [[Everett Golson]] and [[linebacker]] [[Manti Te'o]].

==Baseball==
{{main|Uniform number (Major League Baseball)}}

In baseball, players generally wear large numbers on the back of their jersey. Some jerseys may also feature smaller numerals in other locations, such as on the sleeves, pants, or front of the shirt. The purpose of numerals in baseball is to allow for easy identification of players. Some players have been so associated with specific numbers that their jersey number has been officially "[[List of Major League Baseball retired numbers|retired]]". The first team to retire a number was the [[New York Yankees]], who retired [[Lou Gehrig]]'s #4 in 1939.

In the early years of baseball, teams did not wear uniform numbers. Teams experimented with uniform numbers during the first two decades of the 20th century, with the first [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] team to use them being the [[1916 Cleveland Indians season|1916 Cleveland Indians]] which used them for a few weeks before abandoning the experiment. Again in 1923, the [[1923 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] tried out uniforms with small numbers on the sleeves, but the players did not like them, and they were removed. For the [[1929 Major League Baseball season]] both the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Cleveland Indians]] put numbers on their jerseys, the first two teams to do so, beginning a trend that was completed by 1937, when the [[1937 Philadelphia Athletics season|Philadelphia Athletics]] became the last team to permanently add numbers to their jerseys.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lukas|first1=Paul|title=Uni Watch: Who needs uniform numbers?|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/1005/uni-watch-who-needs-uniform-numbers|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=2 October 2014|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HOF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/numbers.htm |title=National Baseball Hall of Fame - Dressed to the Nines - Parts of the Uniform |publisher=Exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org |date= |accessdate=2014-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no system for numbering players in baseball, though in the very early years some teams did employ their own systems. The [[1929 New York Yankees season|1929 New York Yankees]] handed out uniform numbers based on a player's position in the [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]]; which is why [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Lou Gehrig]] wore their famous numbers 3 and 4; they batted third and fourth respectively that season. Numbers 1–8 were assigned to the regular starters at their respective batting order positions, numbers 9 and 10 were assigned to the Yankees two backup catchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yankees Uniforms and Logos|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/history/uniforms_logos.jsp|website=mlb.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while pitchers and backup fielders were assigned higher numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929 New York Yankees|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/roster.php?y=1929&amp;t=NYA|website=Baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today there is no rhyme or reason to a player's uniform number, players may pick their own number for personal reasons, or accept a number assigned by the team.

Catcher [[Benito Santiago]] is the only major league baseball player (or any major professional sportsman) known to have worn a leading zero; Santiago wore the number 09 from 1991 to 1994 in an effort to make his uniform more comfortable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.sbnation.com/2010/6/9/1509573/cubs-select-benito-santiago-jr-mlb-draft Cubs select Benito Santiago, Jr.] ''SB Nation'' (9 June 2010). Retrieved 22 September 2014. "insisted on wearing number ‘09’ because he claimed having the single digit in the middle of his jersey felt "weird" with the chest protector strap on top of it."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddie Gaedel]], the midget at the center of an infamous stunt by [[Bill Veeck]]'s [[St. Louis Browns]], is the only known major leaguer to have worn a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] ({{fraction|1|8}}, which he had borrowed from the Browns' batboy) as his jersey number.

==Canadian football==
[[Canadian football]] follows the same general rules as American football, with some minor exceptions.  In the original numbering system, offensive linemen wore numbers from 40–69 and numbers 70–79 were allocated to receivers. A rules change in 2008 switched numbers 40–49 from offensive linemen to eligible receivers.  Any eligible player, whether he is a quarterback, running back, receiver, or a kicker, can wear any eligible number. [[Doug Flutie]] wore his Boston College number of 22 when he played quarterback for the [[BC Lions]] and No. 20 for the [[Calgary Stampeders]].  Currently, numbers 1–49 and 70–89 are eligible while 50–69 are not. Numbers 90–99 are generally worn on defense although in the early days of the [[Canadian Football League]], 90s were common on offense. The number 0 is also allowed in the CFL. A defensive player can wear any number he chooses, regardless of the position he plays.

==Rugby league==
{{Further|Rugby league positions}}

In [[rugby league]] each of the thirteen positions on the field traditionally has an assigned shirt number, for example fullback is "1". In recent times squad numbering has been used for marketing purposes in the [[Super League]] competition. In Super League each player is given a squad number for the whole season, the first choice starting line-up at the beginning of the season will usually be given shirts 1–13 but as interchanges (substitutions) occur during the game and injuries etcetera occur during the season, it is less likely that the number a player wears will match the position they are playing.

Furthermore, a growing number of teams in both Australia and England (such as [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] and [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]]), as well as most major representative teams, have adopted the cricket custom of "club numbers", in which each player is given a unique number in the order of when he made his first senior appearance for a specific side. These numbers are typically small and embroidered above or below the club crest on a player's shirt.

==Rugby union==
{{further|Rugby union numbering schemes|Rugby union positions}}

When included in the starting line-up, a player's rugby shirt number usually determines their position. Numbers 1–8 are the 'forwards', and 9–15 the 'backs'. [[Rugby union]] even has a position named simply after the shirt normally worn by that player in the "Number 8" position. Several clubs (Leicester and Bristol particularly) used letters instead of numbers on shirts, although have now fallen into line with the rest of the clubs.

==Gaelic Games==
{{main|Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions}}
In [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[camogie]], the goal keeper generally wears the number 1 shirt, and the rest of the starting team wears numbers 2–15, increasing from right to left and from defence to attack: substitutes' numbers start from 16.

==Cricket==

The 1995–96 [[World Series Cup]] in Australia saw the first use of shirt numbers in international [[cricket]], with most players assigned their number and some players getting to choose their number, most notably [[Shane Warne]] wearing 23 as it was his number when he played junior [[Aussie Rules]] for [[St Kilda Football Club]]. Other countries soon adopted the practice, although players would typically have different numbers for each tournament, and it was several years later that players would consistently wear the same number year-round. [[Ricky Ponting]] (14) still uses the same number as in that initial season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/209641.html Cricinfo – Australian ODI shirt numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Player numbering was first used in the [[Cricket World Cup]] in 1999, where the [[captain (cricket)|captains]] wore the number 1 jersey and the rest of the squad was numbered from 2 to 15. An exception was that South African captain [[Hansie Cronje]] retained his usual number 5 with opener [[Gary Kirsten]] wearing the number 1 which he had also done previously.

Shirt numbers no longer remain exclusive to the [[Short form cricket|short forms of the game]], and navy blue numbers are now used on the playing whites in the [[Sheffield Shield]] to aid spectators in distinguishing players. However, a recent fashion that has been taken up by several nations is the process of giving a player making his Test debut an appearance number, along with his Test cap, for reasons of historical continuity. The number represents how many players have made their Test debuts including the one wearing it. If two or more players make their debut in the same match, they are given numbers alphabetically based on surname. For example, Thomas Armitage is Test player Number 1 for England. He made his debut in the very first Test Match, against Australia, on 15 March 1877, and was first in alphabetical order on England's team. [[Mason Crane]] made his debut for England on 4 January 2018 against Australia; his number is 683. These numbers can be found on a player's Test uniform, but it is always in discreet small type on the front, and never displayed prominently.

==Basketball==
[[File:Shaq and Nash.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Steve Nash]] wearing their numbers in the [[Phoenix Suns]].]]
American basketball leagues at all levels traditionally use single and double digits from 0 to 5 (i.e. 0, 00, 1–5, 10–15, 20–25, 30–35, 40–45, and 50–55).  The [[NCAA]] and most amateur competitions mandate that only these numbers be used. This eases non-verbal communication between referees, who use fingers to denote a player's number, and the official scorer. In college basketball, single-digit players' numbers are officially recorded as having a [[leading zero]]. Teams can have either a "0" or "00", but they cannot have both.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/sports/ncaabasketball/numerals-on-college-basketball-jerseys-you-can-count-them-on-one-hand.html|title=Crunching the Numbers: College Basketball Players Can’t Wear 6, 7, 8 or 9|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 March 2015|first=Zach|last=Schonbrun}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule about "0" and "00" also applies to the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;http://friends.mavs.com/profiles/blogs/drew-gooden-q-amp-a&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Utah Jazz]] center [[Greg Ostertag]] changed from "00" to "39" so [[Olden Polynice]] could wear No. 0 and in 2003, [[Washington Wizards]] center [[Brendan Haywood]] switched from No. 00 to No. 33 so [[Gilbert Arenas]] (who had the nickname "Agent Zero" already at this point) could wear #0. However, during the 2015–16 season, the [[Denver Nuggets]] played with two players wearing ''both'' 0 and 00 ([[Emmanuel Mudiay]] and [[Darrell Arthur]] respectively), with the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] ([[Kevin Love]] and [[Chris Andersen]] respectively) and [[Indiana Pacers]] ([[C. J. Miles]] and [[Aaron Brooks (basketball)|Aaron Brooks]] respectively) continuing the trend the following season.

The [[National Basketball Association]] has always allowed other numbers from 0 to 99, but use of digits 6 through 9 is less common than 0 through 5 since most players tend to keep the numbers that they had previously worn in college. However, with the increase in the number of international players, and other players who have been on national (FIBA) teams who change NBA teams and cannot keep their number with the previous team because another player has worn it or is retired, players have adopted such higher numbers ([[Patrick Ewing]] with No. 6 in [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]]). When [[Michael Jordan]] retired in 1993, the [[Chicago Bulls]] retired his 23; when he came out of retirement he chose to wear 45 until, during the 1995 NBA post-season, he went back to his familiar 23. Also, players cannot change numbers midseason, but they used to be able to ([[Andre Iguodala]] and [[Antoine Wright (basketball player)|Antoine Wright]] changed from No. 4 and No. 15 to No. 9 and No. 21 for [[Chris Webber]] and [[Vince Carter]], respectively). Since [[Kelenna Azubuike]] was inactive all season, [[Carmelo Anthony]] was able to wear Azubuike's No. 7 when traded to the [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] in 2011, but since [[Rodney Stuckey]] was active, [[Allen Iverson]] could not wear No. 3 when traded to the [[Detroit Pistons|Pistons]] in 2009. (Anthony would not have been able to wear his normal No. 15 anyway and would have had to trade jerseys; the Knicks have retired the jersey number.)

Up to 2014, players in [[FIBA]]-organized competitions for national teams, including the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] and [[FIBA World Championship for Women|Women's World Championship]], had to wear numbers from 4 to 15. Under FIBA rules, national federations could also allow any numbers with a maximum of 2 digits for their own competitions; this rule also applied in transnational club competitions, most notably the [[EuroLeague]].&lt;ref&gt;Official Basketball Rules 2008, FIBA, Art. 4.3.2&lt;/ref&gt; At present, players are allowed any numbers from 1 to 99, additionally 0 and 00.&lt;ref&gt;Official Basketball Rules 2014, FIBA, Art. 4.3.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handball==
In [[handball]] the number has to be at least 20&amp;nbsp;cm high in the back and 10&amp;nbsp;cm in the front.

According to the [[International Handball Federation]] the numbers from 1 to 99 should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ihf.info/files/Uploads/NewsAttachments/0_New-Rules%20of%20the%20Game_GB.pdf#page=16|title=IX.

The goalkeeper has often the number 12 or 1 also common is the number 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/trikotnummern-im-handball-die-glueckszahlen-a-746830.html|title=Die Glückszahlen|last=Boysen|first=Stefan|date=2011-02-24|website=Spiegel|language=German|trans-title=The lucky numbers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309165410/http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/trikotnummern-im-handball-die-glueckszahlen-a-746830.html|archive-date=2018-03-09|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field player has often the other numbers from 1 to 20. Sometimes the players has also the last two digits of the year of their birth.

The first group to use numbers on [[ice hockey]] players' uniforms is a matter of some debate. The [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] is sometimes credited with being the first to use numbered sweaters, but the [[National Hockey Association]], the predecessor of the [[National Hockey League]], is known to have required its players to wear numbered armbands beginning with the [[1911–12 NHA season|1911–12 season]], which may have come before that.&lt;ref name=impressions&gt;{{cite web|last=DeLaere|first=Matt|title=What's in a Number?|publisher=''Impressions''|date=17 August 2017|accessdate=2 March 2018|url=https://www.impressionsmagazine.com/digital-decorating/heat-transfer/whats-in-a-number/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patrick brothers who founded the PCHA put numbers on players' backs so they could sell programs in which the players were listed by their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vancouver brother sculpted game of hockey 100 years before Canucks vied for Cup|url=https://thehockeynews.com/news/article/vancouver-brothers-sculpted-game-of-hockey-100-years-before-canucks-vied-for-cup|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To start the [[1977–78 NHL season|1977–78 season]], the NHL placed into effect a rule that also required sweaters to display the names of the players wearing them, but [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] owner [[Harold Ballard]] initially refused to abide by it, fearing that he would not be able to sell programs at his team's games. The NHL responded by threatening to levy a fine on the team in February 1978, so Ballard started having names put on the jerseys but made them the same color as the background they were on, which for the team's road jerseys was blue. The League threatened further sanctions, and despite playing more than one game with their "unreadable" sweaters, Ballard's Maple Leafs finally complied in earnest by making the blue jerseys' letters white.&lt;ref name=impressions/&gt;

The very first jersey number to be retired in professional sports was that of an NHL player - [[Ace Bailey]], whose #6 was retired by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1934 following a career-ending fight with [[Eddie Shore]] during a game against the [[Boston Bruins]] in 1933. Shore injured Bailey under the mistaken impression that Bailey had hip-checked him when it was actually fellow Maple Leaf [[Rod Horner]]. To aid Bailey, the NHL hosted [[Ace Bailey Benefit Game|a benefit game between the Maple Leafs and an all-star team]], at which Maple Leafs owner [[Conn Smythe]] retired his number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Nick|title=Who Had the First Jersey Number to Be Retired in Sports?|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]|date=7 November 2014|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/59830/who-had-first-jersey-number-be-retired-sports|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers used in the National Hockey League===

{{incomplete section|more than just the use of the number 1 in here|date=August 2018}}
Historically, starting NHL [[goaltender]]s wore number 1. Popular belief holds that this was because the goaltender was the first player on the rink from the perspective of one standing in front of the net; this is also believed to be why replacement goaltenders would also wear the number. Further use of the number 1 among goaltenders can be attributed to adherence to tradition.&lt;ref name=goalie1&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinchevsky|first=Tal|title=Why goalies are increasingly ditching traditional No. 1|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=30 November 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/18268822/nhl-goalies-increasingly-ditching-traditional-no-1-other-numbers-their-sweaters|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the number 1 became less common among goaltenders, with only seven using it as of December 2016. One reason was that goaltenders increasingly followed the example set by the Toronto Maple Leafs' [[Terry Sawchuk]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]]' [[Patrick Roy]] after the NHL mandated that each team have two goaltenders in every game. In 1964, Sawchuk joined the Maple Leafs wearing 24 as the number 1 was already being used, but switched to 30, whereas Roy donned 33 as his team already had a player with the number 30, starting a trend of goaltenders using numbers in the 30s. Furthermore, seven franchises have retired the number 1—six in honor of players, and the [[Minnesota Wild]] in honor of its fanbase—making it unavailable. As a result, fewer goalies have chosen the traditional number 1 and instead have opted for more distinctive numbers, or numbers of their favourite goalies. Notable examples include [[Corey Crawford]] wearing 50 for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Braden Holtby]] wearing 70 for the [[Washington Capitals]], [[Sergei Bobrovsky]] wearing 72 for the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]], and [[Andrei Vasilevskiy]] wearing 88 for the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]].&lt;ref name=goalie1/&gt;

The NHL no longer permits the use of 0 or 00 as the League's database cannot list players with such numbers,&lt;ref name=goalie1/&gt; and in 2000 the League retired the number 99 for all member teams in honor of [[Wayne Gretzky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perfect setting: Gretzky's number retired before All-Star Game |publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated. Associated Press |date=6 February 2000 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/2000/nhl_allstar/news/2000/02/06/gretsky_99/ |accessdate=9 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112022319/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/2000/nhl_allstar/news/2000/02/06/gretsky_99/ |archivedate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last number to go unused in the NHL was 84, and  Canadiens forward [[Guillaume Latendresse]] became the first to wear it at the start of the 2006-07 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cazaneuve|first=Brian|date=25 October 2006|title=NHL's best by numbers|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/brian_cazeneuve/10/25/best.numbers/index.html|accessdate=9 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105061810/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/brian_cazeneuve/10/25/best.numbers/index.html|archivedate=5 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auto racing==

In most auto racing leagues, cars are assigned numbers.  The configuration of stock cars, however, makes the numbers much more prominent. (Aerodynamic [[open wheel racing|open-wheel]] cars don't have nearly the amount of flat surface that a [[stock car]] has.)  Numbers are often synonymous with the drivers that carry them.  [[Dale Earnhardt|Dale Earnhardt, Sr.]] is associated with the number 3 (although that number is actually associated more with its owner, [[Richard Childress]], who has taken the number out of reserve for his grandson [[Austin Dillon]], first in the [[Camping World Truck Series]], then in the [[Xfinity Series|Nationwide Series]], and finally in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]] beginning in [[2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2014]]), while [[Richard Petty]] is associated with Number 43, Wood Brothers Racing with Number 21, and [[Jeff Gordon]] to the Number 24.

===NASCAR===
[[File:Jeff Burton, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Jeff Burton]]'s car wearing n° 31 (2013).]]

In [[NASCAR]], numbers are assigned to ''owners'' and not specific ''drivers''. Drivers that spend a long time on a single race team often keep their numbers as long as they drive for the same owners. When drivers change teams, however, they take a new number that is owned by that team. [[Jeff Burton]], for example, raced for three teams from 1994 to 2013, and had four numbers in that time. In 1994 and 1995 he raced the Number 8 car, then owned by the Stavola Brothers. From 1996 to mid-2004 he raced for [[Roush Racing]], and drove the Number 99 car. After leaving Roush Racing for [[Richard Childress Racing]], he changed to car Number 30 (for the rest of the 2004 season) and drove Number 31 (also an RCR car) from 2005 to 2013. The Number 99 car he used to drive for Roush was driven by [[Carl Edwards]] from 2004 to 2014. When [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], having raced under Number 8 at Cup-level moved from DEI to [[Hendrick Motorsports]] he attempted to take the number with him. When that failed Hendrick was able to secure the Number 88 from [[Robert Yates Racing]].

===Formula One===
[[File:Tyrell Scheckter P34.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jody Scheckter]] running with n° 3 in 1976.]]

[[Formula One]] car numbers started to be permanently allocated for the whole season in 1974. Prior to this numbers were allocated on a race-by-race basis by individual organisers. From 1974 to the mid-1990s, the numbers 1 and 2 would be allocated to the reigning world champion and his teammate, swapping with the previous year's champions. Once numbers had been allocated, teams retained the same numbers from year to year, only exchanging for 1 and 2 when the drivers' World Championship was won. As a result, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] are infamous for having carried 27 and 28 for many years (every season from 1980 to 1989, and then again from 1991 to 1995), these numbers having originally been allocated to new entrant [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] in 1977 and passed to Ferrari when [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] replaced [[Jody Scheckter]] as World Champion after the 1980 season. Numbers were reallocated occasionally as teams departed and joined the series, but this scheme persisted until the late 1990s; one team, Tyrrell, kept the same numbers (3 and 4) throughout this period for every season from 1974 to 1995.

The system was changed again in 1996. From that point through 2013, numbers were assigned annually, first to the reigning World Champion driver (who received number 1) and then his team-mate (who received number 2); after that the numbers were assigned to [[List of Formula One constructors|constructors]] sequentially according to their position in the previous season's [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]], so that numbers were allocated (if the reigning champion is not driving for the reigning constructor's champion team) from 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and so on ([[Triskaidekaphobia|skipping 13]] with the seventh-placed team using 14 and 15). The only stipulation was that the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Champion]] was entitled to the number 1 car regardless of the constructor's results; this was relevant when the winning driver's team failed to win the Constructors Championship, or if the winning driver changed teams after winning the championship—for example, when [[Damon Hill]] moved to the [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] team for the [[1997 Formula One season|1997 season]].  This situation happened again in [[2007 Formula One season|2007]] when 2006 champion [[Fernando Alonso]] left Renault to join McLaren, earning him and his rookie teammate, [[Lewis Hamilton]], the numbers 1 and 2; and again in 2010 when [[Jenson Button]] moved to McLaren from [[Brawn GP]].

[[File:Jules Bianchi 2014 Singapore FP2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jules Bianchi]]'s #17 has not been re-issued after he died in 2015 from an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.]]
If a driver wins the World Championship but does not defend his title the following season, tradition dictates that the racing number 1 is not allocated; the reigning World Champion constructor then receives numbers 0 and 2. [[Damon Hill]] received car number 0 in [[1993 Formula One season|1993]] due to [[Nigel Mansell]]'s move to [[Champcars|the CART PPG Indy Car World Series]] in the U.S., and again in [[1994 Formula One season|1994]], this time due to [[Alain Prost]]'s retirement. This tradition has not always been in place; [[Ronnie Peterson]] received number 1 in the [[1974 Formula One season|1974]]; although he did not win the championship the [[1973 Formula One season|previous year]], due to [[Jackie Stewart]]'s retirement, his [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] team was allowed to keep Number 1 as they had won the constructors' title.

The [[2014 Formula One season|2014 season]] was the first with a new system, in which drivers are assigned numbers for their entire careers. Under this system, similar to that used in [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]], drivers may choose any (available) number from 2 to 99, with number 1 reserved for the reigning Drivers' Champion. The champion's "regular" number is placed in reserve while that driver is using number 1, preventing other drivers from using that number. Since [[Jules Bianchi]]'s fatal accident at [[Suzuka Circuit|Suzuka]] in 2014, Formula One has not issued Bianchi's number 17 as a mark of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Parkes|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/120039|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720184816/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/120039|title=The FIA will retire Jules Bianchi's number 17 from Formula 1|work=Autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Media]]|date=20 July 2015|accessdate=20 July 2015|archive-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar system is used in many European-style championships at national and international level; the champion receives number 1, and others are allocated either by a driver's placing in the previous season (third place the year before equates to race number 3) or by the team's placing in the Team/Constructor championship.  If the championship driver does not return, the championship team will be allowed to use number 1.

===IndyCar===
During the [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] era of Indy car racing, it was traditional for the defending champion to carry No. 1 during the season. This rule had one exception; at the [[Indianapolis 500]]. The previous year's Indy 500 winner traditional utilized No. 1 in the Indy 500 that particular year. The defending national champion would have to select a different car number for Indy only, unless he happened to also be the defending Indy 500 winner, sometimes swapping numbers with the other affected driver. There were typical exceptions to the rule, as some defending champions decided against using No. 1, preferring instead to maintain their identity with their favorite number.

During the [[Champ Car|CART]] era, car numbers 1–12 were assigned based on the previous season's final points standings. Number 13 was not allowed, and starting in 1991, No. 14 was formally assigned to [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises]]. The remaining numbers 15–99 were generally allocated to the rest of the teams on first-come, first-served basis. Again at Indianapolis only, the No. 1 was set aside for use by the defending Indy 500 winner, if he so choose to use it, since it was a USAC-sanctioned race.

Some teams in the top 12 chose not to utilize their assigned number, instead preferring a personal favorite number. For example, Penske has used 2 and 3 since 1994. Also, [[Newman-Haas Racing]] exchanged the #2 with [[Walker Racing]] to get the #5 after [[Nigel Mansell]] joined the team in 1993, #5 having been his long-used number in Formula One. "Unused" numbers from 1–12 reverted to the general pool, and could be used by any of the remaining teams.

In the current [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] era, No. 1 is set aside for use by the previous season's championship entry. However, the majority of champions since 1998 have ignored the tradition. Teams and/or sponsors often request to keep their normal numbers in order to maintain their team identity, similar to NASCAR, and some drivers have used their car numbers in social media accounts. The 1998 IndyCar championship team was A. J. Foyt Enterprises, which kept the traditional #14, while [[Panther Racing]] kept the #4 identified with team minority owner [[Jim Harbaugh]], who wore #4 for the majority of his NFL career (except for his year [[Carolina Panthers|in Charlotte]], where [[John Kasay]] wore that number, he wore Foyt's #14). In one case, at the [[2012 Indianapolis 500]], defending national champion [[Dario Franchitti]], who normally used #10 and had the right to #1, chose to use #50 at that race for the 50-year anniversary of sponsor [[Target Corporation|Target]], which has been car owner Chip Ganassi's sponsor since 1990.

In the [[2009 Firestone Indy 300]], British driver [[Alex Lloyd (racing driver)|Alex Lloyd]] used number 40202, in reference to the [[phone text message]] number of a campaign to donate to [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]].

==Other sports==
[[File:Bicycle of Ellen van Dijk, Ronde van Drenthe.jpg|thumb|Number 21 on the road bicycle of [[Ellen van Dijk]] at the [[2014 Ronde van Drenthe World Cup|Ronde van Drenthe]].]]
Other sports which feature players with numbered shirts, but where the number that may be worn is not relevant to the player's position and role are:

* [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]]
* [[Cycling]]
* [[Field hockey]]
* [[Lacrosse]]
* [[Roller derby]]
* [[Volleyball]]

In [[water polo]], players wear [[swim cap]]s bearing a number. Under [[FINA]] rules, the starting goalkeeper wears Number 1, the substitute goalkeeper wears Number 13, and remaining players wear numbers 2 though 12. In [[road bicycle racing]], numbers are assigned to [[cycling team]]s by race officials, meaning they change from race to race. Each team has numbers in the same group of ten, excluding multiples of ten, for example 11 through 19 or 21 through 29. If a race has squads of smaller than nine, each still uses numbers from the same group of ten, perhaps 31 through 36 where the next squad will have 41 through 46. Usually, but not always, the rider who wears a number ending in 1 is the squad's leader and the one who will try for a high overall placing. If the race's defending champion is in the field, he or she wears number 1.

In [[floorball]] all players are required to have number 1–99 on their jersey, but goalies are the only players who can wear number 1.

== {{anchor|Retired}} Retired numbers ==
{{main|Retired number}}
[[File:Lakers vs Nuggets 2013-01-06 (15).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Los Angeles Lakers]] retired numbers displayed at the Staples Center in 2013.]]

Retiring the uniform number of an athlete is an honor a team bestows on a player, usually after the player has left the team, retires from the game, or has died. Once a number is retired, no future player from the team may use that number, unless the player so-honored permits it. Such an honor may also be bestowed on players who had their careers ended due to serious injury. In some cases a number can be retired to honor someone other than a player, such as a manager, owner or a fan. For example, the [[Boston Celtics]] retired the squad number 1 in honor of the team's original owner [[Walter A. Brown]].

The '''Sector 16 Stadium''' ({{lang-pa|ਸੇਕ੍ਟਰ ੧੬ ਸਟੇਡਿਯਮ}}, {{Lang-hi|सेक्टर १६ स्तादियम}}) is a [[cricket]] stadium in [[Chandigarh]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[India]].

It hosted its first [[One Day International|ODI match]] in January 1985 and its only [[Test Cricket|Test match]] in 1990.

It has hosted only four matches. The likes of [[Kapil Dev]], [[Chetan Sharma]] and [[Yograj Singh]] started playing cricket at the Sector 16 Stadium. It fell out of favour to the nearby [[Punjab Cricket Association Stadium]], ([[Mohali]]) cricket ground.

After the stadium in [[Mohali]] was built, there was no [[first-class cricket]] at the Sector 16 Stadium for 10 years before [[Haryana cricket team|Haryana]] ended the barren spell by playing the [[Ranji Trophy]] Plate League semi-final in 2004/05. But after 14 years, [[India cricket team|India]] and [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] played a match  in October 2007.

'''Francisc von Neuman Stadium''' was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], [[Romania]]. It was used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and was the home ground of [[FC UTA Arad]], one of the most successful teams in Romanian club football. The stadium used to hold up to 7,287 people, all on seats, and was built in 1944.

In 2014 the stadium was demolished to make way for a new, modern, exclusively for football, all-seater stadium expected to be open by the end of 2019. The new stadium will have a capacity of 12.700 seats, and will also include offices, a press club, a press center, V.I.P. hospitality, a restaurant and a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uta-arad.ro/stiri/uta-ar-putea-reveni-pe-stadionul-francisc-neuman-in-toamna-lui-2017/3139&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stadium was opened on 1 September 1946 with a match between [[UTA Arad]] - Ciocanul București 1-0. At that time, the stadium was considered the most modern in the country. It is named after a local Jewish aristocrat, Francisc von Neumann, a [[baron]] who owned several businesses in Arad and who personally sponsored the construction of the stadium and the founding of the team. While studying in England, he became a fan of the London-based football team [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], hence the similar team colours.&lt;ref&gt;http://jurnalul.ro/vechiul-site/old-site/suplimente/editie-de-colectie/arad-orasul-lui-neuman-19505.html#&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the stadium went through a major overhaul, when the municipality invested over 700.000 euro for new seats (dropping its capacity from approximately 10.000 on benches), main stand structural repairs, new [[cloakroom]]s, a anti-doping control room, an emergency medical room, a VIP sector, new multimedia sector and a new sound system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancada.com/informatii-utile-3/stadionul-francisc-von-neumann-236.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a 1400 lux density floodlight system was installed as well as a new electronic scoreboard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aradon.ro/nocturna-in-teste/news-20080506-10552110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the municipality presented plans for a new 12.700 capacity all-seater stadium to be built on the exact site of this arena.

'''Valley View Casino Center''' (formerly '''San Diego Sports Arena''' and '''iPayOne Center''') is an [[indoor arena]] located at Sports Arena Blvd in [[Point Loma]], [[San Diego]], [[California]].

The arena seats 12,000 for [[arena football]], 12,920 for [[ice hockey]], 14,500 for [[basketball]] and [[tennis]], 5,450 for amphitheater concerts and stage shows, 8,900-14,800 for arena concerts, 13,000 for ice shows and the [[circus]] and 16,100 for [[boxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hockey.ballparks.com/WHA/SanDiegoMariners/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, ''Amusement Business/Billboard Magazine'' listed the arena as the "#1" facility in the nation for venues seating 10,001 to 15,000 seats. The same magazine ranked the arena as #2 in 2002 and as the #5 facility in 2003. In 2007, the arena was ranked as the #5 facility by Billboard Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Arena rankings, quoted in San Diego Sports Arena's web site's History page [http://www.sandiegoarena.com/info.php]; Amusement Business Magazine folded in 2006 so the primary source cannot be accessed [http://www.amusementbusiness.com/amusementbusiness/index.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201094451/http://www.amusementbusiness.com/amusementbusiness/index.html |date=2007-12-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[U-T San Diego]]'' named the arena #3 on its list of the 50 most notable locations in San Diego sports history.&lt;ref name="sut130706"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Maffei |work=[[U-T San Diego]] |title=Sports site No. 3: San Diego Sports Arena |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/jul/06/travel-top-50-sites-sports-arena-john-ooden/ |date=July 6, 2013 |accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and access==
The arena is located at 3500 Sports Arena Blvd., which is slightly southwest of the interchange of [[Interstate 5 in California#San Diego area|Interstate 5]] and [[Interstate 8 in California|Interstate 8]]. This places it in the [[Midway, San Diego|Midway]] neighborhood, approximately 10 minutes away from [[San Diego International Airport]] by car&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegoarena.com/directions.php&lt;/ref&gt; and about a mile away from the [[Old Town Transit Center]] by foot.&lt;ref&gt;https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=old+town+transit+center&amp;daddr=3500+Sports+Arena+Boulevard,+San+Diego,+CA+92110&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=%3BFfvN8wEdzHsD-Q&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=w&amp;sll=32.754185,-117.205796&amp;sspn=0.008752,0.014656&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=32.753499,-117.205689&amp;spn=0.008752,0.014656&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming rights==
The venue's original name was the '''San Diego International Sports Center'''. The name was later renamed the "San Diego Sports Arena", which it kept until 2004. In the latter year and until 2007, iPayOne, a [[real estate]] savings company based in [[Carlsbad, California]], held the arena's [[naming rights]]. The deal was worth $2.5 million over five years.
[[File:San Diego Sports Arena sign.jpg|thumb|x200px|The sign as seen from the drive-thru of the [[Chick-fil-A]] in the parking lot]]
On April 8, 2007, Ernie Hahn II, CEO of Arena Group 2000 which holds the leasing rights to the property, announced that AG2000 has defaulted iPayOne out of the remainder of the contract for non payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20070407-9999-1b7ipayone.html|title=iPayOne taking no new listings|accessdate = 2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hahn, iPayOne has been in and out of default in payments – mostly [[balloon payments]] – in the last year.  In addition, iPayOne appears to be halting operations and is accepting no new listings. As a result, the name was changed back to the San Diego Sports Arena.

On October 12, 2010, it was announced that the arena's name had been changed to the "Valley View Casino Center", under a $1.5 million, 5-year agreement between the arena operator AEG, the [[San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians]] and the city of San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;http://signonsandiego.com/news/2010/oct/12/sports-arena-gets-new-name-valley-view-casino-cent/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The arena was built in 1966 by [[Robert Breitbard]], a local football hero who played for Hoover High School and [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State]], for $6.4 million.&lt;ref name="sandiegoarena.com"&gt;[http://www.sandiegoarena.com/history.php San Diego Sports Arena's web site, History page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornerstone184"&gt;{{cite book|title=San Diego: California's Cornerstone|author=Engstrand, Iris|page=184|publisher=[[Sunbelt Publications]]|date=2005|isbn=978-0-932653-72-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seating capacity could seat 13,000 hockey spectators or 13,700 for basketball games.&lt;ref name="Cornerstone184"/&gt;

The arena opened on November 17, 1966, when more than 11,000 pro hockey fans watched the [[San Diego Gulls (1966–74)|San Diego Gulls]] (then a member of the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]]) win their season opener, 4&amp;ndash;1, against the [[Seattle Totems]].&lt;ref name="sandiegoarena.com"/&gt;

===1972 GOP National Convention===
In 1972, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] considered the arena for its National Convention. With little warning, however, the GOP decided to hold the convention in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]]. To compensate for this blow to local prestige, then-mayor (and future California governor) [[Pete Wilson]] gave San Diego the by-name of "America's Finest City",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegohistory.org/timeline/timeline3.htm#1960 San Diego Historical Society website, Time Line Section]&lt;/ref&gt; which is still the city's official moniker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiego.gov/ City of San Diego's official web page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Venezuela]]''' was one of the fourteen nations that made their first official appearance at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer 
Olympics]] at the '''[[1948 Summer Olympics]]''' held in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. The [[National Olympic Committee]] for Venezuela was recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1935 but it did not send any Venezuelan representation because it was sceptical about the possibilities of their athletes against European competitors. [[Julio César León]], the first and only representative of Venezuela in those games had to get support from the British Embassy in Caracas in order to travel to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La odisea del primer venezolano en los Olímpicos|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2012/06/120605_juegos_olimpicos_londres_2012_venezuela_1948_julio_cesar_leon_az.shtml|publisher=BBC Noticias|accessdate=20 August 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuela at the 1948 London Summer Games|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/VEN/summer/1948/|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
