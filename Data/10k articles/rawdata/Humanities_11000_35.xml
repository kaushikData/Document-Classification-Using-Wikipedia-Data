'''Ananuri''' ({{Lang-ka| ანანური }}) is a [[castle]] complex on the [[Aragvi River]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], about {{convert|45|mi|0|abbr=off}} from [[Tbilisi]].

==History==
Ananuri was a castle and seat of the ''[[eristavi]]s'' ([[Duke]]s) of [[Duchy of Aragvi|Aragvi]], a feudal dynasty which ruled the area from the 13th century. The castle was the scene of numerous battles.

In 1739, Ananuri was attacked by forces from a rival duchy, commanded by Shanshe of Ksani and was set on fire. The Aragvi clan was massacred. However, four years later, the local peasants revolted against rule by the Shamshe, killing the usurpers and inviting King [[Teimuraz II of Kakheti|Teimuraz II]] to rule directly over them. However, in 1746, King Teimuraz was forced to suppress another peasant uprising, with the help of King [[Erekle II]] of [[Kakheti]]. The fortress remained in use until the beginning of the 19th century. In 2007, the complex has been on the tentative list for inclusion into the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5222/ UNESCO tentative list]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The fortifications consist of two castles joined by a crenellated [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]. The upper fortification with a large square tower, known as ''Sheupovari'', is well preserved and is the location of the last defense of the Aragvi against the Shamshe. The lower fortification, with a round tower, is mostly in ruins.

Within the complex, amongst other buildings, are two churches. The older Church of the Virgin, which abuts a tall square tower, has the graves of some of the Dukes of Aragvi. It dates from the first half of the 17th century, and was built of brick. The interior is no longer decorated, but of interest is a stone [[baldaquin]] erected by the widow of the Duke Edishera, who died in 1674.

The larger Church of the Mother of God(''Ghvtismshobeli''), built in 1689 for the son of Duke Bardzem. It is a central dome style structure with richly decorated façades, including a carved north entrance and a carved [[grapevine cross]] on the south façade. It also contains the remains of a number of [[fresco]]es, most of which were destroyed by the fire in the 18th century.

'''Andrea Doucet''' (born c.1960) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] social scientist and writer. She is professor of sociology and [[Gender Studies|gender studies]] at [[Brock University]], and holds the [[Canada Research Chair]] in gender, work and care. She was also the editor of the academic journal ''[[Fathering (journal)|Fathering]]''.

==Early life==
Doucet was born in [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], Canada in 1960,&lt;ref name="stcatharinesstandard_2011"&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Fraser |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2011/10/13/brock-gets-world-renowned-working-family-researcher |title=Brock gets world-renowned working family researcher |newspaper=St Catharine's Standard |date=October 13, 2011 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019121945/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2011/10/13/brock-gets-world-renowned-working-family-researcher |archive-date=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she grew up in an anglophone family. Her sister is [[BBC]] journalist [[Lyse Doucet]] {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1p3v2soHToC&amp;pg=PR11|title=Do Men Mother?: Fathering, Care, and Domestic Responsibility| first=Andrea|last=Doucet| page=xi|isbn=9780802085467| year=2006| publisher=University of Toronto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Doucet completed her BA in political theory at [[York University]] in Toronto and her MA in international development studies at Carleton University. She earned her [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in social and political sciences in 1995 from Cambridge University.

==Career==
In 1995 and 1996 Doucet was a post doctoral fellow and lecturer at Cambridge. From 1995 to 1998 she was an assistant professor of sociology at [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|St. Mary's University]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. At Carleton University, she was professor of sociology from 1998 to 2011.

She has been professor of sociology and [[Gender Studies|gender studies]] at [[Brock University]] since 2011. She has also held the [[Canada Research Chair]] in gender, work and care since 2011. Doucet is recognized as an "expert in caregiving and work-life balance".&lt;ref name="brocku_2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://brocku.ca/brock-news/2011/10/brock%E2%80%99s-newest-canada-research-chair-studies-work-life-balance/ |title=Brock's newest Canada Research Chair studies work-life balance |date=October 12, 2011 |access-date=March 23, 2018 |publisher=The Brock News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was an editor of the now defunct academic journal, ''[[Fathering (journal)|Fathering: a Journal of Theory, Research, and Practice about Men as Fathers]]''.&lt;ref name="carleton_2009"/&gt;

In 2009, as sociology professor at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Doucet undertook a study entitled "Bread and Roses Project"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.breadandrosesproject.ca/ |title=the Bread and Roses Project: Conversations with a New Generation of Breadwinning Moms and Caregiving Dads |first=Andrea |last=Doucet}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she tracked couples in which women were the primary earners using data from both Canada and the United States. In a 2010 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Doucet observed that, "With women taking on more earning and men taking on more caring, there's a lot of shifting and juggling. You can't just reverse the genders."&lt;ref name="NYT_Parker_Pope_2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/fashion/24marriage.html |title=She Works. They're Happy. |first=Tara |last=Parker-Pope |date=January 22, 2010 |access-date=March 23, 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''[[New York Post]]'' Doucet explained that "The ambiguity over who does what, and its accompanying stress, is to be expected as gender roles change."The 'mancession' has been difficult on couples. Many have told me that they did not expect to be in this situation. To suddenly have it sprung upon you because of job loss can lead to a rapid and stress-filled learning curve for both men and women."&lt;ref name="NYPOst_2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2010/11/09/rise-of-the-power-wives/ |newspaper=New York Post |title=Rise of the power wives |first=Sara |last=Stewart |date=November 9, 2010 |access-date=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2013 book  ''Bread and Roses — And the Kitchen Sink'',&lt;ref name="Doucet_Bread_2013"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bread and Roses — And the Kitchen Sink |date=September 2013 |isbn=9781442695368 |publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the study, Doucet said, "It's been just a steady progression of women's education going up and employment going up, but then quite a remarkable leap in women being primary breadwinners or shared primary breadwinners relates to the changes in the economy."&lt;ref name="postmedia_Proudfoot_2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=More women bringing home the bacon, more men cooking it |first=Shannon |last=Proudfoot |newspaper=Postmedia News |date=October 7, 2010 |url=http://www.canada.com/More+women+bringing+home+bacon+more+cooking/3637234/story.html|access-date=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
From 1998-2002 she was the principal investigator of "Fathers as Primary Caregivers" which received a Canada [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] (SSHRC),&lt;ref name="carleton_2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carleton.ca/socanth/faculty/doucet.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808184817/http://www.carleton.ca/socanth/faculty/doucet.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-08 |title=Andrea Doucet, Sociologist and Writer |publisher=Carleton University |date=2009 |accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canadian federal research funding agency.

[[File:Blacksmith at work02 less contrast.jpg|thumb|A [[blacksmith]] working [[iron]] with a hammer and anvil]]
[[File:3 tourist helping artist blacksmith in finland.JPG|thumb|A [[blacksmith]] working with a [[sledgehammer]], assistant (striker) and Lokomo anvil in [[Finland]]]]
[[File:Enclume.jpg|thumb|An anvil at the medieval construction site of [[Guédelon Castle|Guédelon]] in [[Treigny]], France.]]
An '''anvil''' is a [[metalworking]] [[tool]] consisting of a large block of metal (usually forged or cast steel), with a flattened top surface, upon which another object is struck (or "worked").
 
Anvils are as massive as is practical, because the higher their [[inertia]], the more efficiently they cause the [[energy]] of striking tools to be transferred to the work piece. In most cases the anvil is used as a [[forge|forging]] tool. Before the advent of modern [[welding]] technology, it was a primary tool of metal workers.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Robert. Archaeology and the Origins of Philosophy. Publisher: State University of New York Press  2010. {{ISBN|978-1438431659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King James Version ISAIAH 41:7&lt;/ref&gt;

The great majority of modern anvils are made of cast or forged [[steel]] (the latter is stronger) that has been heat treated. Inexpensive anvils have been made of [[cast iron]] and low quality steel, but are considered unsuitable for serious use as they deform and lack rebound when struck.

Because anvils are very ancient tools and were at one time very commonplace, they have acquired symbolic meaning beyond their use as utilitarian objects. They have even found their way into popular culture including episodes of ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', the name of a [[Anvil (band)|heavy metal band]], and usage by [[blacksmith]]s as well as jewelers and metal smiths.

== Structure ==&lt;!-- [[Hardy hole]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Anvil, labelled en.svg|thumb|A single-horn anvil]]
[[Image:Fciron-anvil face.jpg|thumb|A top view of a well used London pattern anvil]]

The primary work surface of the anvil is known as the face.  It is generally made of hardened steel and should be flat and smooth with rounded edges for most work.  Any marks on the face will be transferred to the work.  Also, sharp edges tend to cut into the metal being worked and may cause cracks to form in the workpiece.  The face is hardened and tempered to resist the blows of the smith's hammer, so the anvil face does not deform under repeated use.  A hard anvil face also reduces the amount of force lost in each hammer blow.  Hammers, tools, and work pieces of hardened steel should never directly strike the anvil face with full force, as they may damage it; this can result in chipping or deforming of the anvil face.

The horn of the anvil is a conical projection used to form various round shapes and is generally unhardened steel or iron.  The horn is used mostly in bending operations.  It also is used by some smiths as an aid in "drawing down" stock (making it longer and thinner).  Some anvils, mainly European, are made with two horns, one square and one round.  Also, some anvils are made with side horns or clips for specialized work.

The ''step'' is that area of the anvil between the "horn" and the "face". It is soft and is used for cutting; its purpose is to prevent damaging the steel face of the anvil by conducting such operations there and so as not to damage the cutting edge of the chisel, though many smiths shun this practice as it will damage the anvil over time.

The ''hardie hole'' is a square hole into which specialized forming and cutting tools, called [[Hardy tool]]s, are placed.  It is also used in punching and bending operations.

The ''[[pritchel]] hole'' is a small round hole that is present on most modern anvils.  Some anvils have more than one.  It is used mostly for punching.  At times, smiths will fit a second tool to this hole to allow the smith more flexibility when using more than one anvil tool.

==Placement==
An anvil needs to be placed upon a sturdy base made from an impact and fire resistant material.  It requires being fastened firmly to the base, so it will not move when struck with a hammer.  A loose anvil is extremely unsafe, as it can fall off the base and is an ineffective forging tool.  Common methods of attaching an anvil are spikes, chains, steel or iron straps, clips, bolts where there are holes provided, and cables.  A smith would use whatever was at hand, as long as it held the anvil firmly in place.   The anvil is placed as near to the forge as is convenient, generally no more than one step from the forge to prevent heat loss in the work piece.

The most common base traditionally was a hard wood log or large timber buried several feet into the floor of the forge shop floor.  This was done to make the anvil immobile when heavy forging and bending were done upon the anvil.  In the industrial era cast iron bases became available.  They had the advantage of adding additional weight to the anvil, making it more stable while making the anvil movable.  These bases are highly sought after by collectors today.  When concrete became widely available, there was a trend to make steel reinforced anvil bases by some smiths, though this practice has largely been abandoned.  In more modern times many anvils have been placed upon bases fabricated from steel, often a short thick section of a large I-Beam.  In addition, bases have been made from dimensional lumber bolted together to form a large block or steel drums full of oil-saturated sand to provide a damping effect.  In recent times tripod bases of fabricated steel have become popular with some smiths.

There are many designs for anvils, which are often tailored for a specific purpose or to meet the needs of a particular smith. For example, there were anvils specifically made for farriers, general smiths, cutlers, chain makers, armorers, saw tuners, coach makers, coopers, and many other types of metal workers. Such designs have originated in diverse geographic locations.

The common [[smith (metalwork)|blacksmith]]'s anvil is made of either forged or cast steel, forged wrought iron with a hard steel face or cast iron with a hard steel face. [[Cast iron]] anvils are not used for forging as they are incapable of standing up to the impact and will crack and dent. Also, cast iron anvils without a hard steel face do not have the rebound that a harder anvil would and will tire out the smith. Historically, some anvils have been made with a smooth top working face of hardened steel welded to a cast iron or wrought iron body, though this manufacturing method is no longer in use. At one end, the common smith's anvil has a projecting conical ''bick'' (''beak'', ''horn'') used for hammering curved work pieces. The other end is typically called the heel. Occasionally, the other end is also provided with a bick, partly rectangular in section. Most anvils made since the late 18th century also have a [[hardy hole]] and a [[pritchel hole]] where various tools, such as the anvil-cutter or hot chisel, can be inserted and held by the anvil. Some anvils have several hardy and pritchel holes, to accommodate a wider variety of [[hardy tools]] and [[pritchel]]s. An anvil may also have a softer ''pad'' for chisel work.

An anvil for a [[power hammer]] is usually supported on a massive anvil block, sometimes weighing over 800 tons for a 12-ton hammer; this again rests on a strong foundation of timber and masonry or concrete.

An anvil may have a marking indicating its weight, manufacturer, or place of origin.  American-made anvils were often marked in pounds. European anvils are sometimes marked in kilograms. English anvils were often marked in hundredweight, the marking consisting of three numbers, indicating [[hundredweight]], quarter hundredweight and pounds. For example, a 3-1-5, if such an anvil existed, would be 3×112{{nbsp}}lb + 1×28{{nbsp}}lb + 5&amp;nbsp;lb = 369&amp;nbsp;lb ≈ 168&amp;nbsp;kg.

Cheap anvils made from inferior steel or cast iron and often sold at retail hardware stores, are considered unsuitable for serious use, and are often derisively referred to as "ASOs", or "anvil shaped objects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anvilfire.com/index.php?bodyName=/FAQs/ebay_fraud_ASO.htm |publisher=Anvilfire.com |title= Ebay Fraud: Purchasing an ASO (Anvil Shaped Object)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur smiths have used lengths of railroad rail, forklift tines, or even simple blocks of steel as makeshift anvils.

A metalworking [[vise (tool)|vise]] may have a small anvil integrated into its design.

==History==
Anvils were first made of stone as a lithic [[stone tool]], then [[bronze]], and later [[wrought iron]]. As [[steel]] became more readily available, anvils were faced with it. This was done to give the anvil a hard face and to stop the anvil from deforming from impact. Many regional styles of anvils evolved through time from the simple block that was first used by [[Metalsmith|smiths]].  The majority of anvils found today in the US are based on the London pattern anvil of the mid-19th century.

The wrought iron steel faced anvil was produced up until the early 20th century.  Through the 19th and very early 20th centuries, this method of construction evolved to produce extremely high quality anvils. The basic process involved forge-welding billets of wrought iron together to produce the desired shape. The sequence and location of the forge-welds varied between different anvil makers and the kind of anvil being made. At the same time cast iron anvils with steel faces were being made in the United States.  At the dawn of the 20th century solid [[Steel casting|cast steel]] anvils began to be produced, as well as two piece forged anvils made from closed die [[forging]]s.  Modern anvils are generally made entirely from steel.

There are many references to anvils in ancient Greek and Egyptian writings, including [[Homer]]'s works. They have been found at the [[Calico Early Man Site]] in [[North America]].

Anvils have since lost their former commonness, along with the smiths who used them.  Mechanized production has made cheap and abundant manufactured goods readily available. The one-off handmade products of the blacksmith are less economically viable in the modern world, while in the past they were an absolute necessity.  However, anvils are still used by blacksmiths and metal workers of all kinds in producing custom work. They are also essential to the work done by [[farrier]]s.

==In ethology and general biology==
[[File:Blacksmith anvil ganson.svg|alt=|thumb|Shape of a modern anvil.]]
Application of the principles of the anvil predate historical human practice, there being a fair number of examples among various species of animals. Some of the most thoroughly documented [[Ethology|ethological]] examples of [[tool use by animals]] in the wild were of [[chimpanzee]]s observed using hammers of wood or stone to crack nuts, with logs or rocks serving as anvils.&lt;ref&gt;Boesch, Christophe and Boesch, Hedwige.

Pub: Behaviour 83 pp. 265-286 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Less formally, birds such as some species of [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] have been known for centuries to crack the shells of the snails they feed on, by striking them on rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, James. The Scots Magazine, Volume 43 1781 pp. 348-349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/quarterlyjourna02blacgoog The Quarterly Journal of Agriculture. VOL. VII.  JUNE 1836— MARCH 1837.

Anvils being by some definitions "''‘proto’ or ‘borderline’ tools..., ... not directly manipulated and not detached from the substrate''", some workers argue that their use is less demanding of brain power than more sophisticated tools, and they accordingly are likely to be used by organisms of a wider range of organisation of the [[central nervous system]] than say, probes, hammers, hooks and scoops. The latter would be limited to species with correspondingly advanced mental powers.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Louis. Reader, Simon M.  Sol, Daniel. Brains, Innovations and Evolution in Birds and Primates.

==In popular culture==

===Historically===
[[Anvil firing]] is the practice of firing an anvil into the air using [[gunpowder]]. It has been popular in [[California]], the [[eastern United States]] and the [[southern United States]], much like how [[fireworks]] are used today. There is a growing interest in re-enacting this "ancient tradition" in the US, which has now spread to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME) has the anvil in its coat of arms. The AME's first services were held in a blacksmith's shop.

===Television and film===
A typical metalworker's anvil, with horn at one end and flat face at the other, is a standard prop for [[Cartoon physics|cartoon gags]], as the epitome of a heavy and clumsy object that is perfect for dropping onto a villain. This visual metaphor is common, for example, in [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]]' ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' shorts, such as those with [[Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.wired.com/2012/12/acme-poster-kickstarter/ | title=Elaborate Poster Puts All of Wile E.

===Musical instruments===

[[File:Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods p 004.jpg|thumb|Mime at the anvil by [[Arthur Rackham]]]]
Wagner's ''Ring des Nibelungen'' is notable in using the anvil as [[pitched percussion]]. The vast majority of extant works use the anvil as [[unpitched]]. However '''tuned anvils''' are available as musical instruments, albeit unusual. These are not to be confused with the "sawyers' anvils" used to "tune" big circular saw blades. Steel anvils are used for tuning for use as musical instruments, because those based partly on cast iron and similar materials give a duller sound; this is actually valued in industry, as pure steel anvils are troublesomely noisy, though energetically more efficient. The hammer and anvil have enjoyed varying popularity in orchestral roles. [[Robert Donington]] pointed out that [[Sebastian Virdung]] notes them in his book of 1510, and [[Martin Agricola]] includes it in his list of instruments (Musica instrumentalis deudsch, 1529) largely as a compliment to [[Pythagoras]]. In pre-modern or modern times anvils occasionally appear in operatic works by Berlioz, Bizet, Gounod, Verdi, and Wagner for example. Commonly pairs of anvils tuned a third apart are used.

[[File:Tuned Anvils from Emil Richards Collection.jpg|thumb|A [[chromatic]] set of tuned anvils]]
In practice modern orchestras commonly substitute a steel bar or other suitable steel structure that is easier to tune than an actual anvil, although a visibly convincing anvil-shaped prop may be shown as desired. In ''Das Rheingold'' Wagner scored for nine little, six mid-sized, and three large anvils, but orchestras seldom can afford instrumentation on such a scale.&lt;ref name="RDon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Donington |first=Robert |title=Music and its Instruments |work=University Paperbacks Third edition |year=1970 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=39I9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Robert+Donington|isbn=9780416722802 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baʿal Berith''' ("Lord of the Covenant") and '''El Berith''' ("God of the Covenant") are two gods, or one god, worshiped in [[Shechem]], in ancient [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=DDD&gt;{{citation |last=Mulder |first=M.J. |contribution=Baal-berith |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;pg=PA141 |title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible |editor-first=K. |editor-last=van der Toorn |editor2-first=Bob |editor2-last=Becking |editor3-first=Pieter Willem |editor3-last=van der Horst |display-editors=0 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=978-90-04-11119-6 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;pg=PA141 141–144] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "covenant" (Hebrew ''Berith'') appears also in [[Ugarit]]ic texts (second millennium BCE) as ''brt'', in connection with [[Baʿal]],&lt;ref name=DDD/&gt; and perhaps as '''Beruth''' in [[Sanchuniathon]]'s work.

== In the Bible ==
[[Book of Judges|Judges]] is the only Biblical book that mentions Baʿal Berith and El Berith.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Judges|8:33|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jud4&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|9:4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jud46&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|9:46|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether they are separate forms of the gods Baʿal and [[El (god)|El]] or are actually one god. Scholars suppose that he or they may have been worshipped for connections to fertility and vegetation, based on another passage in Judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Judges|9:27|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also unclear is what covenant or covenants are referred to by the name ''Berith''. Elsewhere, some of the Shechemites are called "men of Hamor";&lt;ref name=jud28&gt;{{bibleref|Judges|9:28|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this is compared to "sons of Hamor", which in the ancient Middle East referred to people who had entered into a covenant sealed by the sacrifice of a ''hamor'', an ass.&lt;ref name=DDD/&gt; "Children" or "sons of Hamor" itself appears in Genesis&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Gen.|33:19|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Joshua,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Joshua|24:32|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in both of which, as in Judges,&lt;ref name=jud28/&gt; Hamor is called the father of Shechem. Genesis also&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Gen.|34|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; features a man named Hamor who ruled in the area of Shechem&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Gen.|33:18|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a son named ''Shechem''.

Rabbinic tradition equates Baʿal Berith with [[Beelzebub]], the god of [[Philistines|Philistine]] [[Ekron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=4&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Berith |title=JewishEncyclopedia.com - BAAL-BERITH |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sanchuniathon's account ==
In his [[euhemerism|euhemeristic]] account of the [[Phoenicia]]n deities, Sanchuniathon says that a certain [[Elyon|Elioun]], called also "the Most High", and a female named ''Beruth'' dwelt in the neighbourhood of [[Byblos]], on the coast of present-day [[Lebanon]]. They had two children—a male called Epigeius/Autochthon/Sky and a daughter called Earth. Because of the latter pair's beauty, the sky and the earth, respectively, were named after them. According to Sanchuniathon it is from Sky and Earth that [[El (god)|El]] and various other deities are born, though ancient texts refer to El as creator of heaven and earth. A relationship with Hebrew ''bərīt'' ("covenant") or with the city of [[Beirut]] have both been suggested for ''Beruth''. The [[Hittite mythology|Hittite theogony]] knows of a primal god named [[Alalu]] who fathered Sky (and possibly Earth) and who was overthrown by his son Sky, who was in turn overthrown by his (Sky's) son [[Kumarbi]]. A similar tradition seems to be at the basis of Sanchuniathon's account.

== Rabbinic literature ==
The idol Baʿal Berith, which the Jews worshipped after the death of [[Gideon]], was identical, according to the Rabbis, with [[Beelzebub|Baʿal Zebub]], "the lord of flies," the god of [[Ekron]] (II [[Books of Kings|Kings]] i. 2). He was worshipped in the shape of a fly; and Jewish tradition states that so addicted were the Jews to his cult that they would carry an image of him in their pockets, producing it, and kissing it from time to time. Baʿal Zebub is called Baʿal Berith because such Jews might be said to make a covenant ([[Hebrew]]: ''berith'') of devotion with the idol, being unwilling to part with it for a single moment ([[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shab.]] 83b; comp. also [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanh.]] 63b). According to another conception, Baʿal Berith was an obscene article of [[idolatry|idolatrous]] worship, possibly a simulacrum [[Priapus|priapi]] (Yer. Shab. ix. 11d; 'Ab. Zarah iii. 43a). This is evidently based on the later significance of the word "berit," meaning [[circumcision]].

==Christianity==
According to the ''Admirable History'' written by Father [[Sebastien Michaelis]] in 1612, Baʿal Berith once possessed a nun in Aix-en-Provence.  In the process of the exorcism, Baʿal Berith volunteered not only his own name and the names of all the other demons possessing her, but the names of the saints who would be most effective in opposing them.

'''Bertrand Newton''' is a fictitious character created by Australian comedian [[Charles Firth (comedian)|Charles Firth]] for his satirical book [[American Hoax]], the name being a play on Australian television celebrity [[Bert Newton]]. In this book Newton was described as the founder the fictitious American [[527 organization|527]] [[Political Action Committee|Political Action Committee (PAC)]] ''AdBack'', and also author of an influential booklet on [[political campaign|political advertising]] titled ''How to Change the World One Ad at a Time'' (2004).

==Biography==
Born in the USA in 1972, Newton started out as a student activist in the early 1990s, during which time he got involved in the anti-[[Gulf War]] "[[Opposition to the Iraq War|No Blood For Oil]]" coalition at Berkley Campus of [[UCLA]]. The formation of this group split the movement and ultimately led to his expulsion from the Californian Peace Coalition. He later studied at [[Oxford University in England]] and became an advertising executive.

Newton became wealthy creating ads for technology companies during the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]], before quitting advertising during the post-boom downturn. He then began using his talents and wealth to use the power of modern advertising to bring about political change to make the world a better place.

==''Adback''==
''AdBack'' was one of a raft of non-profit companies that were formed to support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential elections]]. The motto of the organization was "dedicated to changing the world one ad at a time". The non-profit company designed advertisements for several [[niche markets]] during the elections, including the award winning "GayBack" Television commercial that aired in the crucial swing state of [[Ohio]].

Newton's philosophy on political advertising, and organising methods, have their roots in organizations like [[MoveOn.org]], and have been closely connected to [[George Soros]]'s Open Society Foundation project.

'''BookMooch''' is an international, on-line book exchange community founded by [[John Buckman]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, T. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/23/DDHE18BKE7.DTL&amp;type=books Book lovers trade tomes through Web sites]. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. June 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership, which has grown to around 74,000 in over 90 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckman |first=John |url=http://blog.bookmooch.com/2008/06/30/new-york-daily-news-story/ |title=New York Daily News Story « BookMooch Blog |publisher=Blog.bookmooch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005105544/http://blog.bookmooch.com/2008/06/30/new-york-daily-news-story/ |archivedate=2008-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is open to anyone and is free. There is heavy community participation in its running and organisation.  About 500,000 book titles are available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookmooch.com/about/stats_show?chart=number_of_asins_listed&amp;type=chart |title=BookMooch charts - Books listed for giving: total number |publisher=Bookmooch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 2,000 books are swapped per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckman |first=John |url=http://blog.bookmooch.com/2008/03/25/is-bm-growing/ |title=Is BM growing? « BookMooch Blog |publisher=Blog.bookmooch.com |date=2008-03-25 |accessdate=2011-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208150529/http://blog.bookmooch.com/2008/03/25/is-bm-growing/ |archivedate=2010-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==

BookMooch allows its users to exchange books using a points system.  Members earn points by adding books to their inventories, by sending books to other members and by providing feedback when they receive books.  The points earned can then be used to “buy” books from other members.  All books “cost” the same number of points, with a multiple point surcharge for international mooches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookmooch.com/about/points |title=BookMooch Points |publisher=Bookmooch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Point exchange takes place at the beginning of any transaction, allowing “currency” to circulate quickly. Members may opt to send books only within their own country, worldwide, or worldwide upon request.

There is no waiting period for a new member to begin to participate in BookMooch.  Setting up an initial trading inventory will earn enough points to begin trading immediately.  Forum members encourage new members by keeping an eye out for new inventories and posting links to them.

Member pages contain biographical information, conditions of trade and links to their transaction histories.  [[Web widget|Widgets]] allow members to personalise their pages and listings.  Links to [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] sites in various countries allow members to enter books into the system quickly.  A notification system e-mails members when a book on their Wishlist becomes available and directs them to the Mooch screen for that book.

Members may choose to donate points to charity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookmooch.com/charity |title=Charity |publisher=Bookmooch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Books for Prisons, public libraries, education and counselling services, children's and military book charities.  Members may add to the charity list if they have a particular charity they want to support.  The charities can then use their points to acquire books.

==Organization==

John Buckman continues to maintain and add features to the site and run it with the assistance of a small, international admin team who participate in the forums and resolve any issues.  The Official BookMooch Blog&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://blog.bookmooch.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504011926/http://blog.bookmooch.com/ |archivedate=2007-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; records his travels, new BM projects, ideas and solicits input and feedback. Members of the forum contribute help and advice, feature suggestions, book talk, chat and “special offers.”

==Member contributions==

Members are active in suggesting and contributing features to the system. Member-run, associated BookMooch activities include:

*The BookMooch Angel Network – In response to increases in postal rates which  discourage some users from mailing abroad, a group of volunteer “angels” exist who will mooch books within their own country and send them on to members in other countries;
*The BookMooch Support Group is for members who commit to reading at least two of their stacked-up To Be Read piles during the month and post reviews to the Support Group's blog, The Smoke Lives.
*The BookMooch Journal Project – Journals/Notebooks posted by a member for Mooching.  Each member who mooches contributes artwork or as directed by the originator and adds the book to their own inventory to be Mooched.
*BookMooch Friends is a Yahoo social group for getting to know one another outside the trading environment
*BookMooch Barter  - where members can swap things other than books
*BookMooch Lottery – an occasional activity where members pool points.  Half the pool goes to a random selection of members; half to charity.

Under discussion is a member-run Bank of BookMooch where members who are short of points can borrow and repay them later.  Members also write documentation and help features and maintain the BookMooch Wiki.

The site has an [[API]] allowing developers to create their own web applications.

==Transparency==

Transparency of behaviour is a key component of BookMooch.  Recipients of books assign feedback to each transaction and a history for each member is open to view.  A balanced ratio of mooching to giving must be maintained by each member in order to continue to receive books. Both the forums and the feedback/e-mail systems generally allow users to resolve any differences amicably.

==Income==

BookMooch is a [[for-profit corporation]] wholly owned by Buckman, but it does not charge membership or use fees. Revenue is generated from users' voluntary fiscal contributions and from commissions when users purchase a book from Amazon.com through referral by the site. As of December 2006, for approximately every 30 books mooched, one book is purchased from Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckman |first=John |url=http://blog.bookmooch.com/2006/12/14/some-stats-for-bookmooch-about-amazon-book-sales/ |title=some stats for BookMooch about Amazon book sales « BookMooch Blog |publisher=Blog.bookmooch.com |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2011-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208092150/http://blog.bookmooch.com/2006/12/14/some-stats-for-bookmooch-about-amazon-book-sales/ |archivedate=2010-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clover Site''' (46CB40) is a [[Fort Ancient culture]] [[archeological site]] located near [[Lesage, West Virginia|Lesage]] in [[Cabell County, West Virginia|Cabell County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. It is significant for its well-preserved remains of a late prehistoric/[[Protohistory|protohistoric]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village. The site's unique assemblage has made it the [[type site]] for the Clover Phase of the Madisonville horizon of the Fort Ancient culture.

The site was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;

==Description==
The site is located {{convert|20|mi|km}} north of [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] on a high flood terrace of the Ohio River, within the [[Green Bottom Wildlife Management Area]]. At 5 acres, it was a large village with a semi-circular layout. It had a centrally located [[plaza]] surrounded by habitation areas, very similar to other Fort Ancient sites, although a [[palisade]] such as ones found at other sites has yet to be found at Clover. The site once was described as having three raised [[mound]] like areas {{convert|5|ft|m}} high and {{convert|200|ft|m}} wide, but they can no longer be located. Investigations at the site have produced Native American produced shell-tempered ceramics, stone tools, bone tools, and ornaments. Items of European manufacture, including brass and copper ornaments and glass [[trade beads]] have definitively dated the upper levels of the site to the [[Protohistory|protohistoric period]]. The artifact assemblages found at the site by avocational archaeologists such as John J. Adams and S.F. Dunett in the 1920s and professional investigations in the 1940s by [[James Bennett Griffin|James B. Griffin]], enabled Griffin to propose the Clover Phase of the Madisonville complex that spanned the years 1550 to 1600, a way of identifying this protohistoric time period at other contemporary sites in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fort Ancient Aspect|first=James B.|last=Griffin|authorlink=James Bennett Griffin|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other investigations were undertaken at the site in the 1980s by [[Nicholas Freidin]] of [[Marshall University]], who conducted an archaeological field school there from 1984 to 1988. Items excavated from the site are now part of the John Adams Collection of artifacts curated by the [[Huntington Museum of Art]].

==Connection to other sites==
Other sites with significant Clover Phase habitations include the [[Lower Shawneetown]] Site, the [[Buffalo Indian Village Site|Buffalo Site]], the [[Hardin Village Site]], the [[Mariemont Embankment and Village Site|Madisonville Site]], the [[Rolfe Lee Site]], Logan Site and Marmet Village Site. Pottery excavated from many of these different sites, with types including Madisonville Plain, Cordmarked, or Smoothed Cordmarked wares, have a unique feature(a 2-twist direction to the cordage) which is rarely found in pottery from sites to the west of the Clover Site and are relatively common at sites to its east. This suggest that Clover site people maintained closer contact with sites such as Buffalo, Gue Farm, Marmet, and Rolfe Lee than with other sites that were to its west. Other exotic artifacts found at the site, such as [[shell gorget]]s associated with the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]], [[Mississippian culture pottery|pottery effigy bowls]], and figurines show a connection with [[Mississippian culture]] villages in what is now eastern [[Tennessee]].

The '''Coffin Texts''' are a collection of [[ancient Egypt]]ian funerary [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] written on [[coffin]]s beginning in the [[First Intermediate Period]]. They are partially derived from the earlier [[Pyramid Texts]], reserved for royal use only, but contain substantial new material related to everyday desires, indicating a new target audience of common people. Ordinary Egyptians who could afford a coffin had access to these funerary spells and the [[pharaoh]] no longer had exclusive rights to an afterlife.&lt;ref name=Lichtheim&gt;{{cite book |last= Lichtheim |first=Miriam|title=Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol 1|publisher=University of California Press|year=1975|location=London, England|isbn=0-520-02899-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BOD&gt;{{cite book | last = Goelet | first = Dr. Ogden | title = The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Going Forth by Day| publisher = Chronicle Books | location = San Francisco | year = 1994|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the modern name of this collection of some 1,185 spells implies, they were mostly inscribed on [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] coffins. They were also sometimes written on tomb walls, [[Stele|stelae]], [[canopic chest]]s, [[papyrus|papyri]] and [[Death mask|mummy mask]]s. Due to the limited writing surfaces of some of these objects, the spells were often abbreviated, giving rise to long and short versions, some of which were later copied in the [[Book of the Dead]].&lt;ref name=BOD /&gt;

== Content ==
In contrast to the [[Pyramid Texts]] which focus on the [[Heaven|celestial realm]], the coffin texts emphasize the subterranean elements of the afterlife ruled by the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Osiris]], in a place called the [[Duat]]. An Osirian afterlife is offered to everyone, and the deceased is even referred to as "the Osiris-[name]". This subterranean realm is described as being filled with threatening beings, traps, and snares with which the deceased must contend. The spells in the Coffin Texts allow the deceased to protect themselves against these dangers and "dying a [[second death]]".

A new theme recorded in the coffin texts is the notion that all people will be [[Judgement (afterlife)|judged]] by [[Osiris and his council]] according to their deeds in life. The texts allude to the use of a [[Weighing of the Heart|balance]], which became the pivotal moment of judgment in the later [[Book of the Dead]]. The texts address common fears of the living, such as having to do manual labor, with spells to allow the deceased to avoid these unpleasant tasks.

They combine [[ritual action]]s intended as protection, expressions of aspiration for a blessed existence after death and of the [[wikt:transformation|transformation]]s and [[Reincarnation|transmigrations]] of the [[Ba (Egyptian soul)|ba]] and [[akh]] and so on.  In addition there are descriptions of the [[Duat|land of the dead]], its landscape and inhabitants.  These include the [[Sekhet Hotep]] (Field of offerings or peace), the [[paths of Rostau]] and the [[abode of Osiris]].

=== Examples ===

Coffin text 1130 is a speech by the sun god Ra, who says:
:''Hail in peace! I repeat to you the good deeds which my own heart did for me from within the serpent-coil, in order to silence strife...''
:''I made the four winds, that every man might breathe in his time..''
:''I made the great inundation, that the humble might benefit by it like the great...''
:''I made every man like his fellow; and I did not command that they do wrong. It is their hearts which disobey what I have said...''
:''I have created the gods from my sweat, and the people from the tears of my eye.''

Coffin text 1031 is spoken by the deceased, who says:
:''I shall sail rightly in my bark, I am lord of eternity in the crossing of the sky.''
:''I am not afraid in my limbs, for Hu and Hike overthrow for me that evil being.''
:''I shall see light-land, I shall dwell in it...''

:''Make way for me, that I may see Nun and Amun! For I am that Akh who passes by the guards...''

:''I am equipped and effective in opening his portal!''
:''As for any person who knows this spell, he will be like Re in the eastern sky, like Osiris in the netherworld. He will go down to the circle of fire, without the flame touching him ever!''

== The Book of Two Ways ==

A few coffins from the Middle Egyptian necropolis of el-Bersheh ([[Deir el-Bersha]]) contain unique graphical representations of the realm of the afterlife, along with spells related to the journey of the deceased through the Duat. This collection, called ''the Book of Two Ways'', was the first example of an Ancient Egyptian map of the underworld. The Book of Two Ways is a precursor to the [[New Kingdom]] books of the underworld as well as the Book of the Dead, in which descriptions of the routes through the afterlife are a persistent theme. The two ways depicted are the land and water routes, separated by a lake of fire, that lead to Rostau and the abode of Osiris.&lt;ref name=BOD/&gt;

{{Linguistics}}

'''Cognitive linguistics''' ('''CL''') is an interdisciplinary branch of [[linguistics]], combining knowledge and research from both [[psychology]] and linguistics. It describes how language interacts with cognition, how language forms our thoughts, and the evolution of language parallel with the change in the common mindset across time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition|last=Robinson|first=Peter|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-0-805-85352-0|location=|pages=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Merriam-Webster, the word "cognitive" is defined as "of, relating to, being, or involving conscious intellectual activity (such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering)". Merriam-Webster also defines linguistics as "the study of human speech including the units, nature, structure, and modification of language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|year=2003|isbn=978-0-87779-809-5|location=|pages=240, 724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining those two definitions together to form cognitive linguistics would provide the notion of the concepts and ideas discussed in the realm of CL. Within CL, the analysis of the conceptual and experiential basis of linguistic categories is of primary importance. The formal structures of language are studied not as if they were autonomous, but as reflections of general conceptual organization, categorization principles, processing mechanisms, and experiential and environmental influences.

Since cognitive linguistics sees language as embedded in the overall cognitive capacities of human beings, topics of special interest for cognitive linguistics include: the structural characteristics of natural language categorization (such as [[prototypical]]ity, systematic [[polysemy]], [[cognitive model]]s, [[Mind|mental]] imagery, and [[conceptual metaphor]]); the functional principles of linguistic organization (such as iconicity and naturalness); the conceptual interface between [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] (as explored by [[cognitive grammar]] and [[construction grammar]]); the experiential and pragmatic background of language-in-use; and the relationship between [[language]] and [[thought]], including questions about [[linguistic relativity]] and conceptual universals.

What holds together the diverse forms of cognitive linguistics is the belief that linguistic knowledge involves not just knowledge of the language, but knowledge of the world as mediated by the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, cognitive linguistics argues that language is both [[Embodied philosophy|embodied]] and [[situated]] in a specific [[Bioregion|environment]].

== History ==
Cognitive linguistics is a relatively modern branch of linguistics. It was founded by [[George Lakoff]] and [[Ronald Langacker]]. Lakoff coined the term "cognitive linguistics" in 1987 in his book ''"Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things"'', one of his most famous writings. Lakoff had already previously written many publications discussing the role of various cognitive processes involved in the use of language. Some of these previous publications include "The Role of Deduction in Grammar"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|first=|date=1971|title=The Role of Deduction in Grammar. In Fillmore and Langendoen|url=|journal=Studies in Linguistic Semantics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Linguistics and Natural Logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reidel|first=|date=1972|title=Linguistics and Natural Logic|url=|journal=Semantics in Natural Language|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he published the paper ''"Cognitive Grammar: Some Preliminary Speculations"'', in which he also coined the term "[[cognitive grammar]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G. Lakoff, H. Thompson|first=|date=1975|title=(with H. Thompson) Dative Questions in Cognitive Grammar. In Functionalism,|url=|journal=Chicago Linguistic Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the field of cognitive linguistics had emerged, it was criticized by many prominent linguists. However, by the end of the 1980s, the field had attracted the attention of many people and started to grow.

The journal ''Cognitive Linguistics'' was established in 1990 as the first journal specialized in research in that field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Linguistics Reader|last=Benjamin Berge, [[Vyvyan Evans]], Jörg Zinken|first=|publisher=Equinox|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three central positions ==
Cognitive linguists deny that the [[mind]] has any module for language-acquisition that is unique and autonomous. This stands in contrast to the stance adopted by [[Noam Chomsky]] and others in the field of [[generative grammar]]. Although cognitive linguists do not necessarily deny that part of the human linguistic ability is innate, they deny that it is ''separate'' from the rest of cognition. They thus reject a body of opinion in cognitive science suggesting that there is evidence for the [[Modularity of mind|modularity]] of language. Departing from the tradition of [[truth-conditional semantics]], cognitive linguists view meaning in terms of conceptualization. Instead of viewing meaning in terms of models of the world, they view it in terms of [[mental space]]s.

They argue that knowledge of linguistic phenomena — i.e., phonemes, morphemes, and syntax — is essentially [[concept]]ual in nature. However, they assert that the storage and retrieval of linguistic data is not significantly different from the storage and retrieval of other knowledge, and that use of language in understanding employs similar cognitive abilities to those used in other non-linguistic tasks.

== Three dogmas of embodiment ==
Cognitive linguistics suffers from three defective dogmas, which are the scope of much of the criticism CL receives. These three dogmas are from the hypotheses of embodiment engendered by CL.
# Embodiment as an eliminative reductionism:  Sociocultural linguistics is an interdisciplinary science that conceptualize the linguistics as a resultant of the interaction of language with social and cultural components. However, cognitive linguistics empirical methodologies somehow contradict this. Lakoff's Neural Theory of Language asserted that “''cognitive linguistics is not cognitive linguistics if it ignores relevant structure about the brain,”'' where brain’s structure imposes its superpositions, image schemas, and universal primitives onto language. The main objection to this concept is that the excessive focus on the brain structure, anatomically and functionally, will eliminate the socio-cultural theories of language. That is because you are studying the brain outside its “natural environment”. 
# Embodiment as temporally static:  This dogma complements the first one. We are live creatures, our brain is a dynamic and organic organ, and the development of the brain across time is a critical factor in determining the brain functions, the structure of the brain, and the molecular processes that govern it. Brain functions suffer a lot of biological variabilities; it varies across age; children, adults, and aging brain, it varies in right-handed versus left-handed people, in certain injuries, and evolutionarily over generations. Thus, since brain function and structure are dynamic, then language must be dynamic too. However, results from cognitive linguistics, so far, do not take the temporal progression into consideration. It merely describe facts about the use of language under certain solid conditions.
# Embodiment as consciousness (or as unconscious):  There is a common misconception that studying a mental process means we are actually “conscious” of it. Nevertheless, that is not the case in cognitive linguistics. For example, our brain slices sound waves into phonemes unconsciously. Such process is studied using techniques like EEG which is not informative about whether neurolinguistics processes are conscious or not.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics: Current Applications and Future Perspecitves|last=Kristiansen|first=Gitte|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=2006|isbn=978-3-11-018951-3|location=|pages=119–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two key commitments ==
Two basic commitments were described by George Lakoff in 1990. These two commitments are the basis of orientation and approach followed by cognitive linguists:
# The Generalization Commitment: The aim of the generalization commitment is to pinpoint the broadest generalizations. Thus, molding and understanding general rules that fit all aspects and characteristics of human language. Since this commitment seeks generalization of principles of language, the previous ways of studying the language, like semantics (the meaning of words and meaning), phonology (sound), and morphology (word structure) won’t be suitable, because there is little room for generalization.
# The Cognitive Commitment: The cognitive commitment aim is to characterize the general principles of used language that are consistent with what is known about brain anatomy and functions from other sciences. So, this core philosophy of this commitment is that rules of the used language should agree with what is known about cognition from other sciences, especially psychology and cognitive neuroscience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Areas of study ==

Cognitive linguistics is divided into three main areas of study:
* [[Cognitive semantics]], dealing mainly with [[lexical semantics]], separating semantics (meaning) into meaning-construction and knowledge representation.
* [[Cognitive approaches to grammar]], dealing mainly with syntax, morphology and other traditionally more grammar-oriented areas.
* [[Cognitive phonology]], dealing with classification of various correspondences between morphemes and phonetic sequences.

Aspects of cognition that are of interest to cognitive linguists include:
* [[Construction grammar]] and [[cognitive grammar]].
* [[Conceptual metaphor]] and [[conceptual blending]].
* [[Image schema]]s and [[Force Dynamics|force dynamics]].
* [[Concept]]ual [[organization]]: [[Categorization]], [[Metonymy]], [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|Frame semantics]], and [[Iconicity]].
* [[Construal]] and [[Subjectivity]].
* [[Gesture]] and [[sign language]].
* [[Linguistic relativity]].
* [[Cultural linguistics]].

Related work that interfaces with many of the above themes:
* Computational models of metaphor and language acquisition.
* [[Cognitive model#Language acquisition|Dynamical models]] of language acquisition
* [[Conceptual semantics]], pursued by generative linguist [[Ray Jackendoff]], is related because of its active ''psychological realism'' and the incorporation of prototype structure and images.

Cognitive linguistics, more than generative linguistics, seeks to mesh together these findings into a coherent whole. A further complication arises because the terminology of cognitive linguistics is not entirely stable, both because it is a relatively new field and because it interfaces with a number of other disciplines.

Insights and developments from cognitive linguistics are becoming accepted ways of analysing literary texts, too. [[Cognitive poetics]], as it has become known, has become an important part of modern stylistics.

==  Controversy and Noam Chomsky's view ==

There is significant peer review and debate within the field of linguistics regarding cognitive linguistics. Critics of cognitive linguistics have argued that most of the evidence from the cognitive view comes from the research in pragmatics and semantics, and research in metaphor and preposition choice. They suggest that cognitive linguists should provide cognitive re-analyses of topics in syntax and phonology that are understood in terms of autonomous knowledge (Gibbs 1996).

There is also controversy and debate within the field concerning the representation and status of idioms in grammar and the actual mental grammar of speakers. On one hand it is asserted that idiom variation needs to be explained with regard to general and autonomous syntactic rules. Another view says such idioms do not constitute semantic units and can be processed compositionally (Langlotz 2006).

In his lectures and many of his publications, [[Noam Chomsky]] discussed the cognitive components that are related to the languages and its use -- in other words, studying language as a branch of [[cognitive science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-01|title=Structures, Not Strings: Linguistics as Part of the Cognitive Sciences|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661315002326|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=19|issue=12|pages=729–743|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.09.008|issn=1364-6613}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thinks that the two fields address language aspects that are complementary to each other. However, he believes that his [[generative grammar]] linguistic theory and cognitive linguistic philosophical foundations oppose each other. He also believes that cognitive linguistics needs to accept some foundation from the theory of generative grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=46089|title=Chomsky on Cognitive Linguistics: An Interview (pp. 1-8)|website=www.novapublishers.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Content curation''' is the process of gathering information relevant to a particular topic or area of interest. Services or people that implement content curation are called [[curator]]s. Curation services can be used by businesses as well as end users.

==Concept==

[[Museum|Museums]] and [[Art_museum|galleries]] have curators to select items for collection and display. There are also curators in the world of media, for instance DJs of radio stations tasked with selecting songs to be played over the air.

==Methods==

Content curation can be carried out either manually or automatically or by combination of them. In the first case, it's done by specially designated curators. In the second case, it's done using one or more of the following:

* Collaborative filtering
* Semantic analysis
* Social rating

=== Collaborative filtering ===

[[Collaborative filtering]] is a method of forecasting often used in [[Recommender system|recommendation systems]]. This principle is based on the axiom that evaluations made by users in the past are predictive of evaluations that they will make in the future.

Collaborative filtering can either be based on votes and views of a given social community, as it's done on [[Reddit]] and [[Digg]], or  the end user's own prior activity, as it's done on [[YouTube]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].

=== Semantic analysis ===

[[Semantic analysis (knowledge representation)|Semantic analysis]] examines the relationship between the various elements and sources of information found in a given document. The system compares some of the factors or all the information sources topics and terms. This method uses the principles of factor analysis to analyze  relationships between the studied phenomena and objects.

This approach has been successfully implemented by services like [[Stumbleupon]], which break up content according to topic, subtopic, and category. [[Trapit]] uses semantic analysis in combination with user feedback and AI technology to refine content selections for its users.

=== Social rating ===

This method employs user ratings and recommendations to select content. The system finds someone with interests similar to the end user and bases its recommendations on their activity. This method of selection is widely used on social sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Flipboard]].

Parameters for determining the social ranking are generally based on actions such as shares, votes, likes, etc., keeping in mind the time that these activities are carried out once the content is published.The more there are such activities in a shorter time, the higher rating this content gets.

"Social curation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Catherine|last2=Zarro|first2=Michael|title=Social curation on the website Pinterest.com|journal=Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2012|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1002/meet.14504901189}}&lt;/ref&gt; services like [[Pinterest]] allow users to share and discuss their curated collections of found content.

The '''Defense Media Activity''' ('''DMA''') is a [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) field activity. It provides a broad range of high-quality multimedia products and services to inform, educate, and entertain Department of Defense audiences around the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Our Mission", http://www.dma.mil/, retrieved 2013-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Defense Media Activity is located on [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]]. DoD field activities are established as DoD components by law, by the President, or by the Secretary of Defense to provide for the performance, on a DoD-wide basis, of a supply or service activity that is common to more than one Military Department when it is determined to be more effective, economical, or efficient to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/510001p.pdf "Department of Defense Directive 5100.01, Functions of the Department of Defense and Its Major Components"], dated December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  DMA operates as a separate DoD Component under the authority, direction and control of the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs|Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs]].

==History==
The Defense Media Activity can trace its organizational lineage to the first publication of the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' newspaper produced by Union soldiers during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], in 1861. The DMA is one in a long line of media related organizations established, consolidated or subsumed within the military departments and defense department.  DMA was established as a result of the BRAC 2005 decisions.

===BRAC 2005===
{{Main|BRAC 2005}}
In 2005, as part of the Base Realignment and Closure 2005 analysis, the Defense Department recommended consolidating the media-related organizations of the Military Departments into a single organization and co-locating it with the American Forces Information Service (an existing DoD field activity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/brac/pdf/pt2_07_hsao.pdf "Department of Defense Base Realignment and Closure Report"], Volume I, Part 2 of 2: Detailed Recommendations, May 2005, page H&amp;SA - 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission|Defense Base Realignment and Closure(BRAC) Commission]] accepted the DoD recommendation and included the recommendation in its report to the President on September 8, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brac.gov/docs/final/BRACReportcomplete.pdf "2005 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission Report"], page 212. Retrieved 2013-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, 2005, the President approved the BRAC Commission recommendations and forwarded them to the United States Congress. On September 20, 2005, the U.S. Congress failed to disapprove the BRAC Commission's recommendations. Under the provisions of the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-510) the recommendations were effectively "approved".

The approved BRAC actions were to:
* Realign Fort Belvoir, Virginia, by relocating ''[[Soldiers Magazine]]'' to Fort Meade, Maryland.
* Realign Anacostia Annex, [[District of Columbia]], by relocating the Naval Media Center to Fort Meade, Maryland.
* Realign 2320 Mill Road, a leased installation in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]], by relocating Army Broadcasting-Soldier Radio/TV to Fort Meade, Maryland.
* Realign 103 Norton Street, a leased installation in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]] by relocating Air Force News Agency and the Joint Hometown News Service to Fort Meade, Maryland.
* Close 601 North Fairfax Street, a leased installation in Alexandria, Virginia, by relocating the [[American Forces Information Service]] and the Army Broadcasting-Soldier Radio/TV to Fort Meade, Maryland.
* Consolidate ''Soldier Magazine'', Naval Media Center, Army Broadcasting-Soldier Radio/TV, and the Air Force News Agency-Army/AirForce Hometown News Service into a single DoD Media Activity at Fort Meade, Maryland.

===Establishment===
In September 2007, the deputy defense secretary recognized that the BRAC 2005 decision would result in two field activities co-located at Fort Meade – the American Forces Information Service and DMA – and directed several actions.&lt;ref&gt;Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum, “Establishment of the Defense Media Activity”, dated September 24, 2007. http://www.dma.mil/Portals/2/newsevents/OSD14945-07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consolidate American Forces Information Service with DMA
* Include the internal media elements of the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] that were not addressed in the BRAC 2005 decision
* Establish DMA on January 1, 2008
* Transfer the funds and people from the legacy organizations to DMA on October 1, 2009

DMA’s chartering directive, DoD Directive 5105.74, Defense Media Activity, was published on December 18, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;DoD Directive 5105.74, "Defense Media Activity", dated December 18, 2007, http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/510574p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

DMA was formally established on January 1, 2008, and the people and funding from the predecessor organizations was transferred to DMA on October 1, 2008.  The elements required to move to Fort Meade by the BRAC 2005 decision remained in their facilities as their facility at Fort Meade was designed and constructed.  The building design was completed in September 2008.

On March 13, 2009, the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], Baltimore District, awarded a $56,195,000 contract to Hensel Phelps Construction Co. of [[Chantilly, Virginia|Chantilly]], Virginia, to construct DMA’s headquarters and media production center Fort Meade, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, [http://www.dma.mil/portals/2/Documents/09-06DMAContractAwardwithimages.pdf "News Release"], dated March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 185,870 square-foot facility built to house approximately 660 personnel. The building was completed in May 2011 and organizations began moving into the facility in June 2011.  The move was completed in August 2011. DMA elements located in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., [[Tobyhanna Army Depot]], [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], [[California]], and all overseas locations remained in place.

==Organization And Functions==
Organization and Functions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dma.mil/Portals/2/Documents/DMAStrategicPlanFY14-17_D4F0.pdf "Defense Media Activity Strategic Plan, Fiscal Years 2014-2017"], August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
DMA is composed of a headquarters and seven operating components.

The [[American Forces Radio and Television Service|American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS)]] component delivers, via the American Forces Network (AFN), U.S. radio and television news, information, and entertainment programming to active, guard, and reserve military service members, DoD civilians and contract employees, and their families overseas, on board Navy and Coast Guard ships, and to other authorized users.  Includes radio and television stations in military communities in Europe, Pacific and the Middle East; and include its central broadcasting hub, the AFN Broadcast Center at [[March Air Reserve Base]] in Riverside, California.

The '''[[Defense Information School]]''' provides joint-service training to Defense military and civilian personnel in the career fields of Public Affairs and Visual Information.  The school is located at Fort Meade, Maryland.

The '''Defense Visual Information''' component manages the Defense Department’s visual information records, provides visual information services to other DoD components and manages the Joint Combat Camera program.  It operates the Defense Imagery Management Operations Center (DIMOC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseimagery.mil/about/dimoc.html "About Us"], retrieved 2013-10-5.&lt;/ref&gt; centered at Fort Meade, Maryland, with elements at [[March Air Reserve Base]] in Riverside, California, and [[Tobyhanna Army Depot]] in Pennsylvania.

The '''Production''' component produces media and visual information products to the internal DoD family (active, guard, and reserve military service members, dependents, retirees, DoD civilians, and contract employees) and external audiences through all available media, including motion and still imagery; print; radio; television; web and related emerging internet, mobile, and other communication technologies. Also includes communication of messages and themes from senior DoD leaders in order to support and improve quality of life and morale, promote situational awareness, provide timely and immediate force protection information, and sustain readiness. Services include [[American Forces Press Service]], [[Pentagon Channel]], the [http://jhns.dma.mil/ Joint Hometown News Service], and providing internal news and information products for Defense.gov, Army.mil, Navy.mil, Marines.mil, and AF.mil.

The ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' produces and delivers a newspaper distributed overseas (and on-line products) for the U.S. military community. Editorially independent of interference from outside its own editorial [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], it provides commercially available U.S. and world news and objective staff-produced stories relevant to the military community.

The '''Support Services''' component provides activity-wide administrative, facility management, transportation and logistics services.

The '''Technical Services''' component provides technology services to the other DMA components, hosts hundreds of DoD web sites through the DoD Public Web program&lt;ref&gt;"About DMA" and "DoD Public Web", http://www.dma.mil/AboutDMA/DODPublicWeb.aspx retrieved 2013-10-5.&lt;/ref&gt;, Defense Video &amp; Imagery Distribution System (DVIDS), and the Television-Audio Support Activity (T-ASA).&lt;ref&gt;"Television-Audio Support Activity", http://tasa.dodmedia.osd.mil/ retrieved 2013-10-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
DMA is led by a director appointed by the ASD (PA) and may be a military flag or general officer, or a civilian appointed as a career member of the [[Senior Executive Service (United States)|Senior Executive Service]].  The following is a list of DMA’s directors.

The '''experience machine''' or '''pleasure machine''' is a thought experiment put forward by  philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] in his 1974 book  ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nozick | first = Robert | title = Anarchy, state, and utopia | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-465-09720-0 | pages = 42–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best known attempts to refute ethical [[hedonism]], and does so by imagining a choice between everyday reality and an apparently preferable [[simulated reality]].

If the primary thesis of hedonism is that "pleasure is the good", then any component of life that is not pleasurable does nothing directly to increase one's [[well-being]]. This is a view held by many value theorists, but most famously by some classical [[Utilitarianism|utilitarians]]. Nozick attacks the thesis by means of a [[thought experiment]]. If he can show that there is something other than pleasure that has value and thereby increases our well-being, then hedonism is defeated.

==The thought experiment==
Nozick asks us to imagine a machine that could give us whatever desirable or pleasurable experiences we could want. Psychologists have figured out a way to stimulate a person's brain to induce pleasurable experiences that the subject could not distinguish from those he would have apart from the machine. He then asks, if given the choice, would we prefer the machine to real life?

Nozick also believes that if pleasure were the only intrinsic value, people would have an overriding reason to be hooked up to an "experience machine," which would produce favorable sensations.

===Initial concerns===
Who would run the machines if everyone plugs in? Nozick asks us to ignore this concern, since it does not adversely affect the thought experiment. One could simply stipulate that the machines have been so well designed as to be fail-proof.

The experiment is also open to multiple interpretations. For instance, Nozick claims that you could either map out the rest of your life in the machine before plugging in, or you could unplug periodically to choose your programming for the next cycle. While interesting, these variations do not directly affect the argument.

===The argument===
The argument is along these lines:

*P1: If experiencing as much pleasure as we can is all that matters to us, then if we will experience more pleasure by doing x than by doing y, we have no reason not to do x rather than y.
*P2: We will experience more pleasure if we plug into the experience machine than if we do not plug into the experience machine.
*C1: If all that matters to us is that we experience as much pleasure as we can then we have no reason not to plug into the experience machine. (P1&amp;P2)
*P3: We have reason not to plug into the experience machine.
*C2: Experiencing as much pleasure as we can is not all that matters to us. (C1&amp;P3, by [[Modus tollens|MT]])

===Reasons not to plug in===
Nozick provides us with three reasons not to plug into the machine.

# ''We want to'' do ''certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them.''
#* "It is only because we first want to do the actions that we want the experiences of doing them." (Nozick, 43)
# ''We want to'' be ''a certain sort of person.''
#* "Someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate blob." (Nozick, 43)
# ''Plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality (it limits us to what we can make).''
#* "There is no ''actual'' contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated." (Nozick, 43)

===Counterarguments===
Psychologist Felipe de Brigard says that our intuitions about the experience machine may be affected by [[status quo bias]], and suggests reformulating the thought experiment in a form which counters this.&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek|author2=[[Peter Singer]]|title=The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2NeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|date=22 May 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102242-5|pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his version:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
you wake up in a plain white room. You are seated in a reclining chair with a steel contraption on your head. A woman in a white coat is standing over you. 'The year is 2659,' she explains, 'The life with which you are familiar is an experience machine program selected by you some forty years ago. We at IEM interrupt our client's programs at ten-year intervals to ensure client satisfaction. Our records indicate that at your three previous interruptions you deemed your program satisfactory and chose to continue. As before, if you choose to continue with your program you will return to your life as you know it with no recollection of this interruption. Your friends, loved ones, and projects will all be there. Of course, you may choose to terminate your program at this point if you are unsatisfied for any reason. Do you intend to continue with your program?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If we feel differently about this version of the story compared to the form that Nozick offers, according to de Brigard this is due to [[status quo bias]].&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"/&gt;

==In fiction==
{{See also|Simulated reality in fiction}}
Before it became a philosophical thought experiment in the mid seventies, the pleasurable but simulated experience versus reality dilemma had been a staple of science fiction; for example in the short story "[[The Chamber of Life]]" by [[Green Peyton Wertenbaker]] ([[:fr:Green Peyton Wertenbaker|fr]]) , published in the magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in October 1929. The novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' by [[David Foster Wallace]] involves a similar formulation of the experience machine. The novel revolves around a film titled ''Infinite Jest'' that is lethally pleasurable: the film is so entertaining that, once watched, the viewer will desire nothing else but to watch the film over and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sloane |first=Peter |year=2014 |title=The Divided Selves of David Foster Wallace |journal=Tropos |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=67-73 |doi=10.14324/111.2057-2212.011 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420208/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of movies centering on machines capable of replaying experiences previously recorded include the 1983 film ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' and the 1995 film ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]''.&lt;ref name="Baggott2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jim Baggott]]|title=A Beginner's Guide to Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9yAa7kRYiUkC&amp;pg=PT137|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-104232-9|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also is a running theme of the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]''.&lt;ref name="Grau2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Grau|title=Philosophers Explore The Matrix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Pmld5FXZ0YC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518107-4|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agent Smith]]'s account of the early history of the Matrix includes the idea that humans reject a virtual reality that offers them paradise; however, later his informant  [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Mr. Reagan.2FCypher|Cypher]] is willing to betray his colleagues because he would prefer to be reinserted into an (arguably less perfect) Matrix as a wealthy and successful man than continue to live in the harsh realities outside the simulation. While this later version of the Matrix is not a paradise-like reality in the literal sense, it may be argued that it is a lot like a pleasure-inducing Experience Machine, since Cypher is given the opportunity to have a prominent position of power and wealth in this new simulation. As he says while dining at a simulated restaurant: &lt;blockquote&gt;"You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy, and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The net worth of the United States and its economic sectors has remained relatively consistent over time. The total net worth of the United States remained between 4.5 and 6 times GDP from 1960 until the 2000s, when it rose as high as 6.64 times GDP in 2006, principally due to an increase in the net worth of US households in the midst of the [[United States housing bubble]]. The net worth of the United States sharply declined to 5.2 times GDP by the end of 2008 due to declines in the values of US corporate equities and real estate in the wake of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2010|global financial crisis]]. Between 2008 and 2009, the net worth of US households had recovered from a low of 3.55 times GDP to 3.75 times GDP, while nonfinancial business fell from 1.37 times GDP to 1.22 times GDP.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-net-worth"/&gt;

The net worth of American households and non-profits constitutes three-quarters of total United States net worth – in 2008, 355% of GDP. Since 1960, US households have consistently held this position, followed by nonfinancial business (137% of GDP in 2008) and state and local governments (50% of GDP in 2008). The financial sector has hovered around zero net worth since 1960, reflecting its [[leverage (finance)|leverage]], while the federal government has fluctuated from a net worth of -7% of GDP in 1946, a high of 6% of GDP in 1974, to -32% of GDP in 2008.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-net-worth"/&gt;

The [[Federal Reserve]] issues routine reports on the flows and levels of debt in the [[United States]]. As of the first quarter of 2010, the Federal Reserve estimated that total public and private debt owed by American households, businesses, and government totaled $50 trillion, or roughly $175,000 per American and 3.5 times GDP.&lt;ref name="2010flowoffunds"/&gt;

[[Interest]] payments on debt by US households, businesses, governments, and nonprofits totaled $3.29 trillion in 2008. The financial sector paid an additional $178.6 billion in interest on [[deposit account|deposits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 1946, the total US [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] was 150%, with two-thirds of that held by the federal government. Since 1946, the federal government's debt-to-GDP ratio has since fallen by nearly half, to 54.8% of GDP in 2009. The debt-to-GDP ratio of the financial sector, by contrast, has increased from 1.35% in 1946 to 109.5% of GDP in 2009. The ratio for households has risen nearly as much, from 15.84% of GDP to 95.4% of GDP.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-debtlevels"/&gt;

In April 2011, [[International Monetary Fund]] said that, "The US lacks a "credibility strategy" to stabilise its mounting public debt, posing a small but significant risk of a new global economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US lacks credibility on debt, says IMF|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dc1aadea-652e-11e0-b150-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1JPp6ez8E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial sector===

In 1946, the US financial sector owed $3 billion of debt, or 1.35% of GDP. By 2009 this had increased to $15.6 trillion, or 109.5% of GDP.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-debtlevels"/&gt;

Most debt owed by the US financial sector is in the form of federal [[government sponsored enterprise]] (GSE) issues and agency-backed securities.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-financial-sector-debt"&gt;{{Citation

  | accessdate = 3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of financial sector debt owed in the form of GSE and federally related mortgage pools has remained relatively constant – $863 million or 47% of total financial sector debt in 1946 was in such instruments; this has increased to 57% of financial sector debt in 2009, although this now represents over $8 trillion.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-financial-sector-debt"/&gt;

Bonds represent the next largest part of financial sector debt. In 1946, bonds represented 6% of financial sector debt, but by 1953 this proportion had risen to 24%. This remained relatively constant until the late 1970s; bonds fell to 14% of financial sector debt in 1981.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-financial-sector-debt"/&gt; This coincided with [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve chairman]] [[Paul Volcker]]'s strategy of combating [[stagflation]] by raising the [[federal funds rate]]; as a result the [[prime rate]] peaked at 21.5%, making financing through [[credit market]]s prohibitively expensive.&lt;ref name="2010-flow-of-funds-gse-a"&gt;{{Citation

Bonds and GSE/federal agency-backed issues represent all but 12% of financial sector debt in 2009.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-financial-sector-debt"/&gt;

===Households and non-profits===

In 1946, US households and non-profits owed $35 billion of debt or 15.8% of GDP. By 2009 this figure had risen to $13.6 trillion or 95.4% of GDP.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-debtlevels"/&gt; [[Home mortgage]] debt in 1946 represented 66.5% of [[household debt]]; [[consumer credit]] represented another 24%.

The ratio of debt to household income rose by about one-third from 2000 to 2007.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; The US currently has the twelfth highest debt to GDP ratio among advanced economies.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Richard|last1=Dobbs|first2=Susan|last2=Lund|first3=Jonathan|last3=Woetzel|first4=Mina|last4=Mutafchieva|title=Debt and (not much) deleveraging|publisher=McKinsey Global Institute|date=February 2015|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/debt_and_not_much_deleveraging|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonfinancial business===

In 1946, US nonfinancial businesses owed $63.9 billion of debt or 28.8% of GDP. By 2009 this figure had risen to $10.9 trillion or 76.4% of GDP.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-debtlevels"/&gt;

===State and local governments===
[[File:Public debt percent of GDP.pdf|thumb|450px|right|Public debt percent of GDP]]
In 1946, US state and local governments owed $12.7 billion of debt or 5.71% of GDP. By 2009 this figure had risen to $2.4 trillion or 16.5% of GDP.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-debtlevels"/&gt;

State and local governments have significant financial assets, totaling $2.7 trillion in 2009. In 2009, these included $1.3 trillion in credit market debt (that is, debt owed by other sectors to state and local governments). These figures do not include state and local retirement funds.&lt;ref name="2010-flow-of-funds-state-and-local"&gt;{{Citation

===Federal government===

{{Main|United States public debt}}

In 1946, the federal government owed $251 billion of debt or 102.7% of GDP. By 2009 this figure had risen to $7.8 trillion, but the federal government's debt-to-GDP ratio had fallen to 54.75%.&lt;ref name="1946-2009-debtlevels"/&gt;

The federal government held $1.4 trillion in assets at the end of 2009. This is more than double the assets held by the federal government in 2007 ($686 billion), mainly due to the acquisition of [[Equity (finance)|corporate equities]], credit market debt, and cash. The federal government held $223 billion in corporate equity at the beginning of 2009; this had fallen to $67.4 billion at the end of that year.&lt;ref name="2010-flow-of-funds-state-and-local"/&gt;

These figures do not include federal government retirement funds. Federal government retirement funds held $1.3 trillion in assets at the end of 2009.&lt;ref name="2010-flow-of-funds-federal-government-retirement-funds"&gt;{{Citation

====Negative real interest rates====
Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining [[Real interest rate#Negative real interest rates|negative real interest rates]] on government debt.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Louis Federal Reserve (2012) [http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DFII5 "5-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Security, Constant Maturity"] FRED Economic Data chart from government debt auctions (the x-axis at y=0 represents the inflation rate over the life of the security)&lt;/ref&gt; Such low rates, outpaced by the [[inflation rate]], occur when the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies, [[pension]]s, or bond, money market, and balanced [[mutual fund]]s are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against risk.&lt;ref name="liquidation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Wessel (August 8, 2012) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444900304577577192417116440 "When Interest Rates Turn Upside Down"] ''Wall Street Journal'' ([http://www.htisec.com/en/research/shownews.jsp?newsType=DJ&amp;newsid=c-20120808DN019794 full text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120020448/http://www.htisec.com/en/research/shownews.jsp?newsType=DJ&amp;newsid=c-20120808DN019794 |date=2013-01-20 }})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Summers]], [[Matthew Yglesias]] and other economists state that at such low rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money, and improves creditworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Summers (June 3, 2012) [http://blogs.reuters.com/lawrencesummers/2012/06/03/breaking-the-negative-feedback-loop/ "Breaking the negative feedback loop"] ''Reuters''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Yglesias (May 30, 2012) [http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/05/30/why_are_we_collecting_taxes_.html "Why Are We Collecting Taxes?"] ''Slate''&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay so low.&lt;ref name="liquidation"&gt;Carmen M.

Figures of total debt typically do not include other financial obligations such as [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s. Partly this is due to the complexities of quantifying derivatives – the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|United States Comptroller of the Currency]] reports derivative contracts in terms of [[notional value]],&lt;ref name="occ-2010Q1-exec-summary"&gt;{{Citation

The number commonly used by the [[Mass media|media]] is [[notional value]], which is a base value used to determine the size of the cash flows exchanged in the contract.&lt;ref name="debunking-derivatives-delirium"&gt;{{Citation

Fair value can be positive or negative depending on the side of the contract the party is on.&lt;ref name="occ-2010Q1-fair-value"/&gt; Credit exposure is defined as the net [[Income statement|loss]] which holders of derivatives would suffer if their [[counterparty|counterparties]] in those derivatives contracts [[default (finance)|defaulted]].&lt;ref name="occ-2010Q1-ncce"/&gt;

The notional value of derivative contracts held by US financial institutions is $216.5 trillion, or more than 15 times US GDP.&lt;ref name="occ-2010Q1-exec-summary"/&gt;

The fair value of US-held derivatives contracts in the first quarter of 2010 was $4,002 billion (28.1% of GDP) for positions with positive values (known as "derivatives receivables"), and $3,886 for positions with negative values (27.3% of GDP).&lt;ref name="occ-2010Q1-fair-value"/&gt; [[Interest rate derivatives]] form by far the largest part of US derivative contracts by all measures, accounting for $3,147 billion or 79% of derivatives receivables.&lt;ref name="occ-2010Q1-ncce"/&gt;

The measure preferred by the Office of the Comptroller is net current credit exposure (NCCE), which measures the risk to banks and the financial system in derivatives contracts.  The net current credit exposure (NCCE) of American financial institutions to derivatives in the first quarter of 2010 to $359 billion or 2.5% of GDP, down from $800 billion at the end of 2008 in the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis]], when it stood at 5.5% of GDP. The difference between the market value of US derivatives and the credit exposure to the financial system is due to [[netting]] – financial institutions tend to have many positions with their counterparties that have positive ''and'' negative values, resulting in a much smaller exposure than the sum of the market values of their derivative positions.&lt;ref name="occ-2010Q1-ncce"/&gt; Netting reduces the credit exposure of the US financial system to derivatives by more than 90%, as compared to 50.6% at the beginning of 1998.&lt;ref name="occ-2010Q1-largest-holders"&gt;{{Citation

Foreign holdings of US assets are concentrated in debt. Americans own more foreign equity and [[foreign direct investment]] than foreigners own in the United States, but foreigners hold nearly four times as much US debt as Americans hold in foreign debt.

15.2% of all US debt is owed to foreigners.&lt;ref name="2010flowoffunds"/&gt; Of the $7.9 trillion Americans owe to foreigners, $3.9 trillion is owed by the federal government. 48% of US [[United States Treasury security|treasury securities]] are held by foreigners.&lt;ref name="2010flowoffunds-treasuries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current/z1.pdf|title=Flow of Funds report|author=[[Federal Reserve]]|date=2010-06-10|page=L.209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners hold $1.28 trillion in agency- and [[government sponsored enterprise]]-backed securities, and another $2.33 trillion in US [[corporate bond]]s.&lt;ref name="2010flowoffunds-rotw"/&gt;

==Sectoral financial balances==
{{main|Sectoral financial balances}}
[[File:Sectoral Financial Balances in U.S. Economy.png|thumb|right|[[Sectoral financial balances]] in U.S. economy 1990-2012. By definition, the three balances must net to zero. Since 2009, the U.S. capital surplus and private sector surplus have driven a government budget deficit.]]
Economist [[Martin Wolf]] explained in July 2012 that government fiscal balance is one of three major financial [[sectoral balances]] in the U.S. economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private financial sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by [[Identity (mathematics)|definition]]. In the U.S., a foreign financial surplus (or capital surplus) exists because capital is imported (net) to fund the [[trade deficit]]. Further, there is a private sector financial surplus due to household savings exceeding business investment. By definition, there must therefore exist a government budget deficit so all three net to zero. The government sector includes federal, state and local. For example, the government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a capital surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP.&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com"&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/07/19/the-balance-sheet-recession-in-the-us/ Financial Times-Martin Wolf-The Balance Sheet Recession in the U.S.- July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolf argued that the sudden shift in the private sector from deficit to surplus forced the government balance into deficit, writing: "The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust."&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com"/&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] also explained in December 2011 the causes of the sizable shift from private deficit to surplus: "This huge move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of customers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/the-problem-2/ NYT-Paul Krugman-The Problem-December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Finn and Hengest''''' is a study by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], edited by Alan Bliss and published posthumously in book form in 1982.

[[Finn (Frisian)|Finn]] and [[Hengest]] are two [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] heroes appearing in the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' and in the fragment of "[[The Fight at Finnsburg]]". Hengest has sometimes been identified with the [[Hengest|Jutish king of Kent]]. He and his brother [[Horsa]] (the names meaning "[[stallion]]" and "horse") were the legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon immigrants to [[Great Britain|Britain]] as mercenaries in the 5th century.

The book is based on an edited series of lectures Tolkien made before and after [[World War II]]. In his lectures, Tolkien argued that the Hengest of "[[The Fight at Finnsburg]]" and ''[[Beowulf]]'' was a historical rather than a legendary figure and that these works record episodes from an orally composed and transmitted history of the [[Hengest]] named in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J. R. R. |last=Tolkien |editor=[[Michael D. C. Drout]] |title=[[Beowulf and the Critics]] |year=2002 |publisher=Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, [[Arizona State University]] |isbn=0-86698-290-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has gained acceptance from a number of medieval historians and Anglo-Saxon scholars both since Tolkien's initial lectures and since the publication of this posthumous collection.

Tolkien's lectures describe what he called the "Jutes-on-both-sides theory", which was his explanation for the puzzling occurrence of the word ''ēotenas'' in the episode in ''Beowulf''. Tolkien read the word as [[Jutes]], and theorised that the fight was a purely Jutish feud, and Finn and Hnæf were simply caught up by circumstance. Tolkien explained both their presence and their ambiguous loyalty with his interpretation of the story.

==Synopsis and interpretation by Tolkien==

[[Hnæf]], son of Hoc Half-Dane, is the lord of a Danish people who have conquered part of [[Jutland]] (probably the northern part of the [[Cimbrian Peninsula]]) and exiled its former Jutish rulers. Finn, king of Frys-Land (modern-day [[Friesland]] in the Netherlands) has allowed dispossessed Jutes to settle in his lands and enter his service. Finn marries Hnæf's older sister [[Hildeburh]], and sends their son (whose name was probably Friðuwulf) to be [[Foster care|foster]]ed in Hnæf's household.

Around the year AD 450, Hnæf sails to Frys-Land in the autumn; his purpose is to return Finn's now-grown son and spend the winter in Finn's citadel, celebrating [[Yule]]. He brings a retinue of some sixty [[Thegn|thanes.]] Chief among these thanes is a Jute named Hengest, leader of a band of Jutes who have taken service under Hnæf. Unfortunately, and foreseen by no one, when they arrive at Finn's stronghold they find that many of Finn's thanes are also Jutes, particularly one Garulf, who seems to be the rightful heir to the kingdom conquered by Hnæf's people; and these Frisian Jutes are at [[blood feud]] with Hengest and his band, because Hengest supports the conquering Danes, if for no other reason. This would explain why Hildeburh "had no cause to praise the fealty of the Jutes," since that fealty led to the re-awakening of the feud, which killed her brother, husband, and son.

Finn (who seems guiltless in Tolkien's interpretation) tries to prevent trouble by separating the parties, and allowing Hnæf and his thanes to occupy the royal hall, while he removes his own thanes to a different building. However, the Frisian Jutes make a pre-dawn attack, hoping to take Hengest and his band by surprise. But the Danes have been expecting trouble, and a watchman sees the light of their approaching torches. He asks rhetorically, "What is this light?  Is it the dawn in the East, or is it the flight of a dragon, or are the gables burning?"  Hnæf answers, "Neither is this the dawn in the East, nor is it the flight of a dragon, nor are the gables of this hall burning," it is an attack.
Prepared, the Danes and Hengest's Jutes barricade the two doors of the hall against attack. Garulf is warned by one [[Guðhere]] not to risk his "precious life" in the assault, but he attacks and is the first to fall. Finn's Frisian thanes, who have ties of marriage and friendship to Finn's Jutish thanes, join in the fight against the Danes. The Danes hold the hall for five days without losing a man. On the morning of the fifth day the Frisians force their way into the hall, and in the battle, both Hnæf and Friðiwulf are killed. (It is not clear which side Friðiwulf was fighting on, but Tolkien thinks it likely he was staying in the hall with Hnæf, his foster-father and uncle; this would explain why ''Beowulf'' emphasises that Friðiwulf was laid on the funeral pyre at Hnæf's side.) The surviving Danes, and Hengest's Jutes, drive the Frisians and Jutes out of the hall and re-barricade the door.

At this point Finn (who may not have joined in the fight personally) intervenes and offers to make a bargain with the survivors. As Tolkien points out, the Danes had several advantages:
#Finn had lost so many men that he could not force his way into the hall again.
#The Danes were occupying his royal hall, and he was unwilling to burn it to get them out.
#Finn must have felt both guilty and ashamed that his feuding thanes had killed Hnæf, who was his brother-in-law and guest.

Inside the hall, the survivors are in two groups: Danes, led by a chief thane who is described as ''Hunlafing'' ("the son of Hunlaf") and Jutes, led by Hengest.  The Jutes are Hengest's own band, and owed loyalty to Hnæf only because Hengest followed him.  Finn at first tries to make peace with the Danes only, but the Danes loyally insist that any peace agreement must include Hengest and his men.  Finn agrees, and swears an oath of peace: the Danes and Hengest's men will lay down their arms, and since they cannot leave Frys-Land until the winter ends, they will sit at Finn's table and technically accept him as their protector (since he was now their only possible source of food and maintenance, and they had intended to be his guests throughout the winter anyway.)  Finn gives the Danes a separate hall to dwell in for the winter, specifying that they shall share it with the sons of the Jutes (meaning Hengest and his band.)  He also swears that any one of his own thanes who tries to renew the feud (by taunting the Danes that they now follow the slayer of their lord) will be punished, possibly with death, by Finn himself.  The bodies of Hnæf and Friðiwulf are honourably burned.

Over the winter, the Danes and their Jutish allies brood over the fall of Hnæf.  Hengest is faced with a conflict of duty: whether to honour the peace-treaty with Finn, or to honour his duty to avenge his fallen lord.  Finally the son of Hunlaf takes a sword ''Hildeleoma'' ("Battleflame") which was probably Hnæf's sword, and lays it in Hengest's lap.  Hengest "does not refuse the world's counsel" (that is, he goes along with what everyone agrees is right) and decides that his loyalty to Hnæf must outweigh his obligation to Finn.  (In any case, Tolkien points out that we do not see Hengest swearing any oath to Finn; we only see Finn swearing oaths to Hengest and the Danes.)  When the spring comes, the Danes sail home and tell the story of the downfall of Hnæf.  They return to Finn's stronghold in force.  Hengest, having remained in Frys-Land under the guise of upholding the terms of the peace-treaty, opens the gates to the invaders and the Danes sack Finn's stronghold, kill Finn and all his men, loot and burn the city and return home, taking Hildeburh with them.

'''Housing quality and health outcomes in the United States''' are inextricably linked. As a matter of U.S. public health, substandard housing is associated with outcomes such as injury, respiratory infections, heavy metal (e.g. lead) poisoning and asthma.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, J., &amp; Higgins, D., ''Housing and health: Time again for public health action'', American Journal of Public Health, pp. 758-768 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be associated with mental disability and with obesity and its related morbidities.

==Introduction==
According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), housing should provide:

* protection against communicable diseases,
* protection against injury, poisoning, and chronic diseases,
* and reduce psychological and social stresses to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;''Health principles of housing'', World Health Organization, Geneva (1990). Retrieved October 28, 2011 from http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/1989/9241561270_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) 2007 American Housing Survey determined that 6 million households live with moderate or severe physical housing problems.  Homes that are lacking toilets, have faulty or unreliable heating systems, or have exposed electrical wiring do not protect inhabitants from disease and injury and can cause serious psychological stress are categorized as being "severe" housing problems.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt; "Moderate" housing problems are things such as having unvented gas, oil, or kerosene as the primary heating source, or lacking a kitchen sink. Again, the lack of commonplace appliances like a furnace or sink can expose inhabitants to diseases and injury.

The [[U.S. Census Bureau]] gathers data on several factors related to the housing: plumbing, heating, hallways, upkeep, electric service and kitchen equipment.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;Schwartz, A. F., ''Housing Policy in the United States'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;Routledge. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, American Housing Survey (2007). Retrieved from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: http://www.huduser.org/DATASETS/ahs/ahsdata07.html&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 24 million households have lead-based paint hazards. Maintenance and upkeep of public and low-income housing remains a major issue, leading to chronic problems of water infiltration, pest infestation and unsafe physical conditions.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt; The disproportionate burden of these problems falls to children, the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, and minorities.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

==Neighborhoods==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
Housing quality is also an indicator of neighborhood conditions. Neighborhoods that are seen as bad or deteriorating are often characterized by the conditions of the housing in that neighborhood. Poor neighborhood conditions can be defined as having abandoned buildings, vacant lots, no access to quality schools, and high levels of poverty. These neighborhood dynamics can contribute to a person's psychological and social stress.

In low-income neighborhoods crime and noxious noise and odors can force individuals to isolate in substandard homes, which often characterize low-income neighborhoods. The combination of avoiding outside activity and isolating in dangerous living spaces leads to negative health outcomes such as obesity, lead poisoning, and asthma.&lt;ref&gt;Bashir, S. A. (2002). Home is where the harm is: Inadequate housing as a public health crisis. American Journal of Public Health, 92 (5), 733-738.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Housing quality has greatly improved since the beginning of the 20th century. However, today close to 6 million American live in severe or moderate housing conditions. The majority of those living in these extreme housing conditions are minorities and renters. Today’s poor housing and neighborhood conditions are a symptom of historic [[inner city]] disinvestment and population lose influenced by ill-conceived federal housing policy and finance.&lt;ref&gt;Mallach, A., ''Facing the urban challenge: The federal government and America’s older distressed cities'', The [[Brookings Institution]], Washington, D.C. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) played a major part in influencing those with the means to leave the inner city for the suburbs.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt; According to Schwartz, the FHA gave preferential treatment to insuring mortgages in the suburbs rather than the inner city. The FHA considered black neighborhoods too risky of an investment to insure mortgages.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt; The result was many middle-class families left the inner city, taking with them jobs and opportunity. This left poor black families in neighborhoods that were quickly beginning to be characterized by vacant lots, abandoned buildings, crime, and economic insecurity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Today, the recent recession, foreclosure crisis, and the decline of the U.S. auto industry has further exacerbated many of the problems inner city neighborhoods face.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} People are moving out of their neighborhoods as banks foreclose their homes leaving blocks of vacant homes and lots.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Those left in declining neighborhoods are more likely to experience the negative health outcomes associated with poor housing and neighborhood conditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Statistics==
Poor housing conditions can also be characterized by race and geography. Of the 6 million Americans who experience poor housing conditions, blacks and Hispanics fare much worse than whites.{{by whom|date=December 2011}} Moreover, poor housing conditions are disproportionately found in inner cities and rural areas as opposed to the suburbs. Inner city minorities have poorer health than suburban whites.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} 
Black homeowners are more likely than Hispanic and white homeowners to experience severe and moderate housing problems. 2.1% of all homeowners have moderate housing quality problems. 5.9% of black homeowners and 3.8% of Hispanic homeowners experience moderate housing quality problems.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

Black renters are more likely than Hispanics and whites to experience severe and moderate housing conditions. 6.9% of all renters have moderate housing quality problems. 7.9% of black renters and 7.1% of Hispanic renters. 3.1% of all renters have severe housing problems. 4.2% of black renters and 3.4% of Hispanic renters.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

Homeowners and renters in central cities and rural areas are more likely than homeowners and renters in the suburbs to experience severe or moderate housing problems. Of those with severe housing problems, 20% more were in central cities and 10% more were located in rural areas than in suburban areas. Of those with severe housing problems, nearly 20% more were located in central cities.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

==Specific health outcomes==
'''Asthma and respiratory illnesses'''&lt;br&gt;
[[Asthma]] is a major reason for childhood hospitalizations as well as absenteeism from schools.  Asthmatic children living in homes with cockroaches, mice and mold may be especially prone to episodes requiring medical care.  Direct health care costs of asthma totaled more than $14.7 billion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;National Institutes of Health. (2007). Morbidity and Mortality: 2007 Chart Book on Cardiovascular, Lung and Blood Disease. Retrieved from National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/docs/07-chtbk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  $5 billion annually in indirect costs, primarily from lost productivity, can be added to the total.  According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]],&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2011, September 9). Vital Signs: Current cigarette smoking among adults - United States 2005-2010. Retrieved October 15, 2011, from https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6035a5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; almost 13 million lost school days, 4 million asthma attacks and nearly 4,000 deaths yearly are associated with asthma. Water infiltration and poor ventilation increases the likelihood that moisture will be an issue in a home, which can lead to infestation of pests and to mold growth, known triggers of allergies and asthma.
   
'''Lead'''&lt;br&gt;
High lead levels (blood levels ≥10 micrograms per deciliter) are associated with a number of poor health outcomes, including: learning disabilities, behavioral and neurological problems, and, in severe cases, death.  Even relatively low blood lead levels can have negative health impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Canfield, R., Henderson, C., Cory-Slechta, D., Cox, C., Jusko, T., &amp; Lanphear, B., ''Intellectual impairment in children with blood lead concentration below 10 micrograms per deciliter'', [[New England Journal of Medicine]], pp. 1517-26 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The impact on the individual and on society in terms of lost potential can be dramatic. Those living in older, poorly maintained housing are at the greatest risk, and many of these housing units are home to low-income families &lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, D., Clickner, R., Zhou, J., Viet, M., Marker, D., Rogers, J., et al., ''Prevalence of lead-based paint in U.S. housing. Environmental Health Perspectives'', A559-A606 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though blood levels are dropping in much of the population in the United States, the poorest children remain at the greatest risk because they are most likely to live in older, poorly maintained housing.

'''Unintentional injuries'''&lt;br&gt;
Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death among children under the age of 15.  Deaths from residential injuries accounted for an average of 2,822 deaths annually from 1985-1997.&lt;ref&gt;Nagaraja, J., Menkedick, J., Phelan, K., Ashley, P., Zhang, X., &amp; Lamphear, B., ''Deaths from residential injuries in U.S. children and adolescents, 1985-1997'', Pediatrics , pp. 454-461 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The rates of death associated with residential injury are equally significant amongst those aged 65 and older. Poorly maintained stairs, sidewalks, bad lighting, and inadequate facilities for people with limited mobility or sensory impairments are all implicated in injury rates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''Chronic illness'''&lt;br&gt;
Even after accounting for other potential contributors like income, smoking or employment status, poor housing conditions are associated with an increased risk of chronic respiratory infection. Unsanitary conditions made more severe by aging and poorly constructed structures, exacerbate the problem.  Poor heating and cooling lead to an increased risk of temperature related illnesses. Heat stroke and exhaustion are a major cause of mortality and morbidity, especially for the elderly. Conversely, exposure to cold temperatures can contribute to an increased use of health services.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., Hyndman, S., Stewart-Brown, S., Smith, D., &amp; Petersen, S., ''An epidemiological study of the relative importance of damp housing in relation to adult heath'', J Epidemiol Community Health, pp. 677-686 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nutrition and obesity'''&lt;br&gt;
“[[Food deserts]]”, areas that lack grocery stores or markets that contain healthful foods like fruits and vegetables, are primarily found in high poverty, inner-city areas where residents lack the resources to travel.{{by whom|date=December 2011}} These areas are also known for selling convenience foods and liquor.{{by whom|date=December 2011}} Rates of obesity and the related illnesses are much higher in these areas than in higher income communities with easy access to fresh foods. A correlation has been determined for a connection between food insecurity associated with housing cost burdens and under-nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, A., Frank, D., Roos, N., et al., ''Housing subsidies and pediatric undernutrition'', Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine, pp. 1079-1084 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of adequate play areas for children, poor lighting or sidewalk condition can also lead to a lack of physical activity which is associated with increased obesity and associated morbidities, such as type II diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''Intentional injuries'''&lt;br&gt;
Neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status are associated with higher rates of intentional injuries ([[violent crime]]). Poor investment in community property, and the lack of private and semi-private space can lead to the inability of residents to properly or adequately maintain defensible space.  A lack of “eyes of the street” due to poor design or poor maintenance only makes crime prevention more difficult.

== Housing Hazards ==
Most significant aspects of poor housing are linked to various adverse health effects ranked by highest number of people affected. These housing hazards are linked to many health effects like respiratory symptoms, asthma, lung cancer, depression, injury, hypothermia and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51081525|title=Building regulation, health and safety : a report concerning the influence on the health and safety of building users of fabric and services controlled or controllable by regulation of buildings|last=J.|first=Raw, G.|last2=E.|first2=Aizlewood, Claire|last3=M.|first3=Hamilton, Ruth|last4=Establishment.|first4=Building Research|last5=Regions.|first5=Great Britain.

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
A number of housing-quality issues directly or indirectly affect health outcomes, some of which are not addressed by the U.S. Census Bureau, or HUD.

*Ventilation:  Inadequate ventilation, either through natural or mechanical means, can allow for excess moisture in the house which can lead to mold growth or pests.  Mold and by-products of pest infestations can exacerbate symptoms of allergies and asthma for sensitive individuals.
*Heating &amp; cooling:  Inadequate temperature control is directly related to heat injuries.  The elderly and the young are especially sensitive to over-heating.  Each summer, people living in housing with no or poor cooling facilities are hospitalized or die.  Conversely, extreme cold temperatures can contribute to an increased use of medical services.
*Water infiltration:  A major contributor to pest infiltration.  Cockroaches, rats and mice require a stable source of water, and without it, they will not inhabit a building.
*Lead and chemical hazards:  Lead has remained a constant contaminant in the older housing stock in the United States.  [[Lead paint|Lead]] was commonly used in house paints until it was banned in the U.S. in 1977.  Additionally, [[tetraethyl lead]] was used as a gasoline additive until the 1990s. These common uses contributed to the lead that is found in and around houses, and that contribute to lead poisoning.  Lead has received much attention as it is both ubiquitous and recognizably harmful to health.  There are however a number of other potential or know hazardous chemicals used in the construction or maintenance of housing.  Included in these are [[formaldehyde#FEMA trailer incidents|formaldehyde]], [[flame retardants]] and [[plasticizers]].
*Neighborhood context:  Where the housing is located is a significant factor in determining health outcomes.  Unsafe neighborhoods, due to crime, traffic, or other infrastructure problems, force residents indoors, discourage neighborhood connections and inhibit outdoor activities.
*Maintenance: Poorly maintained housing is a significant contributor to many of the other issues, including ventilation, heating and cooling and chemical exposures.  It is also related to unintentional injuries; broken sidewalks and stairs, inadequate lighting and plumbing problems are just a few of the common maintenance problems.

==Interventions / Policy==
There are several factors policy-makers and housing quality and health advocates need to consider when thinking about potential solutions to the problems of housing quality and health.
*First, solutions need to be comprehensive. This means solutions should consider not just the home but also the entire community.&lt;ref&gt;Matte, T.D. &amp; Jacobs D. E., ''Housing and health – current issues and implications for research and programs'', Journal of Urban Health: Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine, 77(1), pp. 7-25 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, characteristics associated with poor housing quality such as cockroaches, ventilation, or moisture can cause negative health outcomes such as asthma. While cockroaches are a symptom of poor ventilation and moisture, they may also be a consequence of a community-wide problem, such as trash left unattended in the street. Solutions that focus only on the home may be missing a key factor, community norms.
*Second, it is important to consider the role discrimination plays when it comes to the race and geography of poor housing conditions. Discrimination is a possible reason why minorities, blacks in particular, are more likely to live in poor quality neighborhoods compared to whites.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M.E. (2006). Housing affordability: One-Third of a nation shelter-poor. A Right to HOUSING: Foundation for a New Social Agenda. Philadelphia, PA: Michael E. Stone.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, E. (1996). Racial/Ethnic differences in home ownership and housing quality, 1991*. Social Problems, 43 (4), 403-426.&lt;/ref&gt; Strengthening or enforcing Fair Housing laws is one way to narrow the disparity between not only the housing conditions of blacks and whites but also the disparities of their health outcomes.
*Third, careful attention needs to be paid to the relationship between housing and health trends. The relationships between housing and health trends are both positive and negative.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, J. E., Wilson, J., Dixon, S.L., Smith, J. &amp; Evens, A. (2009). The relationship of housing and population health: A 30-Year retrospective analysis. Environmental Health Perspectives, 117 (4), 597-604.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the increased use of air conditioning units may be related to increases in incidence of asthma. There may be a relationship between deteriorating neighborhood conditions and stress related health outcomes. Policy makers need to  consider the financial costs of these negative outcomes as they develop plans and designs for housing and neighborhoods.

'''Jodi Magness''' (born September 19, 1956) is an [[archeologist]] and scholar of religion. She serves as the Kenan Distinguished Professor for Teaching Excellence in Early Judaism at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. She previously taught at [[Tufts University]].

== Early life and education ==
Magness received her B.A. in [[Archaeology]] and [[History]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] (1977), and her [[Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World|Ph.D. in Classical Archaeology]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://religion.unc.edu/_people/full-time-faculty/magness/|title=Jodi Magness|last=|first=|date=|work=Department of Religious Studies|access-date=2018-08-20|publisher=University of North Carolina|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Academic career ==
From 1990 to 1992, Magness was Mellon Post-Doctoral Fellow in [[Syro-Palestinian archaeology|Syro-Palestinian Archaeology]] at the Center for Old World Archaeology and Art at [[Brown University]]. She also taught at [[Tufts University]] before joining the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where she is Kenan Distinguished Professor for Teaching Excellence in Early Judaism.

Magness has participated in 20 different excavations in [[Israel]] and [[Greece]]. She co-directed the 1995 excavations of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] siege works at [[Masada]]. From 1997-99 she co-directed excavations at Khirbet Yattir in Israel. Since 2003 Professor Magness has been the co-director of the excavations in the late Roman fort at [[Yotvata]], Israel. In 2011 she began to dig at [[Huqoq]].

Magness is a popular professor whose "unique teaching style of using vivid anecdotes [keeps] students on the edge of their seats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/index.php/article/2007/04/students_enraptured_by_magness_teaching_style|title=Students enraptured by Magness' teaching style|first=Deborah|last=Nefta|publisher=The Daily Tar Heel|date=April 11, 2007|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'' controversy, Magness was widely quoted noting "that at the time of [[Jesus]], wealthy families buried their dead in [[tomb]]s cut by hand from solid rock, putting the bones in niches in the walls and then, later, transferring them to [[ossuary|ossuaries]]." Whereas "Jesus came from a poor family that, like most [[Jew]]s of the time, probably buried their dead in ordinary graves. "If Jesus' family had been wealthy enough to afford a rock-cut tomb, it would have been in [[Nazareth]], not [[Jerusalem]]," she said. Magness also said "the names on the Talpiyot ossuaries "indicate that the tomb belonged to a family from [[Judea]], the area around Jerusalem, where people were known by their first name and father's name. As [[Galilee|Galileans]], Jesus and his family members would have used their first name and hometown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Lost Tomb of Jesus' Claim Called a Stunt|first=Alan|last=Cooperman|newspaper=Washington Post|page=A03|date=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magness has been a guest on the [[National Geographic Channel]]'s [[The Story of God with Morgan Freeman|''The Story of God with Morgan Freeman'']], a documentary television series exploring religious beliefs across cultures around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14855">'''Luminescence dating''' refers to a group of methods of determining how long ago [[mineral]] grains were last exposed to sunlight or sufficient heating. It is useful to [[geologist]]s and [[archaeologist]]s who want to know when such an event occurred. It uses various methods to stimulate and measure [[luminescence]].

It includes techniques such as [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL), and [[thermoluminescence dating]] (TL). "Optical dating" typically refers to OSL and IRSL, but not TL.

==Conditions and accuracy==
All [[sediment]]s and [[soil]]s contain trace amounts of [[radioactive]] [[isotope]]s of elements such as [[potassium]], [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[rubidium]]. These slowly [[Radioactive decay|decay]] over time and the [[ionizing radiation]] they produce is absorbed by mineral grains in the sediments such as [[quartz]] and [[potassium feldspar]]. The radiation causes charge to remain within the grains in structurally unstable "electron traps". The trapped charge accumulates over time at a rate determined by the amount of background radiation at the location where the sample was buried. Stimulating these mineral grains using either light (blue or green for OSL; [[infrared]] for IRSL) or heat (for TL) causes a luminescence signal to be emitted as the stored unstable electron energy is released, the intensity of which varies depending on the amount of radiation absorbed during burial and specific properties of the mineral.

Most luminescence dating methods rely on the assumption that the mineral grains were sufficiently "bleached" at the time of the event being dated. For example,  in quartz a short daylight exposure in the range of 1–100 seconds before burial is sufficient to effectively “reset” the OSL dating clock.&lt;ref name = "Rhodes 2011" /&gt; This is usually, but not always, the case with [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] deposits, such as sand dunes and [[loess]], and some water-laid deposits.

Quartz OSL ages can be determined typically from 100 to 350,000 years BP, and can be reliable when suitable methods are used and proper checks are done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Murray, A. S.  |author2=Olley, J.

==History==
The concept of using luminescence dating in archaeological contexts was first suggested in 1953 by Farrington Daniels, Charles A. Boyd, and Donald F. Saunders, who thought the thermoluminescence response of pottery shards could date the last incidence of heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Daniels, F., Boyd, C.A., &amp; Saunders, D.F. |title=Thermoluminescence as a research tool |journal=Science|volume=117|issue = 3040|year=1953|pages=343–349|doi=10.1126/science.117.3040.343|pmid=17756578 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/117/3040/343|access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental tests on archaeological ceramics followed a few years later in 1960 by Grögler et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Grögler, N., Houtermans, F.G., &amp; Stauffer, H. |title= Über die datierung von keramik und ziegel durch thermolumineszenz. |journal= Helvetica Physica Acta|volume=33|year=1960|pages=595–596 |url= http://retro.seals.ch/digbib/view2?pid=hpa-001:1960:33::601 | access-date=February 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few decades, thermoluminescence research was focused on heated pottery and ceramics, burnt flints, baked hearth sediments, oven stones from burnt mounds and other heated objects.&lt;ref name = "Roberts 2015" /&gt;

In 1963, Aitken et al. noted that TL traps in calcite could be bleached by sunlight as well as heat,&lt;ref name = "Aitken 1963"&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Aitken, M.J., Tite, M.S. &amp; Reid, J. |title=Thermoluminescent dating: progress report |journal=Archaeometry|volume=6|year=1963|pages=65–75 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1963.tb00581.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1965 Shelkoplyas and Morozov were the first to use TL to date unheated sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Shelkoplyas, V.N.  |author2=Morozov, G.V.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Some results of an investigation of Quaternary deposits by the thermoluminescence method |journal=Materials on the Quaternary Period of the Ukraine|volume=7th International Quaternary Association Congress, Kiev|year=1965|pages=83–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 70s and early 80s TL dating of light-sensitive traps in geological sediments of both terrestrial and marine origin became more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Wintle, A.G.  |author2=Huntley, D.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Thermoluminescence dating of sediments |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=1|year=1982|pages=31–53|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027737918290018X | access-date=February 16, 2016 | doi= 10.1016/0277-3791(82)90018-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optical dating using Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) was developed in 1984 by David Huntley and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Huntley, D. J., Godfrey-Smith, D. I., &amp; Thewalt, M. L.

The problem is that nearby electron/hole trapping centres suffer from localized tunneling, eradicating their signal over time; it is this issue that currently defines the upper age-limit for OSL dating

In 1994, the principles behind optical and [[thermoluminescence dating]] were extended to include surfaces made of granite, basalt and sandstone, such as carved rock from ancient monuments and artifacts.  [[Ioannis Liritzis]], the initiator of ancient buildings luminescence dating, has shown this in several cases of various monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Liritzis, I.|title=Surface Dating by Luminescence: An Overview|journal=Geochronometria|volume=38 | issue = 3|year=2011|pages=292–302|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s13386-011-0032-7#page-1|doi=10.2478/s13386-011-0032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Liritzis, I., Polymeris, S.G., and Zacharias, N.|title=Surface Luminescence Dating of 'Dragon Houses' and Armena Gate at Styra (Euboea, Greece)|journal=Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry|volume=10 | issue = 3|year=2010|pages=65–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Liritzis, I.|title=Strofilas (Andros Island, Greece): new evidence for the cycladic final neolithic period through novel dating methods using luminescence and obsidian hydration|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=37|issue=6|year=2010|pages=1367–1377|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2009.12.041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==
Luminescence dating is one of several techniques in which an age is calculated as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;age = (total absorbed radiation dose) / (radiation dose rate)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The radiation dose rate is calculated from measurements of the [[radioactive]] elements (K, U, Th and Rb) within the sample and its surroundings and the radiation dose rate from [[cosmic ray]]s. The dose rate is usually in the range 0.5 - 5 [[Gray (unit)|grays]]/1000 years. The total absorbed radiation dose is determined by exciting, with light, specific minerals (usually [[quartz]] or [[potassium feldspar]]) extracted from the sample, and measuring the amount of light emitted as a result. The [[photon]]s of the emitted light must have higher energies than the excitation photons in order to avoid measurement of ordinary [[photoluminescence]]. A sample in which the mineral grains have all been exposed to sufficient daylight (seconds for quartz; hundreds of seconds for potassium feldspar) can be said to be of zero age; when excited it will not emit any such photons. The older the sample is, the more light it emits, up to a saturation limit.

==Minerals==
The minerals that are measured are usually either quartz or potassium feldspar sand-sized grains, or unseparated silt-sized grains. There are advantages and disadvantages to using each. For quartz, blue or green excitation frequencies are normally used and the near [[ultra-violet]] emission is measured. For potassium feldspar or silt-sized grains, near infrared excitation (IRSL) is normally used and violet emissions are measured.

==Comparison to radiocarbon dating==
Unlike [[radiocarbon dating|carbon-14 dating]], luminescence dating methods do not require a contemporary organic component of the sediment to be dated; just quartz, potassium feldspar, or certain other mineral grains that have been fully bleached during the event being dated. These methods also do not suffer from overestimation of dates when the sediment in question has been mixed with “old carbon”, or {{chem|14|C}}-deficient carbon that is not the same isotopic ratio as the atmosphere. In a study of the chronology of arid-zone [[lake|lacustrine]] sediments from [[List of rivers of Mongolia#Ulaan Lake|Lake Ulaan]] in southern [[Mongolia]], Lee et al. discovered that OSL and radiocarbon dates agreed in some samples, but the radiocarbon dates were up to 5800 years older in others.&lt;ref name = "Lee 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Lee, M.K., Lee, Y.I., Lim, H.S., Lee, J.I., Choi, J.H., &amp; Yoon, H.I. |title=Comparison of radiocarbon and OSL dating methods for a Late Quaternary sediment core from Lake Ulaan, Mongolia|journal=Journal of Paleolimnology |volume=45|issue=2|year=2011|pages=127–135| doi=10.1007/s10933-010-9484-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sediments with disagreeing ages were determined to be deposited by aeolian processes.  Westerly winds delivered an influx of {{chem|14|C}}-deficient carbon from adjacent soils and [[Paleozoic]] carbonate rocks, a process that is also active today. This reworked carbon changed the measured isotopic ratios, giving a false older age. However, the wind-blown origin of these sediments were ideal for OSL dating, as most of the grains would have been completely bleached by sunlight exposure during transport and burial. Lee et al. concluded that when aeolian sediment transport is suspected, especially in lakes of arid environments, the OSL dating method is superior to the radiocarbon dating method, as it eliminates a common ‘old-carbon’ error problem.&lt;ref name = "Lee 2011" /&gt;

The''''' Madonna and Child with Three Angels''''' (also known as ''Madonna del Padiglione'') is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Sandro Botticelli]], executed in 1493. It is housed in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] of [[Milan]].

The Virgin Mary is portrayed holding a book to her breast and gesturing to the Child, the latter being supported by an angel. The Italian name (''[[:wiktionary|padiglione]]'' meaning "pavilion") derives from the rich baldachin over the scene. There is an open book on a small prie-dieu between the Virgin and Child. Angels are pulling back the drapery of the pavilion. Together, the books and the open drapery signify the revelation that Old Testament prophecy has been fulfilled in the birth of the Christ Child to the Virgin.

'''''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld: An Anthropology''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Pagan]] and [[ceremonial magic]] groups that practiced [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] in London, England during the 1990s. It was written by English anthropologist Susan Greenwood based upon her doctoral research undertaken at [[Goldsmiths' College]], a part of the [[University of London]], and first published in 2000 by [[Berg Publishers]].

Greenwood became involved in the [[Western esotericism|esoteric movement]] during the 1980s as a practitioner of [[Dianic Wicca|a feminist form of Wicca]]. Devoting her doctorate to the subject, her research led her to join [[Kabbalistic]] orders and two [[Wicca]]n [[coven]]s, during which she emphasised that she was both an "insider" (a practising [[occultist]]) and an "outsider" (an anthropological observer). Reacting against the work of [[Tanya Luhrmann]], who had authored the primary anthropological study of the London occult scene, ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft]]'' (1989), Greenwood argued against studying magical beliefs from a [[rationalism|western rationalist]] perspective, instead adopting a theoretical approach informed by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenology]] and [[cultural relativism|relativism]]. Greenwood's research focused on Pagan and magical conceptions of the "[[otherworld]]". The book's first chapter summarises the Pagan magical conception of the otherworld, and subsequent chapters detail Greenwood's experiences with Kabbalistic magic and Wicca. The work goes on to discuss issues of [[psychotherapy]] and [[healing]], [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[morality]] and [[ethics]] within London's esoteric community, and the manner in which the community's members' views on these issues are influenced by their beliefs regarding an otherworld.

''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld'' was reviewed by various figures involved in both academia and the Pagan community including Douglas Ezzy and [[Phil Hine]]. Greenwood herself would go on to author several other books on the relationship between magic and anthropology.

==Background==

===Anthropological fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Greenwood's work, several academic researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had published investigations of the Pagan community in the United States and the United Kingdom. First among these was the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft|Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England]]'' (1989), in which she focused on a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders based in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Allen Scarboro, psychologist Nancy Campbell and Wiccan literary critic Shirley Stave undertook fieldwork in the Ravenwood coven of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], over several months across 1990 and 1991 as the basis for ''[[Living Witchcraft|Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven]]'', published by Praeger in 1994,&lt;ref name="Scarboro"&gt;[[#Sca94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]].&lt;/ref&gt; while anthropologist and Wiccan Loretta Orion investigated the Pagan movement in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] of the U.S. for ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'', published by Waveland Press in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]].&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 saw the publication of ''[[Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia]]'', authored by anthropologist Lynne Hume.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenwood and her research===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="This is a study of certain ideas, philosophies, practices and groups within the [[Western esotericism|Western esoteric tradition]] in the last decade of the twentieth century. I explore, through issues concerning magical identity, gender, and morality, aspects of what magicians term the 'otherworld'."|source=—Susan Greenwood, 2000.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
As a child, Greenwood had found a greater spiritual connection with the natural world than with [[organised religion]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"/&gt; During the late 1970s, she embraced [[second-wave feminism]] and came across feminist forms of Pagan Witchcraft through [[Starhawk]]'s ''[[Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex, and Politics|Dreaming the Dark]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"/&gt; Attracted to this new religious movement, she undertook an undergraduate degree in anthropology and sociology at Goldsmiths' College, where her final year research project focused on women's spirituality. Exploring the topic in further depth, she devoted a PhD to the subject, thereby conducting the research underpinning ''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld''.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"/&gt;

Although initially planning to gather data through formal taped interviews with participants, she rejected this method, believing it solidified her "outsider" status among the subculture she was studying. Instead, her data was collected through informal conversations with practitioners, during which she tried to make clear that she was an anthropologist and would use their comments in her work.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 17"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the course of her research, Greenwood gained many friends within the city's Pagan community, and became sexually and emotionally attached to one magician.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 17"/&gt; Greenwood's research was funded using grants from the University of London Central Research Fund and from the [[Economic and Social Research Council]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 x"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; She devoted the published work to her children, Adrian and Lauren.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 x"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

[[Image:RWS Tarot 05 Hierophant.jpg|thumb|150px|Greenwood includes in her work an image of Tarot card "The Hierophant", which she was taught to meditate on while working with Qabalistic magic.]]

Chapter one describes contemporary Paganism and defines "the otherworld". It discusses London's magical and Pagan subculture in the 1990s, and Greenwood's relationship with it. Admitting to being an "insider", she explores her mixed feelings at being both a practicing Pagan and an anthropological observer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second chapter examines the community's conceptions of the otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and [[altered states of consciousness]] and their understandings of it as a realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a [[Phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] or [[relativism|relativist]] perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her third chapter, Greenwood examines her experiences among London's ceremonial magicians, focusing on her training in the [[Hermetic Qabalah]], a "magical language" for exploring the otherworld. Adopting Luhrmann's concept of "[[interpretative drift]]", she relates how she shifted her understanding of events to make sense of her magical experiences. However, in contrast to Luhrmann's emphasis on how practitioners overcame their initial scepticism, Greenwood focuses on how these practitioners learn "the language of another mode of reality" through their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 49&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four details Greenwood's early involvement in Wicca, through three separate covens. Offering her thoughts on Wiccan invocations, she then discusses the faith's approach to sexual polarity, pointing to the sexual underpinnings of the [[Great Rite]] and the [[Gnostic Mass]] as evidence. The chapter is rounded off with an explanation of how Wicca understands the natural world and a comparison between the religion and ceremonial magic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 83&amp;ndash;115.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paganavebury.jpg|thumb|left|Greenwood's work is based upon her fieldwork within the practicing Pagan community.]]

Chapter five examines the attraction of magic for its practitioners, and its uses for [[psychotherapy]] and [[healing]]. Greenwood explores the ways in which occultists use magic as a rebellion against [[Christianity]], and their construction of a "magical identity", believing this to be "organized around a deep internal exploration of the self through an interaction with the otherworld". She also looks at magic and the acquisition of [[power (philosophy)|power]], and the sense of empowerment discovered by magicians who were former abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 117&amp;ndash;149.&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth chapter focuses on notions of [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], highlighting the widespread belief that sexual energy provides the power behind magic and discussing the contrasting views of [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] on this issue; the former emphasised harmony and balance between "masculine" and "feminine" magical forces, while the latter advocated "magical anarchy" or spiritual autonomy for each individual, irrespective of gender. Greenwood looks at contrasting views on these issues in High Magic (ceremonial magic), Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft. Drawing upon the typologies advocated by sociologist of religion [[Susan J. Palmer]], she argues that High Magic emphasises "sex polarity", a situation in which men and women are seen as unequal and different, whereas Wicca holds to a position of "sex complementarity", in which men and women are seen as different yet equal, and Feminist Witchcraft advocates "sex unity", in which there is a tolerance of sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 151&amp;ndash;177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter seven deals with conceptions of [[morality]] and [[ethics]], arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] world view of [[Good and evil|good versus evil]], Wicca adheres to a [[monism|monistic]] worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe as a part of moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the [[Qliphoth]], before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 179&amp;ndash;208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central arguments==
Greenwood states that western esotericists have a [[holism|holistic]], [[animism|animistic]] view of [[cosmology]], considering the universe to be alive and interconnected with [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energies]]. According to such beliefs, many of these energies operate in "a time and space distinct from, but also very closely connected to, everyday reality", and it is this area that is termed the "otherworld" in Pagan discourse.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; She relates that western esotericists believe in forces who inhabit this otherworld, and who are personalized as deities, animal guides, or spirit beings.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"/&gt; She furthermore states that these individuals see themselves as [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]s of the universal [[macrocosm]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"/&gt;

Greenwood highlights the practitioners' belief that they can interact with this otherworld and the entities which inhabit it through rituals that facilitate their own [[altered states of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"/&gt; She notes that western magicians make use of [[mythology]] as a form of "cognitive map" to "structure their otherworldy experience".&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 24"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes that this otherworld is closely linked to [[dream]]s and the [[imagination]] in western magical belief.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 25-26"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 25&amp;ndash;26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenwood argues that the academic discipline of [[anthropology]], being a product of the western [[rationalism]] developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is innately skeptical of claims for the existence of magic or an otherworld, either among non-western cultures or western subcultures. In contrast to this attitude, she notes that anthropology is the discipline which first pointed out that "reality is culturally constructed" and that there are "multiple ways of experiencing the world", including those which conceive of an otherworld existing alongside our own reality. For this reason, she argues that anthropologists wishing to understand a society that believes in and practices magic must first tentatively accept the existence of an otherworld, claiming that "it is inappropriate to use methods developed for the study of everyday reality to analyse the magical otherworld."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic===
Greenwood's text was reviewed by Patric V. Giesler of [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] for peer-reviewed academic journal ''[[American Ethnologist]]''. Giesler describes Greenwood's work as "provocative", noting that it represents a "native's account" of Paganism, with Greenwood being "a native gone anthropologist." He characterises Greenwood's experiences as religious or spiritual rather than magical, because none of the practices that she described involved manipulating beings or forces for an instrumental end; the classic definition of magic. Unconvinced by her argument that practitioner's notions of identity, gender and morality derived from their encounter with the otherworld, he considers other sources for such notions, but otherwise recommended the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gie02|Giesler 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was also reviewed by religious studies scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] of [[Bath Spa University]] for the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]''. Labelling it an "enormously engaging, provocative, and rich book", he notes that readers may wish that Greenwood had more explicitly presented "the antipatriarchal assumptions and their shortcomings" of Feminist Witchcraft. Comparing it with Luhrmann's ''Persuasions of the Witch's Craft'', York comments that it is a "discerningly astute, nonretreating, thoroughly enjoyable, and highly recommended work."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor01|York 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah M. Pike of the [[California State University, Chico]] reviewed the book for ''Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', describing it as an "accessible and personal account". Believing that it made an "important contribution" to Pagan studies and the anthropological study of magic, she nevertheless thought that Greenwood's subjective attitude was the book's shortcoming as well as its strength. Pike finds problems in Greenwood's insider-outsider status, believing that it has not been sufficiently theorised, and that Greenwood was unaware of her own bias in favour of Feminist Witchcraft, which in turn affects her interpretation of other forms of Wicca and ceremonial magic. She also critiques the book's lack of commentary or detailed analysis, complaining that many subsections lack conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pik02|Pike 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Galina Lindquist of the [[University of Stockholm]] published a review in ''[[The Australian Journal of Anthropology]]'', referring to ''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld'' as "a welcome contribution" containing "valuable" [[ethnographic]] material. Noting that it joins the work of anthropologists like [[Jeanne Favret-Saada]], [[Paul Stoller]], and E. Turner, Lindquist praises the manner in which Greenwood put contemporary practices into historical perspective, and how she illuminates the "strains and contradictions" within the magical milieu. She believes that Greenwood's arguments would have been strengthened had she made use of a more in-depth ethnographic study of magical morality, and considers it unfortunate that Greenwood had not touched on [[ritual studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lin02|Lindquist 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pagan and esoteric community===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="This is one of the most stimulating and rewarding ethnographies of contemporary Witchcraft I've read. Greenwood has worked hard, and it shows in the quality of her findings and analysis. Her
writing is clear, insightful, and draws on a sophisticated theoretical framework. She describes herself as a communicator between
the worlds of academia and magical counterculture. She is clearly widely read both in the academic literature and the magical texts, more than competent in both worlds, and skilled at revealing one to the other."|source=—Reviewer Douglas Ezzy, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ezz01|Ezzy 2001]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Greenwood's work was independently reviewed by two separate individuals in ''[[The Pomegranate (journal)|The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Thought]]'' &amp;ndash; then a scholarly but not yet academic publication. The first reviewer, Daniel Cohen of ''Wood and Water'' magazine, praises Greenwood's theoretical approach, claiming that she had been "braver" than Luhrmann in maintaining a "creative tension" as both an insider and outsider. Asserting that Greenwood's use of anthropological terminology made for "hard reading", he suspects that her use of the word "magician" would jar with many Pagans who would disagree with the manner in which she used it. In conclusion, he recommends it as a "valuable but inexpensive book".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coh01|Cohen 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Pomegranate'''s second review came from Pagan studies scholar Douglas Ezzy of the [[University of Tasmania]], who praises Greenwood's research, theoretical approach and style of writing. He notes that her "truly ground breaking" approach in taking spiritual experiences seriously had "fascinated and thrilled" him, asserting that her work builds on the pioneering edited collection ''Being Changed'' by Jean-Guy Goulet and David E. Young. Noting that ''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld'' was "sometimes provocative", he disagrees with some of Greenwood's conclusions, but highlights that her arguments had made him think about these issues "in much sharper focus."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ezz01|Ezzy 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing it for his own website, prominent chaos magician [[Phil Hine]] described Greenwood's work as "fascinating", arguing that it should interest students of anthropology as well as practising occultists. He praises the author's descriptions of her own experiences within esoteric groups, and the manner in which she highlighted the power struggles that take place within them, before recommending it as "an engaging and thought-provoking read".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hin|Hine n.d.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maroons''' were [[Africans]] and their [[African diaspora in the Americas|descendants]] in the [[Americas]] who formed settlements away from [[New World]] [[Slavery|chattel slavery.]] Some had escaped from [[Plantation#Slavery|plantations]], but others had always been free, like those born among them in freedom. They often mixed with [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], thus creating distinctive [[creole culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864551110|title=Slavery's exiles : the story of the American Maroons|last=Diouf|first=Sylviane A.

==Etymology==
The American Spanish  word ''cimarrón'' is often given as the source of the English word ''maroon'' used to describe the runaway slave communities of Florida and of the [[Great Dismal Swamp maroons|Great Dismal Swamp]] on the border of Virginia and North Carolina, on colonial islands of the Caribbean, and other parts of the [[New World]]. Lyle Campbell says the Spanish word ''cimarrón'' means "wild, unruly" or "runaway slave".&lt;ref name="Campbell2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lyle Campbell|title=American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i3g8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA400|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514050-7|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linguist Leo Spitzer, writing in the journal ''Language'', says, "If there is a connection between Eng. ''maroon'', Fr. ''marron'', and Sp. ''cimarrón'', Spain (or Spanish America) probably gave the word directly to England (or English America)."&lt;ref name="Spitzer1938"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leo Spitzer|title=Spanish cimarrón|date=1938|volume=14|issue=2|page=145|doi=10.2307/408879|jstor=408879|publisher=Linguistic Society of America"|quote=The Shorter Oxford Dictionary explains maroon 'fugitive negro slave' as from 'Fr. marron, said to be a corruption of Sp. ''cimarrón'', wild, untamed'. But Eng.''maroon'' is attested earlier (1666) than Fr. ''marron'' 'fugitive slave' (1701, in Furetiere). If there is a connection between Eng. ''maroon'', Fr. ''marron'', and Sp. ''cimarrón'', Spain (or Spanish America) probably gave the word directly to England (or English America).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban philologist José Juan Arrom has traced the origins of the word ''maroon'' further than the Spanish ''cimarrón'', used first in Hispaniola to refer to feral cattle, then to enslaved Indians who escaped to the hills, and by the early 1530s to enslaved Africans who did the same. He proposes that the American Spanish word derives ultimately from the Arawakan root word ''simarabo'', construed as "fugitive", in the [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan language]] spoken by the [[Taíno]] people native to the island.&lt;ref name="Arrom1983"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=José Juan Arrom|title=Cimarrón: apuntes sobre sus primeras documentaciones y su probable origen|journal=Revista Española de Antropología Americana|date=1983|volume=XII|url=https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/REAA/article/viewFile/REAA8383110047A/25067|publisher=Universidad Complutense|location=Madrid|quote=Y si prestamos atención al testimonio de Oviedo cuando, después de haber vivido en la Española por muchos años, asevera que cimarrón «quiere decir, en la lengua desta isla, fugitivos», quedaría demostrado que nos hallamos, en efecto, ante un temprano préstamo de la lengua taina.» English: And if we pay attention to the testimony of Oviedo when, after having lived in Hispaniola for many years, he asserts that cimarrón "Means, in the language of this island, fugitives", it would be demonstrated that we are, in fact, before an early loan of the Taíno language.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArromArévalo1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=José Juan Arrom|author2=Manuel Antonio García Arévalo|title=Cimarrón|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij5IAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22cimarr%C3%B3n%20es%20un%20indigenismo%22|year=1986|publisher=Ediciones Fundación García-Arévalo|page=30|quote=En resumen, los informes que aquí aporto confirman que cimarrón es un indigenismo de origen antillano, que se usaba ya en el primer tercio de siglo xvi, y que ha venido a resultar otro de los numerosos antillanismos que la conquista extendió por todo el ámbito del continente e hizo refluir sobre la propia metrópoli.

== History ==
In the [[New World]], as early as 1512, enslaved Africans escaped from Spanish captors and either joined indigenous peoples or eked out a living on their own.&lt;ref name="Drake1"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/33/34.html "Sir Francis Drake Revived], in ''Voyages and Travels: Ancient and Modern'', The Harvard Classics. 1909–14, para. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Francis Drake]] enlisted several ''cimarrones'' during his raids on the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/33/35.html "Sir Francis Drake Revived"], in ''Voyages and Travels'', para. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1655, escaped Africans had formed their own communities in inland [[Jamaica]], and by the 18th century, [[Nanny Town]] and other villages began to fight for independent recognition.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Mavis Christine (1988), ''The Maroons of Jamaica, 1655–1796: A History of Resistance, Collaboration &amp; Betrayal'', Granby, MA: Bergin &amp; Garvey. {{ISBN|0-89789-148-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When runaway Blacks and Amerindians banded together and subsisted independently they were called Maroons. On the [[Caribbean islands]], they formed bands and on some islands, armed camps. Maroon communities faced great odds against their surviving attacks by hostile colonists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Vistas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZjNkENG2EkC

As the planters took over more land for crops, the Maroons began to lose ground on the small islands. Only on some of the larger islands were organized Maroon communities able to thrive by growing crops and hunting. Here they grew in number as more Blacks escaped from [[plantation]]s and joined their bands. Seeking to separate themselves from Whites, the Maroons gained in power and amid increasing hostilities, they raided and pillaged plantations and harassed planters until the planters began to fear a massive revolt of the enslaved Blacks.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{cite book

The early Maroon communities were usually displaced. By 1700, Maroons had disappeared from the smaller islands. Survival was always difficult as the Maroons had to fight off attackers as well as attempt to grow food.&lt;ref name="brief"/&gt; One of the most influential Maroons was [[François Mackandal]], a [[houngan]], or [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] priest, who led a six-year rebellion against the white plantation owners in [[Haiti]] that preceded the [[Haitian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[Cuba]], there were maroon communities in the mountains, where African refugees who escaped the brutality of slavery and joined refugee [[Taíno people|Taíno]]s.&lt;ref name="Aimes"&gt;Aimes, Hubert H. S. (1967), ''A History of Slavery in Cuba, 1511 to 1868'', New York: Octagon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Before roads were built into the mountains of [[Puerto Rico]], heavy [[Shrubland|brush]] kept many escaped maroons hidden in the southwestern hills where many also intermarried with the natives. Escaped Blacks sought refuge away from the coastal plantations of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin W.

Remnants of these communities remain to this day (2006) for example in [[Viñales]], Cuba,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.guerrillero.co.cu/pinardelrio/2004/marzo/eltemplo.htm "El Templo de los Cimarrónes" Guerrillero: Pinar del Río] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508202938/http://www.guerrillero.co.cu/pinardelrio/2004/marzo/eltemplo.htm |date=2008-05-08 }} in Spanish&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adjuntas, Puerto Rico|Adjuntas]], Puerto Rico.
&lt;!-- ==Usage and other terms==
The name Maroon is the [[English language|British]] and [[French language|French]] [[Corruption (grammar)|corruption]] of the Spanish ''cimarrónes'', meaning "wild" or "untamed". While the word "maroon" was used extensively for the escaped blacks in Jamaica, it was in use throughout the Caribbean. The French used the word ''marron'' for any fugitive slave. In the Guianas, escaped Blacks were commonly known as "bush negroes" or "refugee blacks". In Spanish-speaking areas, the villages were sometimes called ''[[Palenque (village)|palenques]]'' or ''[[quilombo]]s'', and the self-liberated Blacks were called ''palenqueros''. --&gt;

Maroon communities emerged in many places in the Caribbean ([[Saint Vincent (island)|St.&amp;nbsp;Vincent]] and [[Dominica]], for example), but none were seen as such a great threat to the British as the [[Jamaican Maroons]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Edwards, Bryan (1801), ''Historical Survey of the Island of Saint Domingo'', London: J. Stockdale.&lt;/ref&gt; A British governor signed a treaty in 1738 and 1739 promising them {{convert|2500|acres|0|abbr=on}} in two locations, to bring an end to the warfare between the communities. In exchange they were to agree to capture other escaped Blacks. They were paid a bounty of two dollars for each African returned.&lt;ref name="Colonies"&gt;Taylor, Alan (2001), ''American Colonies: The Settling of North America'', New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 17th century, Jamaican Maroons fought British colonists to a draw and eventually signed treaties in the 18th century that effectively freed them over 50 years before the [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of the [[slave trade]] in 1807. To this day, the Jamaican Maroons are to a significant extent autonomous and separate from Jamaican society. The physical isolation used to their advantage by their ancestors has today led to their communities remaining among the most inaccessible on the island. In their largest town, [[Accompong]], in the [[Saint Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica|parish of St.&amp;nbsp;Elizabeth]], the Leeward Maroons still possess a vibrant community of about 600. Tours of the village are offered to foreigners and a large festival is put on every January 6 to commemorate the signing of the peace treaty with the British after the [[First Maroon War]].&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Bryan (1796), "Observations on the disposition, character, manners, and habits of life, of the Maroons of the island of Jamaica; and a detail of the origin, progress, and termination of the late war between those people and the white inhabitants." in Edwards, Bryan (1801), ''Historical Survey of the Island of Saint Domingo'', London: J. Stockdale, pp. 303–360.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the plantation colony of [[Suriname]], which England ceded to the Netherlands in the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]], escaped Blacks revolted and started to build their own villages from the end of the 17th century. As most of the plantations existed in the eastern part of the country, near the [[Commewijne River]] and [[Marowijne River]], the ''Marronage'' (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;running away) took place along the river borders and sometimes across the borders of [[French Guiana]]. By 1740 the Maroons had formed clans and felt strong enough to challenge the Dutch colonists, forcing them to sign peace treaties. On October 10, 1760, the Ndyuka signed such a treaty forged by Adyáko Benti Basiton of [[Boston]], a former enslaved African from Jamaica who had learned to read and write and knew about the Jamaican treaty. The treaty is still important, as it defines the territorial rights of the Maroons in the [[gold]]-rich inlands of Suriname.&lt;ref&gt;Alex van Stipriaan, ''Surinaams contrast'' (1995); Hans Buddingh', ''Geschiedenis van Suriname'' (1995/1999); Alex van Stipriaan/Thomas Polimé, ''Kunst van overleven'' (KIT, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
[[File:Maroon village, Suriname River, 1955.jpg|thumb|Maroon village, [[Suriname River]], 1955]]

Slaves escaped frequently within the first generation of their arrival from Africa and often preserved their [[African languages]] and much of their culture and [[Traditional African religions|religion]]. African traditions included such things as the use of medicinal herbs together with special drums and dances when the herbs are administered to a sick person. Other African healing traditions and rites have survived through the centuries.

The [[jungle]]s around the [[Caribbean Sea]] offered food, shelter, and isolation for the escaped slaves. Maroons sustained themselves by growing vegetables and hunting. Their survival depended upon military abilities and culture of these communities, using guerrilla tactics and heavily fortified dwellings involving traps and diversions. Some defined leaving the community as desertion and therefore punishable by death.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; They also originally raided plantations. During these attacks, the maroons would burn crops, steal livestock and tools, kill slavemasters, and invite other slaves to join their communities. Individual groups of Maroons often allied themselves with the local [[Amerindian|indigenous tribes]] and occasionally assimilated into these populations. Maroons played an important role in the histories of [[History of Brazil|Brazil]], [[History of Suriname|Suriname]], [[History of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], [[History of Haiti|Haiti]], [[History of the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], [[History of Cuba|Cuba]], and [[History of Jamaica|Jamaica]].

There is much variety among Maroon [[culture|cultural]] groups because of differences in history, geography, African nationality, and the culture of indigenous people throughout the [[Western Hemisphere]].

Maroon settlements often possessed a clannish, outsider identity. They sometimes developed [[Creole language]]s by mixing European tongues with their original African languages. One such Maroon Creole language, in Suriname, is [[Saramaccan language|Saramaccan]]. At other times, the Maroons would adopt variations of local European language ([[Creolization]]) as a common tongue, for members of the community frequently spoke a variety of mother tongues.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/805137 |title=Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas |publisher=Anchor Press |author=Price, Richard |year=1973 |location=Garden City, NY |page=25 |isbn=0385065086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maroons created their own independent communities, which in some cases have survived for centuries, and until recently remained separate from mainstream [[society]]. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Maroon communities began to disappear as forests were razed, although some countries, such as [[Guyana]] and Suriname, still have large Maroon populations living in the forests. Recently, many of them moved to cities and towns as the process of [[urbanization]] accelerates.

== Types of Maroons ==
A typical maroon community in the early stage usually consists of three types of people.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

Most of them were slaves who ran away right after they got off the ships. They refused to accept enslavement and often tried to find ways to go back to Africa.

The second group were unskilled slaves who had been working on plantations for a while. Those slaves were usually somewhat adjusted to the slave system but had been abused by the plantation owners, with brutality excessive even when compared to the normal standards. Others ran away when they were being sold suddenly to a new owner.

The last group of maroons were usually skilled slaves with particularly strong ideals against the slave system.

== Relationship with colonial governments ==
Maroonage was a constant threat to New World plantation societies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maroon Societies:  Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas|last=Price|first=Richard|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1979|isbn=0 8018 2247 5|location=Baltimore|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Punishments for recaptured maroons were severe, like removing the Achilles tendon, amputating a leg, castration, and being roasted to death.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Maroon communities had to be inaccessible and were located in inhospitable environments in order to be sustainable.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; For example, maroon communities were established in remote swamps in the [[southern United States]]; in deep canyons with sinkholes but little water or fertile soil in Jamaica; and in deep jungles of [[the Guianas]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Maroon communities turned the severity of their environments to their advantage to hide and defend their communities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  Disguised pathways, false trails, booby traps, underwater paths, quagmires and quicksand, and natural features were all used to conceal maroon villages.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Maroon men utilized exemplary guerrilla warfare skills to fight their European enemies. [[Nanny of the Maroons | Nanny]], the famous Jamaican Maroon, developed guerrilla warfare tactics that are still used today by many militaries around the world.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  European troops used strict and established strategies while maroon men attacked and retracted quickly, used ambush tactics, and fought when and where they wanted to.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Even though colonial governments were in a perpetual state of hatred toward the maroon communities, individuals in the colonial system traded goods and services with maroons.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; They also traded with white settlers and Native American communities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  Maroon communities played interest groups off of one another.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  At the same time, maroon communities were also used as pawns when colonial powers clashed.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Absolute secrecy and loyalty of members was crucial to the survival of maroon communities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; To ensure this loyalty, maroon communities used severe methods to protect against desertion and spies.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  New members were brought to communities by way of detours so they couldn't find their way back and served probationary periods, often as slaves.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  Crimes such as desertion and adultery were punishable by death.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Geographical distribution ==

=== Asia ===
Maroon communities were formed among the [[Afro-Asians in South Asia]] who resisted slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Oka, R., &amp; Kusimba, C. (2007). "Siddi as Mercenary or as African Success Story on the West Coast of India". In J.&amp;nbsp;C. Hawley, ''India in Africa Africa in India: Indian Ocean Cosmopolitans'' (pp. 203–224). Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These communities of maroons still inhabit the South Asian countries.

=== Caribbean islands ===

==== Cuba ====
In [[Cuba]], escaped slaves had joined refugee [[Taínos]] in the mountains to form maroon communities.&lt;ref name="Aimes"/&gt; Remnants of these communities remain to this day (2006), for example in [[Viñales]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

==== Dominica and St. Vincent ====
Similar Maroon communities developed on islands across the Caribbean, such as the [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]]. Many of the Garifuna were deported to the mainland, where some eventually settling along the Mosquito Coast or in Belize.

==== Dominican Republic ====
''See [[History of the Dominican Republic]].''

==== Haiti ====
The French encountered many forms of slave resistance during the 17th and 18th centuries. The African slaves who fled to remote mountainous areas were called ''marron'' ([[French language|French]]) or ''mawon'' ([[Haitian Creole]]), meaning "escaped slave". The maroons formed close-knit communities that practised [[small-scale agriculture]] and hunting. They were known to return to plantations to free family members and friends. On a few occasions they also joined the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] settlements, who had escaped the Spanish in the 17th century. Certain maroon factions became so formidable that they made treaties with local colonial authorities, sometimes negotiating their own independence in exchange for helping to hunt down other escaped slaves. [https://login.avoserv2.library.fordham.edu/login?url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sharpeeman/maroons/0?institutionId=3205].

Other slave resistance efforts against the French plantation system were more direct. The maroon leader [[Mackandal]] led a movement to poison the drinking water of the plantation owners in the 1750s. [[Boukman]] declared war on the French plantation owners in 1791, sparking off the [[Haitian Revolution]]. A statue called the ''[[Le Nègre Marron]]'' or the ''Nèg Mawon'' is an iconic bronze bust that was erected in the heart of [[Port-au-Prince]] to commemorate the role of maroons in Haitian independence.

==== Jamaica ====
{{main|Jamaican Maroons}}

Escaped slaves during the Spanish occupation of the island of Jamaica fled to the interior and joined the [[Taíno]] living there, forming refugee communities. Additional slaves gained freedom during the confusion surrounding the 1655 British invasion. Refugee slaves continued to join them through the decades until the abolition of slavery in 1838. During the late 17th and 18th centuries, the British tried to capture them because they occasionally raided [[plantation]]s, and made expansion into the interior more difficult. An increase in armed confrontations over decades led to the [[First Maroon War]] in 1731, but the British were unable to defeat the Maroons. They finally settled with the groups by treaty in 1739 and 1740, allowing them to have autonomy in their communities in exchange for agreeing to be called to military service with the colonists if needed.

Due to tensions and repeated conflicts with Maroons, the [[Second Maroon War]] erupted in 1795. In an effort to break up the Maroon communities, the colonial government deported approximately 600 captive maroons to [[Nova Scotia]]. Due to their difficulties and those of [[Black Loyalists]] settled at Nova Scotia and England after the American Revolution, Great Britain established a colony in [[Sierra Leone]] in West Africa. It offered ethnic Africans a chance to set up their own community there, beginning in 1792. Around 1800 a number of [[Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone|Jamaican Maroons]] were transported to [[Freetown]], the first settlement of [[Sierra Leone]].

The only Leeward Maroon settlement that retained formal autonomy on Jamaica after the Second Maroon War was [[Accompong]], in [[Saint Elizabeth Parish]], whose people had abided by their 1739 treaty with the British. A Windward Maroon community is also located at Charles Town, on [[Buff Bay River]] in [[Portland Parish]]. Another is at [[Moore Town, Jamaica|Moore Town]] (formerly Nanny Town), also in the parish of Portland. In 2005 the music of the Moore Town Maroons was declared by [[UNESCO]] as a 'Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.'&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;[http://www.blueandjohncrowmountains.org/sustainable-tourism/community-buffer-zones-sites/moore-town-maroons.html "Moore Town Maroons"], Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park; accessed 12 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth community is at [[Scotts Hall, Jamaica|Scotts Hall]], also Portland Parish.&lt;ref name="conf"/&gt; Accompong's autonomy was ratified by the government of Jamaica when the island gained independence in 1962.

The government has tried to encourage survival of the other Maroon settlements. Since 2008, the Jamaican government and Maroon communities have held the Annual International Maroon Conference at rotating communities around the island. Maroons from other Caribbean, Central and South America nations are invited.&lt;ref name="conf"&gt;[http://moj.gov.jm/sites/default/files/minister-speeches/6th%20Annual%20International%20Maroon%20Conference.pdf "6th Annual International Maroon Conference 2014"], Ministry of Justice, Jamaica; accessed 12 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Accompong's colonel and a delegation traveled to the [[Ashanti Empire|Kingdom of Ashanti]] in [[Ghana]] to renew ties with the [[Akan people|Akan]] and Asante people of their ancestors.&lt;ref name="ghana"&gt;[https://www.modernghana.com/newsthread/689367/378154#showcomments "Historical Meeting Between The Kingdom Of Ashanti And The Accompong Maroons In Jamaica"], ''Modern Ghana,'' 2 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Puerto Rico ====
In [[Puerto Rico]], [[Taíno people|Taíno]] families from neighboring Utuado moved into the southwestern mountain ranges, along with escaped African slaves who intermarried with them. DNA analysis of contemporary persons from this area shows maternal ancestry from the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], and [[Fulani]] peoples through the [[mtDNA]] African [[haplotype]] associated with them, [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1b]], which is present here. This was carried by African slaves who escaped from plantations around Ponce and formed communities with the Taíno in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africandnaproject.homestead.com/L1bmtDNA.html |title=African DNA Project mtDNA Haplogroup L1b |date=8 May 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508023420/http://africandnaproject.homestead.com/L1bmtDNA.html |archivedate=8 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taíno [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|haplogroups A]] and [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C]] can also be found in this area.

=== Central America ===

==== Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua ====
Several different maroon societies developed around the Gulf of Honduras. Some were found in the interior of modern-day [[Honduras]], along the trade routes by which [[silver]] mined in the Pacific side of the [[isthmus]] was carried by slaves down to coastal towns such as Trujillo or [[Puerto Cortés|Puerto Caballos]] to be shipped to Europe. When slaves escaped, they went to the mountains for safety. In 1648 the English bishop of Guatemala, Thomas Gage, reported active bands of maroons numbering in the hundreds along these routes.

The [[Miskito Sambu]] were a maroon group who formed from slaves who revolted on a Portuguese ship around 1640, wrecking the vessel on the coast of Honduras-Nicaragua and escaping into the interior. They intermarried with the indigenous people over the next half-century. They eventually rose to leadership of the [[Mosquito Coast]], and led extensive slave raids against Spanish-held territories in the first half of the 18th century.

The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] are descendants of maroon communities that developed on the island of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]]. They were deported to the coast of Honduras in 1797. From their original landing place in [[Roatan Island]], the maroons moved to Trujillo. Gradually groups migrated south into the Mosquito Kingdom and north into [[Belize]].

==== Panama ====
{{main|Cimarron people (Panama)}}
[[Bayano]], a [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] man who had been enslaved and taken to Panama in 1552, led a rebellion that year against the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spanish]] in Panama. He and his followers escaped to found villages in the lowlands. Later these people, known as [[Cimarron people (Panama)|Cimarron]], assisted Sir [[Francis Drake]] in fighting against the Spanish.

=== North America ===

==== Mexico ====
See [[Gaspar Yanga]], [[Afro-Latin American#Mexico|Afro-Latin]], [[Afro-Mexican#Palenques|Afro-Mexican]].

==== Nova Scotia ====
{{main|Sierra Leone Creole people#Maroons and other transatlantic immigrants}}
From 1796 to 1800, [[Black Nova Scotians|550 maroons]], who had been deported from Jamaica after the Second Maroon War, lived in [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1800, they were [[Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone|sent to Sierra Leone]].

===United States===

==== Florida ====

The [[Black Seminoles]], who allied with [[Seminole Indians]] in Florida, were one of the largest and most successful Maroon communities in the United States. Some intermarried and were culturally Seminole; others maintained a more African culture. Descendants of those who were removed with the Seminole to [[Indian Territory]] in the 1830s are recognized as [[Seminole Freedmen]]. Many were formerly part of the [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]], but have been excluded since the late 20th century by new membership rules that require proving Native American descent from historic documents.

==== Louisiana ====

Until the mid-1760s, maroon colonies lined the shores of [[Lake Borgne]], just downriver of [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. These fugitive slaves controlled many of the [[canal]]s and back-country passages from [[Lake Pontchartrain]] to [[Gulf of Mexico|the Gulf]], including the [[Rigolets]]. These colonies were finally eradicated by militia from Spanish-controlled New Orleans led by [[Francisco Bouligny]]. [[Free people of color]] aided in the capture of these fugitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Din |first1 = Gilbert C. |title = Spaniards, Planters, and Slaves: The Spanish Regulation of Slavery in Louisiana, 1763–1803 |publisher = Texas A&amp;M University Press |year = 1999 |isbn = 0890969043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Hall |first1 = Gwendolyn Midlo |title = Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century |publisher = Louisiana State University Press |year = 1995 |isbn = 0807119997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== North Carolina and Virginia ====

A large settlement of the [[Great Dismal Swamp maroons]] lived in the marshlands of today's North Carolina and Virginia.

=== South America ===

==== Brazil ====
{{main|Quilombo}}

One of the best-known ''[[quilombo]]s'' (maroon settlements) in [[Brazil]] was [[Palmares (quilombo)|Palmares]] (the Palm Nation) which was founded in the early 17th century. At its height, it had a population of over 30,000 free people and was ruled by king [[Zumbi]]. Palmares maintained its independent existence for almost a hundred years until it was conquered by the Portuguese in 1694.

==== Colombia ====
Escaped slaves established independent communities along the remote Pacific coast, outside of the reach of the colonial administration. In Colombia the Caribbean coast still sees maroon communities like [[San Basilio de Palenque]], where the creole [[Palenquero]] language is spoken.

==== Ecuador ====
In addition to escaped slaves, survivors from [[shipwreck]]s formed independent communities along rivers of the northern coast and mingled with indigenous communities in areas beyond the reach of the colonial administration. Separate communities can be distinguished form the cantones Cojimies y Tababuela, [[Esmeraldas Canton|Esmeraldas]], [[Limones, Chiriquí|Limones]].

==== French Guiana and Suriname ====

{{main|History of Suriname#Slavery and emancipation}}

In [[French Guiana]] and [[Suriname]] (where Maroons account for about 15% of the population),&lt;ref name="Kuipers2005"/&gt; escaped slaves, or [[Bushinengue]]s, fled to the interior and joined with indigenous peoples and created several independent tribes, among them the [[Saramaka]], the [[Paramakans|Paramaka]], the [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka]] (Aukan), the [[Kwintis|Kwinti]], the [[Aluku|Aluku (Boni)]], and the Matawai. By the 1980s the Bushinengues in Suriname had begun to fight for their land rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/casos/articulos/seriec_172_ing.pdf Case of the Saramaka People v. Suriname, Judgment of November 28, 2007], Inter-American Court of Human Rights (''La Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos''), accessed 21 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1986 and 1991, the [[Surinamese Interior War]] was waged by the [[Jungle Commando]], a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] group fighting for the rights of the Maroon minority, against the military dictatorship of [[Dési Bouterse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=French |first1=Howard W |title=To Suriname Refugees, Truce Means Betrayal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/14/world/to-suriname-refugees-truce-means-betrayal.html |accessdate=14 June 2018 |work=New York Times |date=14 April 1991 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, following a ruling by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], the Suriname government agreed to compensate survivors of the 1986 [[Moiwana]] village massacre, in which soldiers had slaughtered 39 unarmed Ndyuka people, mainly women and children.&lt;ref name="Kuipers2005"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kuipers |first1=Ank |title=Villagers return to site of 1986 Suriname massacre |url=https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/topics/legal-human-rights/publication/2010/villagers-return-site-1986-suriname-massacre |accessdate=14 June 2018 |work=Forest Peoples Programme |agency=Reuters |date=30 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media and gender''' refers to the relationship between [[Media (communication)|media]] and [[gender]], and how gender is represented within [[media platform]]s. These platforms include but are not limited to [[film]], [[television]], [[journalism]], and [[video game]]s.
Initiatives and resources exist to promote [[gender equality]] and reinforce women's [[empowerment]] in the media industry and representations. For example, [[UNESCO]], in cooperation with the [[International Federation of Journalists]], elaborated the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/ Gender-sensitive Indicators for Media] contributing to [[gender equality]] and women's [[empowerment]] in all forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/|title=Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media: Framework of indicators to gauge gender sensitivity in media operations and content {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Feminism|Feminist]] writers, largely gaining prominence in the 1960s during [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminism]], began criticizing the [[Western canon]] for providing and promoting an exclusively white male [[world view]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Have We Got a Theory for You! Feminist Theory, Cultural Imperialism and the Demand for "The Woman's Voice"|last=Lugones|first=Maria C.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists typically perceive gender as a social construct which is not only reflected in artistic work but perpetuated by it.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism|last=Treichler|first=Paula|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until fairly recently, feminists have mainly directed their studies to gender representations in literature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Gender disparity in media careers ==
Numbers of women in media professions, such as journalism, is growing; however, the media is and has been statistically dominated by men, who hold the vast majority of power positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.metiers-presse.org/explore.php#stack/alljournalists/journalistNumber/ageSlice/genderDistribution/none/2014/none|title=La répartition du nombre de journalistes par tranches d’âge et par sexe en 2014|work=Espace Data - Observatoire des métiers de la presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that men are more likely to be quoted than women in the media, and more likely to cover "serious" topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem|title=The Problem|publisher=Women's Media Center|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210092107/http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem|archivedate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bechdel test]], originally created to evaluate popular fiction's representation of women and subsequently adapted to employment in the media professions, show that a number of women are employed but do not benefit from an equal voice. For example, women's presence on [[radio]] is typically hired to cover topics such as weather and [[culture]].

In the [[video game industry]] about half of the [[gamer]]s are women but their presence is still limited in the production of games. Those who tried to publicly challenge this situation, such as [[Anita Sarkeesian|A. Sarkeesian]], have been subjected to harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=A.|year=2015|title="Everyone Can Make Games!": The post-feminist context of women in digital game production|url=https://zenodo.org/record/849069|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=15|issue=4|pages=576–592|doi=10.1080/14680777.2014.958867}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cinema there is concern about the low number of female [[Film director|director]]s and the difficulties of older actresses to find roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/100-women-directors-hollywood-should-be-hiring.html|title=100 Women Directors Hollywood Should Be Hiring|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|date=November 2, 2015|work=Vulture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-women-directors-20150222-story.html|title=Oscars 2015: Female directors scarce at Hollywood's major studios|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|date=February 22, 2015|work=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also earn 2.5 times less income than men in the same jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Smith L., Stacy|author2=Choueiti, Marc|author3=Pieper, Katherine|year=2014|title=Gender bias without borders: An investigation of female characters in popular films across 11 countries|url=https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/gender-bias-without-borders-full-report.pdf|publisher=Media, Diversity, &amp; Social Change Initiative. University of Southern California, Annenberg School for Communication &amp; Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by [[Stacy Smith]] of the [[University of Southern California]] shows that only 7% of directors, 13% of [[writer]]s and 20% of [[Film producer|producer]]s in film and television are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theairspace.net/insight/gender-equality-in-the-media-the-new-social-movement/|title=Gender Equality in the Media: The New Social Movement|last1=McSweeney|first1=Melissa|website=The AirSpace|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Writers Guild, an estimated 17% of screenplays over the last decade were written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Charlotte|date=2000|title=MOVIES; Her Type Is Strong, Not Silent; Susannah Grant is making waves in the male-dominated world of screenwriting with her latest films centering on determined women.: [Home Edition]|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/421663810?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:wcdiscovery&amp;accountid=11411|journal=Los Angeles Times|volume=|pages=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasing numbers of women work in the media as journalists or directors. Therefore, they deal with topics tightly related to women's needs and tend to provide a positive role for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender/gender-and-media/|title=Gender and media|author1=Ann Kangas|author2=Huma Haider|date=July 2015|publisher=GSDRC|author3=Erika Fraser|author4=Evie Browne}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer only consumers of media but also contributors to media, they get more involved in decision-making and agenda of activities. This empowerment of women gives them abilities to promote balance in gender representations and avoid stereotypes. Media becomes a suitable ground for expressions and claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender in the Information Society: Emerging Issues|author1=Pavarala, V.|author2=Malik, K. K.|author3=Cheeli, J.

== Representations of women ==

=== Underrepresentation ===
According to the report investigation of female characters in popular films across 11 countries, 1 woman for 2.24 men appeared on the screen between January 1, 2010 and May 1, 2013. In 2009, the [[Screen Actors Guild|Screen Actors Guild (US)]] also found that men continue to make up the majority of roles, especially [[Supporting Roles|supporting roles]], where they contribute around two roles for every female role, whereas females hold a slightly larger proportion of [[lead role]]s compared to their proportion of supporting roles, but still less than lead roles occupied by male counterparts.

The same is true for [[television programs]]. In general, from the 1950s to the 1970s, television programs had 30-35% female roles in American TV shows.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Media, Gender and Identity: An Introduction|last1=Gauntlett|first1=David|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-39661-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female roles increased in the 1980s, but there were still twice as many roles for men in television.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; However, these disparities change depending on the type of program: in mid-1970s [[sitcom]]s there were "nearly equal proportions", whereas in [[Action-adventure (disambiguation)|action-adventure shows]] "only 15 per cent of the leading characters were women".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; In the 1980s, female characters represented 43% of roles in comedy shows and only 29% in action-adventure programs, however, they had outnumbered male characters two to one in dramas.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Since the 1990s, "gender roles on television seemed to become increasingly equal and non-stereotyped ... although the majority of lead characters were still male."&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt;

The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] is an organisation that has been lobbying the industry for years to expand the roles of women in film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21737490-furore-hollywood-will-result-different-stories-making-it-screen|title=The aftermath of the Weinstein scandal|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, feminists such as [[Clare Short]], Gaye Tuchman, and [[Angela McRobbie]] denounced unfair representations of gender in media and especially in magazines.

=== Sexualization ===
The [[Western world|Western]] ideal of female beauty is that of the fit, young and thin woman, and the media spreads this ideal through movies, TV shows, [[fashion show]]s, advertisements, magazines and newspapers, music videos, and children's [[cartoon]]s. For women to be considered attractive, they have to conform to images in advertisements, television, and music portraying the ideal woman as tall, white, thin, with a 'tubular' body and blonde hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|title=Female Body Image and the Mass Media: Perspectives on How Women Internalize the Ideal Beauty Standard|author=Serdar, K.L.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|archivedate=2016-04-28|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2016-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that typical female roles fall into cultural stereotypes of women and are often sexualized with minimal clothing and sexualized roles.&lt;ref name="Collins2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Rebecca L.|date=2011|title=Content Analysis of Gender Roles in Media: Where Are We Now and Where Should We Go?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-010-9929-5|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=3|pages=290–298|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9929-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a content analysis of video games found that "41% of female characters wore revealing clothing and an equal number were partially or totally nude", whereas the male characters were not.&lt;ref name="Downs2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=Edward|last2=Smith|first2=Stacy L.|date=2010|title=Keeping Abreast of Hypersexuality: A Video Game Character Content Analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-009-9637-1|journal=Sex Roles|volume=62|issue=11|pages=721–733|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[sexualization]] is not the only stereotypical way in which women are represented in the media.

In advertisement, celebrity endorsement of products are thought to be especially effective if the celebrity is a physically attractive woman, as the attractiveness is thought to transfer to the brand's image and studies have shown that audiences respond better to female endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan, Kara; Yu Leung Ng; Luk, Edwin K. Young Consumers; Bradford|first=|date=2013|title=Impact of celebrity endorsement in advertising on brand image among Chinese adolescents|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1365799498?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:wcdiscovery&amp;accountid=11411|journal=Emerald Publishing|volume=14|pages=167–179|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[objectification]] of women in the media is transmitted verbally and nonverbally, as well as directly and indirectly, and it is not only visual but can also be expressed subtly by commenting on women's appearance in a humorous way, making jokes and gags, and using double meanings.&lt;ref name="Galdi3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galdi|first1=Silvia|last2=Maass|first2=Anne|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara|date=2014|title=Objectifying Media: Their Effect on Gender Role Norms and Sexual Harassment of Women|url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/38/3/398|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=38|issue=3|pages=398–413|doi=10.1177/0361684313515185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some shows focused entirely on successful professional women and their "quests for sex, pleasure and romantic love", such as ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' (1997–2002) and ''[[Sex and the City]]'' (1998–2004).&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Even if the main character in Ally McBeal was portrayed as desperate to find a husband, the show had other non-stereotypical female characters and "sided with the women".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt;  ''Sex and the City'' had assertive female protagonists, especially in matters of sex, and did not punish them for wanting pleasure, knowing how to get it, and being determined to do so, which can be seen especially in the case of [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]], played by [[Kim Cattrall]].&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Another female icon from the 1990s is the title character on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', a teenage girl who starred and became hugely popular in the "typically male-dominated world of [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] fans".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; [[Buffy Summers]], played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], was powerful, heroic, confident, and assertive, characteristics that were generally ascribed to male characters.

In her 1973 article "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]", feminist film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] coined the term [[Male gaze|male-gaze]] to describe the way that women in film serve as projections of male fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|date=1 October 1975|title=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|url=https://academic.oup.com/screen/article-abstract/16/3/6/1603296?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Screen|volume=16|pages=6–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestication ===
On TV, marriage, parenthood, and domesticity have been shown as more important to women than men.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; From the mid-1940s to the 1960s, women (predominantly white, middle-class women) were portrayed mostly as housewives who had seemingly "perfect" lives: their houses were always impeccably clean, their children were always healthy, and they were always beautiful and organized.&lt;ref name="Zeisler3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminism and Pop Culture|last1=Zeisler|first1=Andi|date=2008|publisher=Seal Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV didn't portray the reality that by 1960 "40 per cent of women worked outside the home ... [and that] divorce rates spiked twice after World War II".&lt;ref name="Zeisler3"/&gt; According to a study from 1975 conducted by Jean McNeil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeil|first1=Jean|date=1975|title=Feminism, Femininity and the Television Shows: A Content Analysis|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08838157509363786|journal=Journal of Broadcasting|volume=19|issue=3|pages=259–269|doi=10.1080/08838157509363786}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 74 per cent of the cases studied women's interactions were "concerned with romance or family problems", whereas men's interactions were concerned with these matters in only 18 per cent of the cases.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Furthermore, female characters often didn't have jobs, especially if they were wives and mothers, and were not the dominant characters or [[Decision-making|decision-makers]].&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; The boss is usually a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.iwmf.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IWMF-Global-Report-Summary.pdf|title=Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media|author=Byerly, C. M.|publisher=International Women's Media Foundation|location=Washington DC|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are portrayed as more assertive or aggressive, adventurous, active, and victorious, whilst women are shown as passive, weak, ineffectual, victimized, supportive, and laughable.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt;

As one study about gender role portrayals in advertisements from seven countries' shows, women are more likely to play the role of the [[Housekeeping|housekeeper]] and men are more likely to play the roles of professionals.&lt;ref name="Paek2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paek|first1=Hye-Jin|last2=Nelson|first2=Michelle R.|last3=Vilela|first3=Alexandra M.|date=2011|title=Examination of Gender-role Portrayals in Television Advertising across Seven Countries|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-010-9850-y|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=3|pages=192–207|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9850-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, Souha R. Ezzedeen found that career-driven female characters in film are often portrayed as failing at fulfilling the stereotypical roles of a woman, like sexual attraction, maternal roles, and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezzedeen|first=Souha R.|date=2015|title=Portrayals of career women in Hollywood films: implications for the glass ceiling's persistence|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1675843005?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:wcdiscovery&amp;accountid=11411|journal=Gender in Management|volume=30|pages=239–264|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age gap ===

Older characters and actors in general tend to be underrepresented in most media; however, this seems to specifically effect female actors who appear less frequently in film and television than their male colleagues and younger women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/is-2015-the-year-of-the-older-actress-203907/|title=Is 2015 the Year of the Older Actress?|last=Berger|first=Laura|date=April 22, 2015|work=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt; While 40+ male roles are on the rise in both theatrical and television productions, female 40+ roles represent only 28% of female roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sag.org/press-releases/october-23-2009/latest-casting-data-follows-historical-trends-and-continues-exclude-p|title=Latest casting data follows historical trends and continues to exclude people with disabilities|date=October 23, 2009|publisher=Screen Actors Guild}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors such as [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] continue to undertake major roles as ageless heroes, whereas the normative structure for older women is that their ageing is part of the plot (for example in ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (2008) and [[Sex and the City (film)|''Sex and the City'']] (2010)).&lt;ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fairclough|first1=K|year=2012|title=Nothing less than perfect: female celebrity, ageing and hyper-scrutiny in the gossip industry|url=http://doi.org/10.1080/19392397.2012.644723|journal=Celebrity Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=90–103|doi=10.1080/19392397.2012.644723}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically seen in relation to female roles relying on sexualization and the superficial (apparent) effects of aging on their body are presented as something to be hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Calasanti, Toni|author2=Kathleen F. Slevin|author3=Neal King|date=13 November 2017|title=Ageism and Feminism: From "Et Cetera" to Center|journal=NWSA Journal|publisher=|volume=18|issue=1|pages=13–30|doi=10.2307/4317183|jstor=4317183}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continue to be defined mainly by their appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L'assignation de genre dans les médias : attentes, perturbations, reconfigurations|author1=Damian, B.|author2=Montañola, S.|author3=Olivesi, A.|publisher=Presses universitaires de Rennes|year=2014|isbn=978-2-7535-2905-2|location=Rennes|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In gossip culture, the older female body is represented in largely negative terms unless it has been modified "correctly" by cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122" /&gt; Aging female celebrities have become one of the mainstays of gossip magazines and blogs, which endorse a culture of consumption in which cosmetic technologies and procedures are not questioned but in which female celebrities who have used them are either figured as glamorous for getting it right or as monstrous for going too far.&lt;ref name="doi.org2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jermyn, D.|date=2012|title="Get a life, ladies. Your old one is not coming back": ageing, ageism and the lifespan of female celebrity|journal=Celebrity Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1080/19392397.2012.644708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another consequence of portraying aging women in the media, is that in most TV shows, actresses who are playing characters in their 40s and 50s tend to have younger appearing body types. This has led to critiques that these representations are first and foremost framed in terms of how well older actresses are managing their aging bodies.&lt;ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122" /&gt; Midlife women have grown accustomed to seeing their age group portrayed in a seemingly unrealistic way, and this had led to an increase of eating disorders and negative body image among this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hefner|first=Veronica|date=Summer 2014|title=The Influence of Television and Film Viewing on Midlife Women's Body Image, Disordered Eating, and Food Choice|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=65fa7055-cd70-453b-8863-f0b372478d63%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=95678398&amp;db=ufh|journal=Media and Psychology|volume=17|pages=185–207|doi=10.1080/15213269.2013.838903|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one court case in 2011, English television actress [[Miriam O'Reilly]] successfully sued the [[BBC]] for [[age discrimination]] after being dropped from a show. It was claimed that she had been told to be careful about her wrinkles and to consider [[Botulinum toxin|Botox]] and dyeing her hair.&lt;ref name="doi.org2" /&gt;

The commercial potential of older consumers is becoming more significant (an increased 'active [[lifespan]]', the [[Baby boomers|baby boom]] generation entering retirement, retirement ages that are raising). A multiplication of images of successful aging are explicitly tied to consumerism by the anti-ageing industry and older female celebrities advertising their products.&lt;ref name="doi.org2" /&gt; Examples abound: [[Sharon Stone]] for [[Christian Dior]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] for [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Julianna Margulies]] for [[L'Oreal]], [[Christy Turlington]] for [[Maybelline]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]] for [[CoverGirl]], etc. These advertisements are paradoxical in that they allow older celebrities to remain visible while encouraging an ageist and [[Sexism|sexist]] culture in which women are valued for their appearance. Baby boomers are an increasingly important audience group for the cinema industry, resulting in more and new kinds of stories with older [[protagonist]]s. [[Romantic comedy|Romantic comedies]] in which women protagonists take on the [[Romance (love)|romantic]] [[hero]]ine role provide one of the few spaces in [[popular culture]] showing appealing representations of older women, such as ''[[I Could Never Be Your Woman]]'' (2007), ''[[Last Chance Harvey]]'' (2008), and ''[[It's Complicated (film)|It's Complicated]]'' (2009). They are part of a phenomenon called the "girling" of older women, where the protagonists and celebrities are portrayed as being just as excited and entitled to be going out on dates as younger women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jermyn, D.|date=2012|title="Glorious, glamorous and that old standby, amorous": the late blossoming of Diane Keaton's romantic comedy career|journal=Celebrity Studies|publisher=|volume=3|issue=1|pages=37–51|doi=10.1080/19392397.2012.644718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abuse ===
Heterosexual romantic relationships in media, particularly in film, often romanticize intimate partner violence wherein the woman is the victim. Films like [[Twilight (2008 film)|''Twilight'']] (2008), ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Gray]]'' (2015), and ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'' (1994) are all examples of films in which abusive behavior, such as manipulation, coercion, threats, control and domination, isolation, excessive jealousy, and physical violence, are all exhibited by the male romantic lead.&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, Amy E., et al. “The Abuse Litmus Test: A Classroom Tool to Assess Power and Control in On-Screen Relationships.” Family Relations, vol. 66, no. 1, Feb. 2017, pp. 154–165. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1111/fare.12237.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study on women's interpretations of abusive behavior found that many women see the sort of abusive behaviors shown in popular films as romantic or desirable. This conflation of abuse and romance is widely attributed to the prevalence of abusive tropes in popular media. &lt;ref&gt;Papp, Leanna, et al. “The Dark Side of Heterosexual Romance: Endorsement of Romantic Beliefs Relates to Intimate Partner Violence.” Sex Roles, vol. 76, no. 1–2, Jan. 2017, pp. 99–109. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1007/s11199-016-0668-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female characters as plot devices for male characters ===
====Referred Pain====
In media featuring a male protagonist, women’s pain, suffering, or even death are often used as plot devices to further the male protagonist’s narrative arc. This is known as the “referred pain” plot device. It involves a situation wherien a woman undergoes a traumatic event, often (but not always) of a sexual nature, but her pain is referred to a male character. This male character’s grief and anger due to the trauma experienced by the female character are explored in depth.  The female character’s emotional or physical response is only addressed briefly or cursorily. This trope is featured in such films as [[Mission: Impossible 2|''Mission: Impossible 2'' (2000)]], [[Moulin Rouge!|''Moulin Rouge'' (2001)]], as well as in the Shakespeare play ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and books like ''[[Oroonoko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Åström |first1=Berit |title=Referred pain: privileging male emotions in narrative instances of female physical suffering |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |year=2011 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=125-137 |doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.565193 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09589236.2011.565193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Disposable Woman====
The Disposable Woman trope refers to a trope in which a woman is included in a story for the sole purpose of dying, thus putting the male protagonist through emotional development or inspiring him to embark on a revenge quest. The woman who dies in these situations is referred to as "disposable" because she does not serve a purpose beyond her death. The disposable woman trope in present in many films, including ''[[Braveheart (1995 film)|Braveheart'' (1995)]], [[The Matrix Revolutions|''The Matrix Revolutions'' (2003)]], ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy'' (2004)]], ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight'' (2008)]], ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2|The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' (2014)]], ''[[Deadpool 2|Deadpool 2'' (2018)]], and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disposable Woman |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman |website=TVtropes |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “Manic Pixie Dream Girl” was coined in 2007 by film critic Nathan Rabin to describe a female character who exists solely “to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."&lt;ref name="rabin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/my-year-of-flops-case-file-1-elizabethtown-the-bat,15577/ |title=My Year Of Flops, Case File 1: ''Elizabethtown'': The Bataan Death March of Whimsy |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Rabin |date=January 25, 2007 |website=[[The A.V.

== Representations of men ==
Men are proportionally represented by media more often compared to women, but the representations that do exist are often criticized for their portrayal of sexist stereotypes. Most critics discuss the ways male characters in film and television are typically more tough, aggressive, domineering, etc than the average man they are meant to represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Media: The Influence of Media on Views of Gender|last=Wood|first=Julia T.|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text='[[Masculinity|Masculine]]' means the male who fits in with [[Society of the United States|American society]]'s stereotypical 'manly man', or a handsome (according to current [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]) man with definite muscles, and a conservative style of dress and hairdo. The inadequate male lacks many characteristics of the masculine male. He is weak and fearful, lacking both physical stamina and any significant amount of courage. This was demonstrated in the cartoons analyzed not only through actions but also by body type and bone structure, as well as dress and hairstyle. The delicate female was patterned in the cartoons studied as a woman of delicate physical structure, who is thin and dressed in such a manner as would not allow her to complete tasks traditionally meant for males. The modern female is one who is dressed in a more neutral fashion, such as jeans or pants, and does not have a noticeably tiny waistline.|author=Kelly Eick|source="Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons"&lt;ref name="Eick"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.calpoly.edu/~jrubba/495/paper1.html|title=Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons|website=Dr. Rubba's Home Page: English 495 Topics in Applied Language Study|publisher=California Polytechnic State University|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}}}

Media representations of sports and athletes contribute to the construction of a dominant model of [[masculinity]] centered on strength and an ambivalent relationship to [[violence]], encouraging boys and men to take risks and to be aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Messner|first1=Michael A.|last2=Dunbar|first2=Michele|last3=Hunt|first3=Darnell|author-link3=Darnell Hunt|date=November 2000|title=The televised sports manhood formula|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0193723500244006|journal=[[Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues]]|publisher=[[Sage Publications|Sage]]|volume=24|issue=4|pages=380&amp;ndash;394|doi=10.1177/0193723500244006|postscript=.|ref=harv|author-link1=Michael Messner}} [http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/manhood-formula.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In advertising, men usually promote alcoholic beverages, banking services, credit cards, or cars. Although women also promote cars, advertisements involving women are usually highly dependent on their [[sexuality]], which is not the case for those with men, who are shown in these ads in an elegant and powerful way. Also, when men are acting on a [[Television advertisement|television commercial]], they are usually performing activities such as playing sports, driving around girls, repairing cars, drinking, relaxing, and having fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Advertising|author=Bartos, R.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2000|editor=J. Jones|location=US|pp=103–117|chapter=Women as advertising target}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, when a man is promoting on an advertisement, they usually speak about the product and do not use it.

Film historian [[Miriam Hansen]] argues the way [[female gaze]] came to film during the [[flapper]] films of the 1920s, specifically citing the famous Italian-American actor [[Rudolph Valentino]] as having been used on the screen to draw in a female audience as an embodiment of male beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|date=November 10, 2016|title=From a faculty seminar with Laura Mulvey: reflections on visual pleasure|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17400309.2017.1377923?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=New Review of Film and Television Studies|volume=15|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginie Julliard and Nelly Quemener remark that even though the dominant conception of sexuality in media is [[heterosexuality]] with [[construction]] of [[tradition]]al models of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], sexually diverse versions are being used in media which can also be a source of identification by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rfsic.revues.org/693|title=Le genre dans la communication et les médias : enjeux et perspectives|author1=Virginie Julliard|author2=Nelly Quemener|date=2014-01-15|accessdate=2015-03-04|journal=Revue française des sciences de l'information et de la communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, a U.S. [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] [[media monitoring]] organization called [[GLAAD]] was founded by [[Vito Russo]], [[Jewelle Gomez]], and Lauren Hinds with the support of other [[LGBT]] people in the media to combat media discrimination. The name "GLAAD" had been an acronym for "Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation", but is also known for its inclusivity of [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Peeples"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/2013/03/24/glaad-affirms-commitment-trans-and-bi-people-alters-name|title=GLAAD Affirms Commitment To Trans and Bi People, Alters Name|last=Peeples|first=Jase|date=March 24, 2013|accessdate=March 25, 2013|publisher=''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that exposure to objectifying media can be linked to increased probability of male viewers engaging in sexual harassment, abuse, or acts of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Galdi3" /&gt;

In the U.S., for example, exposure to TV has been associated with "more stereotypical sexual attitudes [like the idea that men are sex-driven and the notion that women are sexual objects] and evaluation styles". Also popular is the idea that appearance or sexiness is essential for men and women.&lt;ref name="Bogt2" /&gt; Additionally, pop music and music videos have been shown to increase stereotypical gender schemas, and promote the ideas that gender relationships are adversarial and that appearance is fundamental.&lt;ref name="Bogt2" /&gt;

The stereotyped portrayals of men and women have been argued to be valued and internalized by younger viewers, especially during puberty and the construction of their sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raja Mujtaba|date=January 18, 2011|title=Mass media and its influence on society|work=Opinion Maker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body image ===
There are many studies that aim to prove that sexual objectification is the root cause of body image issues. One 1995 study intended to prove that sexual advertising contributes to body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinberg|first=Leslie|date=1995|title=Body Image and Televised Images of Thinness and Attractiveness: A Controlled Laboratory Investigation|url=http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1995.14.4.325|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=14|pages=325–338|doi=10.1521/jscp.1995.14.4.325|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred and thirty nine women were involved. They were split into two groups: The first group where the women watched an advert that showed attractive women. The second part where they showed adverts that were non-appearance related. The results showed the group of women that watched the appearance related advertisement experienced feelings of depression and body dissatisfaction.

Relationships between media exposure and personal concepts of body image have also been increasingly explored. ''[[Psychology Today]]'' conducted a survey and observed that "of 3,452 women who responded to this survey, 23% indicated that movie or television celebrities influenced their body image when they were young, and 22% endorsed the influence of fashion magazine models".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=J.

Body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors have increased in the UK, Australia, and the US due to a "perceived environmental pressure to conform to a culturally-defined body and beauty ideal" which is promoted mainly by the media.&lt;ref name="Bell2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Beth Teresa|last2=Dittmar|first2=Helga|date=2011|title=Does Media Type Matter?

A study conducted in 2015 by the Department of Communication at [[University of Missouri]] tested the potential impact of gendered depictions of women in the superhero movie genre on female undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennell|first=Hillary|last2=Behm-Morawitz|first2=Elizabeth|date=2015-03-01|title=The Empowering (Super) Heroine?

Factors involved in the composition of self-image include the emotional, physical, and reasoning aspects of a person, and these aspects affect one another.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legenbauer|first=Tanja|date=May 2008|title=Influence of Appearance-Related TV Commercials on Body Image State|url=|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=32|pages=352–371|doi=10.1177/0145445507309027|pmid=18391052|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main contributors to negative body image is the fact that forms of media like commercials and magazines promotes the "thin ideal".&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; From seeing images of women with extremely thin bodies, some people have an increase of negative emotions, and these individuals tend to take actions like dieting to help relieve the undesirable feelings about their body image.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This act of dieting could lead to dangerous behaviors such as eating disorders if the negative perceptions about one's body image does not improve.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Considering that an average North American will watch about 35,000 commercials a year, it is to be expected that commercials presenting images of skinny and gorgeous women will have a bigger impact on increasing negative body image, than ads in magazines.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The author of "Influence of Appearance-Related TV Commercials on Body Image State", Tanja Legenbauer, conducted a study in order to demonstrate that images presented in commercials can lead to harmful effects in those that watch them. &amp;nbsp;Her study included participants who looked at different silhouettes of differently shaped women, and their response to these images was reviewed. These participants included those with and without eating disorders, and usually those participants with eating disorders reacted more negatively to the images presented to them in the study.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

One explanation for why TV shows could negatively affect body image is the idea of the "third" person. The "third" person idea explains that women can start to develop negative body image because they are constantly seeing images of thin and beautiful women on TV.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Yoonhyeung|date=October 2008|title=Third-Person Effects of Idealized Body Image in Magazine Advertisements|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=52|pages=147–164|doi=10.1177/0002764208321348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From seeing these images, they realize that men are seeing these same women and thinking that those images are the standards for a perfect or ideal woman.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Body image can be defined as the perception of how one sees themselves and whether or not they are happy with what they are seeing. This image of oneself can be positively or negatively affected by the opinions of those that matter to the person.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; When a woman thinks about the "third person", the gender and relationship of the "third person" to the woman can change the amount of impact their opinion has on the woman.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; So, an example would be if a woman knows that her boyfriend is seeing these images of lean and beautiful women, her boyfriend's opinion can more negatively affect how she sees herself and her body than if she thinks about a female stranger seeing the same images.

Eating disorders are presumed to mainly affect teenage girls, but they are starting to become more common in middle aged women. When women want to work on bettering their health or when they want to get into shape, they often look to fitness or health magazines.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willis|first=Laura E.|date=April 2014|title=Weighing Women Down: Messages on Weight Loss and Body Shaping in Editorial Content in Popular Women's Health and Fitness Magazines|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=29|pages=323–331|doi=10.1080/10410236.2012.755602|pmid=23844558|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One problem with women looking towards health magazines for help is that these magazines are often filled with images of women who are in their 40s and 50s, but are very lean and beautiful.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; In order to establish that these health magazines are having a negative impact on body image in the readers of the magazines, Laura E. Willis, the author of "Weighing Women Down: Messages on Weight Loss and Body Shaping in Editorial Content in Popular Women's Health", conducted a study. She looked at issues of five different health and fitness magazines, and realized that these magazines tend to focus more on appearance rather than health, and focused on reducing caloric intake rather than exercise.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The messages presented in these magazines can cause a negative perception of oneself, and instead of motivating people to better themselves, they have the ability to make the reader feel bad about their body.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Responses and movements for change ==
=== Feminist response ===
[[Germaine Greer]], Australian-born author of [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Female-Eunuch-Germaine-Greer/dp/006157953X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458435668&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+female+eunuch+by+germaine+greer|title=The Female Eunuch|last1=Greer|first1=Germaine|date=1970|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=978-0061579530}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1970), offered a systematic deconstruction of ideas such as womanhood and femininity, arguing that women are forced to assume submissive roles in society to fulfill male fantasies of what being a woman entails.  Greer wrote that women were perceived as mere consumers benefiting from the purchasing power of their husband. Women become targets for marketing, she said, and their image is used in advertising to sell products.  American socialist writer and feminist, [[Sharon Smith (writer)|Sharon Smith]] wrote on the first issue of ''Women and Film'' that women's roles in film "almost always [revolve] around her physical attraction and the mating games she plays with the male characters" in contrast to men's roles, which according to the author are more varied.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Sharon|title=The Image of Women in Film: Some Suggestions for Future Research|journal=Women and Film|issue=1|pages=13–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Marjorie Rosen, an important contributor to [[feminist film theory]], argued that "the Cinema Woman is a Popcorn Venus, a delectable but insubstantial hybrid of cultural distortions".&lt;ref name="Rosen2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Popcorn Venus|last1=Rosen|first1=Marjorie|date=1973|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Gaye Tuchman wrote of the concept of [[symbolic annihilation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hearth and Home: Images of Women in the Mass Media|last1=Tuchman|first1=Gaye|last2=Kaplan Daniels|first2=Arlene|last3=Benét|first3=James|date=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195023527|ref=Tuchman}}&lt;/ref&gt; blaming the media for imposing a negative vision of active women and making an apologia for housewives.

From media representations, feminists paved the way for debates and discussions about gender within the social and political spheres. In 1986, the British MP Clare Short proposed a bill to ban newspapers from printing [[Page 3]] photographs of topless models.&lt;ref name="Biscarrat2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rfsic.revues.org/619|title=L'analyse des médias au prisme du genre : formation d'une épistémè|author=Laetitia Biscarrat|date=2013|accessdate=2015-03-04|journal=Revue française des sciences de l'information et de la communication|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/clare-short-i-didnt-get-rid-of-page-3-can-leveson-6294455.html|title=I didn't get rid of Page 3 &amp;ndash; Can Levenson?|author=Clare Short|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, feminist critics began analyzing film in terms of the Bechdel test. This feminist assessment of cinema was named after [[Alison Bechdel]], feminist cartoonist and creator of the long-running comic strip ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]''. This test determines the level of gender equality present in a film by assessing whether a work of&amp;nbsp;[[fiction]]&amp;nbsp;features at least two named women who talk to each other about something other than a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bechdeltest.com/|title=Bechdel Test Movie List|website=bechdeltest.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, TV critics, academics, and women started to point out the way TV shows portrayed female characters.&lt;ref name="Zeisler3"/&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine called out the industry for "refusing to rise above characterizations of women as pretty, skinny, dopey, hapless housewives or housewife wannabes", and a poll conducted by ''[[Redbook]]'' magazine in 1972 showed that "75 per cent of 120,000 women ... agreed that 'the media degrades women by portraying them as mindless dolls'".&lt;ref name="Zeisler3" /&gt; In that sense, ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' was a television breakthrough because it introduced the first female character whose central relationships were not her husband or boyfriend or her family, but her friends and coworkers. The main character was a sort of stand-in for the "new American female" who put her job before romance and preferred to be alone than with the wrong men, but still had to do stereotypically female office work (like typing and getting coffee) and didn't speak up to her boss and other male coworkers.&lt;ref name="Zeisler3" /&gt;

=== International Organization and NGO response ===
==== UN Women ====
[[UN Women]] is the [[United Nations|UN]] organization dedicated to [[gender equality]] and the [[empowerment]] of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/about-un-women|title=About UN Women|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to increase women's leadership, to end violence against women and to engage women in all aspects of peace and security processes, it's important to give women the right place in media landscape, and their representations must be fair and equal. UN Women supports media monitoring studies on how women are depicted in the media. For instance, the organisation "engage media professionals by raising awareness of gender equality and violence against women, including through special workshops and tool-kits, to encourage gender-sensitive reporting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/end-violence-against-women/2014/media|title=Women and media|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UNESCO ====
In line with UNESCO's [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/themes/gender-equality/ Global Priority Gender], "[[UNESCO]] is contributing to achieving full [[gender equality]] in the media by 2030".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/media-pluralism-and-gender-equality|title=Media Diversity and Gender Equality|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach this goal, the Organization developed the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/ Gender-sensitive Indicators for Media (GSIM)] to measure gender awareness and portrayal within media organizations (e.g. working conditions), but particularly in editorial content. The Organization has been promoting their application by governments, media organizations, journalists unions and associations, journalism schools and the like. They set the basis for gender equality in media operations and editorial content. In addition, each year, UNESCO organizes a campaign named "[https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews Women Make the News]"; in 2018 the theme was ''Gender Equality and Sports Media'' as "Sports coverage is hugely powerful in shaping norms and [[stereotype]]s about [[gender]]. Media has the ability to challenge these norms, promoting a balanced coverage of men's and women's sports and a fair portrayal of sportspeople irrespective of gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews|title=Women Make the News 2018|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Micromégas''''' is a 1752 [[novella]] by the French [[philosopher]] and [[satirist]] [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= |first=|year=1752 |title=Le Micromégas de M. de Voltaire |publisher= |place=A Londres (i. e. Paris, Michel Lambert)|edition= 1 |page= |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86157424/f9.image.r=micromegas%20voltaire |accessdate=11 June 2016 |via= Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his story "[[Plato's Dream]]", it is an early example in the [[literary genre]] of [[science fiction]], and is a significant development in the [[history of literature]].

The tale recounts the visit to Earth of a being from a planet circling the star [[Sirius]], and of his companion from the planet [[Saturn]].

The technique of using an outsider to comment on aspects of Western culture was popular at this period; Voltaire also used it in ''[[Zadig]]''. [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], too, applied it in ''[[Persian Letters]]'', as did [[José Cadalso]] in ''Cartas marruecas'' and [[Tomás Antônio Gonzaga]] in ''[[Cartas Chilenas]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Plot==
The story is organized into seven brief chapters. The first describes Micromégas (small/large), an inhabitant of one of the planets that orbits Sirius. His home world is 21.6 million times greater in circumference than the [[Earth]]. Micromégas stands {{convert|120,000|feet|km|abbr=out}} tall. When he is almost 450 years old, approaching the end of his infancy, Micromégas writes a scientific book examining the insects on his planet, which at {{convert|100|feet|meters}} are too small to be detected by ordinary microscopes. This book is considered heresy, and after a 200-year trial, he is banished from the court for a term of 800 years. Micromégas takes this as an incentive to travel around the Universe in a quest to develop his intellect and his spirit.

After extensive celestial travels he arrives on [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], where he befriends the secretary of the Academy of Saturn, a man less than a twentieth of his size (a "dwarf" standing only {{convert|6,000|feet|km|abbr=out}} tall). They discuss the differences between their planets. The Saturnian has 72 senses while the Sirian has 1,000. The Saturnian lives for 15,000 Earth years while the Sirian lives for 10.5 million years; Micromégas reports that he has visited worlds where people live much longer than this, but still consider their lifespans too short. At the end of their conversation, they decide to take a philosophical journey together.

Eventually, they arrive on Earth and circumnavigate it in 36 hours, with the Saturnian only getting his lower legs wet in the deepest ocean and the Sirian barely wetting his ankles. They decide that the planet must be devoid of life, since it is too small for them to see with the naked eye. In the Baltic Sea, the Saturnian happens to spot a tiny speck swimming about, and he picks it up to discover that it is a whale. As they examine it, a boatful of philosophers returning from an Arctic voyage happens to run aground nearby.

The space travellers examine the boat and, upon discovering the lifeforms inside it, they conclude that the tiny beings are too small to be of any intelligence or spirit. Yet they gradually realize the beings are speaking to each other, and they devise a hearing tube with the clippings of their fingernails in order to hear the tiny voices. After listening for a while, they learn the human language and begin a conversation, wherein they are shocked to discover the breadth of the human intellect.

The final chapter sees the humans testing the philosophies of [[Aristotle]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] against the travellers' wisdom. When the travellers hear the theory of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] that the universe was made uniquely for mankind, they fall into an enormous fit of laughter. Taking pity on the humans, the Sirian decides to write them a book that will explain the point of everything to them. When the volume is presented to the Academy of Science in Paris, the secretary opens the book only to find blank pages.

The '''Mormon Historic Sites Foundation''' (MHSF) is an independent organization that seeks to contribute to the memorialization of sites important to the history of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].  The organization also maintains a database of historic sites of the LDS Church called the '''Mormon Historic Sites Registry'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Mormon Historic Sites Registry |work= MormonHistoricSites.org |publisher= Mormon Historic Sites Foundation |url= http://mormonhistoricsites.org/sites-registry/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150106213554/http://mormonhistoricsites.org/sites-registry/ |archive-date= 2015-01-06 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==

The foundation was originally started in 1992 as the Ensign Peak Foundation, involved in the creation of [[Ensign Peak|Ensign Peak Park]] in Salt Lake City, Utah.  After the success of this project the organization changed to its current name and undertook a broader mission.  Their next major project was the restoration of [[Kirtland, Ohio]] including the working towards the relocation of the main road so visitors would not have to compete with traffic in visiting the historic sites there.

The current title first appeared in the ''[[LDS Church News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Baugh |first= Alexander L. |authorlink= Alexander L. Baugh |title= Haun's Mill remembered |newspaper= [[LDS Church News]] |date= November 7, 1998 |url= http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/30410/Hauns-Mill-remembered.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150106213102/http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/30410/Hauns-Mill-remembered.html |archive-date= 2015-01-06 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the ceremony held in 1998 to remember the [[Haun's Mill Massacre]], held jointly by the MHSF and the [[Missouri Mormon Frontier Foundation]].

== Publications ==
The MHSF produces a semiannual scholarly publication called '''''Mormon Historical Studies'''''.  It features "essays, biographies, documents, book reviews, historical site descriptions, indexes, and archival listings relevant to subjects of general interest to Latter-day Saints".&lt;ref name=Publications&gt;{{citation |url= http://mormonhistoricsites.org/publications/ |title= Publications |work= MormonHistoricSites.org |publisher= Mormon Historic Sites Foundation |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150106213234/http://mormonhistoricsites.org/publications/ |archive-date= 2015-01-06 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Mormon Historical Studies was originally '''''The Nauvoo Journal''''', until its name change in spring 2000.&lt;ref name=Publications /&gt; The Nauvoo Journal started with Lyman D. Platt and the Early Mormon Research Institute in 1989, intending to aid Mormon History "by bringing to light previously unknown and little used records, by correcting false research and traditions, by indexing of other difficult records, and by publishing many sources that are inaccessible to hundreds of interested family historians and genealogists".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Platt |first= Lyman D. |year= 1989 |url= http://mormonhistoricsites.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NJ1_Platt1.pdf |title= Early Mormon Sources, 1830-1900 |journal= The Nauvoo Journal |volume= 1 |publisher= Early Mormon Research Institute |page= 4 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150106214056/http://mormonhistoricsites.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NJ1_Platt1.pdf |archive-date= 2015-01-06 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex Osborn of [[IGN]] gave the anime series positive marks, saying "The first season of ''My Hero Academia'' delivers thirteen episodes of fantastic action, elevated by a heartfelt story that's wrapped around a core cast of memorable and relatable characters." Osborn went on to state that the villains were underdeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/30/my-hero-academia-season-1-review |title=My Hero Academia: Season 1 Review |first=Alex |last=Osborn |publisher=IGN |date=June 30, 2016 |accessdate=July 16, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709224036/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/30/my-hero-academia-season-1-review |archivedate=July 9, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Coalition for Sexual Freedom''' ('''NCSF''') is a [[sex-positive]] advocacy and educational organization founded in 1997 in the United States. It claims to represent 50 coalition partners and over 100 supporting organizations. NSCF advocates on behalf of adults involved in "alternative lifestyles"{{when defined as|date=September 2018}} with respect to sexuality and relationship composition, specifically for tolerance and non-discrimination of those so identified, as well as education for adults involved in such lifestyles. The organization's main office is in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], with members, coalition partners, board, and volunteers based across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83520005.html One more faction whips Congress] The American Enterprise, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-55096991.html Bill O'Reilly.

==Organization==

The NCSF's mission as described on its web page is: "The NCSF is committed to creating a political, legal and social environment in the US that advances equal rights for consenting adults who engage in alternative sexual and relationship expressions. The NCSF aims to advance the rights of, and advocate for consenting adults in the [[BDSM]]-Leather-Fetish, [[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swing]], and Polyamory Communities. We pursue our vision through direct services, education, advocacy, and outreach, in conjunction with our partners, to directly benefit these communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ncsfreedom.org/who-we-are/about-ncsf/ncsf-mission-statement|title=NCSFreedom - NCSF Mission Statement|first=Deb|last=Cinkus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===The Media Outreach Project===

NCSF's Media Outreach Program provides sound bites and tactics for its advocates and allies in dealing with the media. It regularly provides media training and conducts dozens of interviews every year.

===Kink Aware Professionals===

Kink Aware Professionals (KAP) is a privately funded, non-profit service which provides the community with free referrals to psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the BDSM, fetish, and leather community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsfreedom.org/kap/index.php?option=com_keyword&amp;id=270|title=ncsfreedom.org|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611150428/http://www.ncsfreedom.org/kap/index.php?option=com_keyword&amp;id=270|archivedate=11 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCSF took custody of the Kink Aware Professionals program from its previous advocate, Race Bannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bannon.com/kap/|title=Kink Aware Professionals - bannon.com|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCSF creates KAP materials and literature and has actively recruited psychotherapeutic, medical, legal and other professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to diverse expressions of sexuality.

===Consent counts===

In 2007, NCSF organized a leather leadership roundtable at the Creating Change conference to discuss the goals of the BDSM-leather-fetish communities. The number one priority was determined to be the [[decriminalization]] of BDSM. A subsequent [[townhall meeting]] at LLC was held to further discuss this goal and to establish an outline for a working plan for this 10–15-year project. This is a community-wide project with participation by national groups as well as activists to help determine the plan to accomplish this goal. In early 2010, it was determined that it would be in the best interest of this project for NCSF to take a leadership role. Since NCSF had already established the DSM project as a major area of focus, it made sense to also add the Consent Counts project as a major focus. Judy Guerin, former Executive Director of NCSF and long-time sexual freedom activist, recently re-joined NCSF as the Consent Counts project director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63492458.html Wedge, Dave.

'''''Pars pro toto''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɑːr|z|_|p|r|əʊ|_|ˈ|t|əʊ|t|əʊ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pars_pro_toto|title=pars pro toto {{!}} Definition of pars pro toto in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-la|ˈpars proː ˈtoː.toː|lang}}), [[Latin]] for "a part (taken) for the whole",&lt;ref name="m-w"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pars%20pro%20toto |title=pars pro toto - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[figure of speech]] where the name of a ''portion'' of an object, place, or concept represents its ''entirety''. It is distinct from a [[merism]], which is a reference to a whole by an enumeration of parts; [[metonymy]], where an object, place, or concept is called by something or some place associated with the object, place, or concept; or [[synecdoche]], which can refer both to this and its inverse: the whole representing a part.

In the context of language, ''pars pro toto'' means that something is named after a part of it, or after a limited characteristic, in itself not necessarily representative for the whole.  For example, "glasses" is a ''pars pro toto'' name for something that consists of more than just two pieces of glass.
Examples of common ''pars pro toto'' usage in political geography include "[[Russia]]" or "[[Russian people|Russians]]", for the entire former [[Russian Empire]] or former [[Soviet Union]] or its people, [[China]] for [[People's Republic of China]], [[Holland]] for the [[Netherlands]], and, particularly in languages other than English, using the translation of "[[England]]" in that language for "[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]". Among English-speakers "[[Great Britain]]" or "Britain" is a common ''pars pro toto'' shorthand for the entire United Kingdom. [[Switzerland]]'s name (in German ''Schweiz'') comes from its central Canton of [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]].

The inverse of a ''pars pro toto'' is a ''[[totum pro parte]]'', in which the whole is used to describe a part, such as widespread use of "[[Americas|America]]" (which originally named the entire western hemisphere to place it geographically, with alliteration, alongside Asia, Africa, "Europa", and ultimately [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]]) in place of "[[United States of America]]", "United States" or "US".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Blair Arts Ltd. |url=http://www.odlt.org/ballast/totum_pro_parte.html |title=Online Dictionary of Language Terminology (ODLT) s.v. totum pro parte |publisher=ODLT |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''[[synecdoche]]'' is used for both, as well as similar metaphors, though in Greek it literally means "simultaneous understanding".

The '''Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars''' ({{lang-de|Preußisches Nationaldenkmal für die Befreiungskriege}}) is a [[war memorial]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], dedicated in 1821. Built by the [[Prussian king]] during the [[Kleinstaaterei|sectionalism]] before the [[Unification of Germany]] it is the principal [[Germany|German]] monument to the Prussian soldiers and other citizens who died in or else dedicated their health and wealth for the [[German Campaign of 1813|Liberation Wars (Befreiungskriege)]] fought at the end of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Wars of the Sixth]] and in that of the [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh Coalition against France]] in the course of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] initiated its construction and commissioned the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] who made it an important piece of art in [[cast iron]], his last piece of Romantic [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic architecture]] and an expression of the post-Napoleonic poverty and material sobriety in the liberated countries.&lt;ref name="Dehio 2000 247"&gt;Sibylle Badstübner-Gröger, Michael Bollé, Ralph Paschke et al., ''Handbuch der Deutschen Kunstdenkmäler / Georg Dehio'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;267. {{ISBN|3-422-03071-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument is located on the [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|Kreuzberg hill]] in the [[Viktoriapark|Victoria Park]] in the [[Tempelhofer Vorstadt]], a region within [[Boroughs of Berlin|Berlin's borough]] of [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]]. The monument was conceived at a time of deteriorating relations between the [[Reactionary#Metternich and containment|reactionaries]] and the reformers of the civic movement within Prussia. The monument is of cast iron, a technique en vogue at the time. Its younger socket brick building is faced with grey [[Silesia]]n [[granite]] and was designed by the Prussian architect [[Heinrich Strack]] and realised by the Prussian engineer [[Johann Wilhelm Schwedler]]. Its centerpiece is a tapering [[turret]] of 60 Prussian feet ({{convert|18.83|m|ft|abbr=on}}), resembling the spire tops of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;"Gross gedacht und klein geraten: Berlins Kreuzbergdenkmal wurde deshalb zum eindrucksvollen Zeugnis deutscher und preußischer Geschichte", in: ''monumente'', [[Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz]] (ed.), No. 1/2 (1997), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dedication==
On the eastern side of the monument under the memorial inscription for the [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Battle of Großgörschen (aka Lützen)]] there is the dedication: "The [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King]] to the People, which at his call magnanimously offered its wealth and blood for the Fatherland, to the Fallen in memoriam, to the Living with acknowledgement, to Future Generations for emulation."&lt;ref&gt;In the German original: "Der Koenig dem Volke | das auf seinen Ruf hochherzig | Gut und Blut dem Vater= | lande darbrachte den Gefal= | lenen zum Gedaechtniß den | Lebenden zur Anerken= | nung den künftigen Geschlech= | tern zur Nacheiferung". Cf. Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;48. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This dedication was authored by [[August Boeckh]], a member of the philosophical class of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] commissioned to write it.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 50"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;50. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick William III had rejected three alternative proposals by the philosophical class.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 50"/&gt; This dedication may be considered problematic, inasmuch as it was not the king who had called his people, but the stubborn people, commoners, lower-ranking bureaucrats, military men, and members of the nobility who had stolen a march on the king.

People who had earlier welcomed and benefited from Napoleon's reforms and who, like those in other nations had been inspired by his earlier "Republican" ideals of emancipating commoners as citizens, started to resist when he betrayed these ideals by making himself Emperor, levying burdensome compulsory contributions for his projects designed to aggrandize himself and his family, impoverishing not only his own people, but those of other nations, and above all bringing about the deaths of thousands in seemingly unending wars.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 20"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;20. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the [[Continental System|blocus]], a measure against free trade, unfairly enforced favorable exchange rates of most European nations toward France while at the same time attempting to eliminate their far more profitable trade with Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 20"/&gt;

In 1813 the defeated and intimidated king, forced into a coalition with France since 1812,&lt;ref name="Pflug 1863 44"&gt;Ferdinand Pflug, [[s:Aus den Zeiten der schweren Noth (8)|"Aus den Zeiten der schweren Noth. Nr. 8. Der Landtag zu Königsberg und die Errichtung der Landwehr"]], in: ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'' (1863), Heft 3-4, pp. 44–56, here p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; against the will of his people refused the risky attempt to shake off the French supremacy in the wake of [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's defeats in Russia]]. [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Ludwig Yorck]], commanding the Prussian units supporting the French, had declared their neutrality towards the Russians without royal accord. In early 1813 irregular units, [[guerrilla]]s lacking royal sanction, began to form, swearing their allegiance to the German Fatherland rather than to the king.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 21"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;21. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 February 1813 the [[Prussian estates|East Prussian estates]] unanimously voted for financing, recruiting, and equipping a militia army (''Landwehr'') of 20,000 men, plus 10,000 in reserve, out of their funds, following a proposal designed by Yorck, [[Clausewitz]], and [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein]]. The hesitant king could not stop this anymore, but was forced to enact it on March 17 in his address entitled ''An mein Volk'' ("To My People").&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 29"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;29. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pflug 1863 44"/&gt;

However, this civic act of initiating Prussia's participation in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] was distasteful to the monarch, who again and again delayed implementing his promise of 22 May 1815 to introduce a parliament and a constitution for the entire kingdom.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 21"/&gt; Rather, the monarchs allied against Napolian subsequently granted themselves the right to suppress the rights previously granted to the citizens and to reverse all the reforms which had done away with feudalism.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 21"/&gt; On 21 March 1819, Frederick William even forbade his subjects to address any further petitions for him to fulfill his promise.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 21"/&gt; The [[Reactionary#Metternich and containment|reaction]] prevailed against the patriotic zeal of the populace.

==Alternative names==
The ponderous officialese name evoked many alternative names developed for the monument. Other names are ''Nationaldenkmal zur Erinnerung an die Befreiungskriege/Freiheitskriege'' (i.e. national monument in memory of the liberation/liberty wars, a more extended version), ''Befreiungsdenkmal'' (i.e. liberation monument), ''Kreuzbergdenkmal'' (i.e. Kreuzberg monument, however, there are at least five more monuments on [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|the Kreuzberg]] sparsed in [[Viktoriapark|Victoria Park]], which covers most of that hill), ''Kriegsdenkmal auf dem Kreuzberge'' (war monument on the Kreuzberg, somewhat indifferentiated), ''National-Monument'', ''Schinkeldenkmal'' (i.e. Schinkel monument, however, it is not a monument of Schinkel, but one by Schinkel), ''Siegesdenkmal'' (i.e. victory monument), ''Volksdenkmal auf dem Tempelhofer Berge'' (people's monument on the Tempelhof hill, however, it was the king's monument, with statues displaying the faces of many royal siblings, and the hill had been renamed by the king into Kreuzberg in 1821).{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

== Location ==
[[File:Victoria park berlin.png|thumb|right|Map with the National Monument within the Victoria Park]] The monument is located on the {{convert|66|m|ft|adj=mid|high}} top of [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|the Kreuzberg]] in the [[Tempelhofer Vorstadt]]. Between 1888 and 1894 the [[Viktoriapark|Victoria Park (Viktoriapark)]] was laid out around the monument. The monument, topped by an [[iron cross]], became name-giving for the hill it stands on, before mostly called ''Tempelhofer Berg'', but also denoted by many other names in its history. Hundred years after the inauguration of the monument, the VIth [[boroughs of Berlin|borough of Berlin]], established on 1 October 1920 and provisionally named ''Hallesches Tor'', was renamed into [[Kreuzberg]] on 27 September 1921.&lt;ref name="Wille 1986 21"&gt;Klaus-Dieter Wille, ''Spaziergänge in Kreuzberg'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;21. {{ISBN|3-7759-0287-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] has been called the «relatively modest outcome of grandiose plans».&lt;ref&gt;In the German original «relativ bescheidene Ergebnis grandioser Planungen» cf. ''Berlin: Kunstdenkmäler und Museen'', Eva Börsch-Supan, Helmut Börsch-Supan, Günther Kühne and Hella Reelfs, Stuttgart: Reclam, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1977, (=Reclams Kunstführer Deutschland; vol. 7), p. 301. {{ISBN|3-15-010265-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the monument resembles the spire top of an earlier project by Schinkel, a national memorial church with the working title ''Nationaldom'' designed in summer 1814, and a second draft in January 1815.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 22"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;22. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, like many other projects the memorial church never materialised due to lacking money. The compulsory contributions to France ([[Prussian thaler|thaler]] 41.73 million [=154.5 million Francs] alone by the [[Treaty of Tilsit]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brandt in collaboration with Thomas Hofmann, ''Preußen: Zur Sozialgeschichte eines Staates; eine Darstellung in Quellen'', edited on behalf of Berliner Festspiele as catalogue to the exhibition on Prussia between 15 May and 15 November 1981, Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1981, (=Preußen; vol. 3), p.&amp;nbsp;80. {{ISBN|3-499-34003-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), levied during its supremacy, which Prussia could mostly only raise by way of credit from various creditors, French and of other nations, heavily weighed as debts to be amortised and serviced on the budgets of municipalities, cities, states and other corporations until the 1870s.

Already in late 1813 other projects for monuments had been launched by [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]], [[Karl Sieveking]], [[Johann Heinrich von Dannecker]], [[Leo von Klenze]], [[Friedrich Weinbrenner]].&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 24"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;24. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schinkel considered for his project to ask the magistrate (city government) of Berlin to build a memorial.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 26"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;26. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; So like jumping the ship also the initiative for a war memorial did not originate with the king.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 25"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;25. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 1813, when the king had jumped on the bandwagon for the liberation wars, he established the [[military decoration]] of the [[Iron Cross]], backdated to March 10, late [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise's]] birthday.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 29"/&gt; He commissioned Schinkel to design the Iron Cross after a royal sketch.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 22&amp;29"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, pp.&amp;nbsp;22 and 29. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Iron Cross was a decoration of a new kind, available for every soldier, who had turned from subjects of different estate status into citizens by the establishment of the Prussian citizenship in 1810, therefore there were no status barriers to get the Iron Cross.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 30"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;30. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 1818 Schinkel commissioned the Royal Prussian Iron Foundry (Königlich Preußische Eisengießerei) to cast the pieces for the monument, including its statues.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 46"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;46. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundry estimated costs of [[Prussian thaler|thaler]] 20,646.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 46"/&gt; After negotiations on 27 August 1818 the merchant Gottfried Wilhelm August Tietz, the farming burgher Johann Friedrich Götze and Christian Weimar (Weymann) sold the top of the Götze'scher Berg (today's Kreuzberg) measuring 1.5 Prussian [[Morgen#Germany|Morgen]] ({{convert|2,839.83|m2|sqft|lk=out|abbr=on}}) and an access road branching off from Methfesselstraße.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 38"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;38. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 September 1818 the king approved the stipulated price of thaler 1,100 and an additional 400 as compensation for [[fixture (property law)|fixtures]].&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 38"/&gt; The adjacent land, measuring 72 Morgen ({{convert|18.38|ha|acre|lk=out|abbr=on}}), remained property of Götze, Tietz and Weimar.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 38"/&gt; The king confirmed the price.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 38"/&gt;

[[File:Nationaldenkmal Kreuzberg Berlin.JPG|thumb|right|The monument lengthwise.]] [[Duke Charles of Mecklenburg]] arranged the laying of the [[cornerstone|foundation stone]] for 19 September 1818, attended - among others - by Tzar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], [[Christian Daniel Rauch]] and Schinkel.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 39&amp;52"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, pp.&amp;nbsp;39 and 52. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An iron cast memorial medal was issued on that occasion and the proceeds were used for war invalids.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 39seq"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, pp.&amp;nbsp;39seq. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A bit northeast of the monument, deeper on the slope thus not blocking the view, a guard's house was erected after Schinkel's design in 1821.&lt;ref name="Tempelhofer 1986 13"&gt;''Die Tempelhofer Berge nebst ihrer Erhebung dem Kreuzberge anno 1286 bis 1986'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;13.

For the inauguration of the monument Frederick William III chose the 30 March 1821, the seventh anniversary of the conquest of the [[Montmartre]] in the [[Battle of Paris (1814)|Battle of Paris]].&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 41"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;41. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The inauguration was attended by the royal family, the Prussian generality, the senior pastors of all Protestant congregations of Berlin, and as guests by Grand Duke [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas of Russia]] and his wife [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)]], as well as by thousands of other spectators.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 41"/&gt; Court preacher Bishop [[Rulemann Friedrich Eylert]] held an inaugural prayer.&lt;ref name="Berlinische 1821"&gt;Report on the inauguration, in: ''Berlinische Nachrichten'', 31 March 1821, reprinted in: Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;124. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The national monument is crowned by an Iron Cross.&lt;ref name="Oschilewski 1965 19"/&gt; On the occasion of the inauguration the king renamed Götze'scher Berg into Kreuzberg (i.e. cross mountain) after the Iron Cross topping the monument.&lt;ref name="Oschilewski 1965 19"&gt;Walther Oschilewski, ''Kreuzberg: Ein Berliner Bezirk gestern und heute'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;19.

[[File:Hintze Kreuzberg 1829.JPG|thumb|left|View with the monument and the greyish-turquoise pyramidal roof of the guard's house (lower centre), 1829 by [[Johann Heinrich Hintze|Hintze]]]] On 1 December 1829 Frederick William III asked Schinkel for proposals how to improve the visibility of the monument.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 68"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;68. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schinkel's ideas, a socket or an encircling structure were never realised.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 68"/&gt; Schinkel had proposed to enlarge the tiny monument's plot (a radius of 53 Prussian feet; {{convert|16.634|m|ft|abbr=on}}) by buying an additional circular spread of 150 to 200 Prussian feet ({{convert|47.08|to|62.77|m|ft|abbr=on}}) around the monument, however, all rejected as too costly.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 73"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;73. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The southerly adjacent land had meanwhile been bought by the Gericke brothers, who planned to develop the area and opened the amusement park Tivoli right south of the monument.&lt;ref name="Tempelhofer 1986 13+15"&gt;''Die Tempelhofer Berge nebst ihrer Erhebung dem Kreuzberge anno 1286 bis 1986'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, pp.&amp;nbsp;13 and 15.

[[File:Denkmal auf dem viktoriapark in berlin kreuzberg, treppe.jpg|thumb|right|Strack's outside staircase]] Between 1857 and 1859 Tivoli brewery established on the site of the former amusement park south of the monument and its access from Methfesselstraße.&lt;ref name="Chod 2003 332"&gt;Kathrin Chod, Herbert Schwenk and Hainer Weißpflug, ''Berliner Bezirkslexikon: Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;332. {{ISBN|3-7759-0474-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 [[Johann Heinrich Strack]] proposed a socket building to elevate the monument, and King [[William I of Prussia]], in personal union also German Emperor, ordered its realisation in 1878.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 73"/&gt; [[Johann Wilhelm Schwedler]] carried out the plans.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 73"/&gt; On 29 August 1878 he elevated the monument, weighing 3,800 [[Zentner]] ({{convert|1900|kg|lb}}), with hydraulical pumps.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 73"/&gt; On 3 September the monument was turned by 21° with its front into the axis of the Großbeerenstraße, before on 25 October the monument was set to rest on the new socket building.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 73&amp;75"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, pp.&amp;nbsp;73 and 75. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The octagonal, {{convert|8|m|ft|adj=mid|high}}, crenellated bastion-like socket building is adorned with Silesian granite and sandstone covering the brick substructures.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 75"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;75. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A northerly outside staircase provides the access to the elevated level.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 75"/&gt; However, Strack's projected flight of stairs from the monument all the way down to Großbeerenstraße was again refused as too costly.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 75"/&gt;

In 1879 [[Guido von Madai]], president of the royal police, decreed a maximum height of buildings in the adjacent streets to uphold the visibility of the monument. The ordinance, however, was annulled by the groundbreaking 1882 "Kreuzberg judgement" of the Prussian Royal [[administrative court]], stating that the police had exceeded its authority to ensure [[public security]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. details on the suit "M. vs royal police department in Berlin", in: ''Entscheidungen des Königlichen Oberverwaltungsgerichts'': 106 vols., Berlin: Heymann, 1877–1941, vol. 9 (2nd ed., 1887), Ludwig Jacobi, Wilhelm Jebens and Gottlieb von Meyeren (eds.), pp.&amp;nbsp;345seqq.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December 1887 the city of Berlin acquired {{convert|8.5|ha|acre}} of unbuilt land from several owners, mostly north and west of the monument.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 87"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;87. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Right adjacent to the south the brewery (merged into Schultheiss in 1891), and in the east and northeast villas remained.&lt;ref&gt;In 1993 the brewery was closed and its compound is redeveloped as a residential area named Victoria Quarter.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 1888 the city parliament decided for City Garden Director [[Hermann Mächtig]]'s design for [[Viktoriapark|Victoria Park]], including a [[waterfall]] between monument and Großbeerenstraße.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 87"/&gt;

The monument was included in the Nazi plans for rebuilding Berlin, but only preparations materialised. [[Ernst Sagebiel]] oriented his [[Tempelhof Airport]] building towards the monument so that the central hall's front on the forecourt of the airport and one edge of the monument's octagonal groundplan are parallel. As seen from the monument today's [[Platz der Luftbrücke]] in front of the airport opens as a square, encircled by buildings of similar heights except for the taller central hall of the airport (mostly realised). The then planned axis consisting of a promenade and series of waterfalls cascading down the Kreuzberg hill towards the square was never realised, the interjacent block of houses remained untouched.&lt;ref&gt;See Christine Heeb, [http://www-docs.tu-cottbus.de/alumniplus/public/files/master_theses/christine_heeb.pdf "A multifaceted monument - the complex heritage of Tempelhof Central Airport"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719100831/http://www-docs.tu-cottbus.de/alumniplus/public/files/master_theses/christine_heeb.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}, Master of Arts thesis in World Heritage Studies, [[Brandenburg Technical University|Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus]], 2007 (pdf), pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|British bombing]] left behind a wake of devastation leading from one block north up the Großbeerenstraße, over the waterfall to the monument, blasting away the southern edge of the octagonal socket structure then used as a safe place for casts of various sculptures, such as the Quadriga of the [[Brandenburg Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;The casts were taken in 1942, survived the cracking of the socket building rather intact, so that the original Quadriga almost completely destroyed in the Second World War could be replaced by a replica cast in [[West Berlin]] in 1957.

The casts were relocated from the open socket building in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="Fischer 2007 29"&gt;Rike Fischer, ''Auf dem Gipfel von Berlin – Ein Spaziergang durch den Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;29. {{ISBN|3-935810-07-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Black Cross.jpg|thumb|right|A Greek cross resembling the groundplan of the monument with its arms being of equal length but shorter than the width of their ends]] It is said that due to the influence of Crown Prince [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William (IV)]] Schinkel's design in Gothic Revival style prevailed over another in rather [[neoclassical architecture|classicist forms]].&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 27"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;27. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was decided to be made from [[cast iron]].&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 28"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;28. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{Interlanguage link multi|Royal Prussian Iron Foundry|de|3=Königlich Preußische Eisengießerei}}, renowned for its [[Berlin Iron Jewellery]] (Eisenkunstguss, Fer de Berlin) produced all the parts of the monument.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 28"/&gt; Frederick William III popularised cast iron by using it himself for decoration and table ware.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 28"/&gt;

The groundplan of the monument is a [[Greek cross]] with its arms being of equal length but shorter than the width of their ends. Its twelve edges are each dedicated to one battle of the Liberation Wars. The somewhat wider ends of the four arms are reserved for the four main battles with golden inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 52"/&gt; Each of the twelve outward edges bears an inscription with the name and date of the battle topped by a little socket displaying an Iron Cross. Above each socket is a niche with the iron cast statue of a [[genius (mythology)|genius]] symbolising with their decoration and accessories the respective battle. The niches are in the actual structure of the monument tapering off to the top crowned again by an Iron Cross.

Originally [[Christian Daniel Rauch]] and [[Christian Friedrich Tieck]] had been commissioned to design and model each six statues. However, both were too busy and partially not in Berlin so that the creation of the statues was always on delay.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 52"/&gt; Therefore, [[Ludwig Wilhelm Wichmann]] was additionally appointed to model some of the genii after Rauch's and Tieck's designs.&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 52"/&gt; As a guideline for the designs of the genii Schinkel recommended frescos by [[Pietro Perugino]] in the audience hall of the [[Collegio del Cambio]] in [[Perugia]].&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 66"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;66. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Prussian Monuments for the Liberation Wars==

Since early 1817 a series of, partially pyramidal, war monuments, each topped by an Iron Cross had been already realised in [[Großbeeren]], [[Dennewitz]], [[Großgörschen]], at the [[Kaczawa|Katzbach]] near [[Legnickie Pole|Wahlstatt]] (all in 1817), as well as in [[Chojnów|Haynau]] and [[La Belle Alliance]] (both in 1818).&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 27&amp;77"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, pp.&amp;nbsp;27 and 77. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Monument for the Liberation Wars, though built later than the others, was considered the mother of all other earlier memorials for the Liberation Wars,&lt;ref name="Berlinische 1821"/&gt; More monuments for the Liberation Wars topped by an Iron Cross, not always from cast iron, but sandstone followed in [[Greifswald]], [[Krefeld]], [[Minden]], [[Elsfleth]], [[Breslau]] and on the [[Drachenfels (Siebengebirge)|Drachenfels]] (1857).&lt;ref name="Nungesser 1987 77"&gt;Michael Nungesser, ''Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;77. {{ISBN|3-922912-19-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other monuments on the Kreuzberg ==

[[File:Ernst Herter - Der seltene Fang.jpg|thumb|right|''The rare haul'' by [[Ernst Herter|Herter]], 1896, however, not on, but at the foot of the Kreuzberg.]]
Other monuments on the Kreuzberg are:

*Two [[herms]] of "poets and singers of German patriotism".&lt;ref name="Wille 1986 23"&gt;Klaus-Dieter Wille, ''Spaziergänge in Kreuzberg'', [[#References|see references]] for bibliographical details, p.&amp;nbsp;23. {{ISBN|3-7759-0287-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Monument of [[Heinrich von Kleist]], 1898 by Karl Pracht, aluminum replica on the Kreuzberg, marble original preserved in the schoolyard of Leibniz-Gymnasium
** Monument of [[Friedrich Rückert]], 1899 by Ferdinand Lepcke, replica on the Kreuzberg (meanwhile stolen), original preserved in the schoolyard of Leibniz-Gymnasium&lt;ref&gt;A third surviving monument of a poet is that of [[Ludwig Uhland]] (1899 by Max Kruse), with its aluminum replica being located on street level at the foot of the Kreuzberg. The monuments of [[Max von Schenkendorf]] (1899 by Alfred Reichel), [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] (1899 by Hans Latt) and of [[Theodor Körner (author)|Theodor Körner]] (1899 by Ernst Wenck) were all destroyed in the Second World War and not reconstructed.

There are more monuments in the park, but rather on street level, and not on the Kreuzberg, such as the well known ''The rare haul'' (1896 by [[Ernst Herter]]), a herm to [[Ludwig Uhland]] (1899 by Max Kruse, aluminum replica) or the monument to the raped women.

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] have both immigrated and migrated to [[New York City]]. The first group of Puerto Ricans immigrated to New York City in the mid-19th century when Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony and its people Spanish subjects. The following wave of Puerto Ricans to move to New York City did so after the [[Puerto Rico Campaign|Spanish–American War]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/puertorico.html |title=The World of 1898: The Spanish–American War |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Ricans were no longer Spanish subjects and citizens of Spain, they were now [[Puerto Rican citizenship|Puerto Rican citizens]] of an American possession and needed passports to travel to the mainland of the United States.

That was until 1917, when the [[United States Congress]] approved [[Jones-Shafroth Act]] which gave Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico a [[U.S. citizenship]] with certain limitations. Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States however, were given full American citizenship and were allowed to seek political office in the states which they resided. Two months later, when Congress passed the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], conscription was extended to the Puerto Ricans both in the island and in the mainland. It was expected that Puerto Rican men 18 years and older serve in the U.S. military &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5064/ |title=Puerto Rican Laborers During World War I |publisher=Historymatters.gmu.edu |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[Puerto Ricans in World War I|World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/puertorico.html |title=The World of 1898: The Spanish–American War |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jones-Shafroth Act also allowed Puerto Ricans to travel between Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland without the need of a passport, thereby becoming migrants. The advent of [[air travel]] was one of the principal factors that led to the largest wave of migration of Puerto Ricans to New York City in the 1950s, known as "The Great Migration". Similar to many other U.S. East Coast cities, Puerto Ricans were the first Hispanic group to move to New York City in large numbers.

From 1970 until about 1990, the city's Puerto Rican population was at its height, they represented up to 80% of the city's Hispanic community and 12% of the city's total population, at that time nearly 70% of Puerto Ricans lived in New York. It wasn't until the 1990s, that the percentage Puerto Ricans made up of the city's Hispanic community and the total population as a whole started to decrease, largely due to a declining Puerto Rican population, increasingly diversifying Hispanic community, and New York City rebounding its economy after deindustrialization, which ultimately resulted in a faster growing city population and dwindling Puerto Rican influence. However, since the early 2010s, New York's Puerto Rican population started to grow again, being in the midst of another major migration wave out of Puerto Rico.

According to the 2010 census, Puerto Ricans represent 8.9 percent of New York City alone (32% of the city's Hispanic community), and 5.5% of New York State as a whole.&lt;ref name="ByType2010"/&gt; Over a million Puerto Ricans in the state, about 70% are present in the city, with the remaining portion scattered in the city's suburbs and other major cities throughout New York State. Although [[Florida]] has received some dispersal of the population, there has been a resurgence in Puerto Rican migration to [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], primarily for economic and cultural considerations&lt;ref name=PuertoRicansReturningToNewYork&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/22/us/puerto-rico-migration-economy/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=Why more Puerto Ricans are living in mainland U.S. than in Puerto Rico|author=Cindy Y.

==Early 19th century==

During the 19th century, commerce existed between the ports of the [[East Coast of the United States]] and the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico. Ship records show that many Puerto Ricans traveled on ships that sailed from and to the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Many of them settled in places such as New York, [[Connecticut]], and [[Massachusetts]]. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, many Puerto Ricans, such as Lieutenant [[Augusto Rodríguez (soldier)|Augusto Rodriguez]], joined the ranks of military armed forces, however since Puerto Ricans were Spanish subjects they were inscribed as Spaniards.&lt;ref name="CW"&gt;"The Puerto Rican Diaspora: historical perspectives"; By Carmen Teresa Whalen, Víctor Vázquez-Hernandez; page 176; Publisher: Temple University Press; {{ISBN|978-1-59213-413-7}}; {{ISBN|1-59213-413-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Puerto Rican enclave in New York City was in [[Manhattan]].  Most of the Puerto Ricans who moved there came from well-to-do families or were people whose economic situation could permit them the luxury of traveling from the island to New York City by way of [[steamship]], an expensive and long trip. Amongst the first Puerto Ricans to immigrate to New York City were men and women who were exiled by the Spanish Crown for their political beliefs and struggles for the cause of Puerto Rican independence.  By 1850, Puerto Rico and [[Cuba]] were the only two remaining Spanish colonies in the [[New World]].  The Spanish Crown would either imprison or banish any person who promoted the independence of these two nations.&lt;ref name="Palante"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palante.org/History.htm |title=Palante History |publisher=Palante.org |date=1917-03-17 |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these exiles were [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]] and [[Segundo Ruiz Belvis]] who together founded [[Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico|"The Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico"]] in New York.  They were the planners of the short and failed 1868 revolt against Spain in Puerto Rico known as [[El Grito de Lares]].&lt;ref&gt;Ojeda Reyes, Félix, ''El Desterrado de París'', pp. 94–104&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent Puerto Rican who in 1871 immigrated to New York was [[Arturo Alfonso Schomburg]], considered by many as the "Father of Black History".  He too became a member of the "Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico" and was an outspoken promoter of not only the independence of Puerto Rico but of Cuba's also.&lt;ref&gt;[Antonio Vélez Alvarado, amigo y colaborador consecuente de Martí y Betances, Author: Dávila, Ovidio; pp. 11–13.; Publisher: San Juan, P.R. : Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture), 2002. (Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the Puerto Rican Flag==

{{Main article|Flags of Puerto Rico}}

Four other Puerto Ricans who moved to New York because of political reasons were Manuel Besosa, [[Antonio Vélez Alvarado]], [[Juan Ríus Rivera]] and [[Francisco Gonzalo Marín]]. These four Puerto Ricans joined the Cuban Liberation Army whose headquarters was in New York City.

Some sources document Francisco Gonzalo Marín with presenting a Puerto Rican flag prototype in 1895 for adoption by the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. Marín has since been credited by some with the flag's design.&lt;ref&gt;"Latin America's Wars Volume I: The Age of the Caudillo, 1791–1899"; by Robert L. Scheina; Pg. 359; Publisher: Potomac Books Inc.; 1 edition (January 2003); {{ISBN|1-57488-449-2}}; {{ISBN|978-1-57488-449-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a letter written by Juan de Mata Terreforte which gives credit to Marin. The original contents of the letter in Spanish are the following:&lt;ref name="FGMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verbiclara.nireblog.com/post/2008/07/02/vida-pasion-y-muerte-de-francisco-gonzalo-marin-pachin|title=Vida, pasión y muerte de Francisco Gonzalo Marín [Pachín]|trans-title=The life, passion, and death of Francisco Gonzalo Marín [Pachín]|language=es|publisher=verbiclara.nireblog.com|date=July 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420015919/http://verbiclara.nireblog.com/post/2008/07/02/vida-pasion-y-muerte-de-francisco-gonzalo-marin-pachin|archivedate=April 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotebox|"La adopción de la bandera cubana con los colores invertidos me fue sugerida por el insigne patriota Francisco Gonzalo Marín en una carta que me escribió desde Jamaica. Yo hice la proposición a los patriotas puertorriqueños que asistieron al mitin de Chimney Hall y fue aprobada unánimemente."}} Which translated in English states the following: {{quotebox|The adaptation of the Cuban flag with the colors inverted was suggested by the patriot Francisco Gonzalo Marín in a letter which he wrote from [[Jamaica]]. I made the proposition to various Puerto Rican patriots during a meeting at Chimney Hall and it was approved unanimously.&lt;ref name="FGMS"/&gt;}}
[[File:Junta Revolucionaria.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee&lt;br /&gt;(standing L-R) Manuel Besosa, Aurelio Méndez Martínez, and Sotero Figueroa (seated L-R) Juan de M. Terreforte, D. Jose Julio Henna and Roberto H. Todd]]
It is also believed that on June 12, 1892, Antonio Vélez Alvarado was at his apartment at 219 Twenty-Third Street in Manhattan, when he stared at a Cuban flag for a few minutes, and then took a look at the blank wall in which it was being displayed. Vélez suddenly perceived an optical illusion, in which he perceived the image of the Cuban flag with the colors in the flag's triangle and stripes inverted. Almost immediately he visited a nearby merchant, Domingo Peraza, from whom he bought some crepe paper to build a crude prototype. He later displayed his prototype in a dinner meeting at his neighbor's house, where the owner, Micaela Dalmau vda. de Carreras, had invited [[José Martí]] as a guest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digilib.nypl.org/dynaweb/ead/scm/scmgaasp/@Generic__BookTextView/163;pt=163#X Schomburg (Arthur A.) Papers, 1724–1895 (1904–1938)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written by Maria Manuela (Mima) Besosa, the daughter of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee member Manuel Besosa, she stated that she sewed the flag. This created a belief that her father could have been its designer.

Even though Marín presented the [[Puerto Rican Flag]] in New York's "Chimney Corner Hotel",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbetances.com/ |title=Francisco Marin |publisher=Redbetances.com |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may never be known who designed the current flag. What is known, however, is that on December 22, 1895, the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee officially adopted a design which is today the official flag of Puerto Rico.

In 1897, [[Antonio Mattei Lluberas]], a wealthy coffee plantation owner from Yauco, visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]], Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio Méndez Martinez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising, which became known as the [[Intentona de Yauco]] was to be directed by Betances, organized by Aurelio Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Juan Ríus Rivera from Cuba.&lt;ref name="HMPR"&gt;"Historia militar de Puerto Rico"; by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 305–06; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; {{ISBN|84-7844-138-7}}; {{ISBN|978-84-7844-138-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The political immigration to New York practically came to a halt in 1898 after the Spanish–American War when Puerto Rico became a possession of the United States.  It is estimated that 1,800 Puerto Rican citizens (they were not American citizens until 1917) had immigrated to New York during this period.&lt;ref name="Immigartion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/immig/cuban3.html |title=Immigration Puerto Rican/Cuban |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I era==
[[File:TheSanJuanNews.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The San Juan News'' announcing the Supreme Court decision in the Isabel Gonzalez case of 1904]]
In 1902, the [[United States Treasury Department]] issued new immigration guidelines that changed the status of all Puerto Ricans to "foreigners." [[Isabel Gonzalez]] was a young single mother who was expecting her second child. Her fiancé, who was in New York, sent for her with the intention of getting married. When Gonzalez arrived in New York, she and all the Puerto Ricans who were with her, were detained in [[Ellis Island]] and denied entry. She was accused of being an alien and as an unwed parent she was deemed as a burden to the welfare system of the country. Gonzalez challenged the Government of the United States in the groundbreaking case "GONZALES v. WILLIAMS' (her surname was misspelled by immigration officials). The Supreme Court ruled that under the immigration laws González was not an alien, and therefore could not be denied entry into New York. It also stated that Puerto Ricans were not U.S. citizens, they were "noncitizen nationals." Gonzalez, who became an activist on behalf of all Puerto Ricans, paved the way for the [[Jones-Shafroth Act]], which conferred United States citizenship on all citizens of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=192&amp;invol=1 |title=U.S. Supreme Court |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, the United States entered World War I and that same year the United States Congress approved the Jones-Shafroth Act which gave Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship. Puerto Ricans no longer needed a passport to travel to the U.S. and were allowed to seek public office in the mainland U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/jonesact.html |title=Jones Act – Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic situation in the island was bad and continued to worsen as a result of the many hurricanes which destroyed most of its crops. Many Puerto Rican families [[immigration to the United States|migrated to the United States]], the bulk of whom went to New York, in search of a better way of life.&lt;ref name="Immigartion"/&gt; In New York, they faced the same hardships and discrimination that earlier groups of immigrants, such as the [[Irish people|Irish]], the [[Italians]], and the [[Jews]], had faced before them. It was difficult for them to find well paying jobs because of the language barrier and their lack of technical working skills.  The few men who found jobs worked for low salaries in factories.  The women usually stayed home as housewives and tended to their children. Those who did not find jobs had the option of joining the United States Military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/memorial.html |title=America's Defense |publisher=Houstonculture.org |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Jones-Shafroth Act, Puerto Ricans in the mainland United States as all other non-citizens, who were permanent residents were required to register with the Selective Service System by law and could be drafted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters |first=Justin |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1005634/ |title="Can Non-Citizens Join the Military?", by: Jeremy Derfner |publisher=Slate.com |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; however one of the effects of the Act was that all Puerto Ricans were now eligible for the military "draft" ([[conscription]]). One of the military units at that time was New York's [[369th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment]]. [[Rafael Hernández Marín|Rafael Hernández]] was a Puerto Rican who served in the almost all [[Afro-American]] unit. The unit fought against the [[Germans]] in France and became known{{by whom|date=July 2014}} as the "Harlem Hell Fighters". Hernández, his brother Jesus and 16 other Puerto Ricans was assigned to the United States Army's Harlem Hell fighters musical band, the Orchestra Europe.

[[Nero Chen]] was one of the many Puerto Ricans who settled in East Harlem. He became the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain acclaim when in 1917 he fought against "Panama Joe Gans" at Harlem's Palace Casino which was located at 28 East 135th St., between [[Fifth Avenue|Fifth]] and [[Madison Avenue]]s, in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="PPNY"&gt;"Pioneros Puertorriqueños en Nueva York"; by Joaquin Colon Lopez; pages: 229, 230; Publisher: Arte Publico Press (November 2001); {{ISBN|1-55885-335-9}}; {{ISBN|978-1-55885-335-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As evidenced by an early 1924 poster, migrants in New York organized baseball teams which played against each other. The poster announces a game which was held at Howard Field in Brooklyn between two teams, the San Juan B.B.C. and the Porto Rican Stars, made of Puerto Ricans from the East Side section of Manhattan.

As the economic situation in the United States worsened in a prelude to the [[Great Depression]], many Puerto Ricans in the mainland found themselves competing with other groups for the positions of unskilled labor such as dishwashers, maintenance and laundry workers. This led to the "Harlem Riots" of July 1926. between unemployed Jews and Puerto Ricans. Various Puerto Rican organizations in East Harlem, organized a media campaign to ease the tensions between the groups involved and called upon the mayor, governor of the state to restore order and provide protection to the area.&lt;ref&gt;"Leonard Covello and the Making of Benjamin Franklin High School"; By Michael C. Johanek, John L. Puckett; Page 66; Published 2007 Temple University Press; {{ISBN|1-59213-521-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, [[Oscar Garcia Rivera, Sr.]] (1900–1969), a native of [[Mayagüez]] and resident of East Harlem, became the first Puerto Rican to be elected to public office in the continental United States as a member of the [[New York State Assembly]]. A witness of the discrimination which Puerto Ricans were subject to, he created the "Unemployment Insurance Bill" which paved the way for the passage of bills which established minimum hours and wages for working people, the creation of a Wage Board within the Labor Department, and the right of employees to organize and negotiate grievances. In 1956, he also became the first Puerto Rican to be nominated as the Republican candidate for Justice of the City Court.&lt;ref name="EHN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.east-harlem.com/mt/archives/cat_people_news.html |title=East Harlem News |publisher=East-harlem.com |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II and The Great Migration==
Several factors contributed and led to what came to be known as '''"The Great Migration"''' of Puerto Ricans to New York.  These were the following: the [[Great Depression]], World War II and the advent of air travel.

The Great Depression which spread throughout the world was also felt in Puerto Rico.  Since the island's economy was and still is dependent to that of the United States, it was to be expected that when the American banks and industries began to fail the effect would be felt in the island.  Unemployment was on the rise as a consequence and  therefore, many families fled to the mainland U.S.A. in search of jobs.&lt;ref name="greatdepressionsbook.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatdepressionsbook.com |title=Great Depressions of the Twentieth Century, edited by T. J. Kehoe and E. C. Prescott |publisher=Greatdepressionsbook.com |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of World War II opened the doors to many of the migrants who were searching for jobs.  Since a large portion of the male population of the U.S. was sent to war, there was a sudden need of manpower to fulfill the jobs left behind.  Puerto Ricans, both male and female, found themselves employed in factories and ship docks, producing both domestic and warfare goods.  The new migrants gained the knowledge and working skills which in the future would serve them well.  The military also provided a steady source of income,&lt;ref name="Palante"/&gt; in 1944, the Puerto Rican WAC unit, Company 6, 2nd Battalion, 21st Regiment of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, a segregated Hispanic unit, was assigned to the [[New York Port of Embarkation]], after their basic training at [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia]]. They were assigned to work in military offices which planned the shipment of troops around the world.&lt;ref name="PR Women"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/PRHistory.html |title=Puerto Rican Woman in Defense of our country |publisher=Womensmemorial.org |date=1944-08-21 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205715/http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/PRHistory.html |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"LAS WACS"-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Seginda Guerra Mundial; by: Carmen Garcia Rosado; page 60; 1ra.

The advent of air travel provided Puerto Ricans with an affordable and faster way of travel to New York.  The one thing that most migrants had in common was that they wanted a better way of life than was available in Puerto Rico, and although each held personal reasons for migrating, their decision generally was rooted in the island's impoverished conditions as well as the public policies that sanctioned migration.&lt;ref name="Immigartion"/&gt;

In 1948, the Migration Division of the Department of Labor of Puerto Rico opened its office in New York City. Its mission was to mediate between the island and the New York/Puerto Rican community, assuage the adjustment experience of new arrivals, and generally inform them about jobs, housing and other critical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;"Images of America; Pioneros II-Puerto Ricans in New York City 1948–1998"; by: Virginia Sanchez Korrol and Pedro Juan Hernandez; {{ISBN|978-0-7385-7245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't long before the Puerto Rican "Barrios" in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]], [[South Bronx]], Spanish Harlem, and Manhattan's Lower East Side began to resemble "Little Puerto Ricos" with their "Bodegas" (small grocery stores) and "[[Piragua (food)|Piragueros]]" (Puerto Rican shaved ice venders) in every corner.&lt;ref name="AJES"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1536-7150.1968.tb03082.x |title=Discrimination, Subculture, and the Economic Performance of Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican-Americans|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology |date=1968|volume=27|pages=371–375|doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1968.tb03082.x|first=Martin T. |last=Katzman}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that from 1946 to 1950 there were 31,000 Puerto Rican migrants each year to New York.

===Puerto Rican culture in New York===
[[File:Piragua1920.jpg|thumb|left|A piragüero in NYC posing with his Piragua pushcart in the 1920s]]
Puerto Ricans began to form their own small "[[barrio]]s", in [[The Bronx]], [[Brooklyn]] and in East Harlem (which would become known as [[Spanish Harlem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/Art/A&amp;I/Harcpt.htm |title=Harlem Hell Fighters |publisher=Army.mil |date=1918-09-29 |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in East Harlem where the Puerto Rican migrants established a cultural life of great vitality and sociality. They also participated in some of the sports, such as boxing and baseball which were first introduced in the island by the American Armed Forces after the Spanish–American War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portalesp.caguas.gov.pr/.../historia.../Origen%20del%20béisbol%20en%20Puerto%20Rico.pdf Historia del Beisbol en Puerto Rico]&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Ricans who moved to New York not only took with them their customs, traditions, they also took with them their [[Piragua (food)|piraguas]], a Puerto Rican frozen treat, shaped like a pyramid, made of [[shaved ice]] and covered with fruit flavored syrup.&lt;ref name="greatdepressionsbook.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Columbia History of Latinos in the United States Since 1960"; By David Gregory Gutiérrez; pg. 98; Published 2004 by Columbia University Press; {{ISBN|0-231-11808-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia:'' by Winston James, piraguas were introduced in New York by Puerto Ricans as early as 1926.

===Puerto Rican music===
[[File:Teatro Puerto Rico - 1954.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Teatro Puerto Rico]]
Puerto Rican music flourished with the likes of Rafael Hernández and [[Pedro Flores (composer)|Pedro Flores]] who formed the "Trio Borincano" and gained recognition in the city. [[Myrta Silva]] who later joined Hernandez's "Cuarteto Victoria" also gained fame as a singer after the group traveled and played throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="AJES"/&gt;

The South Bronx became a hub for Puerto Rican music. Theaters which had served to previous groups of immigrants, such as the Irish and the Italians, for their dramatic works or vaudeville style shows, now served the growing Puerto Rican and Latino population with musical performances from musicians from Puerto Rico and Latin America. Plus, the local Bronx's burgeoning Latino musicians. Among these theaters were the historical [[Teatro Puerto Rico]] at E. 138th St. and Hunts Point Palace in Southern Blvd. During the Teatro Puerto Rico's "golden era", which lasted from 1947 to 1956, musician [[José Feliciano]] made his stateside debut&lt;ref name="CJ"&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|first1=Roberta L.|last1=Singer|first2=Elena|last2=Martínez|url=http://www.placematters.net/files/pdfs/mambo.pdf|title=A South Bronx Latin Music Tale|journal=Centro Journal|pages=5–6|volume=XVI|issue=1|date=2004|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City also became the mecca for [[freestyle music]] in the 1980s, of which Puerto Rican [[singer-songwriter]]s represented an integral component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/library/history_of_freestyle.html|title=The History of Freestyle Music|first=Joey|last=Gardner|publisher=music.hyperreal.org|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Rican influence in popular music continues in the 21st century, encompassing major artists such as [[Jennifer Lopez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/jennifer_lopez|title=López, Jennifer|accessdate=May 21, 2015|publisher=musicofpuertorico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s==
The third great wave of domestic migration from Puerto Rico came after World War II. Nearly 40,000 Puerto Ricans settled in New York City in 1946, and 58,500 in 1952–53. Many soldiers who returned after World War II made use of the [[GI Bill]] and went to college. Puerto Rican women confronted economic exploitation, discrimination, racism, and the insecurities inherent in the migration process on a daily basis, however they fared better than did men in the job market. The women left their homes for the factories in record numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Virginia|last=Sánchez Korrol|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/women/html/wh_030800_puertoricanw.htm|title=Puerto Rican Women|publisher=college.hmco.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325081938/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/women/html/wh_030800_puertoricanw.htm|archivedate=March 25, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1953, Puerto Rican migration to New York reached its peak when 75,000 people left the island.&lt;ref name="Palante"/&gt;
[[File:Ricky Martin at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Ricky Martin]] at the annual Puerto Rican parade in New York City]]

[[Operation Bootstrap]] ("Operación Manos a la Obra") is the name given to the ambitious projects which industrialized Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century engineered by [[Teodoro Moscoso]]. The industry that was attracted did not provide sufficient jobs. With increased population growth and displacement from traditional labor pursuits, the growing population could not be accommodated. Much of the surplus labor migrated to the United States. In 1948, Puerto Ricans elected their first governor [[Luis Muñoz Marín]], who together with his government initiated a series of social and economic reforms with the introduction of new programs in the island.  Some of these programs met some resistance from the American government and therefore, the local government had some trouble implementing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa031698.htm|title=About.com – Puerto Rico|publisher=Geography.about.com|date=November 8, 2012|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]] began a campaign to recruit Puerto Rican laborers in the island to work in the city's factories. Mayor Wagner figured that the city would benefit greatly by the luring of what was considered to be "cheap labor".&lt;ref name="Palante"/&gt;

Discrimination was rampant in the United States and it was no different in New York. As stated by [[Lolita Lebrón]], there were signs in restaurants which read '''"No dogs or Puerto Ricans allowed"'''. The [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]] established an office in New York in the 1950s and attracted many migrants. Leaders of the party conceived a plan that would involve an attack on the [[Blair House]] with the intention of assassinating United States President [[Harry S. Truman]] and an attack on the House of Representatives. These events had a negative impact on the Puerto Rican migrants. Americans viewed Puerto Ricans as anti-Americans and the discrimination against them became even more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A48918-2004Feb17 A 2004 Washington Post article on Lolita's life]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Puerto Ricans were able to overcome these obstacles and became respected members of their communities. Many such as [[Antonia Pantoja]], established organizations such as "ASPIRA", that helped their fellow countrymen to reach their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspira.org/pantoja.htm|title=Our Founder Dr. Antonia Pantoja 1922–2002|publisher=ASPIRA.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044405/http://www.aspira.org/pantoja.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, a group of politicians close to [[Carmine DeSapio|Carmine Gerard DeSapio]], then the leader of [[Tammany Hall]], chose [[Tony Méndez]] to lead the eastern section of the district, known as the 14th Assembly District. He was chosen by the group, which was also known as the Democratic County Committee, because in those days there was no direct election of district leaders. Plus, the influx of Puerto Ricans moving to the 14th Assembly District, in which East Harlem is located, replaced the members of the Italian Community who preceded them and eventually moved out. Méndez became the first native-born Puerto Rican to become a district leader of a major political party in New York City.&lt;ref name="TM"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/10/obituaries/antonio-mendez-dead-at-80-east-harlem-political-leader.html Tony Mendez obituary], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first New York Puerto Rican Day Parade, founded by Tony Méndez was held on Sunday, April 13, 1958 in the "Barrio" in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="TM" /&gt; Its first President was Victor López and it was coordinated by José Caballero. The grand marshals were Oscar González Suarez and Tony Méndez Esq. Prominent personalities from Puerto Rico headed by then Governor Luis Muñoz Marín, attended the initial parade. The parade was organized as a show of Puerto Rican pride and is a tradition which not only continues today in the city of New York but, that has also extended to other cities such as [[Chicago]], Illinois and [[Orlando, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brightcove.com/title.jsp?title=1033870790&amp;channel=992845440 Puerto Rican Day Parade] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930050138/http://www.brightcove.com/title.jsp?title=1033870790&amp;channel=992845440 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1960, the United States census showed that there were well over 600,000 New Yorkers of Puerto Rican birth or parentage. Estimates were that more than one million Puerto Ricans had migrated during that period.&lt;ref name="Palante"/&gt;

==Nuyorican Movement==
[[File:Nuyorican Poets Cafe in Loisaida section of New York City.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Nuyorican Poets Café]]
Puerto Rican writer [[Jesús Colón]] founded an intellectual movement involving poets, writers, musicians and artists who are Puerto Rican or of Puerto Rican descent and who live in or near New York City which became known as the [[Nuyorican Movement]]. The phenomenon of the "Nuyoricans" came about when many Puerto Ricans who migrated to New York City faced difficult situations and hardships, such as racial discrimination. A "Nuyorican" subculture developed. In 1980, Puerto Rican poets [[Miguel Algarín]], [[Miguel Piñero]] and [[Pedro Pietri]] established the "Nuyorican Poets Café" on Manhattan's Lower East Side (236 E 3rd Street, between Avenues B and C) which is now considered a New York landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Pamela|url=http://www.ncteamericancollection.org/aaw_poetry_essay.htm|title=The Poetry Heritage of Puerto Rico|publisher=ncteamericancollection.org|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021030074125/http://www.ncteamericancollection.org/aaw_poetry_essay.htm|archivedate=October 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1964, the Puerto Rican community made up 9.3 percent of the total New York City's population. The Puerto Rican migrants who gained economic success began to move away from the "Barrios" and settled in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]], and [[Long Island]] or moved to other cities in other states like New Jersey (especially [[North Jersey]] which is still apart of the NYC metropolitan area), Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Florida, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avenuea.org/ev/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=51 east Village]&lt;/ref&gt; New immigrants from the [[Dominican Republic]], Mexico and South America moved into the Barrios which were once mainly occupied by the Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/D.Badillo.BxImm.pdf|title=New Immigrants in The Bronx – The Bronx County Historical Society|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s saw what became known as reverse-migration. Many Puerto Ricans returned to the island to buy homes and to invest in local businesses. Puerto Ricans have made many important contributions to New York and the society of the United States in general. They have contributed in the fields of entertainment, the arts, music, industry, science, politics, and military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2002/vol6n51/PRRebirthBarrio-en.html|title=Puerto Rico Herald|publisher=Puerto Rico Herald|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Puerto Ricans have moved from New York to settle in smaller cities throughout the [[northeastern United States]]. For example, in 2009 Puerto Ricans alone made up 29.1% of [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading, Pennsylvania's]] population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=ChangeGeoContext&amp;geo_id=16000US4263624&amp;_geoContext=&amp;_street=&amp;_county=Reading&amp;_cityTown=Reading&amp;_state=04000US42&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;_submenuId=factsheet_1&amp;ds_name=ACS_2009_5YR_SAFF&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null%3Anull&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry=|title=Government Census 1|publisher=Factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was over 53% Hispanic, and 25.0% of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence, Massachusetts']] population, which was over 70% Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=Search&amp;geo_id=16000US4263624&amp;_geoContext=01000US%7c04000US42%7c16000US4263624&amp;_street=&amp;_county=lawrence&amp;_cityTown=lawrence&amp;_state=04000US25&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=160&amp;_submenuId=factsheet_1&amp;ds_name=ACS_2009_5YR_SAFF&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null%3Anull&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry=|title=Government Census 2|publisher=Factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PRimmigrationchart.png|250px|thumb|1980s Chart showing the Puerto Rican migration movement in the United States]]

However, since 2006, there has been a resurgence in immigration from Puerto Rico to New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-06-08/news/29651265_1_puerto-ricans-undocumented-immigrants-immigration-reform-movement|title=The Puerto Ricans are coming!|first=Dolores|last=Prida|publisher=NYDailyNews.com|date=June 8, 2011|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey, with an apparently multifactorial allure to Puerto Ricans, primarily for economic and cultural considerations.

New York State overall has also resumed its net in-migration of Puerto Rican Americans since 2006, a dramatic reversal from being the only state to register a decrease in its Puerto Rican population between 1990 and 2000. The Puerto Rican population of New York State, still the largest in the United States, is estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau to have increased from 1,070,558 in 2010 to 1,103,067 in 2013. New York State gained more Puerto Rican migrants from Puerto Rico as well as from elsewhere on the mainland between 2006 and 2012 than any other state ''in absolute numbers''.&lt;ref name=Pew2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2014/08/11/puerto-rican-population-declines-on-island-grows-on-u-s-mainland/|title=Puerto Rican Population Declines on Island, Grows on U.S. Mainland|author=D’Vera Cohn, Eileen Patten, and Mark Hugo Lopez|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=August 11, 2014|accessdate=August 29, 2015|quote=However, New York has been the single biggest state magnet for migrants: According to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, among Puerto Ricans between 2006–2012, 31% of moves from the island to the mainland and 20% of moves from one state to another state were to the Empire State.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, unlike the initial pattern of migration several decades ago, this second Puerto Rican migration into New York and surrounding states is being driven by movement not only into New York City proper, but also into the city's surrounding suburban areas, such that the New York City Metropolitan Area gained the highest number of additional Puerto Rican Americans of any metropolitan area between 2010 and 2016, to 1,494,670 in 2016.&lt;ref name = NYMetroPRest/&gt;

==Enclaves==

[[Brooklyn]] has several neighborhoods with a Puerto Rican presence, and many of the ethnic Puerto Rican neighborhoods in Brooklyn formed before the Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the [[South Bronx]] because of the work demand in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in the 1940s and 50s. [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] has the highest concentration of Puerto Ricans in Brooklyn. Other neighborhoods with significant populations include [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]], [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], [[Coney Island, Brooklyn|Coney Island]], [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]], and [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]].&lt;ref name="flatbush"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirteen.org/brooklyn/i-movie.html|title=A Walk Around Brooklyn – Interactive Map|work=thirteen.org|publisher=PBS|accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="williamsburgpuertorico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkingaround.com/williamsburg_puerto_rican.html|title=Walking Around – Williamsburg – Puerto Rican New York City's Ethnic Neighborhoods|year=2004|work=walkingaround.com|accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eastnewyorkghetto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thabit|first=Walter|author2=Frances Fox Piven |title=How East New York became a ghetto|publisher=NYU Press|year=2006|edition=illustrated|page=36|isbn=978-0-8147-8267-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sunsetparkcloseup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-02-21/nyc-life/close-up-on-sunset-park-brooklyn/|title=Close-Up on Sunset Park, Brooklyn|last=Pascoe|first=Jessie|date=February 21, 2006|work=The Village Voice|publisher=Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC|accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Williamsburg; Graham Avenue is nicknamed "Avenue of Puerto Rico" because of the high density and strong ethnic enclave of Puerto Ricans who have been living in the neighborhood since the 1950s.

===Puerto Rican population in New York===
As of 1990, New Yorkers of Puerto Rican descent (Nuyoricans), numbered 143,974. Nearly 41,800 state residents (Nuyoricans) in 1990 had lived in Puerto Rico in 1985. According to the Census taken in the year 2000, Puerto Rican migrants made up 1.2% of the total population of the United States, with a population of well over 3 million Puerto Ricans (including those of Puerto Rican descent). If taken into account together with the almost 4 million Puerto Ricans who are U.S. citizens (nevertheless, excluded by the [[U.S. Census]] statistics of U.S. population), Puerto Ricans make up about 2.5% of the total population of U.S. citizens around the world (within and outside the U.S. mainland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/pub/puerto.shtml|title=Puerto Rican New Yorkers in 1990, analysis of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the city's Puerto Ricans and changes over time|work=New York City Department of City Planning|date=1994|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613011114/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/pub/puerto.shtml|archivedate=June 13, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 Puerto Rican population by borough===
New York City's total Puerto Rican population was 723,621 and they represented 8.9% of the population. The Puerto Rican population and the percentage Puerto Ricans make up of each borough, as of the 2010 census, is:&lt;ref name="ByType2010"/&gt;
*[[Bronx]] – 298,921 (21.6%)

==Puerto Rican influence==
In July 1930, Puerto Rico's Department of Labor established an employment service in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Chenault 1938: 72&lt;/ref&gt; The Migration Division (known as the "Commonwealth Office"), also part of Puerto Rico's Department of Labor, was created in 1948, and by the end of the 1950s, was operating in 115 cities and towns stateside.&lt;ref&gt;Lapp 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Puerto Rican Affairs in the United States was established in 1989 as a cabinet-level department in Puerto Rico. Currently, the Commonwealth operates the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and has 12 regional offices throughout the United States.

Puerto Ricans in New York have preserved their cultural heritage by being involved actively in the different political and social rights movements in the United States. They founded  "Aspira", a leader in the field of education, in 1961. Aspira is now one of the largest national Latino nonprofit organizations in the United States.&lt;ref name="Pantoja 2002: 93-108"&gt;Pantoja 2002: 93–108&lt;/ref&gt; Other educational and social organizations founded by Puerto Ricans in New York and else where are the National Puerto Rican Coalition in Washington, DC, the National Puerto Rican Forum, the Puerto Rican Family Institute, Boricua College, the Center for Puerto Rican Studies of the City University of New York at Hunter College, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women, and the New York League of Puerto Rican Women, Inc., among others.

[[Hostos Community College]] in the Bronx, was named after a Puerto Rican Eugenio Maria de Hostos, and was founded as an all-Puerto Rican college. The college now accepts students of all races, however it largely caters to Hispanics with up to 80% of its students being of Hispanic descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last=Schwinge|first=Diana|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED452703.pdf|title=Standards, Exit Exams, and the Politicization of Bilingual Education: The Writing Exit Exam at Hostos College|publisher=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]]|journal=Working Papers in Educational Linguistics|volume=16|issue=2|date=September 2000|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boricua College]] is another originally all-Puerto Rican college with campuses in East Williamsburg and Manhattan.

The '''Radbruch Formula''' (German: ''Radbruchsche Formel'') is a theory of law which was first formulated in a 1946 essay by the German law professor and politician [[Gustav Radbruch]]. According to the theory, a judge who encounters a conflict between a statute and what he perceives as just, has to decide against applying the statute if - and only if - the legal concept behind the statute in question seems either "unbearably injust" or in "deliberate disregard" of human equality before the law.

Radbruch's Formula is rooted in the situation of a [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law System]]. It is believed{{weasel inline|date=April 2015}} to be a reaction of Radbruch's experience of the judiciary in [[Nazi Germany]] and has been applied in the decision of courts in the Federal Republic of Germany numerous times. By some authors{{weasel inline|date=April 2015}}, the Radbruch essay ''Gesetzliches Unrecht und übergesetzliches Recht'', which first included his theory, is regarded as one of the most influential legal-philosophical writings of the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. S. Paulson and R.Dreier, 'Einführung in die Rechtsphilosophie Radbruchs', in: Gustav Radbruch: Rechtsphilosophie, Studienausgabe (Heidelberg, 1999), pp. 235–250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and Content==
Before [[World War II|the Second World War]], Radbruch seems to have been a supporter of unconditional [[Legal positivism|Legal Positivism]], which demands a strict separation between law and morality. In consequence, judges would have to apply positive law (i.e. statutes) without exception. The experience of the Third Reich (where Radbruch, then a professor, was banned from teaching), seemed to have modified Radbruch's view. Shortly after the end of the war, Radbruch first stated his formula in a 1946 essay:

'''Excerpt:'''
''Der Konflikt zwischen der Gerechtigkeit und der Rechtssicherheit dürfte dahin zu lösen sein, daß das positive, durch Satzung und Macht gesicherte Recht auch dann den Vorrang hat, wenn es inhaltlich ungerecht und unzweckmäßig ist, es sei denn, daß der Widerspruch des positiven Gesetzes zur Gerechtigkeit ein so unerträgliches Maß erreicht, daß das Gesetz als „unrichtiges Recht“ der Gerechtigkeit zu weichen hat. Es ist unmöglich, eine schärfere Linie zu ziehen zwischen den Fällen des gesetzlichen Unrechts und den trotz unrichtigen Inhalts dennoch geltenden Gesetzen; eine andere Grenzziehung aber kann mit aller Schärfe vorgenommen werden: wo Gerechtigkeit nicht einmal erstrebt wird, wo die Gleichheit, die den Kern der Gerechtigkeit ausmacht, bei der Setzung positiven Rechts bewußt verleugnet wurde, da ist das Gesetz nicht etwa nur „unrichtiges“ Recht, vielmehr entbehrt es überhaupt der Rechtsnatur. Denn man kann Recht, auch positives Recht, gar nicht anders definieren als eine Ordnung und Satzung, die ihrem Sinne nach bestimmt ist, der Gerechtigkeit zu dienen.''&lt;ref&gt;G. Radbruch, ''Gesetzliches Unrecht und übergesetzliches Recht'', Süddeutsche Juristenzeitung (1946), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Excerpt (Translation):'''
''The conflict between justice and the reliability of the law should be solved in favour of the positive law, law enacted by proper authority and power, even in cases where it is injust in terms of content and purpose, except for cases where the discrepancy between the positive law and justice reaches a level so unbearable that the statute has to make way for justice because it has to be considered "erroneous law". It is impossible to draw a sharper line of demarcation between cases of legal injustice and statutes that are applicable despite their erroneous content; however, another line of demarcation can be drawn with rigidity: Where justice is not even strived for, where equality, which is the core of justice, is renounced in the process of legislation, there a statute is not just 'erroneous law', in fact is not of legal nature at all. That is because law, also positive law, cannot be defined otherwise as a rule, that is precisely intended to serve justice.''

Radbruch restated his concept in the book ''Vorschule der Rechtsphilosophie'' (published posthumously).

==Reception in Court==
Both the German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] and the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] have applied Radbruch's Formula numerous times. Its first court appearances were in cases concerned with National Socialist crimes. The defendants in those cases argued that, according to National Socialist statutes valid at the time of their actions, their deeds were legal. The courts used Radbruch's formula to argue that some statutes had been so intolerable that they had not been law in the first place and consequently could not be used to justify the deeds in question. More recently, the Radbruch formula reappeared in trials against [[East Germany|East German]] soldiers, ordered to protect the inner-German border.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6076">Professor '''Radcliffe Archibald Emerson''' (c. 1855-?),&lt;ref name=age/&gt; M.A. Ox., D.C.L. (Ox.), L.L.D. (Edinburgh), F.B.A., FRS, [[FRGS]], MAPS,&lt;ref name=degrees/&gt; Fellow of the Royal Society, Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], Member of the American Philosophical Society,&lt;ref name=titles/&gt; is one of the main characters in the [[Amelia Peabody series|Amelia Peabody]]  [[historical mystery]] series by author [[Elizabeth Peters]]. He is an [[Egyptologist]] who is typically addressed as Professor, although he hates his first name and prefers to be called "Emerson." For his explosive temper and dynamic use of language, his Egyptian friends and employees have nicknamed him ''Abu Shitaim'', "Father of Curses".

Emerson is the husband of [[Amelia Peabody]], Egyptologist and self-proclaimed detective, and they are the parents of Walter ([[Ramses Emerson|"Ramses"]]) Emerson.

==Personal History==
Very little of Emerson's life story is revealed until ''[[He Shall Thunder in the Sky]]''.

His mother was Lady Isabel Courtenay, daughter of the [[Earl]] of Radcliffe (one possible reason he hates his first name). His father, Thomas Emerson, was a good-hearted but easygoing man who failed to satisfy his cold-hearted, ambitious wife. Their marriage had become loveless by the time Radcliffe was born, and after his father died, his mother did her best to "shape" Radcliffe into her ideal of a man, which he vehemently resisted. A small inheritance from a distant relative enabled him to escape his mother's control, and the aristocratic marriage she had arranged for him, and pursue his studies as an Egyptologist. His mother disowned him.

Radcliffe became an Egyptologist, while his younger brother Walter became a [[philologist]]. The two frequently led archaeological expeditions to Egypt, where Radcliffe was one of the first (and for a while, few) advocates of a methodological approach to archaeology.

In ''[[Crocodile on the Sandbank]]'', during a visit to the Cairo museum, the Emersons encountered [[Amelia Peabody]] and her friend, [[Evelyn Emerson|Evelyn Forbes]]. Radcliffe and Amelia instantly butted heads in an argument, and she considered him a rude and patronizing boor. When Amelia visited the Emersons' dig in [[Amarna]], however, Amelia found Radcliffe Emerson ill, and not only nursed him back to health, but also took over part of his duties. Grudgingly, he came to respect her abilities, and at the end, realized he was in love with her.

In the later books Amelia refers to Emerson as "the greatest Egyptologist of this or any other age."

A few years after his marriage and Ramses's birth, Emerson tried to make peace with his mother. She refused his attention, but was unable to prevent him from inheriting his grandfather's estate when she died.

==Appearance==
When he first appears in ''[[Crocodile on the Sandbank]]'', Emerson is described (by Amelia, thus romantically) as tall, well-muscled, with "sapphirine" eyes and dark, wavy black hair. In ''[[The Mummy Case]]'', he is described as having Titian highlights in his hair. He prefers to wear a beard, as he is self-conscious about the dimple in his chin (which he calls a cleft), but Amelia, who hates the beard and adores the dimple, makes him shave it at the earliest possible opportunity. In ''Crocodile'', Amelia also describes him as having a "very hairy" chest and body, but this reference is never made again.

==Character==
Emerson is presented as a dynamic man of action, but one with great tenderness toward his family and friends. He is known to be short-tempered and irascible, but his family and friends hardly ever take notice, knowing he means no harm. However, he has shown genuine anger and a willingness to use violence often enough to make him feared by all the petty criminals and crooked antiques dealers in Egypt.

Emerson remains charmingly oblivious to his few character flaws. He sees himself as the only rational, even-tempered person in the family; he has a boyish enthusiasm for automobiles and motorcycles, though he is mechanically inept and the recklessness of his driving terrifies his family; and he always seizes any opportunity to go about in disguise, especially with a false beard, though it is impossible for anyone to be fooled by them.

He is intolerant of bureaucracy and an advocate of careful methods of excavation and research.  His methods are presented as a great contrast to those of well-known non-fictional archaeological adventurers, who can sometimes be found as minor characters in the books.  More established and careful [[archaeologist]]s, including [[William Flinders Petrie]] and [[Howard Carter]], the discoverer and primary excavator of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], are presented more positively.

The Emerson family adventures, to date, are set in both Great Britain and Egypt during the British [[British Empire|Imperial]] period, beginning in approximately 1890 and extending through the 1920s.

==References==
&lt;references&gt;
&lt;ref name=age&gt;In ''[[Seeing a Large Cat]]'' (hardback ed., p. 384) Ramses mentions that his father was "almost thirty" at the time of his marriage in 1884, which would put his date of birth at some point in 1854 or 1855.  In the ''[[Amelia Peabody's Egypt: A Compendium|Compendium]]'', there is a reference to Amelia, but not Emerson, on what might have been a final voyage to Egypt in 1939, however it is unknown whether Emerson had died by this time or was simply not with her at the time the event described took place.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=degrees&gt;''[[Amelia Peabody's Egypt: A Compendium]]'', pg. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=titles&gt;These were rattled off by Emerson to an admiring group of dignitaries in ''[[The Last Camel Died at Noon]]'', chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''recumbent stone circle''' is a type of [[stone circle]] that incorporates a large monolith, known as a ''recumbent'', lying on its side. They are found in only two regions: near [[Aberdeen]] in the north-east of [[Scotland]], and in the far south-west of [[Ireland]] in the counties of [[County Cork|Cork]] and [[County Kerry|Kerry]].&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005" /&gt; They are thought to be associated with rituals in which moonlight played a central role, as they are aligned with the arc of the southern moon. More than 200 such stone circles are known to exist.&lt;ref name="FokkensHarding2013"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Fokkens,Harry|editor2=Harding, Anthony|last=Darvill|first=Timothy|title=The Oxford Handbook of the European Bronze Age|chapter=Monuments and Monumentality in Bronze Age Europe|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZQeAAAAQBAJ|date=27 June 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957286-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
[[File:Drombeg stone circle - geograph.org.uk - 239919.jpg|right|thumb|Drombeg stone circle in Ireland, showing the small recumbent stone visible through the gap between the large portal stones opposite]]
Up to 99 recumbent stone circles are known to exist in an area of [[Aberdeenshire]] spanning about {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} north to south by {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} east to west. They are clustered in areas characterised by low hills, away from the mountains and alongside patches of fertile and well-drained soil, which would indicate that they were built by local farmers.&lt;ref name="RugglesBurl"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A New Study of the Aberdeenshire Recumbent Stone Circles, 2: Interpretation|author1=Ruggles, C.L.N.|author2=Burl, H.A.W.|journal=Archaeoastronomy: Supplement to the Journal for the History of Astronomy|number=8|year=1985|pages=25–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were normally constructed on sloping hillsides, aligned towards the southern moon.&lt;ref name="Burl2005" /&gt; A few sites were deliberately levelled before construction of the circle; one, at Berrybrae, was built on an artificial clay platform.&lt;ref name="RugglesBurl" /&gt;

The diameters of the Scottish circles range from {{convert|18.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|24.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}. They are typified by the presence of a massive recumbent stone, averaging 24 tons in weight, lying between the circle's two tallest stones, known as ''flankers''.&lt;ref name="Aberdeenshire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/archaeology/special/recumbent.asp|title=Recumbent Stone Circles|publisher=Aberdeenshire Council|accessdate=9 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509183651/http://aberdeenshire.gov.uk/archaeology/special/recumbent.asp|archivedate=9 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recumbents were carefully positioned by the circle builders and generally appear on the southwest side of the circle, with their bases supported (in some cases on mounds) so that their tops are level. The other stones in the circle taper off sequentially so that the smallest are to be found opposite the recumbent.&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005" /&gt; The recumbent and its flankers were evidently seen as the most important elements of the circle; in a number of cases the remaining stones were added later, and in some cases were apparently never added at all.&lt;ref name="Burl2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burl|first=Aubrey|title=The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL5KcoqiOnoC|year=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08347-7|pages=219, 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish recumbent stone circles take a rather different form, with the recumbent being small and placed in an isolated position on the southwest side while the two tallest stones, known as ''portals'', stand opposite on the northeast side.&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruggles|first=Clive L. N.|title=Ancient Astronomy: An Encyclopedia of Cosmologies and Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9YYqiXm-lkC|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-477-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly likely that the recumbent stone circles of northeast Scotland and south-west Ireland are related, given how similar they are, but the geographical distance between them – several hundred kilometers of mountain terrain, bogs and sea – has prompted debate about how exactly the relationship came about. It is possible that rather than there being direct communication between the two locations, the ideas underlying recumbent stone circles were transmitted by a single influential person or group of people who – for whatever reason – left one location and perhaps settled in the other.&lt;ref name="Ruggles2005" /&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Kirkton of Bourtie stone circle.jpg|thumb|500px|View of the fragmentary [[Kirkton of Bourtie stone circle]], illustrating the wide vistas chosen by the circle-builders]]
Recumbent stone circles are believed to have been designed for ritualistic astronomical purposes. The moon would have appeared above the recumbent stone, framed between the flankers. Scotland's recumbent stone circles have an average diameter of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}, so a recumbent stone that was {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} long would have given an observer an arc of vision of around 10 degrees. This would have given the worshippers about an hour during which the moon would pass over the stone.&lt;ref name="Burl2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burl|first=Aubrey|title=Prehistoric Astronomy and Ritual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCTryg7lKcMC|year=2005|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0-7478-0614-1|pages=44–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About every eighteen and a half years, the moon would make a closer approach in which it would appear to be "framed" between the two flanking stones above the recumbent; this was presumably a peak time for ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Hadingham1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadingham|first=Evan|title=Early Man and the Cosmos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYPYd5zY6ooC|year=1985|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-1919-9|pages=64–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the ceremonies is unknown, but Audrey Burl suggests that "the rites enacted in the rings were closely connected with the flourishing and dying of plants, crops, animals and human beings in the short-lived world of four thousand years ago."&lt;ref name="Hadingham1985" /&gt;

The interiors of some excavated recumbent stone circles have been found to contain pits filled with charcoal, sherds of pottery and the cremated remains of human bones (sometimes those of young children). However, they were not funerary monuments in the ordinary sense; the remains appear to have been merely "tokens" representing a few individuals and a small portion of the bodies. It is possible that they may have been used to lend sanctity to the sites. The builders also scattered crushed quartz around the recumbents, which would have refracted and reflected the beams of moonlight. It may have been seen as "moonstone", serving to draw down the influence of the moon into the desired spot and imbue the ceremony with its radiance.&lt;ref name="Hadingham1985" /&gt;

==Development and analysis==

The recumbent stone circles of Scotland have been linked to an earlier type of monument erected around 3000 BC, the [[Clava cairn]]s near [[Inverness]]. The type example of the monument is the three circular cairns at Balnuaran of Clava, which are surrounded by a ring of standing stones rising in height from the northeast to the southwest. The cairns have burial chambers in the interior, each one reached by a passageway that leads in from the southwest side. An analysis published by Burl in 1981 revealed that the tomb passages all lay within the arc of the moon during its eighteen-and-a-half year cycle. However, they could not have been used for observations as their sightlines were too restricted.&lt;ref name="Hadingham1985" /&gt;

The cairns fell into disuse after about 2500 BC, but the lunar astronomical tradition reflected in their structures appears to have been transferred east to the Neolithic farmers of central Aberdeenshire. The gradation in height of the stone rings at Clava is replicated in the recumbent stone circles which appeared across Aberdeenshire during the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age, from around 2700–2000 BC.&lt;ref name="Hadingham1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burl1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burl|first=Aubrey|title=A Guide to the Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-GWBAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-06331-8|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their alignment with the southern moon is more precise than that of the Clava cairns; whereas the cairns encompass the entire arc of the moon, the orientation of most of the recumbent stones focuses on a much shorter arc. The degree of precision is limited, however, and the circles were clearly not observatories nor meant for precise knowledge of the moon's movements.&lt;ref name="Hadingham1985" /&gt;

Most of the circles are of fairly modest dimensions and Burl has theorised that they could have been constructed by a single family. Transporting the massive recumbents was a different matter, however; the fifty-ton recumbent at Old Keig was transported from six miles away and may have needed up to 200 people to drag it to its final resting place. The circle at Strichen provided a unique opportunity to test how the recumbents might have been transported. It was incorrectly restored in the 19th century by Lord Lovat, so between 1979–83 it was fully excavated and correctly restored by a team led by Burl, Ian Hampsher-Monk and Philip Abramson. The restoration required the team to move some of the stones, and it was found that the most efficient non-mechanical means of doing so was to use drag the stones along a slippery path of wet straw using logs as a kind of sledge.&lt;ref name="Hadingham1985" /&gt;

Unlike the more grandiose Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments found elsewhere in Scotland, the recumbent stone circles of Aberdeenshire do not appear to have been intended to overshadow or overawe other more modest works. Even considering their geographical clustering, they are also well-spread out. Clive Ruggles and Aubrey Burl suggest that this indicates that they were constructed to serve as local ritual centres for groups of subsistence farmers each inhabiting territories of about {{convert|10|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, living on an egalitarian basis without powerful leaders and possibly numbering no more than about twenty or thirty people per group.&lt;ref name="RugglesBurl" /&gt;

The circle builders left no records, but their works were remarked upon and to some extent mythologised in historic times by the region's later inhabitants. The 16th century Aberdonian historian [[Hector Boece]] wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;in the times of King Mainus ... huge stones were assembled in a ring and the biggest of them was stretched out on the south side to serve for an altar ... In proof of the fact to this day there stand these mighty stones gathered together into circles 'the old temples of the gods' they are commonly called – and whoso sees them will assuredly marvel by what mechanical craft or by what bodily strength stones of such bulk have been collected to one spot.&lt;ref&gt;Burl (2000), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The English antiquarian [[John Aubrey]] recorded in the 17th century that people believed of the [[Easter Aquhorthies]] recumbent stone circle that "Pagan priests of old dwelt in that place" and &lt;blockquote&gt;that the Priests caused earth to be brought from other adjacent places upon peoples backs to Auchinchorthie, for making the Soile thereof deeper, which is given for the reason why this parcell of land (though surrounded by heath and moss on all sides) is better and more fertile than other places thereabout.&lt;ref&gt;Burl (2000), p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Shalimar Gardens''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|شالیمار باغ}}}}), sometimes spelt '''Shalamar Gardens''', is a [[Mughal garden]] complex located in [[Lahore]], capital of the [[Pakistan]]i province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. The gardens date from the period when the Mughal Empire was at its artistic and aesthetic zenith,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort and Shalimar Gardens in Lahore|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/171/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are now one of Pakistan's most popular tourist destinations.

The Shalimar Gardens were laid out as a [[Charbagh|Persian paradise garden]] intended to create a representation of an earthly utopia in which humans co-exist in perfect harmony with all elements of nature.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; Construction of the gardens began in 1641 during the reign of Emperor [[Shah Jahan]],&lt;ref name="rehman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=REHMAN|first1=A.|title=CHANGING CONCEPTS OF GARDEN DESIGN IN LAHORE FROM MUGHAL TO CONTEMPORARY TIMES|journal=Garden History|date=2009|volume=37|issue=2|pages=205–217|jstor=27821596}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was completed in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mughalgardens.org/html/shalamar.html Shalamar Gardens] Gardens of the Mughal Empire. Retrieved 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 the Shalimar Gardens were inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] as they embody Mughal garden design at the apogee of its development.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

==Location==
The Shalimar Gardens are located near [[Baghbanpura]] along Grand Trunk Road some 5 kilometers northeast of Lahore's [[Walled City of Lahore|Walled City]].

==Background==
Lahore's Shalimar Gardens were built by the Mughal royal family primarily as a venue for them to entertain guests,&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; though a large portion was open to the general public. The gardens' design was influenced by the older [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir]] that were built by Shah Jahan's father, Emperor [[Jahangir]].&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Emma|title=The Art of the Islamic Garden|date=2004|publisher=Crowood|isbn=186126609X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwIpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=shalimar+gardens+lahore&amp;dq=shalimar+gardens+lahore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcktbuxLHYAhVF_WMKHQ5qBys4ChDoAQgoMAA|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the gardens in Kashmir which relied on naturally sloping landscapes, the waterworks in Lahore required extensive engineering to create artificial cascades and terraces.&lt;ref name="schimmel"/&gt;

The Shalimar Gardens were designed as a Persian-style ''[[Charbagh]]'' "Paradise garden" - a microcosm of an earthly utopia.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; Though the word ''Bagh'' is translated simply as "garden," ''bagh'' represents a harmonious existence between humans and nature, and represents a poetic connection between heaven and earth.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; All natural elements of the ''bagh'' are appreciated - including the sun, moon, and air.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; [[Muhammad Saleh Kamboh]], historian to [[Shah Jahan]], reported that the gardens of Kashmir inspired the design for the Shalimar Garden in Lahore,&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; and that a wide variety of trees and flowers grew together in the garden.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt;

The site was chosen for its stable water supply.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; The project was managed by Khalilullah Khan, a noble of [[Shah Jahan]]'s court, in cooperation with  and [[Mulla Alaul Maulk Tuni]]. [[Ali Mardan Khan]] was responsible for most of the construction, and had a 100-mile-long canal built to bring water from the foothills of Kashmir to the site.&lt;ref name="schimmel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schimmel|first1=Annemarie|title=The Empire of the Great Mughals: History, Art and Culture|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1861891857|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7sewQQzOHUC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=shalimar+lahore+public&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNx4-LybHYAhVP-GMKHSsDAJ0Q6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=shalimar%20lahore%20public&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of the Shalimar Gardens originally belonged to the [[Arain]] [[Mian Family Baghbanpura]]. Mian Muhammad Yusuf, then the head of the Arain [[Mian Family Baghbanpura|Mian family]], ceded the site of ''Ishaq Pura'' to the Emperor Shah Jahan in order for the gardens to be built. In return, Shah Jahan granted the Arain Mian family governance of the Shalimar Gardens, and the gardens remained under their custodianship for over 350 years.

Construction of the gardens began on 12 June 1641, and took 18 months to complete.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; During the [[Sikh empire|Sikh era]], much of the garden's marble was pillaged and used to decorated the [[Golden Temple]] in [[Amritsar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Tom|title=Garden History: Philosophy and Design 2000 BC – 2000 AD|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134370825}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shalimar Gardens were plundered of much of its marble which was transported to decorate the [[Ram Bagh Palace]] in nearby [[Amritsar]], while the gardens' costly [[agate]] gate was stripped and sold by [[Lehna Singh Majithia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latif|first1=Syad Muhammad|title=Lahore: Its History, Architectural Remains and Antiquities|date=1892|publisher=New Imperial Press|location=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the Shalimar Gardens were nationalised by [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|General Ayub khan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upon A Trailing Edge: Risk, the Heart and the Air Pilot|page=268|year=2015|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; because leading [[Arain]] [[Mian Family Baghbanpura|Mian family]] members had opposed his imposition of martial law in [[Pakistan]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The annual [[Mela Chiraghan]] festival used to take place in the gardens until [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|General Ayub Khan]] forbade it in 1958.

==Design and layout==
[[File:ShalimarLayout.jpg|thumb|left|The Shalimar Gardens are divided into three distinct terraces. The area in red is the uppermost terrace, and was reserved for the Emperor’s harem, while the area in blue was reserved for the Emperor. The area in green is the lowest terrace, and was occasionally open to the public.]]
[[File:Shalimar Gardens, Lahore (Faiz Baksh Tarrace- 2nd tarrace of the Garden).jpg|thumb|The middle level terrace of the garden, known as the ''Faiz Bakhsh'' terrace, was the Emperor’s garden.]]
Mughal Gardens were based upom [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] gardens built in Central Asia and Iran between the 14th and 16th century.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shalimar Gardens|url=http://mughalgardens.org/html/shalamar.html|website=Gardens of the Mughal Empire|publisher=Smithsonian Productions|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high brick wall richly decorated with intricate [[fretwork]] encloses the site in order to allow for the creation of a ''[[Charbagh]]'' paradise garden - a microcosm of an earthly utopia.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt;

The Shalimar Gardens are laid out in the form of form of a rectangle aligned along a north-south axis, and measure 658 metre by 258 metres, and cover an area of 16 [[hectare]]s. Each terrace level 4–5 metres (13-15 [[foot (length)|feet]]) higher than the previous level.

The uppermost terrace of the gardens is named ''Bagh-e-Farah Baksh'', literally meaning ''Bestower of Pleasure''. The second that third terraces are jointly known as the ''Bagh-e-Faiz Baksh'', meaning ''Bestower of Goodness''. The first and third terraces are both shaped as squares, while the second terrace is a narrow rectangle.

Shalimar's main entrance was onto the lower-most terrace, which was open to noblemen, and occasionally to the public.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; The middle terrace was the Emperor's Garden, and contained the most elaborate waterworks of any Mughal garden.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; The highest terrace was reserved for the Emperor's ''harem''.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt;

The square shaped terraces were both divided into four equivalent smaller squares by long fountains flanked by brick ''khayaban'' walkways designed to be elevated in order to provide better views of the garden.&lt;ref name="schimmel"/&gt; Cascades were made to flow over a marble paths in what are known as ''chadors'', or "curtains" into the middle terrace. Water collected into a large pool, known as a ''haūz'', over which a seating pavilion was made.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt;

===Water features===
The Shalimar Garden's contain the most elaborate waterworks of any Mughal Garden.&lt;ref name="rehman"/&gt; It contains 410 fountains, which discharge into wide marble pools, each known as a ''haūz''. The enclosed garden is rendered cooler than surrounding areas by the garden's dense foliage, and water features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hann|first1=Michael|title=Symbol, Pattern and Symmetry: The Cultural Significance of Structure|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=1472539001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWABAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR25&amp;dq=shalimar+gardens+lahore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDp8mFw7HYAhUBsVQKHUdBBfMQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=shalimar&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - a relief during Lahore's blistering summers, with temperature sometimes exceeding {{convert|120|°F|°C}}. The distribution of the fountains is as follows:

* The upper level terrace has 105 fountains.
* The middle level terrace has 152 fountains.
* The lower level terrace has 153 fountains.
* All combined, the Gardens has 410 fountains.

The Gardens have 5 water cascades including ''the great marble cascade'' and ''Sawan Bhadoon''.

'''Short prose''' is a generic term for various kinds of very short [[fictional]] [[prose]]; short prose may or may not be [[narrative]]. Short prose pieces are considerably shorter than a [[short story]], i.e., usually less than c. 1,000 words. Because of their small size, short prose pieces can attain high levels of lexical density and may thereby resemble [[prose poetry|prose poems]], but the focus in short prose is less on language itself (and thus on [[rhythm]], metre, or other phonological effects) than on the rapid presentation of a situation.

A piece of short prose may contain [[drama]], but it normally differs from a [[vignette (literature)|vignette]] in that it has no necessary associations with theatre or character. Because [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is peripheral to, or nonexistent in, short prose, a short prose piece differs from a [[sketch story]] in that it does not necessarily invite the reader to imagine what came before or what follows after. Finally, because a piece of short prose does not necessarily have characters, conflict, or resolution, it usually differs from the [[short short story]], [[flash fiction]] and [[microfiction]] as these are usually defined.

Writers who have favoured the use of short prose include [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Daniil Kharms]] (Случаи), [[Dezső Kosztolányi]], [[István Örkény]] (''Egyperces novellák''), Samuel Beckett ([[Fizzles]]), [[Francis Ponge]] (''[[Le parti pris des choses]]''), [[David Eggers]] (''[[Short Short Stories]]''),  [[Eduardo Berti]] (''[[La Vie Impossible]]'').

The '''Steinhaus longimeter''', patented by the professor [[Hugo Steinhaus]], is an instrument used to measure the [[arc length|lengths of curves]] on maps. It is a transparent sheet of three grids, turned against each other by 30 degrees, each consisting of [[perpendicular]] lines spaced at equal distances 3.82 [[Millimetre|mm]]. The measurement is done by counting crossings of the curve with grid lines. The number of crossings is the approximate length of the curve in millimetres.

'''''Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik''''' is a book on the history of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] by the Austrian [[art history|art historian]] [[Alois Riegl]]. It was published in [[Berlin]] in 1893. The English translation renders the title as ''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'', although this has been criticized by some.{{efn|For example, Benjamin Binstock, "Alois Riegl, Monumental Ruin," in A. Riegl, ''Historical Grammar of the Visual Arts'' (New York, 2004), p.35 n.28: "Evelyn Kain's translation of what she strangely calls ''Problems of Style'' is unsatisfactory; it is not simply a question (or problem) of style." See also Kathryn Brush's review of the translation, ''Art Bulletin'' 74 (1994), p. 355: "Riegl wrote ''Stilfragen'', or ''Questions of style'' (curiously entitled ''Problems of Style'' in the 1992 English translation) during the 1890s...."}} It has been called "the one great book ever written about the history of ornament."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Gombrich, ''The sense of order'' (London, 1984), 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riegl wrote the ''Stilfragen'' while employed as director of the textile department at what was then the Österreichisches Museum für Kunst und Industrie (today the [[Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien|Museum für angewandte Kunst]]) in [[Vienna]]. His primary intention was to argue that it was possible to write a continuous history of ornament. This position is argued in explicit opposition to that of the "technical-materialist" school, according to which "all art forms were always the direct products of materials and techniques"&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and that ornamental "motifs originated spontaneously throughout the world at a number of different locations."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Riegl associates this view with the followers of [[Gottfried Semper]], who had advanced a related argument in his ''Der Stil in den technischen Künsten; oder praktischer Ästhetik'' (''Style in the technical arts; or practical [[aesthetics]]'', 1878-79). However, Riegl consistently disassociates Semper's followers from Semper himself, writing that

{{quote|The theory of the technical, materialist origin of the earliest ornaments is usually attributed to Gottfried Semper. This association is, however, no more justified than the one made between contemporary Darwinism and Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the technical-materialist position had attained the status of dogma, Riegl stated that "the most pressing problem that confronts historians of the decorative arts today is to reintegrate the historical thread that has been served into a thousand pieces."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he argued for a continuous development of ornament from ancient Egyptian through Greek and Roman and up to early Islamic and, eventually, Ottoman art.

==Contents==
[[File:Flickr - jemasmith - Umayyad Mosque, Damascus, Detail..jpg|thumb|Stone relief with [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]] of tendrils, [[palmette]]s and half-palmettes in the [[Umayyad Mosque]], [[Damascus]]]]

The ''Stilfragen'' is divided into an introduction, which sets out the purpose of the work, and four chapters, each on a theme in the history of artistic style.

The first chapter, "The Geometric Style," argues that geometric ornament originated, not from such technical processes as wickerwork and weaving, but rather from an "immanent artistic drive, alert and restless for action, that human beings possessed long before they invented woven protective coverings for their bodies."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported this position through an analysis of geometric ornament in [[Stone Age]] European art, in particular objects that had recently been discovered in the [[Dordogne]]. This ornament, he argued, developed from attempts to represent natural forms in two dimensions, which gave rise to the idea of an outline. After this "invention of line," the cave-dwellers proceeded to arrange lines "according to the principles of rhythm and symmetry."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter, "The Heraldic Style," addresses compositions of "paired animals arranged symmetrically to either side of an intervening central element."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of decoration had been associated by previous scholars, most notably [[Ernst Curtius]], with the technical demands of [[silk]]-weaving. Riegl argued instead that heraldic ornament arose before the invention of mechanical weaving-looms, and stemmed from a desire for symmetry.

The third chapter, "The Introduction of Vegetal Ornament and the Development of the Ornamental Tendril," traces an unbroken evolution of vegetal ornament from ancient Egyptian through to late [[Roman art]]. Here Riegl argues that motifs such as the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flower]], although they may originally have been endowed by the Egyptians with symbolic significance, were adopted by other cultures that "no longer understood their hieratic meaning,"&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby became purely decorative. In the most famous section of this chapter, Riegl argued that [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus ornament]] was not derived from the [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus plant]], as had been believed since the time of [[Vitruvius]], but was rather a sculptural adaptation of the [[palmette]] motif. It was therefore "a product of pure artistic invention,"&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; and not of "a simple compulsion to make direct copies of living organisms."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth chapter, "The [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]]," continues the development of the previous chapter through late antique and early [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and into [[Islamic art]]. The arabesque is  understood here as a geometricized version of earlier systems of tendril ornament, thereby establishing a "genetic relationship between the ornamental Islamic tendril and its direct predecessor, the tendril ornament of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 229.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The final two chapters are therefore presented as a continuous history of vegetal ornament from ancient Egypt through to Ottoman Turkey, in which individual motifs develop according to purely artistic criteria, and not through the intervention of technical or mimetic concerns. In the introduction it is suggested that this development could be continued to Riegl's own time, and that "ornament experiences the same continuous, coherent development that prevails in the art of all periods."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The ''Stilfragen'' remains a fundamental work in the history of ornament, and has heavily influenced the work of [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Ernst Gombrich]], among others who have addressed the same themes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jessica Rawson|Rawson, Jessica]], ''Chinese Ornament: The Lotus and the Dragon'', pp. 24-25, 1984, British Museum Publications, {{ISBN|0714114316}}. Rawson's Appendix, pp. 199-222, summarizes the early history of flower ornament around the Mediterranean: "Details of the present description differ from Riegl's analysis; however the general outline proposed follows his fascinating account" (p. 199)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Riegl's work as a whole, the ''Stilfragen'' constitutes his earliest general statement of principles, although his "theoretical thinking had not by any means reached maturity."&lt;ref&gt;Henri Zerner, "Preface," ''Problems of style'', xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; By severing stylistic development from external influences, such as technical procedures or a desire to imitate nature, Riegl raised an extremely complicated set of questions regarding the actual source and significance of stylistic change. As [[Otto Pächt]] has written:

{{quote|In the picture that Riegl draws of the development the changes of style are meaningful in a specific way; continuity is not merely carrying on; every stylistic phase creates its own problems which are solved in the succeeding one, only to create new conflicts for which new answers have to be found. Thus the styles change of necessity, or to put it differently: in a kind of 'retrospective prophecy' the art historian shows that artistic development was compelled to move in the direction in which in fact it did. A view with most serious implications. One of them was that if one viewed art history in this way, absolute aesthetic norms became obsolete and had to be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Pächt, "Art historians and art critics, vi: Alois Riegl," ''The Burlington Magazine'' 105 (1963), 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus the concerns of the ''Stilfragen'' led directly into those of Riegl's next major study, the ''Spätrömische Kunstindustrie'' (''Late Roman art industry'', 1901), in which he approached style change in [[late antiquity]] not as a symptom of decline, but as the result of positive artistic concerns.

The '''Stone Age Institute''' is an independent research center dedicated to the [[archeology|archaeological]] study of human origins and technological development. The institute conducts research and education in human origins studies, publishes books and articles, and mentors prospective scientists The institute is housed in a {{convert|11400|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility located on a {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} rural site outside [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. 

The Stone Age Institute is an autonomous research facility, but it has strong ties with [[Indiana University]], especially CRAFT (the [[Center for Research into the Anthropological Foundations of Technology]]) and the Human Evolutionary Studies Program.

The facility includes a research library on early prehistory and an extensive artifact collection donated by the late [[J. Desmond Clark]], professor of Anthropology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

In [[linguistics]], and particularly [[phonology]], '''stress''' or '''accent''' is relative emphasis or prominence given to a certain [[syllable]] in a word, or to a certain word in a phrase or sentence. This emphasis is typically caused by such properties as increased [[loudness]] and [[vowel length]], full articulation of the vowel, and changes in [[pitch (music)|pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fry|first=D.B.|date=1955|title=Duration and intensity as physical correlates of linguistic stress. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|url=|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=27|pages=765–768|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fry|first=D.B.|date=1958|title=Experiments in the perception of stress|url=|journal=Language and Speech|volume=1|pages=126–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''stress'' and ''accent'' are often used synonymously in this context, but they are sometimes distinguished. For example, when emphasis is produced through pitch alone, it is called ''[[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]]'', and when produced through length alone, it is called ''quantitative accent''.&lt;ref name="Monrad"&gt;G. H. Monrad-Krohn, "The prosodic quality of speech and its disorders (a brief survey from a neurologist's point of view)", ''Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica'', vol. 22, issue 3-4, pp. 255-269.&lt;/ref&gt; When caused by a combination of various intensified properties, it is called ''stress accent'' or ''dynamic accent''; English uses what is called variable stress accent.

Since stress can be realised through a wide range of phonetic properties, such as loudness, vowel length, and pitch, which are also used for other linguistic functions, it is difficult to define stress solely phonetically.

The stress placed on syllables within words is called '''word stress''' or '''lexical stress'''. Some languages have ''fixed stress'', meaning that the stress on virtually any multisyllable word falls on a particular syllable, such as the penultimate (e.g. Polish) or the first. Other languages, like [[Stress and vowel reduction in English|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], have ''variable stress'', where the position of stress in a word is not predictable in that way. Sometimes more than one level of stress, such as ''primary stress'' and ''[[secondary stress]]'', may be identified. However, some languages, such as [[French language|French]] and [[Standard Chinese phonology|Mandarin]], are sometimes analyzed as lacking lexical stress entirely.

The stress placed on words within sentences is called '''sentence stress''' or '''prosodic stress'''. This is one of the three components of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], along with [[Isochrony|rhythm]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. It includes '''phrasal stress''' (the default emphasis of certain words within [[phrase (linguistics)|phrases]] or clauses), and '''contrastive stress''' (used to highlight an item − a word, or occasionally just part of a word − that is given particular focus).

== Phonetic realization ==

There are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream, and these depend to some extent on which language is being spoken. Stressed syllables are often [[loudness|louder]] than non-stressed syllables, and may have a higher or lower [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. They may also sometimes be pronounced [[vowel length|longer]]. There are sometimes differences in [[Place of articulation|place]] or [[manner of articulation]] – in particular, vowels in unstressed syllables may have a more central (or "[[neutral vowel|neutral]]") articulation, while those in stressed syllables have a more peripheral articulation. Stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal.

These particular distinguishing features of stress, or types of prominence in which particular features are dominant, are sometimes referred to as particular types of accent – ''dynamic accent'' in the case of loudness, ''[[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]]'' in the case of pitch (although this term usually has more specialized meanings), ''quantitative accent'' in the case of length,&lt;ref name="Monrad"/&gt; and ''qualitative accent'' in the case of differences in articulation. These can be compared to the various types of [[accent (music)|accent in music theory]]. In some contexts, the term ''stress'' or ''stress accent'' is used to mean specifically dynamic accent (or as an antonym to ''pitch accent'' in its various meanings).

A prominent syllable or word is said to be ''accented'' or ''tonic''; the latter term does not imply that it carries [[phonemic tone]]. Other syllables or words are said to be ''unaccented'' or ''atonic''. Syllables are frequently said to be in ''pretonic'' or ''post-tonic'' position; certain phonological rules apply specifically to such positions. For instance, in American English, /t/ and /d/ are [[intervocalic alveolar flapping|flapped]] in post-tonic position.

In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], which is a [[tone language]], stressed syllables have been found to have tones realized with a relatively large swing in [[fundamental frequency]], while unstressed syllables typically have smaller swings.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanski, G., Shih, C., Jing, H.; Quantitative Measurement of Prosodic Strength in Mandarin, Speech Communication 41(4), November 2003, {{DOI|10.1016/S0167-6393(03)00100-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Stress in Standard Chinese]].)

Stressed syllables are often perceived as being more forceful than non-stressed syllables. Research has shown, however, that although dynamic accent is accompanied by greater [[respiratory system|respiratory]] force, it does not mean a more forceful [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] in the [[vocal tract]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Lexical stress ==
Lexical stress, or '''word stress''', is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word. The position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or [[dialect]] in question, but in other languages, it must be learned for each word, as it is largely unpredictable.

Languages in which position of the stress can usually be predicted by a simple rule are said to have ''fixed stress''. For example, in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the stress almost always comes on the first syllable of a word. In [[Armenian Language|Armenian]] the stress is on the last syllable of a word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mirakyan |first=Norayr |date=2016 |title=The Implications of Prosodic Differences Between English and Armenian |url=http://www.ysu.am/files/SSS_BookCollect_3_2016,%20pp.%2091-96.pdf |journal=Collection of Scientific Articles of YSU SSS |publisher=YSU Press |volume=1.3 |issue=13 |pages= 91–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Esperanto]], and [[Polish language|Polish]], the stress is almost always on the [[penult]] (second-last syllable). In [[stress in Macedonian language|Macedonian]], it is on the [[antepenult]] (third-last syllable).

Other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way, as in [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Latin]] (whose stress is conditioned by the structure of the penult). They are said to have a regular stress rule.

Statements about the position of stress are sometimes affected by the fact that when a word is spoken in isolation, prosodic factors (see below) come into play, which do not apply when the word is spoken normally within a sentence. [[French phonology|French]] words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable, but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable (unless it is a [[schwa]], when it is the second-last) of any string of words in that language. Thus, it is on the last syllable of a word analyzed in isolation. The situation is [[stress in Standard Chinese|similar in Standard Chinese]]. French (some authors add Chinese&lt;ref&gt;San Duanmu (2000), ''The Phonology of Standard Chinese'', Oxford University Press, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;) can be considered to have no real lexical stress.

Languages in which the position of stress in a word is less predictable are said to have ''variable stress'' like [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Stress is usually truly lexical and must be memorized as part of the pronunciation of an individual word. In some languages, such as in Spanish, in Portuguese, in [[Lakota language|Lakota]] and, to some extent in Italian, stress is even represented in writing using diacritical marks, for example in the Spanish words ''c'''é'''lebre'' and ''celebr'''é'''''. In Russian, diacritical marks are sometimes written for people learning the language, whether as a first or second language.

In such languages with ''variable stress'', stress may be [[phoneme|phonemic]] in that it can serve to distinguish otherwise identical words. For example, the English words ''insight'' and ''incite'' are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter. Other examples include '''''um'''schreiben'' ("rewrite") vs. ''um'''schrei'''ben'' ("paraphrase, outline") in German, за́мок ("castle") vs. замо́к ("lock") in Russian, and '''''an'''cora'' ("anchor"), ''an'''co'''ra'' ("more, still, yet") in Italian, and the triple example ''sábia'' ("wise woman"), ''sabia'' ("know"), ''sabiá'' ("type of bird") from Portuguese. 

With very few exceptions, English [[compound (linguistics)|compound words]] are stressed on their first component. And even such exceptions, for example ''mankínd'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/mankind ''mankind''] in the Collins English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; are instead often stressed on the first component by some people or in some kinds of English.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=mankind ''mankind''] in the American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the same components as those of a compound word are used in a descriptive phrase with a different meaning and with stress on both words, but then this descriptive phrase is not usually considered a compound, e.g. ''bláck bírd'' (any bird that is black) and ''bláckbird'' (a [[common blackbird|specific bird species]]) and ''páper bág'' (a bag made of paper) and ''páper bag'' (very rarely used to mean a bag for carrying newspapers, often also used to mean a bag made of paper).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/paper-bag ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialects of the same language may have different stress placement. For instance, the English word ''laboratory'' is stressed on the second syllable in [[British English]] (''labóratory'' often pronounced "labóratry", the second ''o'' being silent), but the first syllable in [[American English]], with a secondary stress on the "tor' syllable (''láboratory'' often pronounced "lábratory"). The Spanish word ''video'' is stressed on the first syllable in Spain (''vídeo'') but on the second syllable in the Americas (''vidéo''). The Portuguese words for [[Madagascar]] and the continent [[Oceania]] are stressed on the third syllable in [[European Portuguese]] (''Madag'''á'''scar'' and ''Oce'''â'''nia''), but on the fourth syllable in [[Brazilian Portuguese]] (''Madagasc'''a'''r'' and ''Ocean'''i'''a'').

=== Levels of stress ===
{{Main|Secondary stress}}
Some languages are described as having both ''primary stress'' and ''secondary stress''. A syllable with secondary stress is stressed relative to unstressed syllables but not as strongly as a syllable with primary stress. As with primary stress, the position of secondary stress may be more or less predictable depending on language. In English, it is not fully predictable, but the different secondary stress of the words ''organization'' and ''accumulation'' (on the first and second syllable, respectively) is predictable due to the same stress of the verbs ''órganize'' and ''accúmulate''. In some analyses, for example the one found in Chomsky and Halle's ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]'', English has been described as having four levels of stress: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, but the treatments often disagree with one another. &lt;!--English secondary stress does not have the phonetic characteristics normally associated with stress, [surely not true in general?] --&gt;

[[Peter Ladefoged]] and other phoneticians have noted that it is possible to describe English with only one degree of stress, as long as [[unstressed vowel|unstressed syllables]] are phonemically distinguished for [[vowel reduction]].&lt;ref name=Lad&gt;Ladefoged (1975 ''etc.'') ''[[A course in phonetics]]'' §&amp;nbsp;5.4; (1980) ''Preliminaries to linguistic phonetics'' p 83&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that the multiple levels posited for English, whether ''primary–secondary'' or ''primary–secondary–tertiary'', are mere [[phonetic]] detail and not true [[phoneme|phonemic]] stress, and often, the alleged secondary stress is not characterized by the increase in respiratory activity normally associated with primary stress in English or with all stress in other languages. (For further detail see [[Stress and vowel reduction in English]].)

== Prosodic stress ==
{{Infobox IPA
| above = Extra stress
| ipa symbol = ˈˈ◌
}}
''[[Prosody (linguistics)|Prosodic]] stress'', or ''sentence stress'', refers to stress patterns that apply at a higher level than the individual word – namely within a [[prosodic unit]]. It may involve a certain natural stress pattern characteristic of a given language, but may also involve the placing of emphasis on particular words because of their relative importance (contrastive stress).

An example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for [[French language|French]] above; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words (or if that is a [[schwa]], the next-to-final syllable). A similar pattern has been claimed for English (see {{slink||Levels of stress}} above): the traditional distinction between (lexical) primary and secondary stress is replaced partly by a prosodic rule stating that the final stressed syllable in a phrase is given additional stress. (A word spoken alone becomes such a phrase, hence such prosodic stress may appear to be lexical if the pronunciation of words is analyzed in a standalone context rather than within phrases.)

Another type of prosodic stress pattern is ''quantity sensitivity'' – in some languages additional stress tends to be placed on syllables that are longer ([[mora (linguistics)|moraically heavy]]).

Prosodic stress is also often used [[pragmatics|pragmatically]] to emphasize (focus attention on) particular words or the ideas associated with them. Doing this can change or clarify the meaning of a sentence; for example:

{{block indent|&lt;poem&gt;''I'' didn't take the test yesterday. (Somebody else did.)
I ''didn't'' take the test yesterday. (I did not take it.)
I didn't ''take'' the test yesterday. (I did something else with it.)
I didn't take ''the'' test yesterday. (I took a different one.)
I didn't take the ''test'' yesterday. (I took something else.)
I didn't take the test ''yesterday''. (I took it some other day.)&lt;/poem&gt;}}

As in the examples above, stress is normally transcribed as [[italic type|italics]] in printed text or underlining in handwriting.

In English, stress is most dramatically realized on focused or accented words. For instance, consider the dialogue

{{block indent|&lt;poem&gt;"Is it brunch tomorrow?"
"No, it's ''dinner'' tomorrow."&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In it, the stress-related acoustic differences between the syllables of "tomorrow" would be small compared to the differences between the syllables of "''dinner''", the emphasized word. In these emphasized words, stressed syllables such as "''din''" in "''din''ner" are louder and longer.&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Beckman, Stress and Non-Stress Accent, Dordrecht: Foris (1986) {{ISBN|90-6765-243-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Silipo and S. Greenberg, Automatic Transcription of Prosodic Stress for Spontaneous English Discourse, Proceedings of the XIVth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (ICPhS99), San Francisco, CA, August 1999, pages 2351–2354&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Kochanski, E. Grabe, J. Coleman and B. Rosner, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, volume 118, number 2, pages 1038–1054, {{DOI|10.1121/1.1923349}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also have a different fundamental frequency, or other properties.

The main stress within a sentence, often found on the last stressed word, is called the ''nuclear stress''.&lt;ref&gt;Iggy Roca, ''Thematic Structure: Its Role in Grammar'', Walter de Gruyter 1992, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stress and vowel reduction ==
In many languages, such as [[Russian phonology|Russian]] and [[English phonology|English]], [[vowel reduction]] may occur when a vowel changes from a stressed to an unstressed position. In English, unstressed vowels may reduce to [[schwa]]-like vowels, though the details vary with dialect (see [[Stress and vowel reduction in English]]). The effect may be dependent on lexical stress (for example, the unstressed first syllable of the word ''photographer'' contains a schwa {{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|g|r|ə|f|ər}}, whereas the stressed first syllable of ''photograph'' does not {{IPA|/ˈfoʊtəˌgræf -grɑːf/}}), or on prosodic stress (for example, the word ''of'' is pronounced with a schwa when it is unstressed within a sentence, but not when it is stressed).

Many other languages, such as [[Spoken Finnish|Finnish]] and the mainstream dialects of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], do not have unstressed vowel reduction; in these languages vowels in unstressed syllables have nearly the same quality as those in stressed syllables.

== Stress and rhythm ==
Some languages, such as [[English language|English]], are said to be ''stress-timed languages''; that is, stressed syllables appear at a roughly constant rate and non-stressed syllables are shortened to accommodate this. This contrasts with languages that have ''syllable timing'' (e.g. [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or ''[[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] timing'' (e.g. [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), where syllables or moras are spoken at a roughly constant rate regardless of stress. For details, see [[Isochrony]].

== Historical effects of stress ==
It is common for stressed and unstressed syllables to behave differently as a language evolves. For example, in the [[Romance languages]], the original Latin [[vowel length|short vowels]] {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} have often become [[diphthong]]s when stressed. Since stress takes part in [[verb]] conjugation, this has produced verbs with [[apophony|vowel alternation]] in the Romance languages. For example, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] verb ''volver'' has the form ''v'''o'''lví'' in the past tense but ''v'''ue'''lvo'' in the present tense (see [[Spanish irregular verbs]]). [[Italian language|Italian]] shows the same phenomenon but with {{IPA|/o/}} alternating with {{IPA|/uo/}} instead. This behavior is not confined to verbs; note for example Spanish ''v'''ie'''nto'' "wind" from Latin ''v'''e'''ntum'', or Italian ''f'''uo'''co'' "fire" from Latin ''f'''o'''cum''.

== Stress "deafness" ==
An operational definition of word stress may be provided by the stress "deafness" paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dupoux|first=Emmanuel|last2=Peperkamp|first2=Sharon|last3=Sebastián-Gallés|first3=Núria|date=2001-09-01|title=A robust method to study stress "deafness"|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/110/3/10.1121/1.1380437|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=110|issue=3|pages=1606–1618|doi=10.1121/1.1380437|issn=0001-4966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that if listeners perform poorly on reproducing the presentation order of series of stimuli that minimally differ in the position of phonetic prominence (e.g. [númi]/[numí]), the language doesn't have word stress. The task involves a reproduction of the order of stimuli as a sequence of key strokes, whereby key '1' is associated with one stress location (e.g. [númi]) and key '2' with the other (e.g. [numí]). A trial may be from 2 to 6 stimuli in length. Thus, the order [númi-númi-numí-númi] is to be reproduced as '1121'. It was found that listeners whose native language was French performed significantly worse than Spanish listeners in reproducing the stress patterns by key strokes. The explanation is that Spanish has lexically contrastive stress, as evidenced by the [[minimal pair]]s like ''tópo'' ("mole") and ''topó'' ("met"), while in French, stress does not convey lexical information and there is no equivalent of stress minimal pairs as in Spanish.

== Spelling and notation for stress ==
The [[orthography|orthographies]] of some languages include devices for indicating the position of lexical stress. Some examples are listed below:
* In [[Greek language|Modern Greek]], all [[polysyllable]]s are written with an acute accent over the vowel of the stressed syllable. (The acute accent is also used on some [[monosyllable]]s in order to distinguish [[homograph]]s, as in η ("the") and ή ("or"); here the stress of the two words is the same.)
* In [[Spanish language|Spanish orthography]], stress may be written explicitly with a single acute accent on a vowel. Stressed antepenultimate syllables are always written with this accent mark, as in ''árabe.'' If the last syllable is stressed, the accent mark is used if the word ends in the letters ''n, s,'' or a vowel, as in ''está.'' If the penultimate syllable is stressed, the accent is used if the word ends in any other letter, as in ''cárcel.'' That is, if a word is written without an accent mark, the stress is on the penult if the last letter is a vowel, ''n'', or ''s'', but on the final syllable if the word ends in any other letter. However, as in Greek, the acute accent is also used for some words to distinguish various syntactical uses (e.g. ''té'' "tea" vs. ''te'' a form of the pronoun ''tú''; ''dónde'' "where" as a pronoun or wh-complement, ''donde'' "where" as an adverb). For more information, see [[Stress in Spanish]].
* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Portuguese language#Stress|stress]] is sometimes indicated explicitly with an acute accent (for ''i'', ''u'', and open ''a'', ''e'', ''o''), or circumflex (for close ''a'', ''e'', ''o''). The orthography has an [[Portuguese orthography#Diacritics|extensive set of rules]] that describe the placement of diacritics, based on the position of the stressed syllable and the surrounding letters.
* In [[Italian language|Italian]], the grave accent is needed in words ending with an accented vowel, e.g. ''città'', "city", and in some monosyllabic words that might otherwise be confused with other words, like ''là'' ("there") and ''la'' ("the"). It is optional for it to be written on any vowel if there is a possibility of misunderstanding, such as ''condomìni'' ("condominiums") and ''condòmini'' ("joint owners"). See {{slink|Italian alphabet|Diacritics}}.

Though not part of normal orthography, a number of devices exist that are used by linguists and others to indicate the position of stress (and [[syllabification]] in some cases) when it is desirable to do so. Some of these are listed here.
* In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), primary stress is indicated by a high vertical line before the stressed element, secondary stress by a low vertical line. For example, {{IPA|[sɪˌlæbəfɪˈkeɪʃən]}} or {{IPA|/sɪˌlæbəfɪˈkeɪʃən/}}. Extra stress can be indicated by doubling the symbol: {{IPA|ˈˈ◌}}. Most commonly, the stress mark is placed before the beginning of the stressed syllable, where a syllable is definable. However, it is occasionally placed immediately before the vowel.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, E. M. (2005) "Phonetic variation in Italian consonant gemination", ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', 35: 153–181.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Linguists frequently mark primary stress with an acute accent over the vowel, and secondary stress by a grave accent. Example: {{IPA|[sɪlæ̀bəfɪkéɪʃən]}} or {{IPA|/sɪlæ̀bəfɪkéɪʃən/}}. This has the advantage that it does not require a decision about syllable boundaries.
* In English dictionaries that show pronunciation by [[respelling]], stress is typically marked with a [[prime (symbol)|prime mark]] placed after the stressed syllable: /si-lab′-ə-fi-kay′-shən/.
* In ''[[ad hoc]]'' pronunciation guides, stress is often indicated using a combination of bold text and capital letters. For example, si-'''lab'''-if-i-'''KAY'''-shun or si-LAB-if-i-KAY-shun
* In [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] dictionaries, stress is indicated with an [[acute accent]] (´) on a syllable's vowel (example: вимовля́ння) or, in other editions, an [[apostrophe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; just after it (example: гла'сная). Stressing is rare in general texts, but is still used when necessary: compare ''за́мок'' (castle) and ''замо́к'' (lock). Stress marks are generally used only in materials for foreign learners of the language.
* In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''ad hoc'' indication of stress is usually marked by an acute accent on the vowel (or, in the case of a [[diphthong]] or double vowel, the first two vowels) of the stressed syllable. Compare ''achterúítgang'' (deterioration) and ''áchteruitgang'' (back exit).
* In [[Biblical Hebrew]], a complex system of [[cantillation]] marks is used to mark stress, as well as verse syntax and the melody according to which the verse is chanted in ceremonial Bible reading. In [[Modern Hebrew]], there is no standardized way to mark the stress. Most often, the cantillation mark ''oleh'' (part of ''oleh ve-yored''), which looks like a left-pointing arrow above the consonant of the stressed syllable, for example ב֫וקר ''bóker'' (morning) as opposed to בוק֫ר ''bokér'' (cowboy). This mark is usually used in books by the Academy of the Hebrew Language, and it is available on the standard Hebrew keyboard at AltGr-6. In some books other marks, such as [[meteg]], are used.

'''Taylor Branch''' (born January 14, 1947) is an American author and [[historian]] best known for his trilogy of books chronicling the life of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and much of the history of the American [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The third and final volume of the 2,912-page trilogy—collectively called ''[[America in the King Years]]''—was released in January 2006, and a selected summary of the trilogy, ''The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement'', was released in 2013.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Branch graduated from [[The Westminster Schools]] in [[Atlanta]] in 1964. From there, he went to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] on a [[Morehead Scholarship]]. He graduated in 1968 and went on to earn an [[Master of Public Administration|M.P.A.]] from the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]] in 1970.

He was a [[lecturer]] in [[politics]] and [[history]] at [[Goucher College]] from 1998 to 2000.

===Career===
[[File:Taylor Branch 13618-008.jpg|thumb|Branch at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014]]
Branch served as an assistant editor at ''[[The Washington Monthly]]'' from 1970 to 1973; he was Washington editor of ''[[Harper's]]'' from 1973 to 1976;
and he was Washington columnist for ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'' from 1976 to 1977. He also has written for a variety of other publications, including ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', ''Sport'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', and ''[[Texas Monthly]]''.

In 1972, Branch worked for the [[Texas]] campaign of Democratic presidential nominee [[George McGovern]]. Branch shared an apartment in Austin with [[Bill Clinton]], and the two developed a friendship that continues today. He also worked with [[Hillary Rodham]], Bill's then-girlfriend and Yale Law School classmate, and later Clinton's wife.

Branch's book on former president [[Bill Clinton]], ''The Clinton Tapes: Wrestling History With The President'', was written from many tape-recorded interviews and conversations between the two, most of which occurred in the White House during Clinton's two terms in office and which were not disclosed publicly until 2009 at the time of the book's publication.

Taylor Branch received a five-year [[MacArthur Foundation]] Fellowship (also known as a "genius grant") in 1991 and the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 1999.  In 2008, he received the [[Dayton Literary Peace Prize]]'s Lifetime Achievement Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daytondailynews.com/l/content/oh/story/living/2008/05/16/ddn051808lifepeaceprize.html King biographer latest Literary Peace Prize honoree]&lt;/ref&gt; presented to him by special guest [[Edwin C. Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daytonliterarypeaceprize.org/2008-ecm.htm Dayton Literary Peace Prize - Edwin C. Moses]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he co-produced ''[[Schooled: The Price of College Sports]]'' based on his 2011 book ''The Cartel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|3057718|title=Schooled: The Price of College Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015, he received the BIO Award from [[Biographers International Organization]], for his contributions to the art and craft of biography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biographersinternational.org/about/annual-awards/the-bio-award/ The BIO Award, Biographers International Organization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307105436/http://biographersinternational.org/about/annual-awards/the-bio-award/ |date=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversial statements===

Branch has stated that [[Black Hebrew Israelites]] were denied citizenship under the Israeli law of return because of alleged anti-Black sentiment among Israeli Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Seth, ''Blacks in the Jewish Mind: A Crisis of Liberalism'',  p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Branch, Taylor "Blacks and Jews: The Uncivil War", in ''Bridges and Boundaries: African Americans and American Jews'' (Salzman, Ed), 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Branch was criticized by [[Seth Forman]], who said the claims seem baseless, particularly in light of Israel's airlift of thousands of black Ethiopian Jews in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Forman"&gt;Blacks in the Jewish mind: a crisis of liberalism, Seth Forman, NYU Press, 1998: p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; A group of American civil rights activists led by [[Bayard Rustin]] investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of Black Hebrews' situation.&lt;ref name=Shipler&gt;{{cite news |last=Shipler |first=David K. |title=Israelis Urged To Act Over Black Hebrew Cult |url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F4071FFA395F0C738FDDA80894D9484D81 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 30, 1981 |accessdate=2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Branch lives in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], with his wife, Christina Macy, and their two children, Macy (born 1980) and Franklin (born 1983).

Last updated October 2015. Accessed October 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the definition of technical communication, the overarching goal of the practice is to create easily accessible information for a specific audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100524154910/http://www.tcanz.org.nz/Resources/Learn+About+Technical+Communication/Technical+Communication.html What is Technical Communication?] at the official website of the Technical Communicators Association of New Zealand.

==As a profession==
Technical communicators generally tailor information to a specific audience, which may be subject matter experts, consumers, end users, etc. Technical communicators often work collaboratively to create [[deliverable]]s that include [[online help]], user [[user guide|manual]]s, classroom training guides, computer-based training, [[white paper]]s, [[specification]]s, [[industrial video]]s, [[reference card]]s, [[data sheet]]s, [[journal article]]s, and [[patent]]s.
[[Vocational education|Technical]] domains can be of any kind, including the soft and hard [[science]]s, [[high technology]] including [[computer]]s and [[software]] and [[consumer electronics]]. Technical communicators often work with a range of specific [[Subject-matter expert]]s (SMEs) on these educational projects.

Technical communication jobs include the following:&lt;ref name=whirl/&gt;
[[API writer]], [[e-learning author]], [[information architect]], [[technical content developer]], [[technical editor]], [[technical illustrator]], [[technical trainer]], [[technical translator]], [[technical writer]], [[usability expert]], [[user experience designer]], and [[user interface designer]]. Other jobs available to technical communicators include digital strategist, marketing specialist, and content manager.

In 2015, the [[European Association for Technical Communication]] published a competence framework for the professional field of technical communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://competences.technical-communication.org/overview.html Competence Framework for Technical Communication] at the tekom Europe official website.

Much like technology and the world economy, technical communication as a profession has evolved over the last half-century. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Content creation&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Information mapping]]; do not rename heading without fixing incoming link ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
{{See also|Information mapping}}

Technical communication is a task performed by specialized employees or consultants. For example, a professional writer may work with a company to produce a user manual. Some companies give considerable technical communication responsibility to other technical professionals—such as programmers, engineers, and scientists. Often, a professional technical writer edits such work to bring it up to modern technical communication standards.

To begin the documentation process, technical communicators identify the audience and their information needs. The technical communicator researches and structures the content into a framework that can guide detailed development. As the body of information comes together, the technical communicator ensures that the intended audience can understand the content and retrieve the information they need. This process, known as the [[writing process]], has been a central focus of writing theory since the 1970s, and some contemporary textbook authors apply it to technical communication. Technical communication is important to most professions, as a way to contain and organize information and maintain accuracy.

The [[technical writing]] process is based on Cicero's 5 canons of [[rhetoric]], and can be divided into six steps:

# Determine purpose and audience
# Collect information ([[inventio|Invention]])
# Organize and outline information ([[Dispositio|Arrangement]])
# Write the first draft ([[Elocutio|Style]])
# Revise and edit ([[Memoria|Memory]])
# Publish output ([[Pronuntiatio|Delivery]])

===Determining purpose and audience===

All technical communication serves a particular purpose—typically to communicate ideas and concepts to an audience, or instruct an audience in a particular task.  Technical communication professionals use various techniques to understand the audience and, when possible, test content on the target audience. For example, if bank workers don't properly post deposits, a technical communicator would review existing instructional material (or lack thereof), interview bank workers to identify conceptual errors, interview subject matter experts to learn the correct procedures, author new material that instructs workers in the correct procedures, and test the new material on the bank workers.

Similarly, a sales manager who wonders which of two sites is better for a new store might ask a marketing professional to study the sites and write a report with recommendations. The marketing professional hands the report off to a technical communicator (in this case, a technical editor or technical writer), who edits, formats, and sometimes elaborates the document in order to make the marketing professional's expert assessment usable to the sales manager. The process is not one of knowledge transfer, but the accommodation of knowledge across fields of expertise and contexts of use. This is the basic definition of technical communication.

Audience type affects many aspects of communication, from word selection and graphics use to style and organization. Most often, to address a particular audience, a technical communicator must consider what qualities make a text useful (capable of supporting a meaningful task) and usable (capable of being used in service of that task). A non-technical audience might misunderstand or not even read a document that is heavy with jargon—while a technical audience might crave detail critical to their work. Busy audiences often don't have time to read entire documents, so content must be organized for ease of searching—for example by frequent [[:wikt:heading|headings]], [[White space (visual arts)|white space]], and other cues that guide [[attention]]. Other requirements vary according to particular audience's needs.

Technical communication in the government is particular and detailed. Depending on the segment of government (and country), the government component must follow distinct specifications. Information changes continuously and technical communications (technical manuals, interactive electronic technical manuals, technical bulletins, etc.) must be updated.

===Collecting information===

Technical communicators must collect all information that each document requires. They may collect information through primary (first-hand) research—or secondary research, using information from existing work by other authors. Technical communicators must acknowledge all sources they use to produce their work. To this end, technical communicators typically distinguish quotations, paraphrases, and summaries when taking notes.

===Organizing and outlining information===

Before writing the initial draft, the technical communicator organizes ideas in a way that makes the document flow well. Once each idea is organized, the writer organizes the document as a whole—accomplishing this task in various ways: chronological: used for documents that involve a linear process, such as a step-by-step guide that describes how to accomplish something; parts of an object: Used for documents that describe the parts of an object, such as a graphic showing the parts of a computer (keyboard, monitor, mouse, etc.); simple to complex (or vice versa): starts with easy ideas and gradually goes into complex ideas; specific to general: starts with many ideas, then organizes the ideas into sub-categories; general to specific: starts with a few categories of ideas, then goes deeper

After organizing the whole document, the writer typically creates a final outline that shows the document structure. Outlines make the writing process easier and save the author time.

===Writing the first draft===

After the outline is complete, the writer begins the first draft, following the outline's structure. Setting aside blocks of an hour or more, in a place free of distractions, helps the writer maintain a flow. Most writers prefer to wait until the draft is complete before any revising so they don't break their flow. Typically, the writer should start with the easiest section, and write the summary only after the body is drafted.

The ABC (''a''bstract, ''b''ody, and ''c''onclusion) format can be used when writing a first draft of some document types. The abstract describes the subject, so that the reader knows what the document covers. The body is the majority of the document and covers topics in depth.  Lastly, the conclusion section restates the document's main topics. The ABC format can also apply to individual paragraphs—beginning with a topic sentence that states the paragraph's topic, followed by the topic, and finally, a concluding sentence.

===Revising and editing===

Once the initial draft is laid out, editing and revising can be done to fine-tune the draft into a final copy. Four tasks transform the early draft into its final form, suggested by Pfeiffer and Boogard:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

====Adjusting and reorganizing content====

In this step, the writer revises the draft to elaborate on topics that need more attention, shorten other sections—and relocate certain paragraphs, sentences, or entire topics.

====Editing for style====

Good style makes writing more interesting, appealing, and readable. In general, the personal writing style of the writer is not evident in technical writing. Modern technical writing style relies on attributes that contribute to clarity: headings, lists, graphics; generous white space, short sentences, present tense, simple nouns, [[active voice]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 63. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though some scientific applications still use the [[passive voice]]), second and third person as required

Technical writing as a discipline usually requires that a technical writer use a [[style guide]]. These guides may relate to a specific project, product, company, or brand. They ensure that technical writing reflects formatting, punctuation, and general stylistic standards that the audience expects. In the United States, many consider the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'' the bible for general technical communication. Other style guides have their adherents, particularly for specific industries—such as the ''Microsoft Style Guide'' in some information technology settings.

====Editing for grammar and punctuation====

At this point, the writer performs a ''mechanical edit'', checking the document for grammar, punctuation, common word confusions, passive voice, overly long sentences, etc.

'''Xochipala''' is a minor archaeological site in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Guerrero]], whose name has become attached, somewhat erroneously, to a style of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Formative Period]] figurines and pottery from 1500 to 200 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (1985). p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeological site belongs to the Classic and Postclassic eras, from 200-1400 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa María Reyna-Robles (2003) supplies the dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological site==
The '''Organera Xochipala''' archaeological zone takes its name from the nearby village of Xoxhipala and the local [[Stenocereus thurberi|organ pipe cactus]].  The archaeological site belongs to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic]] and, most importantly, the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic eras]], from 200 to 1400 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa María Reyna-Robles (2003) supplies the dates.  Pool, p. 306, says: "Archaeological excavation has failed to find an Early [Olmec] Horizon at [Organera] Xochipala."&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-20th century this site, representative of the [[Mezcala culture]], was extensively looted of an estimated 20,000 pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa María Reyna-Robles (website).&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the sculptural artifacts have been studied as looted pieces appearing in art collections.

The area is better known for its Xochipala-style figurines and stone bowls, which have been dated to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Formative (or Preclassic) Period]] 1500 to 200 BCE.

The site is particularly notable for the discovery of a [[corbelled arch]], an innovation generally attributed the Maya.  Whether the corbelled arch was independently developed in Guerrero or was imported from the Maya regions is still unsettled.

The mound complex of Las Mesas is located about six kilometers to the south/southwest of the modern town of Xochipala. Some important monoliths were found there.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaud F.

==Formative Period figurines==
[[File:Two_Xochipala_figurines_(Met_by_Ched).jpg|right|thumb|300px|Two Formative Period Xochipala figurines, 13th - 10th century BCE (?)]]
The Xochipala style is represented by some of the earliest and most naturalistic Mesoamerican figurines,&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 309.  Parsons, p. 176, who describes the "extreme naturalism characteristic of the earliest known figurine tradition in Mesoamerica".  See also Grove quote in '''Critical assessment''' section.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of bowls intricately carved from very hard stone.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (1985), p. 216.  Parsons et al. (p. 176) say "The Xohipala culture also produced finely sculpted utilitarian stonework".&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rediscovered Xochipala-style figurine was purchased in Guerrero in 1897 by [[William Niven]] and sold to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] in 1903.  Unfortunately, no Xochipala figurine has yet been found in [[archaeological context]], but only through collectors and art dealers.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest date assigned to any figurine is 1500 BCE&lt;ref&gt;Miller (p. 32) gives the 1500 BCE date.&lt;/ref&gt; but without [[provenance]], so dating is based on stylistic and compositional characteristics.

To achieve a more realistic look, many of the figurines were first modeled without clothing, which was then draped [[applique]]-like about the body.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the nude figurines may have been dressed in perishable clothing.&lt;ref name="Miller, p. 32"&gt;Miller, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical assessment===
There is near universal praise for these early figurines:

:"Near Xochipala a number of solid clay statuettes have been found dating from about 1300 BC, but modelled with a sureness of hand, a sensitivity to three-dimensional form, and a liveliness that suggests a well-established tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Honour, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Hugh Honour]]''

:"Expressive gestures, naturalistic forms of hair, breasts, and plastic arms and legs make early and rare Xochipala figures among the finest ceramic works of the ancient New World".&lt;ref name="Miller, p. 32" /&gt;  ''[[Mary Ellen Miller]]''

:". . . some of the most imaginative, lively, and naturalistic figuines yet known in [[Mesoamerica]]".&lt;ref&gt;Grove, p. 1138.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[David Grove]]''

:"This small group constitutes some of the greatest miniature ceramic sculpture made in the Americas.  The figures stand out in intensity and naturalism from all other works."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (1985), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  "These primal works of superb technical virtuosity represent some of the greatest ceramic figurines in all of the vast body of Mesoamerican art."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (1972), p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Gillett Griffin''

===Olmec?===
In his seminal 1972 book, Carlo Gay attributed the sophisticated artistry of the Xochipala figurines to a precocious culture that was the predecessor of the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coast]] [[Olmec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Gay's ''Xochipala: The Beginnings of Olmec Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gay, the naturalistic "Early Xochipala" figurines led over centuries to the stylised "Late Xochipala" style which in turn led to what archaeologist Gillett Griffin has called "abstracted, . . . ideal," and "contrived" Olmec art.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin,p. 306 &amp; 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite what Griffin describes as a "pure Olmec stratum", others have found few similarities between Xochipala figurines and Olmec art.  [[David Grove]], for example, finds that minor quantities of some Olmec attributes appear in Gay's "Middle Xochipala" sequence and in the stone bowls, but these attributes are otherwise missing from Xochipala art.&lt;ref&gt;Grove.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Coe]], however, sees "nothing [in the Xochipala figurines or stone bowls] which would lead into the Olmec pattern".&lt;ref&gt;Coe, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gay's proposal is "now widely regarded as untenable".&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 57.  Trigger refers to the hypothesis as "outdated", p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of an alternate explanation of Xochipala precociousness, [[David Grove]] suggests that the earliest figurines were influenced by the "already developed and sophisticated ceramic traditions of northern South America", an idea that is not widely accepted in the archaeological community.
