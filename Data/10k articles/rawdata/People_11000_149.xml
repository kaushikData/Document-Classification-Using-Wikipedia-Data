'''Abu Hajal Muslim ibn Awsaja''' ({{lang-ar|ابوحَجَل مسلم بن عوسجه الأسدي}}) was a companion of Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]]. He assisted [[Muslim ibn Aqeel]] in [[Kufa]]. Then he joined [[Husayn ibn Ali]] army with his family. He was killed in [[battle of Karbala]].&lt;ref name="AbbasAnis1983"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Syed Ghulam Abbas|author2=Mir Babbar Ali Anis|title=The Immortal Poetry &amp; Mir Anis: With the Versified Translation of a Marsia of Mir Anis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeljAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Majlis-e-Milli, Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name and lineage ==
He is Muslim son of Awsaja son of Sa'd son of Tha'laba son of Dudan son of Asad son of Khuzayma al-Asadi. His [[Kunya (Arabic)|Kunya]] is Abu Hajal. He was a companion of [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Muslim ibn Awsaja and [[Habib ibn Madhahir]] both were from the tribe of [[Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah|Banu Asad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Samavi|first1=Muhammad|title=Absar al-Ein fi Ansar al-Husayn|publisher=al-Derasat al-Islamiyya|location=Qom|isbn=964-90575-7-9|pages=108–111|url=http://www.noorlib.ir/View/fa/Book/BookView/Image/1767/1/133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Kufa ==
Mulim ibn Awsaja supported [[Husayn ibn Ali]]’s ambassador, [[Muslim ibn Aqeel]], in [[Kufa]] with weaponry and tried to take oath of allegiance for Husayn ibn Ali. 
The spy of [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]], Ma'qil, found the safe house of Muslim ibn Aqeel through Muslim ibn Awsaja. Consequently, [[Hani ibn Urwa]] who sheltered Muslim ibn Aqeel in his house was arrested. Then Muslim ibn Aqeel to organizing an army chose Muslim ibn Awsaja as commander of [[Banu Asad]] and [[Madh'hij]] and some other commanders. Soon after Hani ibn Urwa and Muslim ibn Aqeel were killed by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, and Muslim ibn Awsaja hided in a safe house for a while. Afterward he joined Husayn ibn Ali army with his family in [[Karbala]].&lt;ref name="Nafs al-Mahmoom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qomi|first1=Abbas|title=Nafs al-Mahmoom|publisher=al-Maktaba al-Heydariyya|location=Qom|url=http://www.noorlib.ir/View/fa/Book/BookView/Image/1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Karbala ==

=== The Night before Ashura ===
At [[Day of Tasu'a|Tasu'a]] night, Husayn ibn Ali told his soldiers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You are allowed to leave Karbala and your promises and oath of allegiance have served well so far, you are not obligated to stay for the battle.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Then, some companions proclaimed their allegiance and loyalty to Husayn ibn Ali over again. After the descendants of [[Banu Hashim]], Mulim ibn Awsaja was the first one who said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Oh, [[Husayn ibn Ali|Abu Abd-Allah]]! We would never leave you alone. How it is possible to bring excuses to Allah? O, by Allah, never! We will never leave you alone; I will never give up; I will slay the enemies with my spear and sword until it drops on the ground; then I stone them. By Allah, I would never leave you alone until I fulfill my duties to Allah and defend the descendants of Prophet Muhammad. O, by Allah, if I am perished, I would reborn, and then if I am burnt and turned into ashes, I would reborn; and if it happens seventy times I would reborn and fight for you until I am martyred for you. I would never leave you as I know I will be perished once. Consequently, eternal prosperity and dignity would be mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ʻUmar Ibn Kathīr|first1=Ismāʻīl|title=al-Bidāyah wa-al-nihāyah|publisher=Dar al-Fekr|location=Beirut|page=177|url=http://www.noorlib.ir/View/fa/Book/BookView/Image/13958/1/172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== His motto in the battle of Karbala ====
He repeatedly expressed this motto in the [[battle of Karbala]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you desire to know me, I am brave as a lion; my lineage goes back to Banu Asad. If you treat me with tyranny, you are strayed from the right path, and you are guilty of ingratitude toward Allah.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It should be noted that [[Asad]] means lion.

== Death ==
Muslim ibn Awsaja was the first one who was killed in the battle of Karbala before Amr ibn Qartah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nafasul Mahmoom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv3dBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275|publisher=JAC Developer|pages=275–|id=GGKEY:RQAZ12CNGF5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was about 70 years old.&lt;ref name="El-Neil2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ibn El-Neil|title=The Truth About Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlUq-sMt5ccC&amp;pg=PA204|date=1 November 2008|publisher=Strategic Book Publishing|isbn=978-1-60693-259-9|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''Afghans'''" or "'''Ghans'''" were [[camel train|camel caravanners]] who worked in [[Outback]] [[Australia]] from the 1860s to the 1930s. They included [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], [[Punjabis|Punjabi]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]] and [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] men from the region between the southern [[Hindu Kush]] in [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Indus River]] in what is now [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref name=Westrip&amp;Holroyde&gt;Westrip, J. &amp; Holroyde, P. (2010): ''Colonial Cousins: a surprising history of connections between India and Australia.'' [[Wakefield Press (Australia)|Wakefield Press]]. {{ISBN|1862548412}}, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as others from [[Kashmir]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Egypt]], [[Persia]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=australia.gov&gt;[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/afghan-cameleers australia.gov.au &gt; About Australia &gt; Australian Stories &gt; Afghan cameleers in Australia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815171331/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/afghan-cameleers |date=15 August 2014 }} Accessed 8 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides providing vital support to exploration and settlement of the arid interior of the country, these cameleers played a major role in establishing [[Islam in Australia]], building the country's [[Marree Mosque|first mosque at Marree]] in South Australia.

==History==
The first Afghan cameleers arrived in [[Melbourne]] in June 1860, when three men arrived with a shipment of 24 camels for the [[Burke and Wills expedition]].&lt;ref name=australia.gov /&gt; Afghans without camels are reported to have reached Australia as early as 1838.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/afghans.htm  Flinders Range Research - The Afghan Camelmen]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the building of railways and the widespread adoption of motor vehicles, camels were the primary means of [[bulk transport]] in the Outback, where the climate was too harsh for horses and other beasts of burden. After their use was superseded by modern transport, some cameleers released their camels into the wild, and a large population of [[Australian feral camel|feral camels]] remains from this time. From 1850-1900, Afghani camel handlers played an important part in opening up Central Australia, helping in building of telegraph and railway lines. They also helped the growth of Muslims in Australia before 1850.

==Impact==
Even though the Afghans' help was greatly appreciated they were also subject to discrimination because of their religion and appearance, and because of the competition they provided to European bullock teamsters.&lt;ref name=australia.gov /&gt; Many of those European competitors were also cameleers and in 1903 a European camel train proprietor of [[Wilcannia]] replaced all of his Afghan camel drivers with Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;''National Advocate'' newspaper, 17 April 1903, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The passenger train which travels between [[Adelaide]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] is known as "[[The Ghan]]" (formerly ''[[The Afghan Express]]'') as a reference to the service the Afghans provided to the areas through which the train travels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prr.org.au/cms/train-services-mainmenu-81/afghan-express-mainmenu-69 Afghan Express]&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Afghans to settle in Australia was approximately 3,000, with over 2,000 arriving between 1870 and 1900.&lt;ref name=australia.gov /&gt;

===Establishment of mosques===
At [[Marree]], an important junction of the camel trade, the Afghan cameleers built the earliest mosque in Australia in 1861,&lt;ref name=australia.gov /&gt; but this subsequently fell into disuse and was demolished. Over time as some members of the Afghan community prospered through trade and camel breeding, they contributed towards the  building of the oldest permanent mosque in Australia, in Adelaide in 1888–89,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weekendnotes.com/adelaide-city-afghan-mosque/ Weekend Notes &gt; Adelaide City Afghan Mosque] Accessed 8 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Perth mosque, which dates from 1905.{{sfn|Westrip &amp; Holroyde|p. 193}}

{{Book of Mormon}}
According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Alma, the son of Alma''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|m|ə}}) was a [[Nephite]] prophet often referred to as "Alma the Younger" to distinguish him from his father, who is often referred to as "[[Alma the Elder]]". These appellations, "the Younger" and "the Elder", are not used in the Book of Mormon; they are distinctions made by scholars, useful because both individuals were prominent during the same time period and filled a similar cultural and religious role. Alma is the namesake of the [[Book of Alma]].

There are many similarities in both plot and in language between the Alma the Younger's conversion story and the story of [[Saul of Tarsus]] in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ashurst-McGee| first1=Mark| title=A One-sided View of Mormon Origins| accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of his life==
Alma the Younger lived in [[Zarahemla]] during the end of the reign of the Nephite King [[King Mosiah II|Mosiah]]. It is believed that he was born in 126 BC.  As a young man, he, the four sons of Mosiah, and others wanted to destroy the church and actively persecuted its members. After they were visited personally by an angel and rebuked for their actions, Alma fell into an unconscious state where for three days and three nights he lay unable to move until he felt within that he had been forgiven of his sins. He and those who persecuted church members with him abdicated their role as persecutors and became followers of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alma the Younger subsequently became the first elected chief judge of the [[Nephites]] as well as their religious leader. He observed that the Nephites of the church were becoming increasingly wicked, proud, disdainful of outsiders and neglectful toward the poor and needy.(Alma 4:11-12) When the "unbelievers" began to follow their example, Alma feared the entire people were on the path to self-destruction.(Alma 4:11) He resigned his post as chief judge and began traveling from city to city to preach to the Nephites. He began in Zarahemla, where his efforts were successful. A thorough purge of the church leadership and membership took place, with those former insiders and leaders who refused to relinquish their pride being "rejected, and their names blotted out".(Alma 6:3).

Alma moved on to the cities of Gideon and Melek, where his call to humility was also well received.  From Melek he traveled three days journey north to [[Ammonihah]], whose inhabitants proved much more hardened than those of the previous three cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|1|}} - {{lds|Alma|alma|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ammonihah the people were very wicked. They considered themselves superior to outsiders, especially the [[Lamanites]], and gloried in the strength of their city, which they considered indestructible. According to Alma chapter 9, Satan held such control over them that they would not listen to Alma.  While trying to speak to them he was abused and thrown out of the city. Commanded by an angel to return, Alma slipped back into the city through a different route from the south. There he met [[Amulek]], a lapsed believer (Alma 10:5-6) of some social prominence who fed Alma and housed him for a time.  In the city streets, the two of them joined up and preached to the people, where they were challenged by a lawyer named [[Zeezrom]].  After Amulek had silenced Zeezrom through his teaching and aroused his conscience, Alma took his turn, preaching to the people with similar results. When finished, Alma and Amulek were cast into prison and delivered by a miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|9}} - {{lds|Alma|alma|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A repentant Zeezrom eventually joined Alma in his missionary work.

Several years later, Alma met up with a man named [[Korihor]], whom the Book of Mormon describes as an [[anti-Christ]]. This Korihor tried to lead the Nephites astray. Alma confronted him, confounding his arguments and miraculously removing Korihor's power of speech. The stricken Korihor signaled acknowledgement that he had acted maliciously, knowing all along that he was wrong and bringing destruction upon others. He was reduced to begging and was eventually run down and killed in a city of Nephite dissenters called [[Zoramites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These same Zoramites were found to practice things that perverted the ways of the Lord. This led Alma to extend his missionary work to these people. While among them, he was most successful with the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|51|31|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alma's final instruction was to his sons, [[Helaman]], [[Shiblon]], and [[Corianton]].  He gave each separate lessons, and finally gave the records of the church to Helaman. He then departed, in the 19th year of the reign of the judges (or 73 BC) as if to go to Melek, but was never heard from again. Both [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] and Helaman believed that he was taken up like Moses of old, and buried by the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|36}} - {{lds|Alma|alma|42}}, {{lds|Alma|alma|45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1901">'''Asad ibn al-Furat''' ({{lang-ar|أسد بن الفرات}}; 759-828) was a [[jurist]] and [[theologian]] in [[Ifriqiya]], who began the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily]].

His family, originally from [[Harran]] in [[Mesopotamia]], emigrated with him to [[Ifriqiya]]. Asad studied in [[Medina]] with [[Malik ibn Anas]], the founder of the [[Malikite]] school, and in Kufa with a disciple of [[Abu Hanifa]], the founder of the [[Hanafite]] tradition. He collected his views on religious law in the '''Asadiyya''', which had great influence in Ifriqiya.

After his return to Ifriqiya he became a judge in [[Kairouan]], where he soon came into conflict with the [[Aghlabid]] [[Emir]] [[Ziyadat Allah I]] (817-838) after criticising his luxurious and impious lifestyle. In order to get rid of this unwelcome critic, Ziyadat appointed Asad the leader of an expedition to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Sicily]]. In 827 Asad landed with a force of [[Arabs]] in Sicily and following a defeat of Byzantine troops proceeded to [[Siege of Syracuse (827–828)|besiege]] [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. However, the city could not be taken and Asad soon died of plague.

Asad was prominent in establishing the [[Malikite]] [[Madh'hab]] in Ifriqiya.

'''Bicycle messengers''' (also known as '''bike''' or '''cycle couriers''') are people who work for [[courier]] companies (also known as messenger companies) carrying and delivering items by [[bicycle]]. Bicycle messengers are most often found in the [[central business district]]s of metropolitan areas. Courier companies use bike messengers because bicycle travel is less subject to unexpected holdups in city [[Traffic congestion|traffic jams]], and is not deterred by parking limitations, fees or fines in high density development that can hinder or prevent delivery by motor vehicle, thereby offering a predictable delivery time.

==History==
[[File:BikeBoys.jpg|thumb|Bicycle messenger boys, [[Salt Lake City]], 1912]]

Almost immediately after the development of the pedal-driven [[velocipede]] in the 1860s, people began to use the bicycle for delivery purposes. [[David V. Herlihy]]'s 2004 book on the early history of the bicycle contains several references to bicycle messengers working during the late 19th century, including a description of couriers employed by the Paris stock exchange in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herlihy |first=David V. |authorlink=David V. Herlihy |title=Bicycle: the History |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2004 |page=177 |url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300104189 |isbn=0-300-10418-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[bicycle boom]] of the 1890s in the United States, [[Western Union]] employed a number of bicycle [[telegraph boy]]s in [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], and other large population centers.

One of the earliest recorded post-war American bicycle courier companies was founded by Carl Sparks, in [[San Francisco]], in 1945. According to the San Francisco Bicycle Messenger Association, "Sparkie's went on to become Aero, which was bought out in 1998 [and] later absorbed into CitySprint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Bike Messengering in San Francisco |publisher=San Francisco Bicycle Messenger Association |date=September 1996 |url= http://www.ahalenia.com/sfbma/history.html |accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, there were well-established companies offering bicycle messenger services in many major cities in the U.S.

In Europe, the bicycle had fallen out of favour as a means of delivery in the third quarter of the 20th century. It was not until 1983 that bicycle messengers made their reappearance in Europe. London's "On Yer Bike" and "Pedal-Pushers" were pioneers of pedal over petrol, and the rest of the city's courier companies followed suit. By the late 1980s, cycle couriers were a common sight in central London and a British manufacturer named a range of mountain-bikes for them, the Muddy Fox 'Courier'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Value Judgement |publisher=The Washing Machine Post |date=1998-04-11 |url=http://www.ileach.co.uk/post/archive/archivepost12.html |quote=When I entered the grand world of cycling in a proper way instead of playing on a terrible ten speed racer, i bought a Muddy Fox Courier for £300 [sic] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070821210443/http://www.ileach.co.uk/post/archive/archivepost12.html |archivedate=21 August 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs in continental Europe, some inspired by seeing couriers in the U.S. or in London, began to offer bicycle courier services in the late 1980s, and by 1993 there were sufficiently large numbers of bicycle couriers in Northern Europe and North America that over 400 attended the inaugural Cycle Messenger Championships in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Short history of the Cycle Messenger World Championships |publisher=International Federation of Bicycle Messengers and Associations |date=October 1998 |url=http://www.messengers.org/ifbma/history.html |quote=500 messengers showed up, raced, drank beer, smoked and hung out.

There are very few bicycle couriers in Portugal, France, Spain, or Italy. Outside Europe and North America, there are now large bicycle messenger services in Japan, and also in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. More recently, several companies started offering bike messenger services in Central and South America, specifically in México City, México; San José, Costa Rica; Bogotá, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, Brazil.

==Demand for courier services==
Messengers carry a huge variety of items, from things that could not be sent by digital means (corporate gifts, original artwork, clothes for photo-shoots, original signed documents) to mundane items that could easily be emailed, albeit without the air of importance attached to an express courier delivery. Messengers deliver digital content on [[optical media]] or [[Hard disk drive|hard disks]] because, despite high speed broadband connections, companies find it easier to send a disc than to work out how to transmit larger amounts of data than an email account can handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Piracy And Securing The Digital Media Supply Chain |url=http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=73253 |date=2007-12-31 |publisher=Video Insider |accessdate=2008-01-05 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sneakernet Redux: Walk Your Data |url= https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,54739,00.html |date=2002-08-26 |publisher=Wired Magazine |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal documents, various financial instruments and sensitive information are routinely sent by courier, reflecting a distrust of digital cryptography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub92/lynch.html |first=Clifford |last=Lynch |title=Authenticity and Integrity in the Digital Environment |date=May 2000 |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have claimed that technological innovation will significantly reduce the demand for same-day parcel delivery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2118772,00.html |publisher=Guardian Media |first=Matt |last=Seaton |title=Two Wheels column |date=2007-07-05 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831092911/http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0%2C%2C2118772%2C00.html |archivedate=31 August 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/19/world/fax-displacing-manhattan-bike-couriers.html |date=1990-03-19 |title=Fax Displacing Manhattan Bike Couriers |publisher=The New York Times |first=Robert |last=Tomasson |accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicting that the [[fax machine]], and then the [[internet]], would render the messenger business obsolete. There is still a demand for fast courier services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=7 July 2006 |publisher=The Economist |title=Soft Pedal |url= http://twocitiestwowheels.blogspot.com/2006/07/economist-and-bike-messengers.html |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is certainly some truth in the predictions. Reliable data specifically relating to bicycle messenger occupational statistics is hard to find: the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] [[statistics]] does not track bicycle messengers specifically, and does not include "independent contractors" in statistics referenced for this industry occupation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=US Department of Labor | publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |url= http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes435021.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090106010254/http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes435021.htm |archivedate=6 January 2009 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reports indicate the business is shrinking.

The gradual acceptance of electronic filing by U.S. courts has had a negative effect on the market. In San Francisco, bike messengers report a smaller work force coupled with decreased earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kathleen | last=Pender | title=Bicycle messengers are pedaling uphill against the Internet | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/17/BUGOSR1ET51.DTL | accessdate=2009-01-09 | date=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York alone, the number of messengers dropped by approximately 1,000 between 1998 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Internet Endangers Big-City Tradition: The Bike Messenger | url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2008/07/bikemessengers |date=2008-07-25 | publisher=Wired Magazine | accessdate=2008-07-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080726225922/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2008/07/bikemessengers| archivedate= 26 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working conditions==
[[File:Julia Obear, messenger girl at the National Women's (i.e. Woman's) Party headquarters LCCN92522519 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Bicycle messenger at the headquarters of the [[National Woman's Party]], 1922]]
The conditions of employment of bicycle messengers vary from country to country, city to city and even company to company. Contracts governing the relationship between individual courier and company are subject as much to customary practice, as local ordinance. In some places messengers are [[independent contractor]]s paid on [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] and do not receive benefits such as health insurance. In other places they will be regular [[employee]]s of the courier company enjoying all the benefits thereof.

The employment status of the bicycle messengers of one of the UK's biggest same-day courier services, CitySprint, was challenged by the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] [[trade union]] in December 2007. The challenge arose after the firm terminated the contract of one of its riders. The GMB sought to establish that more than 1,500 CitySprint operatives currently classified as self-employed sub-contractors should be re-classified as employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author= Nick Mathiason |title= Christmas sacking starts fight for rights of dispatched courier |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/23/2 |publisher= Guardian Media |location= London, UK |date= 2007-12-23 |accessdate=2007-12-24 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080106124055/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/dec/23/2| archivedate= 6 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The job is poorly paid relative to the risk and effort required. In 2002, a [[Harvard Medical School]] study of injury rates among [[Boston]] bicycle messengers determined that the rate of injury requiring time off work among the sample group was more than thirteen times the U.S. average, and more than three times higher than the next highest group, workers in the meat-packing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Licensing==
In most cities, there are no legal requirements beyond those applying to all cyclists. Some jurisdictions, though, require the licensing of courier bicycles. In [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] for example, metal license plates must be fixed to bicycles used for courier work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Calgary City Business License information FAQ | publisher=City of Calgary | url=http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_104_0_0_35/http%3B/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Development+and+Building+Approvals+and+Land+Use+Planning+and+Policy/Business+Licences/Business+Licence+FAQs.htm#Question4 | accessdate=2009-01-18 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] additionally requires bicycle messengers to complete a test in order to obtain a license, and to carry an identification card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=City of Vancouver Community Services/Licenses and Inspections | publisher=City of Vancouver | url=http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/LICANDINSP/licences/pdf/bikecourierguide.pdf | accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
The most essential piece of equipment for a bicycle messenger is a [[bicycle]]. Some large cities that employ significant numbers of bike messengers (e.g., New York City) have relatively flat terrain, and are especially conducive to the performance properties of fixed gear bicycles.

Because bicycle thefts are prevalent in many cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | title=Bicycles stolen every 71 seconds

  | accessdate=2007-09-24 
  | quote=The hotspots for [bicycle] thefts are central London }}&lt;/ref&gt; a lock to secure the bike during deliveries is essential. [[U-lock]]s are also popular. Messengers typically carry basic tools, weather-proof clothing and a street map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first='Buffalo' Bill | last=Chidley | title=How to be a messenger and not get stitched up, nicked or run over | publisher=London Bicycle Messenger Association | url=http://www.londonmessengers.org/FAQ | accessdate=2010-12-29 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629084442/http://www.londonmessengers.org/FAQ | archivedate=2008-06-29|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of messengers use a bag to carry deliveries and personal effects. Bags with a single strap that wraps diagonally across the chest (popularly known as [[messenger bag]]) are popular because they can be swung around the messenger's body to allow access without removing the bag. Clasps which can be adjusted with one hand (ideal for riding), clips, pockets and webbing loops on the strap for holding a [[cell phone]] or [[two-way radio]] and other equipment also feature on purpose-built messenger bags. Bags generally have large capacities (up to 50 liters or 3,000 cubic inches). Baskets and racks mounted on the bike are also used, and at least one messenger service (in [[New York City]]) equips its riders with specialized three-wheel cycles (sometimes known as [[cargo bike|cargo-trikes]]), with a large trunk in the rear. Many bicycle messengers also wear helmets and mount lights and fenders (mud guards) to their bicycles.

==Communications==
Messengers communicate and are dispatched to assignments via hand-held communication devices including [[two-way radio]]s, [[cell phone]]s, and [[personal digital assistant]]s. Many of the larger messenger services equip their riders with [[GPS tracking]] devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first='Buffalo' Bill | last=Chidley | title=The End of Bicycle Messengering As We Know It? | publisher=Moving Target | url=http://www.movingtargetzine.com/article/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-bicycle-messengering-as-we-know-it | accessdate=2007-09-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814002904/http://www.movingtargetzine.com/article/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-bicycle-messengering-as-we-know-it| archivedate= 14 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ease of location.

The 1986 film ''[[Quicksilver (film)|Quicksilver]]'' featuring a bicycle messenger, is an early expression of the mythology of the messenger as daredevil stunt rider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guerrero |first=Jeff |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07252/815585-109.stm |title=The Next Page: The Limberness of the Fixed Gear Mind |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2007-09-09 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Star [[Kevin Bacon]] rides a racing bike, a fixed gear bike and a [[Artistic cycling|trick bike]] with 1:1 gear ratio and zero-rake forks, to perform the stunts in the film. The 2000–2002 television series ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'' had the main character Max Guevara, played by [[Jessica Alba]], as a bicycle messenger at a courier service named Jam Pony. The show took place in a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[Seattle]] where motorized transportation was costly and therefore couriers were more prevalent and bicycle messengers were seen as a prominent position.
The 2012 film ''[[Premium Rush]]'', starring [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], is also set in the world of bike messengers. In the TV show ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]'', [[Patrick J. Adams]] often has flashback scenes to previous job as a bike messenger. The main character of the game [[inFAMOUS]] is also a bike messenger who possesses amazing skills in parkour and urban-exploration.

News media have made portrayals of messengers ranging from innocuous urban libertines to reckless, cliquish [[Nihilism|nihilists]]. The latter portrayal is often sparked by local incidents involving bike messengers in collisions with other road-users or run-ins with authority figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.governing.com/archive/1999/jun/bike.txt | work=[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]] | title=Messenger mayhem | first=Charles | last=Mahtesian | accessdate=2009-01-13 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents also occasionally lead to proposals for, and dispute over, new ordinances and regulations on messengers and messengering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Messengers don't like Council's signals | work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19990908messenger1.asp | accessdate=2007-09-19 |date=1999-09-08 | first=Timothy | last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/seslaw98/sl980302.htm | title=An Ordinance Concerning The Registration Of Commercial Bicycle Services And The Licensing Of Commercial Messengers | publisher=Government of Massachusetts | accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===
The influence of bicycle messengers can be seen in urban fashion, most notably the popularity of single-strap messenger bags, which are a common accessory among people who do not ride a bicycle regularly. The rise in popularity of [[fixed-gear]] bicycles in the mid-2000s, complete with affectations such as [[spoke card]]s (gathered from "[[Alleycat races|alleycats]]" typically), is attributed to bicycle messengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Singel | last=Ryan | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | title=Fixed-Gear Bikes an Urban Fixture | url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/04/67149 | accessdate=2009-01-18 | date=2005-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090123222218/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/04/67149| archivedate= 23 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events===
Since 1993, [[Cycle Messenger World Championships]], CMWCs, have taken place at national, continental and world levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.messengers.org/events/ | title=CYCLE MESSENGER WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS Event Listings | author=IFBMA | publisher=IFBMA | accessdate=2009-01-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223112635/http://www.messengers.org/events/ | archivedate=2008-12-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events are held as much for fun and messenger networking as for competition. Bicycle messengers also take part in formal cycle competitions at all levels, and in all disciplines. [[Nelson Vails]], silver medalist on the velodrome in the 1984 Olympics, worked as a bicycle messenger in [[New York City]] in the early 1980s. Ivonne Kraft, who competed in the [[Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's cross-country|2004 Olympic cross country mountain bike race]], is a multiple former Cycle Messenger World Champion, and worked as a bicycle messenger in Germany for a number of years.

'''Brian Douglas Wilson''' (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded [[&lt;!-- DO NOT CAPITALIZE --&gt;the Beach Boys]]. After signing with [[Capitol Records]] in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen [[Top 40]] hits for the group.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=34–150}} In addition to his lifelong struggles with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], Wilson is known for his unorthodox [[Musicianship of Brian Wilson|approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques]]. He is often [[Brian Wilson is a genius|referred to as a "genius"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Wilson (writer)|title=The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson: America's Mozart?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150608-is-this-americas-mozart|publisher=BBC|date=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely acknowledged as one of the most [[Cultural impact of the Beach Boys|innovative and significant]] songwriters of the late 20th century.&lt;ref name="conversation2015"/&gt;

The Beach Boys were formed by Wilson with his brothers [[Carl Wilson|Carl]] and [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and friend [[Al Jardine]]. Brian, who grew up influenced by 1950s [[rock and roll]] and [[jazz]]-based vocal groups, originally functioned as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. In 1965, he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and stopped touring with the group, which led to more personal work such as ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966) and the unfinished ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''. As his mental health deteriorated, his contributions to the band diminished, and over the next decade, he was reputed for his reclusive lifestyle and [[substance abuse]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198, 277}} Following a court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist [[Eugene Landy]], Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment, and in the late 1990s, he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist. He remains a member of the Beach Boys' corporation, [[Brother Records|Brother Records Inc]].

Wilson was the first [[pop music|pop]] artist credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalfatovic|first=Martin R.|editor-last1=Browne|editor-first1=Ray Broadus|editor-last2=Browne|editor-first2=Pat|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-821-2|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered a major innovator in the field of [[music production]],{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=16}} the principal originator of the [[California Sound]],{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=50–51, 57}} one of the first [[music auteur|music producer auteurs]],{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} and the first rock producer to [[Recording studio as an instrument|use the studio as its own instrument]].{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|p=33}} The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his own records effectively set a precedent that allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or co-producers. Wilson's success also led to a proliferation of like-minded California producers who helped supplant New York as the center of popular records.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=54}} The zeitgeist of the early 1960s is commonly associated to his early songs,&lt;ref name="Davis1990"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Erik|title=Look!

==Biography==

===1942–1962: Early years and Performances===
[[File:Brian Wilson 1960 yearbook.png|thumb|upright|left|Wilson's senior yearbook photo, 1960]]

Brian Douglas Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, at Centinela Hospital in [[Inglewood, California]], the eldest son of Audree Neva (''née'' Korthof) and [[Murry Wilson]], a musician and machinist.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=40}} His two younger brothers were [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson|Carl]]. He has Dutch, English, German, Irish, and Swedish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Thomas Meggison |url=http://www.americanancestors.org/ancestry-beach-boys/ |title=#71 Royal Descents, Notable Kin, and Printed Sources: The Immediate New England and Royal Ancestry of the Beach Boys |website=American Ancestors |publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823011549/http://www.americanancestors.org/ancestry-beach-boys/ |archive-date=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was two,{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=14}} the family moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby [[Hawthorne, California]].{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=14}} Speaking of Wilson's unusual musical abilities prior to his first birthday, his father said that, as a baby, he could repeat the melody from "When the Caissons Go Rolling Along" after only a few verses had been sung by the father. Murry Wilson said, "He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=11}} At about age two, Wilson heard [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which had an enormous emotional impact on him.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=10}} A few years later, he was discovered to have diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from him simply being born partially [[Hearing loss|deaf]] to a blow to the head from his father, or a neighborhood bully, being to blame.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=12}}

While Wilson's father was ostensibly a reasonable provider, he is believed to have been frequently abusive.{{editorializing|date=May 2018}} A minor musician and songwriter, Wilson's father encouraged his children in the music field in numerous ways. At an early age, Wilson was given six weeks of lessons on a "toy accordion" and, at seven and eight, sang solos in church with a choir behind him.{{sfn|Leaf|1978|pp=15–17}} At [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]], Wilson was on the [[American football|football team]] as a [[quarterback]], played baseball and was a cross-country runner in his senior year.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=15}} He sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home, teaching his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice. He also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of [[the Four Freshmen]] by listening to short segments of their songs on a [[phonograph]], then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=18}} He received a [[Wollensak]] [[tape recorder]] on his 16th birthday, allowing him to experiment with recording songs and early group vocals.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=14}}

One of Wilson's earliest public performances was at a fall arts program at his high school. He enlisted his cousin and frequent singing partner [[Mike Love]], and to entice Carl into the group, named the newly formed membership "Carl and the Passions." The performance featured tunes by [[Dion and the Belmonts]] and the Four Freshmen ("It's a Blue World"), the latter of which proved difficult for the ensemble. The event was notable for the impression which it made on another musician and classmate of Wilson's in the audience that night, [[Al Jardine]].  Jardine would join the three Wilson brothers and Mike Love a few years later in the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=24}}

Wilson enrolled at [[El Camino College]] in Los Angeles, majoring in psychology, in September 1960. He continued his music studies at the [[community college]] as well.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=15}} At some point in 1961 he wrote his first all-original melody, loosely based on a Dion and the Belmonts version of "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]". The song was eventually known as "[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]". Although an early demo of the song was recorded in February 1962 at World-Pacific Studios, it was not re-recorded and released until 1963, when it became a top-ten hit.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=27–31}}

Wilson, his brothers Carl and Dennis, Mike Love and Al Jardine first appeared as a music group in the summer of 1961, initially under the name the Pendletones. After being prodded by Dennis to write a song about the local water-sports craze, Wilson and Mike Love together created what became the  first single for the band, "[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]". Over Labor Day weekend 1961, Wilson took advantage of the fact that his parents were in Mexico City for several days, and the boys used the emergency money his parents had left to rent an amplifier, a microphone, and a stand-up bass for Jardine to play. After the boys rehearsed for two days in the Wilsons' music room, his parents returned home from their trip. Eventually impressed, Murry Wilson proclaimed himself the group's manager and the band embarked on serious rehearsals for a proper studio session.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=28–29}}

[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|right|Wilson (second-left) performing with the Beach Boys in [[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]] outfits at a local high school in late 1962]]

Recorded by Hite and Dorinda Morgan and released on the small [[Candix Records]] label, "Surfin'" became a top local hit in Los Angeles and reached number seventy-five on the national [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] sales charts.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=30–31}} Dennis later described the first time that his older brother heard their song on the radio, as the three Wilson brothers and [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]] drove in Wilson's 1957 Ford in the rain: "Nothing will ever top the expression on Brian's face, ever&amp;nbsp;... ''that'' was the all-time moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-beach-boys/bio/|title=The Beach Boys Biography &amp;#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=Rockhall.com|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danaddington.com/denny/quotes.html|title=Dennis Wilson: quotes|publisher=Danaddington.com|date=|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pendletones were no more. Without the band's knowledge or permission, Candix Records had changed their name to the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=16–17}} Wilson and his bandmates, following a set by [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]], performed their first major live show at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance on New Year's Eve, 1961. Three days previously, Wilson's father had bought him an electric bass and amplifier. Wilson had learned to play the instrument in that short period of time, with Al Jardine moving to rhythm guitar. On stage, Wilson provided many of the lead vocals, and often harmonized with the group in [[falsetto]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Looking for a follow-up single for their radio hit, Wilson and Mike Love wrote "[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]", and attempts were made to record a usable take at World Pacific, including overdubs, on February 8, 1962, along with several other tunes including an early version of "Surfer Girl". Only a few days later, discouraged about the band's financial prospects, and objecting to adding some [[Chubby Checker]] songs to the Beach Boys live setlist, Al Jardine abruptly left the group, but rejoined shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=20}} When Candix Records ran into money problems and sold the Beach Boys' master recordings to another label, Wilson's father terminated the contract. As "Surfin'" faded from the charts, Wilson, who had forged a songwriting partnership with [[Gary Usher]], created several new songs, including a car song, "[[409 (song)|409]]", that Usher helped them write. Wilson and the Beach Boys cut new tracks at [[United Western Recorders|Western Recorders]] including an updated "Surfin' Safari" and "409". These songs convinced Capitol Records to release the demos as a single; they became a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double-sided]] national hit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=22–23}}

===1962–1964: Success and record producing===
[[File:The Beach Boys TV (cropped Brian).jpg|thumb|right|Wilson performing on electric bass with the Beach Boys, 1964.]]
Recording sessions for the band's first album took place in [[Capitol Studios|Capitol's basement studios]] in the [[Capitol Records Building|famous tower building]] in August 1962, but early on Wilson lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boy tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Wilson's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights, and in return the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Wilson fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production – though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=26}}

In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, "[[Surfin' U.S.A.

It was during the sessions for this single that Wilson made the production decision from that point on to use [[double tracking]] on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=32}} The [[Surfin' U.S.A.|''Surfin' U.S.A.'' album]] was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=40}}

Wilson was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the ''[[Surfer Girl]]'' album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Wilson decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'', which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the ''Surfer Girl'' LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Wilson was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=39–42}}

For much of the decade, Wilson attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists. On July 20, 1963, "[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]", which he co-wrote with [[Jan Berry]] of [[Jan and Dean]], was his first composition to reach the top of the US charts. The resulting success pleased Wilson, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean. Wilson's other non-Beach Boy work in this period included tracks by [[the Castells]], [[Donna Loren]], Sharon Marie, the Timers, and the Survivors. The most notable group to which Wilson would attach himself in this era would be [[the Honeys]], which Wilson intended as the female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and as an attempt to compete with [[Phil Spector]]-led girl groups such as [[the Crystals]] and [[the Ronettes]].&lt;ref name=petp&gt;{{cite web|last=Vinnis|first=Rob|title=Pet Projects liner notes|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Pet_Projects.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued juggling between recording with the Beach Boys and producing records for other artists, but with less success at the latter—except for Jan and Dean.&lt;ref name="HimesSurf"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|title=Surf Music|url=http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|website=teachrock.org|publisher=Rock and Roll: An American History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125223127/http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|archivedate=November 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–1967: Artistic growth===

====Resignation from touring and changing scene ====
The Beach Boys' rigorous performing schedule increasingly burdened Wilson, and following a panic attack on board a flight from L.A. to Houston on December 23, 1964,&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; he stopped performing live with the group in an effort to concentrate solely on songwriting&lt;ref name="Riding a wave"&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin|last=Denselow|title=Feature: ''Riding a wave''|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|issue=September 1, 1976|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studio production.&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; Wilson explained in 1971: "I felt I had no choice.

It was during that December that Wilson was introduced to [[cannabis]] hesitantly by his friend Lorren Daro (formerly Loren Schwartz), an assistant at the [[William Morris Agency]].{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=87}} Attracted by the drug's ability to alleviate stress and inspire creativity, Wilson completed the Beach Boys' forthcoming ''[[The Beach Boys Today!|Today!]]'' album by late January 1965 and quickly began work on their next, ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)|Summer Days]]''. Sometime in April, Wilson experienced his first [[acid trip]], which had a profound effect on his musical and spiritual conceptions.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=136}} Again, Daro was hesitant to provide drugs to Wilson, which he did not feel he was ready for, but has recounted that his dosage was "one hundred and twenty-five [[Microgram|mics]] of pure [[Owsley Stanley|Owsley]]," and that "he had the full-on [[ego death]]. It was a beautiful thing."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=174–175}} The music for "[[California Girls]]" came from this first LSD experience, a composition which would later be released as a #3 charting single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title='California Girls' The Beach Boys|pages=F-4|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=August 12, 2007|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/12/entertainment/ca-socalsong12|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson continued experimenting with [[psychotropics]] for the next few years, sometimes even during recording sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=276}} He became fixated on [[psychedelia]], claiming to have coined a slang, "psychedelicate,"{{sfn|Siegel|1967}} and foreseeing that "[[psychedelic music]] will cover the face of the world and color the whole popular music scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Van Dyke|title=IN RESPONSE TO: A Lost Pop Symphony from the September 22, 2005 issue|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/jan/12/smile/|work=The New York Review of Books|publisher=nybooks.com|date=January 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after his first LSD trip, Wilson began suffering from [[auditory hallucination]]s, which have persisted throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Ability"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Brian Wilson – A Powerful Interview|magazine=Ability|year=2006|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/past/brianW/brianw.html|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Pet Sounds'', "genius" promotion, and ''Smile''====
{{Main|Pet Sounds|Smile (The Beach Boys album)}}
[[File:Brian Wilson 1966.png|thumb|right|Wilson in 1966]]
In late 1965, Wilson began working on material for a new project, ''[[Pet Sounds]]''. He formed a temporary songwriting partnership with lyricist [[Tony Asher]], who was suggested to Wilson by mutual friend Daro.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=194}} Wilson, who had recorded the album's instrumentation with [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]], then assembled the Beach Boys to record vocal [[overdub]]s, following their return from a tour of Japan. Upon hearing what Wilson had created for the first time in 1965,&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; the group, particularly [[Mike Love]], was somewhat critical of their leader's music,&lt;ref name="A Boy's own story"/&gt; and expressed their dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; At this time, Wilson still had considerable control within the group and, according to Wilson, they eventually overcame their initial negative reaction, as his newly created music began to near completion.&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; The album was released May 16, 1966, and, despite modest sales figures at the time, has since become widely critically acclaimed, often being cited among the all-time greatest albums. Although the record was issued under the group's name, ''Pet Sounds'' is arguably seen as a Brian Wilson solo album. Wilson even toyed with the idea by releasing "[[Caroline, No]]" as a solo single in March 1966, it reaching number 32 on the ''Billboard'' charts.&lt;ref name="Pet Sounds Billboard Singles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: ''Pet Sounds, Charts &amp; Awards, Billboard Singles''|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1420|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision Corporation]] |accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}

During the ''Pet Sounds'' sessions, Wilson had been working on another song, which was held back from inclusion on the record as he felt that it was not sufficiently complete. The song "[[Good Vibrations]]" set a new standard for musicians and for what could be achieved in the recording studio. Recorded in multiple sessions and in numerous studios, the song eventually cost $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1966|fmt=eq}}) to record within a six-month period.&lt;ref name="The nutty producers"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|title=Feature: ''The nutty producers''|newspaper=[[The Guardian#G2|G2]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=December 16, 1999|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1966, it was released as a single, giving the Beach Boys their third US number-one hit after "[[I Get Around]]" and "[[Help Me, Rhonda]]". It sold over a million copies.

Sometime after ''Pet Sounds'' was released, the Beatles' press agent [[Derek Taylor]] started working as a publicist for the Beach Boys. He gradually became aware of Wilson's reputation as a "genius" among musician friends, a belief that wasn't widely held at the time.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}} Motivated by Wilson's musical merits, Taylor responded with a campaign that would reestablish the band's outdated surfing image, and was the first to tout Wilson as a "genius".{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}}{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63–64}} According to Van Dyke Parks, this was "much to Brian's embarrassment".{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63–64}}

By the time of the universal success of "Good Vibrations", Wilson was underway with his next project, ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', which Wilson described as a "teenage symphony to God." "Good Vibrations" had been recorded in modular style, with separately written sections individually tracked and spliced together, and Wilson's concept for the new album was more of the same, representing a departure from the standard live-taped performances typical of studio recordings at that time. Having been introduced to [[Van Dyke Parks]] at a garden party at [[Terry Melcher]]'s home, Wilson liked Parks' "visionary eloquence" and began working with him in the fall of 1966.&lt;ref name="The unknown surfer"&gt;{{cite news|author=Hodgkinson, Will|title=Feature: ''The unknown surfer''|work=Friday Review|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=December 10, 1999|pages=16–17|authorlink=Will Hodgkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Wilson famously installed a sandbox and tent in his living room, the pair collaborated closely on several ''Smile'' tracks. Conflict within the group and Wilson's own growing personal problems threw the project into [[Collapse of Smile|terminal disarray]]. Originally scheduled for release in January 1967, the release date was continually pushed back until press officer [[Derek Taylor]] announced its cancellation in May 1967.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===1967–1975: Career decline===
====Home studio, institutionalization, and reduced band involvement====

{{Quote box |align=right |salign = left |quote=We pulled out of that production pace, really because I was about ready to die. I was trying so hard. So, all of a sudden I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things, such big musical things. And we had so much fun.

I didn't have any paranoia feelings. |source=—Brian Wilson, January 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Highwater|first=Jamake|title=Rock and other four letter words; music of the electric generation.|year=1968|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0552043346}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width  = 25%}}

By 1967, Wilson's life was on the verge of a serious decline. Following the cancellation of ''Smile'', the Beach Boys relocated to a studio situated in the living room of Wilson's new mansion in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] (once the home of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}), where the band would primarily record until 1972. This has been perceived by some commentators as "the moment when the Beach Boys first started slipping from the vanguard to nostalgia."&lt;ref name="AC interview"&gt;{{cite web |first=Greg|last=Beets |title=Review: ''Pet Sounds: Fifteen Minutes With Brian Wilson''|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:77984|date=July 21, 2000|publisher=Nick Barbaro |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jonathan Perry Stern |year=2012 |page=106 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4O5qzMV2kKcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;f=false Retrieved April 12, 2018.] |title=Memoirs of a Bipolar Ex-Podiatrist |publisher=Dorrance Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout mid-to-late 1967, Wilson oversaw the production of only a few heavily orchestrated songs holding continuity with his ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile'' work, such as "[[Can't Wait Too Long]]" and "[[Time to Get Alone]]". Wilson's interest in the Beach Boys began to wane. Carl explained: "When we did ''Wild Honey'', Brian asked me to get more involved in the recording end. He wanted a break. He was tired. He had been doing it all too long."&lt;ref name="MF1976" /&gt;

Still psychologically overwhelmed by the cancellation of ''Smile'' and the imminent birth of his first child [[Carnie Wilson]] in 1968 amid the looming financial insolvency of the Beach Boys, Wilson's creative directorship within the band became increasingly tenuous; additionally, [[cocaine]] had begun to supplement Wilson's regular use of amphetamines, marijuana, and psychedelics.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=139}} Shortly after abandoning an intricate arrangement of Kern and Hammerstein's "Ol' Man River" at the instigation of Mike Love,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=139, 141}} Wilson entered a [[psychiatric hospital]] for a brief period of time. Biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] has speculated that Wilson had self-admitted and may have been administered a number of treatments ranging from [[talking therapies]] to doses of [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] and [[electroconvulsive therapy]] during this stay.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=141}}

In his absence, 1969's ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' consisted substantially of key ''Smile'' outtakes ("[[Cabinessence]]" and "[[Our Prayer]]") along with the long-germinating "Time to Get Alone". The album's lead track, the Wilson/Love-authored "[[Do It Again (Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]", was an unabashed throwback to the band's earlier surf hits, and had been an international hit in the summer of 1968, reaching number 20 in the US charts and number 1 in the UK and Australia while also scoring well in other countries. During this phase, Wilson also collaborated with his father (credited under the pseudonym of Reggie Dunbar) on "[[Break Away (The Beach Boys song)|Break Away]]", the band's final single for Capitol Records under their original contract; although relatively unsuccessful in the US (peaking at number 63 in ''Billboard''), the song reached number 6 on the British singles chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

At a press conference ostensibly convened to promote "Break Away" to the European media shortly thereafter, Wilson intimated that "We owe everyone money. And if we don't pick ourselves off our backsides and have a hit record soon, we will be in worse trouble&amp;nbsp;... I've always said, 'Be honest with your fans.' I don't see why I should lie and say that everything is rosy when it's not." These incendiary remarks ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with [[Deutsche Grammophon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=149}} Although Murry Wilson's sale of the [[Sea of Tunes]] publishing company (including the majority of Wilson's oeuvre) to [[A&amp;M Records]]' publishing division for $700,000 at the band's commercial nadir in 1969 renewed the longstanding animus{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=169}} between father and son, the younger Wilson stood in for Mike Love during a 1970 Northwest tour when Love was convalescing from illness. He also resumed writing and recording with the Beach Boys at a brisk pace; seven of the twelve new songs on the 1970 album ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' were either written or co-written by Wilson. Nevertheless, the album (retrospectively appraised as "perhaps the strongest album they released post-''Pet Sounds''" by [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11665-sunflowersurfs-up/|title=The Beach Boys: Sunflower/Surf's Up Album Review|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a commercial failure in the US, peaking at number 151 during a four-week ''Billboard'' chart stay in October 1970. Following the termination of the Capitol contract in 1969, the band's new contract with then-au courant [[Reprise Records]] (brokered by Van Dyke Parks, employed as a multimedia executive at the company at the time) stipulated Wilson's proactive involvement with the band in all albums,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=150}} a factor that would become hugely problematic for the band in the years to come.

Sometime in 1969, Wilson opened a short-lived [[health food store]] called [[The Radiant Radish]].&lt;ref name="Nolan1971"/&gt; The store closed in 1971 due to unprofitable produce expenditures and Wilson's general lack of business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hind|first=John|title=This much I know – Brian Wilson, musician, 66, London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/24/popandrock|accessdate=June 28, 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from this era detailed Wilson as "increasingly withdrawn, brooding, hermitic&amp;nbsp;... and occasionally, he is to be seen in the back of some limousine, cruising around Hollywood, bleary and unshaven, huddled way tight into himself."{{sfn|Cohn|1970|pp=103–104}} This notion was contested by lyricist and close friend Stanley Shapiro.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=172}} Nevertheless, Wilson's reputation suffered as a result of his purported eccentricities, and he quickly became known as a commercial has-been whom record labels feared.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=172}} When Shapiro persuaded Wilson to rewrite and rerecord a number of Beach Boys songs in order to reclaim his legacy, he contacted fellow songwriter [[Tandyn Almer]] (whom Wilson would later characterize as his "best friend")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carlindustries.com/happy-birthday-brian-wilson-an-extra-bonus-interview-with-a-man-made-for-all-times/|title=Happy Birthday, Brian Wilson!: An extra-bonus interview with a man made for all times.|website=carlindustries.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for support. The trio then spent a month reworking cuts from the Beach Boys' ''Friends'' album.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=172–173}} As Shapiro handed demo tapes to [[A&amp;M Records]] executives, they found the product favorable before they learned of Wilson and Almer's involvement, and proceeded to veto the idea.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=173}}{{refn|group=nb|Wilson's close friendship with Almer reportedly deteriorated by early 1972 due to a variety of factors, including an alleged liaison between Almer and [[Marilyn Wilson]] and the purported theft of recording equipment from Wilson's home studio.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=250}}}} Wilson commented in 1976:

{{quote|Once you've been labeled as a genius, you have to continue it or your name becomes mud. I am a victim of the recording industry. I didn't think I was a genius. I thought I had talent. But I didn't think I was a genius.&lt;ref name="MF1976"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Beach Boys|magazine=Music Favorites|volume=1|issue=2|date=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson amassed myriad home demo recordings which later became informally known as the "[[Bedroom Tapes]]".&lt;ref name=Bedroom2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Chidester|first=Brian|title=Brian Wilson's Secret Bedroom Tapes|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2014-01-30/music/brian-wilsons-secret-bedroom-tapes/|accessdate=February 1, 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material has been described as "schizophrenia on tape," and "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state."&lt;ref name=Bedroom2014/&gt; Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of [[syncopation|syncopated exercises]] and [[counterpoint]]s piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping [[Swing (jazz performance style)|shuffle grooves]]. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' '[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]' and all throughout ''Smile'', but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s."&lt;ref name=Bedroom2014/&gt; Wilson's daughter [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] remembers, "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song."&lt;ref name=IJWMFTT&gt;''[[I Just Wasn't Made For These Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister Carnie has recounted: "My memories of him are him wandering from room to room&amp;nbsp;... thinking about ''something''.

While working at the Radiant Radish, Wilson met journalist and radio presenter [[Jack Rieley]], who would manage the Beach Boys and act as Wilson's principal lyricist for the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunflower/Surf's Up 2000 liner notes|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Sunflower_Surf_s_Up.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson played and sang on much of the 1971 ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'' album—the band's highest American album chart placement (No. 29) since 1967—and wrote or co-wrote four of the album's ten songs, including the title track. However, only one fully formed original song from Wilson emerged during the album's nominal recording sessions, the dirge-like "[[A Day in the Life of a Tree]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs71.html|title=GIGS71|publisher=Esquarterly.com|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to engineer [[Stephen Desper]], the cumulatively deleterious effects of Wilson's cocaine and tobacco use began to affect his vocal register in earnest during the ''Surf's Up ''sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=160}}

[[File:The Beach Boys 1971 Central Park.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The Beach Boys performing in the early 1970s without Wilson]]

In late 1971 and early 1972, he worked on an album for the [[American Spring]], titled ''[[Spring (American Spring album)|Spring]]'', a new collaboration between erstwhile Honeys Marilyn Wilson and Diane Rovell. He was closely involved in the home-based recordings with co-producer David Sandler and engineer Stephen Desper, and did significant work on more than half of the tracks. As with much of his work in the era, his contributions "ebbed and flowed."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=176}} According to [[Dan Peek]] of [[America (band)|America]], Wilson "held court like a Mad King as [longtime friend] [[Danny Hutton]] scurried about like his court jester" during the ascendant band's engagement at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in February 1972.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=168}} Concurrently, he contributed to three out of eight songs on Beach Boys' ''[[Carl and the Passions – "So Tough"]]'' (1972).

Later that year, he reluctantly agreed to accompany the band to the Netherlands, where they based themselves to record ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]''. Although physically present, he often yielded to his vices (primarily hashish and [[hard cider]]) and rarely participated, confining himself to work on "Funky Pretty" (a collaboration with Mike Love and Jack Rieley); a one-line sung intro to Al Jardine's "[[California Saga: California]]"; and ''Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)'', a narrative suite musically inspired by [[Randy Newman]]'s [[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|''Sail Away'']] that was promptly rejected by the band. However, Carl Wilson ultimately capitulated and ensured that the suite would be released as a bonus EP with the album.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 182}} When the album itself was rejected by Reprise, the song "[[Sail On, Sailor]]"—a collaboration with Van Dyke Parks dating from 1971 that had grown to encompass additional lyrical contributions solicited by Wilson at parties hosted by Hutton—was inserted at the instigation of Parks and released as the lead single.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 184}} It promptly garnered a considerable amount of [[FM radio]] play, became a minor chart hit, and entered the band's live sets as a concert staple.

In 1973, Jan Berry (under the alias JAN) released the single "[[Don't You Just Know It]]", a duet featuring Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discography 1970s|url=http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/main/index.php/disc/disc1970s|website=jananddean-janberry.com|accessdate=October 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123021334/http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/main/index.php/disc/disc1970s|archive-date=November 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson spent a great deal of the two years following his father's June 1973 death, [[Seclusion|secluded]] in the chauffeur's quarters of his home; sleeping, [[alcohol abuse|abusing alcohol]], taking drugs (including heroin), overeating, and exhibiting [[self-destructive behavior]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} He attempted to drive his vehicle off a cliff, and at another time, demanded that he would be pushed into and buried in a grave that he had dug in his backyard.&lt;ref name=Bedroom2014 /&gt; During this period, his voice deteriorated significantly as a result of his mass consumption of cocaine and incessant [[chain smoking]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=180}} Wilson later said that he was preoccupied with "[doing] drugs and hanging out with Danny Hutton" (whose house became the center of Wilson's social life) during the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=265}} [[John Sebastian]] often showed up at Wilson's Bel Air home "to jam" and later recalled that "it wasn't all grimness."{{sfn|Dillon|2012}} Although increasingly [[Recluse|reclusive]] during the day, Wilson spent many nights at Hutton's house fraternizing with [[the Hollywood Vampires|Hollywood Vampire]] colleagues, such as [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Iggy Pop]], who were mutually bemused by an extended Wilson-led singalong of the folk song "[[Shortnin' Bread#The Beach Boys|Shortnin' Bread]]"; other visitors of Hutton's home included Vampires [[Harry Nilsson]], [[John Lennon]], [[Ringo Starr]], and [[Keith Moon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=172}} [[Micky Dolenz]] recalls taking LSD with Wilson, Lennon, and Nilsson, where Wilson "played just one note on a piano over and over again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolenz|first1=Micky|last2=Bego|first2=Mark|title=I'm a Believer|date=2004|publisher=Cooper Square Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-81541-284-7|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions, Marilyn Wilson sent her friends to climb Hutton's fence and retrieve her husband.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=265}}

[[Jimmy Webb]] reported Wilson's presence at an August 2, 1974 session for Nilsson's "[[Duit on Mon Dei|Salmon Falls]]"; he kept in the back of the studio playing "[[Da Doo Ron Ron]]" haphazardly on a [[Hammond organ|B3 organ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shipton|first1=Alyn|title=Nilsson: The Life of a Singer-Songwriter|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19975-657-5|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, he was photographed at Moon's 28th birthday party (held on August 28 at the [[Beverly Wilshire Hotel]]) wearing only his bathrobe. Sometime in 1974, Wilson interrupted a set by jazz musician [[Larry Coryell]] at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] by leaping onto stage and singing "[[Be-Bop-A-Lula]]", again wearing slippers and a bathrobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Brian's Back|magazine=Newsweek|date=July 19, 1976|page=79|url=http://i1188.photobucket.com/albums/z405/smayo1953/scan6.jpg|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During summer 1974, the Capitol Records-era greatest hits compilation ''[[Endless Summer (The Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'' reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' charts, reaffirming the relevance of the Beach Boys in the popular imagination. However, recording sessions for a new album under the supervision of Wilson and [[James William Guercio]] at [[Caribou Ranch]] and the band's studio in Santa Monica that autumn yielded only a smattering of basic tracks, including a banjo-driven arrangement of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]"; "[[It's O.K. (The Beach Boys song)|It's O.K.]]", an uptempo collaboration with Mike Love; the ballad "[[Good Timin' (The Beach Boys song)|Good Timin']]"; and Dennis Wilson's "[[River Song (Dennis Wilson song)|River Song]]".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=194–195}} Eventually, Wilson diverted his attentions to "[[Child of Winter (Christmas Song)|Child of Winter]]", a Christmas single co-written with [[Stephen Kalinich]]; released belatedly for the holiday market on December 23, it failed to chart.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=195}}

Although still under contract with Warner Brothers Records, Wilson signed a sideline production deal with Bruce Johnston and [[Terry Melcher]]'s Equinox Records in early 1975. Together, they founded the loose-knit supergroup known as [[California Music]], which involved them along with L.A. musicians [[Gary Usher]], [[Curt Boettcher]], and a few others.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} This contract was nullified by the Beach Boys' management, who perceived it as an attempt by Wilson to relieve the burden of his growing drug expenses, and it was demanded that Wilson focus his efforts on the Beach Boys, even though he strongly desired to escape from the group.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} The idea of California Music immediately disintegrated.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}}

====First treatment====
Marilyn and the Wilson family were dismayed by Wilson's continued deterioration and were reluctant to payroll him as an active partner in the touring Beach Boys, an arrangement that had persisted for a decade. They enlisted the services of radical therapist [[Eugene Landy]] in October 1975.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198–199}} Landy diagnosed him as paranoid schizophrenic (a diagnosis later retracted), and the treatment prompted Wilson to become more stable and socially engaged, and his productivity increased again.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=200}} The tagline "Brian's Back!" became a major promotional tool for the new Beach Boys album ''[[15 Big Ones]]'', released to coincide with their fifteenth anniversary as a band as a mixture of traditional pop covers with newly written original material. The record was released in the summer of 1976 to commercial acclaim and, despite lukewarm reviews, peaked at number 8 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. Wilson returned to regular stage appearances with the band, alternating between piano and bass, and made a solo appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in November 1976; to the chagrin of the other Beach Boys, producer [[Lorne Michaels]] stipulated an exclusive performance from Wilson.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=215}}

[[File:Brian Wilson 1976 crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wilson at a ''[[15 Big Ones]]'' session, circa 1976]]

Wilson's behavior during this time was reported by many to be strange and off-putting, and Landy's role was described as "unethical" and ostentatious.&lt;ref name="songwriter1969"/&gt; Oftentimes, Wilson would ask for drugs in mid-interview.&lt;ref name="Felton1976"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Felton|first=David|title=The Healing of Brother Brian|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=November 4, 1976|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-healing-of-brother-brian-the-rolling-stone-interview-with-the-beach-boys-19761104|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oui&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Rensin|first1=David|title=A Conversation With Brian Wilson|magazine=Oui|date=December 1976|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/a-conversation-with-brian-wilson|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AstonishingGenius2011"/&gt; During this period, Wilson was under constant surveillance by bodyguards, which he resented.&lt;ref name=Oui/&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' editor David Felton chronicled bizarre exchanges between Wilson and Landy in "The Healing of Brother Brian", a profile of the resurgent band published by the magazine in November 1976; these included a report of Landy's medical staff promising Wilson a cheeseburger in exchange for writing a new song.&lt;ref name="Felton1976"/&gt;

Wilson expressed a fervent desire to leave the group and record a solo album in this period but could not, due to conflicts that it would create between him and the group, leading him to remark, "Sometimes I feel like a commodity in a stock market." He was also firm in that he wanted to record another work on par with the achievement of ''Pet Sounds''.&lt;ref name=Oui/&gt; In April 1977, the all-original album by Wilson, ''[[Love You (The Beach Boys album)|Love You]]'', was released bearing the Beach Boys moniker, although the group's contributions were minimal. It was described by Wilson as an attempt to relieve himself from mental instability brought on by a period of inactivity.&lt;ref name=RS1977&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Snyder|first=Patrick|title=Brian Wilson surfs out of nowheresville|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=March 10, 1977|url=http://troun.tripod.com/rsbriannowhere.html|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Love You'' has since been cited as an early work of [[synthpop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/the-beach-boys/id562555|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|title=The Beach Boys Biography|accessdate=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features playful lyrics (alternately invoking [[Johnny Carson]], [[Phil Spector]], and adolescent interests) and stark instrumentation (featuring [[Moog bass]] lines and [[gated reverb]]-drenched drum patterns reflective of contemporaneous work by [[David Bowie]] and [[Tony Visconti]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Although ''Love You'' only reached number 53 on the ''Billboard'' chart, it was lauded as an artistic watershed by many critics, including [[punk rock]] lodestar [[Patti Smith]] (writing for ''[[Hit Parader]]'') and [[Robert Christgau]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Beach+Boys|title=CG: The Beach Boys|publisher=Robert Christgau|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/patti_smiths_review_of_the_beach_boys_love_you|title=Patti Smith’s review of ‘The Beach Boys Love You’|date=September 2, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson was under Landy's care for fourteen months until December 1976, when the therapist was dismissed for a dispute on his monthly fee.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; Throughout the next several years, Wilson vacillated between periods of relative stability (frequently joining the touring band on piano, bass and vocals and writing or co-writing eight of the twelve tracks on 1978's poorly received ''[[M.I.U. Album]]'') and resurgences of his addictions. During this period, Wilson and his wife, Marilyn, amicably divorced in 1979 due to the strain of his erratic behavior on their family.&lt;ref name="Carlin"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Carlin |first1=Peter Ames |year=1998 |title=Love and Mercy |magazine=People |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=69–73 |publisher= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly checked in and out of hospitals and continued to be plagued by incessant mood swings.

By 1982, he was immersed in debt, owing the government tens of thousands of dollars in back taxes.&lt;ref name="Goldberg1984"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Goldberg|first1=Michael|title=Dennis Wilson: The Beach Boy Who Went Overboard|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 7, 1984|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-beach-boy-who-went-overboard-19840607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second treatment====
After Wilson overdosed on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs, he once again employed Landy.  With this effort by Landy, a more radical program was undertaken to try to restore to Wilson's health.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/03/31/db3102.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/03/31/ixportal.html|title=Eugene Landy obituary|accessdate=April 16, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225202250/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F03%2F31%2Fdb3102.xml&amp;sSheet=%2Fportal%2F2006%2F03%2F31%2Fixportal.html|archivedate=February 25, 2008|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involved removing him from the Beach Boys on November 5, 1982 at the behest of Carl Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine,&lt;ref name="Goldberg1984"/&gt; in addition to isolating him from his family and friends in Hawaii as well as putting him on a rigorous diet and health regimen.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=243–244}} According to Carolyn Williams, Wilson refused to see Landy: "They told him that the only way that he could be a Beach Boy again, and the only way they would release his 1982 tour disbursement money, was if he would agree to see Dr. Landy. Brian started yelling that he didn't like Dr. Landy and that [Landy] was charging him $20,000 a month the last time. He was willing to see anybody to get the weight off, but he didn't want to see Landy. And they said, 'Well, no, you have to see Dr. Landy. That's the only way.'"&lt;ref name="Goldberg1984"/&gt; Landy described the program that he accorded Wilson in ''The Handbook of Innovative Psychotherapies'':

{{quote|The success of twenty-four-hour therapy rests on the extent to which the therapeutic team can exert control over every aspect of the patient's life. ...&amp;nbsp;[The goal is to] totally disrupt the privacy of [the] patient's [life], gaining complete control over every aspect of their physical, personal, social, and sexual environments.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=243}}}}

Coupled with long, extreme counseling sessions, this therapy was successful in bringing Wilson back to physical health, slimming down from {{convert|311|lb|kg}} to {{convert|185|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Wilson on the Beach Boys, Gershwin and his upcoming biopic|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2011/11/brian-wilson-on-biopic-the-beach-boys-gershwin|work=IFC|accessdate=August 28, 2013|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wilson's recovery consolidated, he rejoined the Beach Boys for [[Live Aid]] in 1985 and participated in the recording of the [[Steve Levine]]-produced album ''[[The Beach Boys (album)|The Beach Boys]]''. Wilson stopped working with the Beach Boys on a regular basis after the release of the album, largely due to the control that Landy exercised. Eventually, Landy's therapy technique created a [[Svengali]]-like environment for Wilson, controlling every movement in his life, including his musical direction.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=254–258}} In the mid 1980s, Landy stated, "I influence all of [Brian]'s thinking. I'm practically a member of the band&amp;nbsp;... [We're] partners in life."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=244, 256}} Wilson later responded to allegations with, "People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I'm in charge."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=257}}

Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually. When he requested more money, Carl Wilson was obliged to give away a quarter of Wilson's publishing royalties.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; In 1988, Wilson said that "Dr. Landy doesn't like me to be in touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Timothy|authorlink1=Timothy White (writer)|title=BACK FROM THE BOTTOM|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/magazine/back-from-the-bottom.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 26, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson signed to a solo record deal with [[Sire Records]] label boss [[Seymour Stein]] and variously worked with [[Andy Paley]], [[Russ Titelman]] and Landy's girlfriend as co-authors on the new material. Old friend and collaborator [[Gary Usher]] was a key participant in the early demo work for the album, though Landy later removed him from the project. After several years of genesis, Wilson released his debut solo album ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]''. His work may have been hampered by Landy's influence, since Landy insisted on controlling involvement in every aspect of Wilson's writing and recording and his lyrical influence is significant.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Despite the critical success of his debut solo album, rumors abounded that Wilson had either suffered a [[stroke]] or had been permanently disabled due to excessive drug use.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=271}} The actual problem was that Wilson, who had been prescribed massive amounts of [[psychotropic drugs]] by Landy's staff since 1983, had developed [[tardive dyskinesia]],{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=271, 280}} a neurological condition marked by involuntary, repetitive movements, that develops in about 20 percent of patients treated with [[anti-psychotic]] drugs for an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, R.A., Mulsant, B.

Archives of General Psychiatry, 52, 478–486.&lt;/ref&gt; During recording of the ''Brian Wilson'' album, engineering staff had observed what seemed to be "every pharmaceutical on the face of the earth," referring to the medicine bag Landy was using to store Wilson's prescription drugs.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=272}} Landy separated from Wilson in 1989, however, they remained business partners.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=269, 272}} Wilson's proposed second solo album under the direction of Landy, titled ''[[Sweet Insanity (album)|Sweet Insanity]]'', was rejected by Sire in 1990.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

An ostensible memoir, ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]'', was published in 1991. In the book, whose authorship is still debated, Wilson spoke about his troubled relationship with his abusive father Murry, his private disputes with the Beach Boys and his lost years of mental illness.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=270, 272–273}} Landy's illegal use of psychotropic drugs on Wilson, and his influence over Wilson's financial affairs, were legally ended by his brother Carl and other members of the Wilson family after a two-year-long conservatorship battle in Los Angeles. Landy's misconduct resulted in the loss of his license to practice in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120051,00.html |title=Brian Wilson's Svengali Has His Wings Clipped |magazine=People |volume=31 |issue=15 |date=April 17, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a court-ordered removal and restraining order from Wilson.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/107279|title=The Strange Life of Brian|publisher=Newsweek.com|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborations and unfinished projects====
{{Further|Andy Paley sessions}}

Wilson released two albums simultaneously in 1995. The first was the [[I Just Wasn't Made for These Times|soundtrack]] to [[Don Was]]'s documentary ''[[Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times|I Just Wasn't Made for These Times]]'', which consisted of new versions of several Beach Boys and solo songs. The second, ''[[Orange Crate Art]]'', saw Wilson as lead vocalist on an album produced, arranged and written by [[Van Dyke Parks]]. ''I Just Wasn't Made for These Times'' includes Wilson performing for the first time with his now-adult daughters, [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] and [[Carnie Wilson|Carnie]] of the group [[Wilson Phillips]] and Van Dyke Parks. During the early 1990s, he also worked on some tracks with [[power pop]] band [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]], which remain unreleased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Justin|title=Rocky Mountain News|url=http://zenandjuice.com/music/jellyfish/text/rocky-070993.txt|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Rocky Mountain News|date=July 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Joseph Manning, Jr.|Roger Manning]] has recounted an anecdote during these sessions involving Wilson falling asleep at the piano yet continuing to play.&lt;ref name="Atlantic City 2013" /&gt; Later in the decade, Wilson and his daughters Carnie and Wendy would release an album together, titled ''[[The Wilsons]]'' (1997). Also, around this time, Wilson sang backup vocals on [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s "[[California (Belinda Carlisle song)|California]]".

Having missed out on the Beach Boys' 27th studio album ''[[Summer in Paradise]]'', Wilson returned to the Beach Boys for [[Andy Paley sessions|sporadic recording sessions and live performances during the early to mid-1990s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Back to the Beach|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296612,00.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Entertainment|date=March 31, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with collaborators Andy Paley and Don Was, the sessions were reported to have been tenuous. It had also been discussed that Wilson and the Beach Boys would work with [[Sean O'Hagan]] of [[the High Llamas]] on a comeback album for Wilson and the Beach Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stratton|first=Jeff|title=Bandwidth|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2000-10-26/music/bandwidth/|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Porward Palm Beach New Times|date=October 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; All projects collapsed, and instead, Wilson was involved with the 1996 Beach Boys album ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'': a group collaboration, backing country music artists singing lead vocals of Beach Boys' standards.

In 1998, he teamed with Chicago-based producer [[Joe Thomas (producer)|Joe Thomas]] for the album ''[[Imagination (Brian Wilson album)|Imagination]].'' Following this, he received extensive vocal coaching to improve his voice, learned to cope with his [[glossophobia|stage fright]], and started to consistently perform live for the first time in decades. This resulted in Wilson successfully performing the entire ''Pet Sounds'' album live throughout the US, UK and Europe. In 1999, Wilson filed a suit against Thomas, seeking damages and a declaration which freed him to work on his next album without involvement from Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bad Vibrations: Brian Wilson Sues Collaborator |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bad-vibrations-brian-wilson-sues-collaborator-19990824|work=Rolling Stone|date=August 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was made after Thomas allegedly began to raise his industry profile and wrongfully enrich himself through his association with Wilson. Thomas reciprocated with a suit citing that Melinda Wilson "schemed against and manipulated" him and Wilson. The case was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Wilson Settles Suit With Former Partner|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brian-wilson-settles-suit-with-former-partner-20000718|work=Rolling Stone|date=July 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's third solo album ''[[Gettin' In Over My Head]]'' (2004) featured collaborations with [[Elton John]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Eric Clapton]] and brother Carl, who died of [[lung cancer]] in February 1998.

====''Brian Wilson Presents Smile''====
{{Main|Brian Wilson Presents Smile}}
With his mental health on the mend, Wilson decided to revisit the aborted ''Smile'' project from 1967. Aided by musician and longtime fan [[Darian Sahanaja]] of Wondermints, and lyricist Van Dyke Parks, Wilson reimagined the session material into something that would work in a live context. His work was finally revealed in concert on February 20, 2004, 37 years after it was conceived, though he later stated that the finished product was substantially different from what was originally envisioned. Wilson debuted his 2004 interpretation of ''Smile'' at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London and subsequently toured the UK. Following the tour, ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile'' was recorded, and released in September 2004. The release hit number 13 on the [[Billboard chart|''Billboard'' chart]]. At the [[47th Grammy Awards]] in 2005, Wilson won his first Grammy for the track "[[The Elements: Fire|Mrs. O'Leary's Cow]]" as Best Rock Instrumental.

On September 30, 2008, Seattle's [[Light in the Attic Records]] released ''[[A World of Peace Must Come]]'', a collaboration between Wilson and [[Stephen Kalinich]], originally recorded in 1969, but later lost in Kalinich's closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Seattle Weekly|title=Stephen John Kalinich's LP With Brian Wilson Gets Rescued|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2008-10-08/music/finding-peace/|author=Brian J.

Around this time, Wilson announced that he was developing another concept album, titled ''Pleasure Island: A Rock Fantasy''. Accordingly: "It’s about some guys who took a hike, and they found a place called Pleasure Island. And they met all kinds of chicks, and they went on rides and — it’s just a concept. I haven’t developed it yet. I think people are going to love it — it could be the best thing I’ve ever done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Dylan|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Popular Music: From Adele to Ziggy, the Real A to Z of Rock and Pop|date=2012|isbn=978-1-25003-188-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album has yet to surface, and for several years, Wilson has consistently maintained in interviews that he wishes his "next album" to be more rock-oriented.

In summer 2009, Wilson signed a two-record deal with Disney after he was approached to record an album of his interpretations of Gershwin songs, and to assess unfinished piano pieces by Gershwin for possible expansion into finished songs.

Wilson's understanding of [[music theory]] was self-taught.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=112}} The first instrument he learned to play was a toy [[accordion]]{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=11}} before quickly moving to piano and then bass guitar.{{sfn|Zager|2011|pp=215–216}} From an early age, Wilson demonstrated an extraordinary skill for [[learning music by ear]] on keyboard.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=2, 8}} According to bassist [[Carol Kaye]], "He took bass up another step. He saw it as integral in a symphonic orchestra. He used bass as the framework for a hit record. Very few people can write for bass, but his writing was beautiful. There are a lot of jazz musicians who admire him for it."{{sfn|Dillon|2012}}

The work of record producer [[Phil Spector]], who popularized the [[Wall of Sound]], was a focal obsession for Wilson.&lt;ref name="A Boy's own story"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|title=Feature: ''A Boy's Own Story''|work=Review, [[The Observer]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=January 6, 2002|pages=1–3|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/jan/06/features.review87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Wilson thought of Spector as "the single most influential producer.

Wilson and Ledbetter reconnected in 1992 and married in 1995.&lt;ref name=Fine1999 /&gt; As of 1999, Melinda was acting as Brian's manager, a job which she said is "basically negotiating, and that's what I did every single day when I sold cars."&lt;ref name=Fine1999 /&gt; Wilson and Ledbetter adopted two sons, Dylan and Dash.

Wilson has six grandchildren.

He credited his relationship with his wife with allowing him to resume his career as a musician. In his own words, he said that he should have spent the early 2000s "in a mental institution under heavy sedation" due to the stresses of his condition, however, "Things have started to get a little bit easier, but I'm not always in a positive, happy place."&lt;ref name="freedom2007"/&gt;

He was odd and he seemed odder."{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=170}} In 2017, the ''[[Charlotte Observer]]''{{'}}s Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still "is faring well enough to write a book [''I Am Brian Wilson''] ... and to headline [a] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Janes|first1=Theodon|title=I’m pickin’ up bad vibrations from this interview with Beach Boy Brian Wilson|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article100338387.html|work=[[Charlotte Observer]]|date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether Wilson truly consents to his semi-regular touring schedule since the 2000s is a subject of debate among fans.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}}  In a 1999 ''[[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]]'' biography, Ledbetter stated: "We more or less decided that if he's going to stay in the music business, there's a certain way you stay in the music business, and it's not by making an album every ten years, and just throwing it out." Ginger Blake, a family friend formerly of the Honeys, characterized Wilson as "seemingly is in a fairly good place, but that's not the real Brian Wilson, that's the Brian Wilson who's become complacent and basically surrendered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|people=Neville, Morgan (Director)|date=1999|title=Brian Wilson: A Beach Boy's Tale|time=1:28:34|medium=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about negative comments written in Wilson's 2016 autobiography, Mike Love responded: "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know he has a lot of issues."&lt;ref name="fes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fessier|first1=Bruce|title=Beach Boys seek to overcome discord with new wave of Love|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/music/2016/11/16/beach-boys-seek-overcome-discord-new-wave-love/93977562/|work=[[The Desert Sun]]|date=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|In 2001, the High Llamas' Sean O'Hagan reported that Wilson was "not really responsible for his day-to-day life, he's totally dependent on other people. ...

In 2011, after speaking to some of Wilson's acquaintances, biographer [[Jon Stebbins]] speculated that "Working in the studio and especially touring is not really his choice. His handlers, managers, and wife insist that he work. It's all a bit Landy-like when you look behind the curtain." Although Wilson often says that he enjoys touring, Stebbins writes of a "recent interview [where he was asked] what he disliked the most about touring, Brian replied that it was going on stage and performing. ... Upon hearing Brian say that, his 'handler' quickly reminded Brian, through a fake smile, that he loved performing".{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}}

Wilson is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century,&lt;ref name="conversation2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Shei|first1=Tim|title=A conversation with Brian Wilson|url=http://buffalo.com/2015/10/06/featured/a-conversation-with-brian-wilson/|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his work is credited as a major innovation in the field of music production.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=16}} According to [[Erik Davis]], "Not only did [he] write a soundtrack to the early '60s, but Brian let loose a delicate and joyful [[art pop]] unique in music history and presaged the mellowness so fundamental to '70s California pop."&lt;ref name="Davis1990"/&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote that Wilson was among "studio rats&amp;nbsp;... [that] set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the [[flower power|Flower Power]] era: at once starry-eyed and wistful."&lt;ref name=AVSunshine/&gt; Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas named Wilson an important pioneer of [[experimental pop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Pederson |first1=Erik |title=What the World Needs Now: The New Easy Listening |magazine=Option |date=1997 |issue=77 |pages=62–67 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Wilson started incorporating quasi-symphonic textures into his work, many people began crediting him for propelling the mid-1960s [[art pop]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Holden |date=February 28, 1999 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-they-re-recording-but-are-they-artists.html |title=MUSIC; They're Recording, but Are They Artists? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin wrote that Wilson was the forerunner of "a new kind of [[art-rock]] that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carlin |first1=Peter Ames |authorlink=Peter Ames Carlin |title=MUSIC; A Rock Utopian Still Chasing An American Dream |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/arts/music-a-rock-utopian-still-chasing-an-american-dream.html |date=March 25, 2001 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also regarded as the most famous [[outsider music]]ian.{{sfn|Chusid|2000|p=xv}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vivinetto |first1=Gina |title=The bipolar poet |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/07/19/Floridian/The_bipolar_poet.shtml |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=July 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Irwin Chusid]] noted Wilson as an ironic example of the genre due to his past commercial success, but believes that Wilson's history of torment, substance abuse, and "loopy" material are what "certify" his outsider status.{{sfn|Chusid|2000|p=xv}}

As one of the first [[music auteur|music producer auteurs]], Wilson (along with [[George Martin]]) popularized the idea of the recording studio as a compositional tool{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} by using recording sessions as fertile creative terrain in and of themselves, a practice which was unheard of in his time and later shorthanded as "playing the studio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Seymour|first1=Corey|title=Love &amp; Mercy Does Justice to the Brilliance of Brian Wilson|magazine=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=June 5, 2015|url=http://www.vogue.com/13266664/love-and-mercy-brian-wilson/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 21 years old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, he ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records,{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=54}} and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument.{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|p=33}} The Beach Boys were thus one of the first rock groups to exert studio control.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}}

Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on Wilson's influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Jason Guriel credits ''Pet Sounds'' with inventing the modern pop album, that Wilson "paved the way for auteurs ... anticipat[ing] the rise of the producer ... [and] the modern pop-centric era, which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art. ... Anytime a band or musician disappears into a studio to contrive an album-length mystery, the ghost of Wilson is hovering near. ... [he was] the first to turn an album into an occasion."&lt;ref name="Guriel2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guriel|first1=Jason|title=How Pet Sounds Invented the Modern Pop Album|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/how-pet-sounds-invented-the-modern-pop-album/482940/|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, Wilson also started a trend of "project" recording, where an artist records by himself instead of going into an established studio.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9357">'''Charles Spencer Storms,''' known as '''Charlie Storms''' (1823-1881) was a professional [[gunfighter]] and [[gambler]] of the [[Old West]], who is best known for having been killed in a gunfight with [[Luke Short]] in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona]].

== Early life ==

Charlie Storms was born in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], as is shown by public records.&lt;ref&gt;1870 Federal Census for the First Precinct of the 7th Ward of the city of [[San Francisco]] (70 Minna street), at page 7, line 5, lists Charles Storms, aged 43, occupation gambler, as having been born in England; however, surviving voting lists for the period list him as Charles Spencer (or Spinner) Storms, born New York. Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; Storms was reported by the ''Tombstone Epitaph'' to have been in [[California]] during the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] of 1849,&lt;ref name="weekly"&gt;{{cite news|date=February 27, 1881 |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015133/1881-02-27/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=02%2F25%2F1881&amp;index=3&amp;date2=02%2F31%2F1887&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Luke+Short&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=Arizona&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=Luke+Short&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1 |publisher=Arizona Weekly Citizen | page= 3 |title=A Tombstone dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is corroborated by an entry in the 1852 California state census for the city of [[Sacramento]], that lists twenty-nine year old "Chas. S. Storms," a laborer born in New York who had last lived in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;California State Library; Sacramento, California; 1852 California State Census; Roll #: 3; Repository Collection #: C144:3; Page: 109; Line: 35. ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gambler and gunfighter ==

He had a reputation as being a skilled gunman during the 1870s and afterward, and traveled to many towns throughout the Old West as a gambler.&lt;ref name=legends/&gt; He drifted from place to place, including [[Deer Lodge, Montana|Deer Lodge]],&lt;ref&gt;1870 Federal census for Deer Lodge, Deer Lodge County, Montana Territory, p. 15, line 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]], [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]], [[Dodge City, Kansas]], [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], during which time he was involved in at least three shooting incidents. When [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was murdered by [[Jack McCall]] in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], Storms was reportedly in town at the same time, and it was rumored that he stole one of Hickok's pistols as a souvenir, although this was never proven.&lt;ref name=legends/&gt;

He left [[El Paso, Texas]] and arrived in Tombstone in 1881. He was a well-known gambler and frequented [[Western saloon|saloon]]s in town.&lt;ref name=legends&gt;[http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-gunfighterlist-s.html Charlie Storms]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fatal argument ==

On February 25,&amp;nbsp;1881, Storms had been drinking all night and made several rude remarks to [[faro (card game)|Faro]] dealer [[Luke Short]] in the Oriental Saloon. Storms had successfully defended himself several times with his pistol. He had inaccurately sized Short up as someone who, according to [[Bat Masterson]], he could "slap in the face without expecting a return." Masterson knew both men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ostrand|first1=Maggie Van|title=Luke Short, The Undertakers' Friend|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/MaggieVanOstrand/Luke-Short-The-Undertakers-Friend.htm|accessdate=26 March 2015|date=December 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dearment&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeArment|first1=Robert K.|title=Bat Masterson, the Man and the Legend|date=1989|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, Oklahoma|isbn=9780806170732|edition=First}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Charlie Storms was one of the best-known gamblers in the entire West and had, on several occasions, successfully defended himself in pistol fights with Western 'gunfighters...

Charlie Storms and I were very close friends, as much as Short and I were, and for that reason I did not care to see him get into what I knew would be a very serious difficulty. Storms did not know Short and, like the bad man in Leadville, had sized him up as an insignificant-looking fellow, whom he could slap in the face without expecting a return. Both were about to pull their pistols when I jumped between them and grabbed Storms, at the same time requesting Luke not to shoot, a request I knew he would respect if it was possible without endangering his own life too much. I had no trouble in getting Storms out of the house, as he knew me to be his friend. When Storms and I reached the street, I advised him to go to his room and take a sleep, for I then learned for the first time that he had been up all night, and had been quarreling with other persons...

I was just explaining to Luke that Storms was a very decent sort of man when, lo and behold! There he stood before us, without saying a word, at the same time pulling his pistol. Luke stuck the muzzle of his pistol against Storm's heart and pulled the trigger. The bullet tore the heart asunder and, as he was falling, Luke shot him again. Storms was dead when he hit the ground.}}

Short shot Storms in the chest twice at point-blank range, setting his shirt on fire.&lt;ref name=drwin&gt;{{cite book|last=Erwin|first=Richard E.|title=The Truth about Wyatt Earp|year=1993|publisher=O.K. Press|location=Carpinteria, CA|isbn=9780963393029|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short reportedly told Bat Masterson, "You sure pick some of the damnedest friends, Bat".&lt;ref name=legends/&gt;

Tombstone physician [[George E. Goodfellow]] was only a few feet from Storms when he was killed. "In the spring of 1881 I was a few feet distant from a couple of individuals &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Luke Short and Charlie Storms&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; who were quarreling. They began shooting. The first shot took effect, as was afterward ascertained, in the left breast of one of them, who, after being shot, and while staggering back some 12 feet, cocked and fired his pistol twice, his second shot going into the air, for by that time he was on his back."&lt;ref name=packer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/%E2%80%9Cit-don%E2%80%99t-hurt-much-ma%E2%80%99am%E2%80%9C |first=James |last=Packer| title=It Don’t Hurt Much, Ma’am|publisher=American Heritage|accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found two thicknesses of silk wrapped around the bullet and two tears where it had struck the vertebral column.&lt;ref name=oldwest&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. George Goodfellow |url=http://societyoftheoldwest.ning.com/forum/topics/dr-george-goodfellow |accessdate=8 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220090137/http://societyoftheoldwest.ning.com/forum/topics/dr-george-goodfellow |archivedate=20 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examining Storms afterward, Goodfellow found that he had been shot in the heart, but was surprised to see "not a drop of blood" exiting the wound. He discovered that the bullet had ripped through the man's clothes and into a folded [[silk]] handkerchief in his breast pocket. He extracted the intact bullet from the wound with the silk wrapped around it.&lt;ref name=prescott&gt;{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Edwards |title=George Goodfellow's Medical Treatment of Stomach Wounds Became Legendary |publisher=The Prescott Courier |date=May 2, 1980|pages=3–5 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19800502&amp;id=jH8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vkwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4536,249915}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of what he learned, Goodfellow began experimenting with the first designs for [[bulletproof|bullet-resistant]] clothing made of multiple layers of silk.&lt;ref name=hollington&gt;{{cite web |last=Hollington |first=Kris |title=Staying Alive |url=http://www.assassinology.org/id20.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503151128/http://www.assassinology.org/id20.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 May 2007 |accessdate=4 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short was arrested by Tombstone city Marshal [[Ben Sippy]] for killing Storms. During the preliminary hearing, Masterson testified that Short acted in  [[self defense]] and Short was released.&lt;ref name=prescott/&gt; The ''Arizona Weekly'' reported that Storms was around 60 years old and that he was survived by a widow in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="weekly"/&gt; The 1870 Census returns lists a Mrs. Mary Storms, aged 40, born at sea, residing in the same San Francisco household with Charles Storms, along with two brothers Henry and George Goodman, aged 24 and 16 respectively, who may have been her sons from an earlier marriage.&lt;ref&gt;1900 Federal Census for the 35th Assembly District, City and County of San Francisco Enumeration District 120, Sheet 6-B, Line 55, lists her as being born October 1820 in England, had emigrated to the United States in 1822, and that she was the mother of two children who were both deceased.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[San Francisco Call]] for November 26, 1903, at page 15 lists the death notice of "Mrs. Mary Storms," aged eighty four, who died on November 24 at the University Mound Ladies Home, an assisted care living facility for elderly women.&lt;ref&gt;(San Francisco) ''Call,'' vol. 94, no. 179, November 26, 1903, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christiaan Neethling Barnard''' (8 November 1922&amp;nbsp;– 2 September 2001) was a South African [[cardiothoracic surgery|cardiac surgeon]] who performed the world's first human-to-human [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]] on 3 December 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;ref name="S-Afr-Med-J-Barnard's-first-heart-transplant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt;  Growing up in [[Beaufort West]], [[Cape Province]], he studied medicine and practised for several years in his native country.&lt;ref name=New-York-Times-2001-obituary-Christiaan-Barnard/&gt;  As a young doctor experimenting on dogs, Barnard developed a remedy for the infant defect of [[intestinal atresia]].  His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States.&lt;ref name="Every Second Counts, pages 48-49, Barnard's work remedying intestinal atresia"/&gt;  In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by [[Owen Harding Wangensteen]].&lt;ref name="Every Second Counts, page 51"/&gt;  He was introduced to the heart-lung machine, and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer [[C. Walton Lillehei|Walt Lillehei]].&lt;ref name="Every Second Counts, page 53, Barnard meets Vince Gott"/&gt; Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at the [[Groote Schuur Hospital]], Cape Town.&lt;ref name=BMJ-Raymond-Hoffenberg-December-2001/&gt;

On 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted the heart of [[Denise Darvall]], who had just died from a head injury, into the chest of a 54-year-old [[Louis Washkansky]].  Washkansky regained full consciousness and lived for eighteen days, even spending time with his wife, before he died of pneumonia, with the suppression of his immune system by the anti-rejection drugs being a major contributing factor.&lt;ref name=New-York-Times-2001-obituary-Christiaan-Barnard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Science-Museum-patient-Louis-Washkansky/&gt;  Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, a claim which has been criticised as misleading.&lt;ref name="Calculated-Risks-Gerd-Gigerenzer-2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Companion-To-Bioethics-Second-Edition-2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnard stating to Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky 80% of success, in Every Second Counts, by Donald McRae"/&gt;

Barnard's second transplant patient [[Philip Blaiberg]], with the operation performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for nineteen months and was able to go home from the hospital.&lt;ref name=New-York-Times-2001-obituary-Christiaan-Barnard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chicago-Tribune-Philip-Blaiberg-1968/&gt;

He retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing [[rheumatoid arthritis]] in his hands which ended his surgical career. He became interested in anti-aging research, and in 1986 his reputation suffered when he promoted ''[[Glycel]]'', an expensive "anti-aging" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] soon thereafter. During his remaining years, he established the [[Christiaan Barnard Foundation]], dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world. He died in 2001 at the age of 78 after an asthma attack.

== Early life ==
Barnard grew up in [[Beaufort West]], [[Cape Province]], [[Union of South Africa]]. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa|Dutch Reformed Church]].&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt; One of his four brothers, Abraham, was a "blue baby" who died of a heart problem at the age of three (Barnard would later guess that it was [[tetralogy of Fallot]]).  The family also experienced the loss of a daughter who was stillborn and who had been the fraternal twin of Barnard's older brother Johannes, who was twelve years older than Chris.&lt;ref&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&amp;pg=PT44&amp;lpg=PT44&amp;dq=%22Chris+and+Marius+often+felt+that+she+was+grieving+over+the+loss+of+her+only+daughter%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0sfG2pL-b5&amp;sig=AHk7xZK5s6ocBHV7gUmxq6fKvao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ-8GRvO_RAhUnw1QKHS1rDakQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Chris%20and%20Marius%20often%20felt%20that%20she%20was%20grieving%20over%20the%20loss%20of%20her%20only%20daughter%22&amp;f=false page 46].&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the [[University of Cape Town]] [[Medical School]], where he obtained his [[MBChB|MB ChB]] in 1945.

His father served as a missionary to mixed-race peoples.  His mother, the former Maria Elisabeth de Swart, instilled in the surviving brothers the belief that they could do anything they set their minds to.&lt;ref name=New-York-Times-2001-obituary-Christiaan-Barnard/&gt;

==Career==
Barnard did his [[internship (medicine)|internship]] and [[residency (medicine)|residency]] at the [[Groote Schuur Hospital]] in [[Cape Town]], after which he worked as a general practitioner in [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]], a rural town in the Cape Province.&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"&gt;''Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart'', [[Donald McRae (author)|Donald McRae]], New York: Penguin (Berkley/Putnam), 2006.  See esp. Ch. 10 "The Wait" and Ch. 11 "Fame and Heartbreak," pages 173–214.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar.&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt; He completed his master's degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the University of Cape Town. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation titled "The treatment of tuberculous meningitis".

Soon after qualifying as a doctor, Barnard performed experiments on dogs investigating intestinal atresia, a birth defect which allows life-threatening gaps to develop in the intestines.  He followed a medical hunch that this was caused by inadequate blood flow to the fetus.  After nine months and forty-three attempts, Barnard was able to reproduce this condition in a fetus puppy by tying off some of the blood supply to a puppy's intestines and then placing the animal back in the womb, after which it was born some two weeks later, with the condition of intestinal atresia.  He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply.  The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply.  To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine (6 to 8 inches).  Jannie Louw used this innovation in a clinical setting, and Barnard's method saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town.  This technique was also adapted by surgeons in Britain and the US.  In addition, Barnard analyzed 259 cases of tubercular meningitis.&lt;ref name="Every Second Counts, pages 48-49, Barnard's work remedying intestinal atresia"&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq=%22Soon+after+qualifying+as+a+doctor,+Barnard+produced+a+staggering+piece+of+experimental+research%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0sfG1rO1f1&amp;sig=nA43OxSj7yF1KpnylXq1K8yOp8Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIkrSVnu3RAhUJxmMKHXvEB_QQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Soon%20after%20qualifying%20as%20a%20doctor%2C%20Barnard%20produced%20a%20staggering%20piece%20of%20experimental%20research%22&amp;f=false pages 48–49].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Owen Wangensteen in Minnesota had been impressed by the work of Alan Thal, a young South African doctor working in Minnesota.  He asked Groote Schuur Head of Medicine John Brock if he might recommend any similarly talented South Africans and Brock recommended Barnard.&lt;ref name="Every Second Counts, page 49, Barnard goes to Minnesota"&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22In+December+1955,+Christiaan+Barnard+flew+to+the+city+of+snow%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK3vTLo5DSAhVDMGMKHalQCt4Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20December%201955%2C%20Christiaan%20Barnard%20flew%20to%20the%20city%20of%20snow%22&amp;f=false page 49].&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1955, Barnard travelled to the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Minneapolis]], United States, to begin a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new.&lt;ref name="Every Second Counts, page 51"&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&amp;pg=PT48&amp;lpg=PT48&amp;dq=%22Wangensteen+considered+gastrointestinal+research+to+be+intellectually+delicious%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0sfI2oM_g3&amp;sig=jPUPhhkvTYfmK5dlqON8uzv_nas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi67cj_tKnSAhVIwWMKHVSsAZIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Wangensteen%20considered%20gastrointestinal%20research%20to%20be%20intellectually%20delicious%22&amp;f=false page 51].&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with [[Vince Gott]] who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer [[C. Walton Lillehei|Walt Lillehei]].  Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, "It was the type of inspired thinking that entranced Barnard").  In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation.&lt;ref name="Every Second Counts, page 53, Barnard meets Vince Gott"&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&amp;pg=PT50&amp;lpg=PT50&amp;dq=%22Whenever+he+needed+a+break+from+the+gullet,+Barnard+wandered+across+the+hall%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0sfI2oPW86&amp;sig=_mVcwW7qo08i8kXim2ERnySlu9k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja28myvqnSAhVQ42MKHeTSBgsQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Whenever%20he%20needed%20a%20break%20from%20the%20gullet%2C%20Barnard%20wandered%20across%20the%20hall%22&amp;f=false page 53].&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei's service.  It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon [[Norman Shumway]].&lt;ref name=Invest-Surg-2010&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20497008 | doi=10.3109/08941939.2010.484321 | volume=23 | title=Christiaan Barnard | year=2010 | author=Toledo-Pereyra LH | journal=J Invest Surg | pages=72–78| quote=  under pioneer surgeons C.

(The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.)  Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&amp;pg=PT51&amp;lpg=PT51&amp;dq=%22the+South+African+relaxed+a+little+and+became+friendly+with+Gil+Campbell%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0sfI2oS_9-&amp;sig=-StBQtHhsq9nLASuHfslCkY_HC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZqJ6Jy6nSAhVGHGMKHbCpC5kQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20South%20African%20relaxed%20a%20little%20and%20became%20friendly%20with%20Gil%20Campbell%22&amp;f=false page 54].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled "The [[aortic valve]] – problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve".&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt; The same year he was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation titled "The aetiology of congenital intestinal [[atresia]]".&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt; Barnard described the two years he spent in the United States as "the most fascinating time in my life."

Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at Groote Schuur hospital, as well as holding a joint post at the University of Cape Town.&lt;ref name=BMJ-Raymond-Hoffenberg-December-2001&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1121917 | pmid=11751363 | volume=323 | title=Christiaan Barnard: his first transplants and their impact on concepts of death | author=Hoffenberg R | journal=BMJ | pages=1478–80 | year=2001 | doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1478}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary-of-African-Biography-Volume-6-2012&gt;''Dictionary of African Biography, Volume 6'', Emmanuel Kwaku Akyeampong, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., editors-in-chief,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA386&amp;lpg=PA386&amp;dq=%22as+well+as+surgical+work+and+teaching,+he+did+advanced+work+in+research+laboratories%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1zei2rxyZr&amp;sig=AGMrRsI4d9USWLfdubmfPnb0SNg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj0ejP3e_SAhUX1GMKHSQXCYIQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22as%20well%20as%20surgical%20work%20and%20teaching%2C%20he%20did%20advanced%20work%20in%20research%20laboratories%22&amp;f=false Barnard, Christiaan Neethling], Anne Digby, Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was promoted to full-time lecturer and Director of Surgical Research at the University of Cape Town.

Barnard's younger brother [[Marius Barnard (surgeon)|Marius]], who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnard's right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery.&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt; Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the [[Tetralogy of Fallot]] and [[Ebstein's anomaly]]. He was promoted to Professor of Surgical Science in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1972. In 1981, Barnard became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | accessdate = 8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many awards he received over the years, he was named [[Emeritus|Professor Emeritus]] in 1984.

Following the first successful [[kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] in 1953, in the United States, Barnard performed the second kidney transplant in South Africa in October 1967, the first being done in Johannesburg the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marius|last=Barnard|title=Defining Moments}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2008 |title=Flesh and Blood: Organ Transplantation and Blood Transfusion in Twentieth-Century America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JaZn25Uv6XwC&amp;dq=flesh+and+blood |first=Susan E. |last=Lederer |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=174 |isbn=978-0-19-516150-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 1964, [[James Hardy (surgeon)|James Hardy]] at the [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]], performed the world's first [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]] and world's first cardiac [[Xenotransplantation|xenotransplant]] by transplanting the heart of a chimpanzee into a desperately ill and dying man.

During the [[Apartheid]] era in South Africa, non-white persons and citizens were not given equal opportunities in the medical professions.

Barnard later wrote, "For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side." The donor heart came from a young woman, [[Denise Darvall]], who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town.&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt; On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear.&lt;ref&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae, 2006, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt.&lt;ref&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBYTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=%22He+was+still+in+a+daze+when+Coert+Venter+knocked+gently%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eK3RGGCxdA&amp;sig=igcAK_m1D47HUZCvy3t1qlsOPTE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4mdywoejQAhXphlQKHTg4DccQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22He%20was%20still%20in%20a%20daze%20when%20Coert%20Venter%20knocked%20gently%22&amp;f=false page 189], "Coert Venter . . [and] Bertie Bosman . . withdrew, stressing that he should take as long as he needed to consider their request.  They would understand if he declined to give his consent."  Edward Darvall took four minutes to reach his decision, mainly thinking about his daughter, including how she tried to help others.  He then told the doctors, "If you can't save my daughter, you must try and save this man."&lt;/ref&gt; The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music.  When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique.  Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins.&lt;ref&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&amp;pg=PT162&amp;lpg=PT162&amp;dq=%22Barnard+eventually+became+drowsy+and+he+drifted+in+and+out+of+sleep%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0sfC-nP083&amp;sig=xGL_NszJxgKT5LeGYIbA5FZiREI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIjOGE7vHQAhXmrVQKHdWDBkkQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Barnard%20eventually%20became%20drowsy%20and%20he%20drifted%20in%20and%20out%20of%20sleep%22&amp;f=false page 187].&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt; Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, "Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'"&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily_I" /&gt;

Washkansky survived the operation and lived for 18 days, having succumbed to [[pneumonia]] as he was taking [[immunosuppressive drug]]s.

== Additional heart transplants ==

Barnard was celebrated around the world for his accomplishment. He was [[photogenic]] and enjoyed the media attention following the operation.

Worldwide, approximately 100 transplants were performed by various doctors during 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/48963/1/2009_HMD_Elzinga.pdf MAJOR MEDICAL MILESTONES LEADING UP TO THE FIRST HUMAN HEART TRANSPLANTATION], Kate Elzinga, from ''Proceedings of the 18th Annual History of Medicine Days Conference 2009: The University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine, Alberta, Canada'', Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2011. " . . following Barnard's landmark heart transplantation on December 3, 1967, 107 human heart transplants were performed by 64 surgical teams in 24 countries in 1968. . "&lt;/ref&gt;  Only a third of these patients lived longer than three months.  A U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] publication states, "Within several years, only Shumway's team at Stanford was attempting transplants."&lt;ref name="Adrian-Kantrowitz-Papers"/&gt;

Barnard's second transplant operation was conducted on 2 January 1968, and the patient, [[Philip Blaiberg]], survived for 19 months.&lt;ref name=New-York-Times-2001-obituary-Christiaan-Barnard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chicago-Tribune-Philip-Blaiberg-1968&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/10/12/page/254/article/philip-blaiberg-was-dying-this-time-for-certain Philip Blaiberg was dying—this time for certain], ''Chicago Tribune'', Mrs. Philip Blaiberg, 12 October 1969, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=7 July 1994 |title=Dirk van Zyl, 68; Had '71 Transplant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/obituaries/dirk-van-zyl-68-had-71-transplant.html |work=New York Times |accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between December 1967 and November 1974 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, ten heart transplants were performed, as well as a heart and lung transplant in 1971.  Of these ten patients, four lived longer than 18 months, with two of these four becoming long-term survivors.  One patient lived for over thirteen years and another for over twenty-four years.&lt;ref name="South-African-Medical-Journal-2012"&gt;[http://www.samj.org.za/index.php/samj/article/view/5020/4123 Transplantation of the heart: An overview of 40 years' clinical and research experience at Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town], ''South African Medical Journal'', "Part I. Surgical experience and clinical studies." J Hassoulas, Vol. 102, No. 6 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Full recovery of donor heart function often takes place over hours or days, during which time considerable damage can occur.  Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions.  For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patient's right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs.  Barnard designed the idea of the heterotopic (or "piggy back" transplant) in which the patient's diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a "double heart".  Barnard performed the first such [[Heart transplantation#Heterotopic procedure|heterotopic]] heart transplant in 1974.&lt;ref name="South-African-Medical-Journal-2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Postgrad-Medical-Journal-2016"&gt;[http://pmj.bmj.com/content/early/2016/07/27/postgradmedj-2016-134309.extract "A tale of two hearts"], ''Postgrad Medical Journal'', 27 July 2016.  "...  HHT [Heterotopic Heart Transplantation] involves transplanting the donor heart without removing the recipient heart, effectively forming a 'double heart'.  It was widely used in the pre-cyclosporine era when the donor was not strong enough (eg, the recipient had a much larger body) or the recipient had pre-existing pulmonary hypertension.  Christiaan Barnard performed the first HHT ('piggy back' transplant) in 1974 ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 1974 through December 1983, 49 consecutive heterotopic heart transplants on 43 patients were performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, as compared to less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.&lt;ref name="South-African-Medical-Journal-2012"/&gt;

Many surgeons gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to [[Transplant rejection|rejection of the transplanted heart]] by the patient's immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of [[ciclosporin|cyclosporine]], an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted [[xenotransplantation]] in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a girl who was unable to leave artificial life support after her second aortic valve replacement.

== Public life ==
[[File:Christiaan Barnard 1968.jpg|thumb|Christiaan Barnard in Italy in 1968]]
Barnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa's laws of apartheid, and was not afraid to criticise his nation's government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law. Christiaan's brother, [[Marius Barnard (surgeon)|Marius Barnard]], went into politics, and was elected to the [[Parliament of South Africa|legislature]] from [[Progressive Federal Party]]. Barnard later stated that the reason he never won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was probably because he was a "[[white South African]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1422/14220850.htm "It's the quality of survival that's important"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711210948/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1422/14220850.htm |date=11 July 2007 }}.

Shortly before his visit to Kenya in 1978, the following was written about his views regarding race relations in South Africa;
"While he believes in the participation of Africans in the political process of South Africa, he is opposed to a one-man-one-vote system in South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilary|first=Ng'weno|date=5 May 1978|title=Dr. Christiaan Barnard Visit to Kenya|url=|journal=The Weekly Review|volume=|pages=13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In answering a hypothetical question on how he would solve the race problem were he a "benevolent dictator in South Africa", Barnard stated the following in a long interview at the Weekly Review:&lt;ref name="Hilary 16–17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilary|first=Ng'weno|date=19 May 1978|title=I Would Split South Africa Into Two Parts - Equitably|url=|journal=The Weekly Review|volume=|pages=16–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* While "I would abolish Social discrimination", political discrimination would continue.&lt;ref name="Hilary 16–17"/&gt; 
* He favoured the total division of the country along racial lines. His words were; "I somehow feel ... but we may have to divide South Africa into two equal divisions". In a followup question about where the coloured people would end up in that scenario, he replied that 'I would include them in the white South Africa".&lt;ref name="Hilary 16–17"/&gt;
* That coloured people have "always been accepted" among whites.&lt;ref name="Hilary 16–17"/&gt;
* That "the black man will not accept this view" of universal suffrage.&lt;ref name="Hilary 16–17"/&gt;
* That "we are still out of the Olympic games" despite the fact that "in the field of sports where we have virtually integrated completely."&lt;ref name="Hilary 16–17"/&gt;
* Regarding the [[Soweto uprising]], he claimed it "there was ... a lot of external stirring up of turbulence". Regarding the anger from the black population when [[Steve Biko]] was murdered, he said that "I think that something like $50,000 came in from outside to work up feelings at that funeral."&lt;ref name="Hilary 16–17"/&gt;
* He stated that the National Party members were as upset about Biko's murder as were blacks; "The white community was thoroughly upset, let me tell you. The nationalists themselves were very upset."&lt;ref name="Hilary 16–17"/&gt;

The interview ended with the following summary from he himself;
"I often say that, like [[King Lear]], South Africa is a country more sinned against than sinning."&lt;ref name="Hilary 16–17"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Barnard's first marriage was to Aletta Gertruida Louw, a nurse, whom he married in 1948 while practising medicine in Ceres. The couple had two children&amp;nbsp;— Deirdre (born 1950) and Andre (1951–1984).&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/christiaan-barnard-celebrated-pioneer-of-heart-transplant-surgery-dies-aged-78-667863.html Christiaan Barnard, celebrated pioneer of heart transplant surgery, dies aged 78]", ''The Independent'', 3 September 2001. Retrieved 18 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; International fame took a toll on his personal life, and in 1969, Barnard and his wife divorced. In 1970, he married heiress Barbara Zoellner when she was 19, the same age as his son, and they had two children&amp;nbsp;— Frederick (born 1972) and Christiaan Jr. (born 1974).&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio&gt;{{cite web |title=Christiaan Barnard Biography |url=http://www.allsands.com/entertainment/people/christiaanbarna_aoi_gn.htm |accessdate=10 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523102543/http://www.allsands.com/entertainment/people/christiaanbarna_aoi_gn.htm |archive-date=23 May 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He divorced Zoellner in 1982.&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio/&gt; Barnard married for a third time in 1988 to Karin Setzkorn, a young model.&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio/&gt; They also had two children, Armin (born 1989) and Lara (born 1997), but this last marriage also ended in divorce in 2000.&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio/&gt;

Barnard described in his autobiography ''The Second Life'' a one-night extramarital affair with Italian film star [[Gina Lollobrigida]],&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnard|first=Chris |date=1994 |title= Druhý dech |trans-title=The Second Life|pages = 70–71|language= cs |location=Prague |publisher=Lidové noviny |isbn= 80-7106-096-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Czech translation of The Second Life --&gt; that occurred in January 1968.

In October 2016, U.S. Congresswoman [[Ann McLane Kuster]] (D-NH) stated that Barnard sexually assaulted her when she was 23 years old. According to Kuster, he attempted to grope her under her skirt, while seated at a business luncheon with  Rep. [[Pete McCloskey]] (R-CA), whom she worked for at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20161013/news/310139819/|title=Trump comments prompt congresswoman to share assault story|first=Associated|last=Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nh1.com/news/rep-annie-kuster-tells-concord-monitor-famous-doctor-sexually-assaulted-her-decades-ago/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-10-13/trump-comments-prompt-congresswoman-to-share-assault-story&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retirement ==
Barnard retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing [[rheumatoid arthritis]] in his hands which ended his surgical career. He had struggled with arthritis since 1956, when it was diagnosed during his postgraduate work in the United States.&lt;ref name="mcrae2006"/&gt; After retirement, he spent two years as the Scientist-In-Residence at the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute in the United States and as an acting consultant for various institutions.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

He had by this time become very interested in anti-aging research, and his reputation suffered in 1986 when he promoted ''[[Glycel]]'', an expensive "anti-aging" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=New-York-Times-2001-obituary-Christiaan-Barnard&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/03/world/christiaan-barnard-78-surgeon-for-first-heart-transplant-dies.html|title=Christiaan Barnard, 78, Surgeon For First Heart Transplant, Dies|last=Altman|first=Lawrence K.|date=3 September 2001|work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent time as a research advisor to the Clinique la Prairie, in [[Switzerland]], where the controversial "rejuvenation therapy" was practised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/03/guardianobituaries.medicalscience|title=Obituary: Christiaan Barnard|last=Cooper|first=David K.

Barnard divided the remainder of his years between [[Austria]], where he established the [[Christiaan Barnard Foundation]], dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world, and his game farm in Beaufort West, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cbheartfoundation.com/the-foundation/|title=The Foundation - Christiaan Barnard Heart Foundation|work=Christiaan Barnard Heart Foundation|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Heart and Blood Vessel Surgery|date=2016-09-13|doi=10.1142/9789814699389_0007|work=The First Transplant Surgeon|pages=165–187|publisher=WORLD SCIENTIFIC|isbn=9789814699365|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Christiaan Barnard died on 2 September 2001, while on holiday in [[Paphos]], Cyprus. Early reports stated that he had died of a heart attack, but an [[autopsy]] showed his death was caused by a severe [[asthma]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Autopsy confirms asthma killed Barnard | date= 5 September 2001 | url =http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main_old.php?id=4655&amp;archive=1 | work =[[Cyprus Mail]] | accessdate =15 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202905/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main_old.php?id=4655&amp;archive=1 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Christiaan Barnard wrote two autobiographies. His first book, ''One Life'', was published in 1969 ({{ISBN|0245599525}}) and sold copies worldwide. Some of the proceeds were used to set up the Chris Barnard Fund for research into heart disease and heart transplants in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brink JG, Hassoulas J |title=The first human heart transplant and further advances in cardiac transplantation at Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town - with reference to : the operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2550">'''Deliverance (née Hazeltine) Dane''' was one of many [[women]] accused of [[witchcraft]]&lt;ref name="refname1" group="Ref"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refname2" group="Ref"/&gt; during the [[Salem Witch Trials]]. She was from [[Andover, Massachusetts]], and due largely to the work of her father-in-law, much of the hysteria that swept through Salem was halted in Andover. Her husband, Nathaniel Dane, was the son of [[reverend|Rev.]] [[Francis Dane]].&lt;ref name="refname3" group="Ref"/&gt;  Francis Dane was outspoken against the trials, and his two daughters [[Abigail Faulkner]] and Elizabeth Johnson were also accused of being witches.  Abigail was convicted of witchcraft, but only escaped [[execution]] because she was [[pregnancy|pregnant]] at the time.

Many of the records of Deliverance's examination have been lost, but on page 280 of Marilynne K. Roach's book ''The Salem Witch Trials: A Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Community Under Siege'', she quotes Deliverance as saying that she and some other witches had brought her father-in-law's specter along with them to torment the afflicted.  Her testimony was ignored and Rev. Francis Dane was not arrested. Deliverance Dane escaped execution. According to [[Andover, Massachusetts]] records, she died on June 15, 1735.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

'''Ellen Hansen Corby''' (June 3, 1911 &amp;ndash; April 14, 1999) was an American actress. She is best remembered for the role of Grandma Esther Walton on the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] [[television series]] ''[[The Waltons]]'', for which she won three [[Emmy]] Awards. She was also nominated for an [[Academy Award]] and won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for her performance as Aunt Trina in ''[[I Remember Mama (film)|I Remember Mama]]'' (1948).

==Early life==
Ellen Hansen was born in [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], Wisconsin, to immigrant parents from [[Denmark]]. She grew up in [[Philadelphia]]. An interest in amateur theater while in high school led her to [[Atlantic City]] in 1932, where she briefly worked as a [[chorus girl]]. She moved to [[Hollywood]] that same year and got a job as a script girl {{Clarify|date=January 2013}} at [[RKO Studios]] and [[Hal Roach Studios]], where she often worked on ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies, alongside her future husband, cinematographer Francis Corby. She held that position for the next 12 years and took acting lessons on the side.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Career==
Although she had bit parts in more than 30 films in the 1930s and 1940s, including ''[[Babes in Toyland (1934 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1934) and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), her first credited acting role was in RKO's ''[[Cornered (1945 film)|Cornered]]'' (1945) in which she played a maid, followed by an uncredited brief speaking role as a kitchen cook in ''[[The Locket]]'' (1946). Corby began her career as a writer at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] studios working on the [[Western (genre)|western]] ''[[Twilight on the Trail]]'' (1941).

She received an Academy Award nomination and a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance as a lovelorn aunt in ''I Remember Mama'' (1948). Over the next four decades, she worked in film and television, typically portraying maids, secretaries, waitresses, or gossips, often in Westerns, and had a recurring role as Henrietta Porter, a newspaper publisher, in ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'' (1957&amp;ndash;1959), starring [[Robert Culp]] as [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Hoby Gilman. In the episode entitled "The Vote", Henrietta Porter advocates for [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]: "Women should have the right to vote. Women should be in politics. They can't do any worse than you men!" For her guest appearances in many  Westerns, Corby in 1989 won a [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot]] award.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Corby appeared as the elderly Mrs. Lesh, the crooked car peddler, on CBS's ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''. She guest-starred, as well, on ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[The Guns of Will Sonnett]]'', ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' (several episodes), ''[[Rescue 8]]'', ''[[The Restless Gun]]'' (two episodes), ''[[The Rifleman]]'', ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', ''[[Fury (TV series)|Fury]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Frontier Circus]]'', ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'', ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[Tightrope (TV series)|Tightrope]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'',  ''The Big Valley,   Meet McGraw'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle]]'', ''[[The Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[The Invaders]]'',  ''[[Lassie]]'', and ''[[Night Gallery]]''. From 1965 to 1967, she had a recurring role in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Please Don't Eat the Daisies (TV series)|Please Don't Eat the Daisies]]'', based on an earlier [[Doris Day]] film.

Her best-known role came as Grandma Esther Walton on the made-for-TV film ''The Homecoming:  A Christmas Story'' (1971), which served as the pilot for ''[[The Waltons]]''. Her husband, Zebulon Walton, was portrayed by actor [[Edgar Bergen]] in the film. Corby went on to resume her role on the weekly television series ''The Waltons''. (She was the only adult actor from the original ''Homecoming'' pilot to carry her role over to the series.) Actor [[Will Geer]] played her husband in the series from 1972 until his death in 1978, at which time the character of Zebulon Walton was also buried. The series ran from 1972 to 1981, and resulted in six sequel films. For her work in ''The Waltons'', she gained three Emmy Awards and three more nominations as Best Supporting Actress. She also won a Golden Globe award for best supporting actress in a TV series for the show ''The Waltons'', and was nominated another three times. She left the show early in 1977, owing to a massive stroke she had suffered on 10 November 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walton's Granny' suffers stroke|date=11 November 1976|work=The Miami News| publisher = [[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which impaired her speech and severely limited her mobility and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ellen Corby return uncertain|date=15 May 1977|work=The Orlando Sentinel| publisher = [[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to the series during the final episode of the 1977–78 season, with her character depicted as also recovering from a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ellen Corby 'Walton's' returning|date=19 December 1977|work=The Ithaca Journal| publisher = [[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She remained a regular on ''The Waltons'' through the end of the 1978–79 season, with Esther Walton struggling with her stroke deficits as Corby was in real life. Although Corby was able to communicate after her stroke, her character's lines were usually limited to one word or one-phrased dialogue, such as "No" or "Home"; her role dropped to recurring during ''The Waltons''' final two seasons, and she later resumed her role as Grandma Walton in five of the six ''Waltons'' reunion movies between 1982 and 1997.

==Personal life==
Ellen Hansen married Francis Corby, a film director/cinematographer who was two decades her senior, in 1934; they divorced in 1944. The marriage did not produce children and she never remarried. Francis Corby died in 1956.

Corby in 1969 trained as a teacher of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|transcendental meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen Corby|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/apr/28/local/me-31944|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=15 September 2014|quote=In late 1969, Ellen Corby and I, along with 120 others, spent some months in the jungles of the Himalayan foothills near Rishikesh, India, becoming teachers of Transcendental Meditation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a [[stroke]] in November 1976 from which she recovered and returned to her role on ''The Waltons'' in March 1978. According to Michael Learned, who played Olivia Walton, Will Geer may have saved her life. When she failed to show up for work, Geer immediately suspected something was wrong and went with the show's producers to her home, where they found that she had suffered a stroke. Her stroke was written into the show, with Grandma Walton also suffering a stroke and struggling to regain her speech. Following her stroke, she was supported by her friend, carer and travelling companion Stella Luchetta, with whom she'd become friends in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grandma Walton in Racine|date=24 August 1978|work=The Journal-Times|location=Racine, Wisconsin|page=42|publisher = [[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who lived with her until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries - Ellen Corby; Actress Played Grandma on "The Waltons"|date=17 April 1999|work=Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, California|page=121|publisher = [[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her final role was in ''A Walton Easter'' (1997). In 1999, following several years of declining health, Corby died at age 87 at the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]]. Her memorial site is in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]], [[Glendale, California]].

'''Fitz''' (pronounced "fits") is a prefix in [[patronymic surname]]s of Norman origin, that is to say originating in the 11th century. The word is a [[Norman language|Norman French]] [[noun]] meaning "son of", from Latin ''filius'' (son), plus genitive case of the father's forename.&lt;ref&gt;Thus ''Robertus'', [[List of Latinized names|latinised]] form in the nominative case of the father's forename suggests his son's name in Latin as ''Filius Roberti'' ("son of Robert")&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst ''Fitz'' is now the standard form used by modern historians the word appears in ancient documents with various spellings such as ''fiz'', ''filz'', etc.  The word has developed in modern French to ''fils de'', with which it is thus [[cognate]].

==Origin==
Norman [[gentry]] and [[Nobility|noble]] families under feudal society held one or more manors from an [[Lord|overlord]], who himself held directly from the [[Duke of Normandy]], the sovereign. Such families took their surnames from their principal manor on which they resided and which formed their seat. This was the case for example with [[William the Conqueror]]'s great noble adviser [[Roger de Beaumont]] (c. 1015–1094), ("Roger from Beaumont"), who took his surname from his manor of [[Beaumont-le-Roger]] in Normandy. His eldest son was called [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], again after the family seat.

However, where a distinguished Norman warrior perhaps held no land, and thus was not an established member of feudal society, or was from an obscure family, such a naming convention was unavailable. In such families therefore the word ''Fitz'' was preposed to the fore name of the warrior's father to give the warrior and his further descendants a surname by which they could be known.  Thus ''Fitz Gilbert'', meaning "son of Gilbert" would be adopted as a surname by the warrior christened "Baldwin", giving "Baldwin Fitz Gilbert". If we assume Baldwin's son was christened "William", his name would become "William Fitz Baldwin Fitz Gilbert. However it is rare to find this naming practice extending beyond two generations and eventually the family name became "Fitz Gilbert" alone, the name of the patriarch, with the name of the patriarch's son being dropped. When it is asked why the father, in this case Gilbert, was not himself ''Fitz'' of his own father, the answer seems unclear. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, written in Latin, names a few examples such as ''Turstin filius Rolf'',&lt;ref&gt;Thorn, Caroline &amp; Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.) Vol. 9, Devon, Parts 1 &amp; 2, Phillimore Press, Chichester, 1985, part 1, chapter 37&lt;/ref&gt; who was known in Norman-French documents as [[Turstin FitzRolf|Turstin fitz Rolf]].

==Norse origins==
The Norman noblemen were descended from Norsemen or Vikings and the usage appears to reflect the Scandinavian tradition of adding ''-son'' after (usually) the father's name. There are, however, exceptions in which the name of a more noteworthy mother (Fitz Wymarch) or a parent's title (Fitz Count, [[William FitzEmpress|Fitz Empress]]) was used instead. Such surnames were later created for illegitimate children of royal princes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "Fitz", sense '''a'''. Retrieved 2013-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other names were Normanized from another language, such as [[Fitzpatrick (surname)|FitzPatrick]] (from the original Gaelic [[Mac Giolla Phádraig]]) or FitzDermot (from Mac Gilla Mo-Cholmóc), but are not of Norman or Norse descent.

==Decline/abolition==
The Devon historian [[Tristram Risdon]] (d. 1640) wrote: "From the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] unto the time of King [[Edward I of England|Edward the First]] [reigned 1272–1307] the addition of 'Fitz' was so frequent with the Normans that to avoid confusion in that kind men were commanded to assume unto themselves local names."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tristram Risdon|Risdon, Tristram]] (d. 1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example the ancient Anglo-Norman Devonshire family of "FitzBarnard" assumed the surname "de Speccot", from the name of their Devon seat,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tristram Risdon|Risdon, Tristram]] (d. 1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Speccot in the parish of [[Merton (parish)|Merton]].{{better ref needed|reason=Risdon, writing c.1630 can't be considered a reliable source today|date=August 2017}}

==Revival==
From the [[House of Stuart|Stuart era]] (1603–1714) and later, a pseudo-Anglo-Norman usage of ''Fitz'' was adopted for younger sons of the [[List of English monarchs|British royal family]] who lacked a legal surname, and particularly for [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] children of kings, princes, or general upper class men, for example [[Fitzroy (disambiguation)|Fitzroy]], (meaning "son of the king", from the French ''fils du roy''); [[Fitzjames]], son of king [[James II of England|James II]] (1685–1688); [[FitzClarence]], son of the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]], later King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] (1830–1837); and FitzGeorge, son of [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]] (1819–1904). More generally, in literature the prefix ''Fitz'' has been used to connote nobility, for example in [[Anthony Trollope]]'s 1862 novel ''[[Orley Farm (novel)|Orley Farm]]'' which features the fictional rakishly aristocratic figure Lord John Fitzjoly.

==Irish usage==
The Irish surname [[FitzGerald dynasty|FitzGerald]] is thought to derive from [[Gerald de Windsor]], a [[Cambro-Norman]] nobleman whose son and grandson were involved in the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]].

The Irish name [[Fitzpatrick (name)|Fitzpatrick]] does not indicate a Norman origin of the family; it is the translation into English of the Gaelic surname Mac Giolla Phádraig. Other surnames beginning "Mac Giolla" were made into "McGilli-" (e.g. McGillicuddy), but the Fitzpatricks had their name changed by monarchical decree of [[Henry VIII]] as part of their submission under the Crown's [[surrender and regrant]] policy in the 1530–40's.

'''Frederic Manning''' (22 July 1882{{spaced ndash}}22 February 1935) was an Australian [[poet]] and [[novelist]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Sydney]], Manning was one of eight children of local politician Sir [[William Patrick Manning]].  His family were [[Roman Catholics]] of Irish origin.  A sickly child who suffered from [[asthma]], Manning was educated exclusively at home.  As a teenager he formed a close friendship with the Reverend Arthur Galton, a scholarly man who was [[secretary]] to the [[Governor of New South Wales]].  Galton went home to England in 1898, taking Manning with him. Manning returned to Australia in 1900 but finally settled in the United Kingdom in 1903.

==Early years in England==
Manning moved in with Galton, who had become the [[vicar]] of [[Edenham]], a village about three miles north-west of [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne]] in south [[Lincolnshire]].  He devoted his time to study, reading voraciously, particularly the classics and [[philosophy]], under the domineering influence of Galton.  Although he seemingly shared Galton's contempt for Catholicism, Manning never renounced it entirely.  He made several unsuccessful attempts to write a historical novel, and in 1907 published his first book, ''The Vigil of [[Brunhild]]'', which was a monologue written in verse.  ''Scenes and Portraits'' followed in 1909, which was a discussion of religious topics written in the form of a series of debates in which those taking part are leading lights from the past, such as [[Socrates]], [[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Thomas Cromwell]].  These books went down well in literary circles, but did not enjoy a particularly wide circulation.  Manning was recognised as an up-and-coming writer, a reputation that the indifferent collection ''Poems'' (1910) did not dissipate.

Manning was never the most robust of individuals, neither was his [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] particularly [[healthy]].  Despite his asthma, he became a heavy [[Tobacco smoking|smoker]], and he seems to have sought escape from his loneliness in the local [[public house]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  In the years immediately before [[World War I]], he started to move in [[London]] artistic circles, becoming friends with [[Max Beerbohm]] and [[William Rothenstein]] (there is a collection of letters from Manning to Rothenstein), as well as the influential young poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Richard Aldington]].

==First World War==
When war broke out, Manning was keen to enlist, possibly to escape from a stifling environment and to widen his horizons.  A man with his fragile constitution and unhealthy lifestyle was not going to be an attractive proposition for the military authorities, but in October 1915 after several attempts, his persistence paid off and he enrolled in the [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]].  He was a [[Private (rank)|private]] with the [[Service number#United Kingdom|service number]] 19022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=4100383|title=WW1 Campaign Medals—Medal card of Manning, Frederick|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|format=fee required to view pdf of original medal card|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was selected for [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] training, but failed the course.  Sent to France in 1916, Manning experienced action with the 7th [[Battalion]] at the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]], was promoted to [[Lance Corporal|lance-corporal]] and experienced life in the [[Trench warfare|trenches]].  He was recalled for further training and posted to Ireland in May 1917 with a commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684-1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]]. The life of an officer did not agree with him; he seems not to have integrated particularly well and he drank excessively, getting into trouble with his superiors.  His inebriation was put down to [[neurasthenia]], but Manning resigned his commission on 28 February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30546|supp=y|page=2578|date=26 February 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Manning continued to write. In 1917 he published a collection of poems under the title ''Ediola''. This was a mixture of verse predominantly in his former style alongside [[war poem]]s heavily influenced by the [[imagism]] of Pound, which deal [[Introspection|introspectively]] with personal aims and ideals tempered in the crucible of battle.  He contributed to anthologies, for example, ''The Monthly Chapbook'' which appeared in July 1919 edited by [[Harold Monro]], containing twenty-three poems by writers including John Alford, [[Herbert Read]], [[Walter De La Mare]], [[Sir Osbert Sitwell, 5th Baronet|Osbert Sitwell]], [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Edith Sitwell]], [[Robert Nichols (poet)|Robert Nichols]], [[Rose Macaulay]] and [[W. H. Davies]] alongside Manning and Aldington.  He wrote for periodicals, including [[The Criterion (magazine)|''The Criterion'']], which was produced by [[T. S. Eliot]].

Poetry did not pay, and so in 1923 Manning took a commission from his publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] to write ''The Life of Sir [[William Henry White|William White]]'', a biography of the man who, as [[Director of Naval Construction]], led the build-up of the [[Royal Navy]] in the last years of the nineteenth century. Galton had died in 1921, which not only left Manning effectively homeless, but also lacking a forceful directing influence in his life. He lived for much of the time at the Bull Hotel in Bourne, apart from a short spell when he owned a farmhouse in [[Surrey]].  At this time he was friendly with [[T. E. Lawrence]], then serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] at [[RAF Cranwell]], some twenty miles (a motorcycle ride) from where Manning was living.  In 1926 he contributed the introduction to an edition of ''Epicurus's Morals: Collected and faithfully Englished'' by [[Walter Charleton]], originally published in 1656, published in a limited edition by Peter Davies.

==''The Middle Parts of Fortune''==
As the 1920s progressed and confidence started to return, the artistic community was increasingly looking back at the war.  The demand for written material started to grow.  The big catalyst was the play ''[[Journey's End]]'' written by [[R. C. Sherriff]] which first appeared in 1928.  Davies urged Manning to use his undoubted talent in conjunction with his intense wartime experiences to write a novel.  In an effort to capture the moment, Manning had to work rapidly, with little opportunity for second drafts and revisions.  The result was ''The Middle Parts of Fortune'', published anonymously by Peter Davies and the Piazza Press in a numbered limited edition of 520 copies in 1929, which are now rare collectors' items.  The book is an account in the [[vernacular]] of the lives of ordinary soldiers.  The central character named Bourne is the filter through which Manning's own experiences are transposed into the lives of a group of men whose own personal qualities interact in response to conflict and comradeship.  Bourne is an enigmatic, detached character (a self-portrait of the author) who leaves each of the protagonists alone with their own detachment, privy to their own thoughts.

An [[Censorship|expurgated]] version was published by Davies in 1930 under the title ''[[Her Privates We]]''.  There is a quote from [[Shakespeare]] at the start of each chapter, and this particular reference occurs in ''[[Hamlet]]''.  In Act 2, Scene 2, there is a jocular exchange between Hamlet and [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]:

:''Guildenstern'':  On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
:''Hamlet'':  Nor the soles of her shoe?
:''Rosencrantz'':  Neither, my lord.
:''Hamlet'':  Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?
:''Guildenstern'':  Faith, her privates we.
:''Hamlet'':  In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet.

The original publication of this edition credited authorship to "Private 19022", possibly a simple desire for anonymity or possibly a further pun on "private soldier" and "private parts".  Manning was first credited with authorship by name posthumously in 1943, but the original text was published widely only in 1977. Amongst the voices raised in praise were those of [[Arnold Bennett]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], Ezra Pound (who cited Manning as a literary mentor) and T. E. Lawrence, who claimed to have seen through the anonymity and recognised the author of ''Scenes and Portraits''.  Be that as it may, ''Scenes and Portraits'' was re-published by Peter Davies in 1930, and Manning lived out his life basking in the afterglow of what is widely regarded as one of the very finest novels based upon the experiences of warfare.  T.E. Lawrence said of ''The Middle Parts of Fortune'' that “your book be famous for as long as the war is cared for - and perhaps longer, for there is more than soldiering in it. You have been exactly fair to everyone, of all ranks: and all your people are alive.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telstudies.org/writings/letters/1930/300225_manning.shtml|title=T. E. Lawrence letters - 1930|website=www.telstudies.org|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ernest Hemingway]] called it "the finest and noblest novel to come out of World War I".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men at War: The Best War Stories of all Time.|last=Hemingway|first=Ernest|publisher=Barmhall House|year=1942|isbn=|location=|pages=Introduction p. XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Frederic Manning never married.  His biographers suggest he eschewed intimacy, and that his long-time host Galton and the hostesses of the literary salons which he visited should be seen as "parent-substitute" figures.  Like his hero Bourne, Manning was a private person, who kept his own counsel.  Manning died of [[respiratory]] diseases at a [[Hampstead]] [[nursing home]].  His [[obituary]] appeared in ''[[The Times]]'' on 26 February 1935.  He is interred at [[Kensal Green]] cemetery.

'''Henri Cernuschi''' (''Enrico Cernuschi'' in Italian) (19 February 1821 – 11 May 1896), was a major French banker, economist and Asian art collector, who started off as an Italian politician in 1848-1850.

Cernuschi was born of wealthy parents at [[Milan]], and was destined for the legal profession. During his studies he became involved in the revolutionary movement. He played a conspicuous part in the insurrection at Milan in 1848, and also at Rome in 1849, where he had a seat in the [[National Assembly]]. On the collapse of the revolutionary government he was arrested (1850), but managed to escape to [[France]], where he engaged in commerce and banking, became naturalized, and acquired a large fortune. He took a prominent part in opposing the Socialist movement, and in April 1870, having subscribed a large sum to the funds of a committee formed to combat the Napoleonic plebiscite, had to leave the country.

In September the formation of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] enabled Cernuschi to return, but he soon left [[Paris]] to travel in the [[Far East]]. He returned with a fine art collection that he would constantly expand upon for the remainder of his life. He bequeathed his collection to the city of Paris as well as his private residence at No 7. avenue Velasquez on the edge of [[Parc Monceau]] in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]] to be used as a museum. Open to the public today, the [[Musée Cernuschi|Cernuschi Museum]] collection includes [[China|Chinese]] art, funeral statuary, painted 8th-century silks, neolithic terracottas (3rd millennium BC), [[Japan|Japanese]] art (mostly bronze objects and sculptures, ceramics, paravents), ancient [[Persia]]n bronze objects, an [[Amithaba]] [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] from the 8th Century, plus examples of [[calligraphy]].

As a banker, Cernuschi is best known for his publications on financial questions, more especially [[bimetallism]]. Of the latter he was an ardent champion, and the word itself is commonly supposed to have originated with him—at least in its English form it is first found in his ''Silver Vindicated'' (1876). Among his other works may be mentioned: ''Mécanique de l'échange'' (1861); ''Illusion des sociétés coopératives'' (1886); ''Le Bimétallisme en Angleterre'' (1879); ''Le Grand Procès de l'Union latine'' (1884).

Cernuschi died at [[Menton]] in May 1896, and was interred at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22827">[[File:Escudos de Aragón León y Castilla en las exequias de Carlos I.jpg|thumb|500px|Banner and [[caparison]] with the arms of León (between [[Coat of arms of the Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Heraldry of Castile|Castile]]) in the funeral obsequies of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in [[Brussels]], 29th December 1558, by [[Hieronymus Cock]]]]
The first instance of a figure of the [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] as symbol of the [[Kingdom of León]] is found in minted coins of [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile|Alfonso VII]], called ''the [[Imperator totius Hispaniae|Emperor]]'' ([[1126]]-[[1157]]). Until then, the cross had a preponderant position on documents and coins of [[List of Leonese monarchs|Leonese monarchs]] since that reign the cross was gradually displaced by the lion. The Spanish historian and heraldist [[Martín de Riquer]] explained that the lion was already used as heraldic emblem in [[1148]].&lt;ref&gt;Riquer, Martín de (1942) ''Manual de heráldica española''. Barcelona: Apolo.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the reign of Alfonso VII, the figure of this animal began to appear on royal documents as personal device of the monarch and became pervasive during reigns of [[Ferdinand II of León|Ferdinand II]] (1157-[[1188]]) and [[Alfonso IX of León|Alfonso IX]] (1188-[[1230]]).

The first reference to the lion as personal emblem of the monarch, and thus the kingdom find in ''[[Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris]]'', at the times of Alfonso VII, this chronicle when describing participants armies in the taking of [[Almería]], the text literally says: 

{{Quote|''(...) the select order of knights from León. Carrying banners, like lions they burst (...) Like the lion it surpasses the other animals in beauty and in strength. Thus this city exceeds the other cities in honor. The golden insignia of the Emperor appears on its banners and on its arms. It is carried into battle as a protection against every evil''.&lt;ref&gt;Lipskey, Glenn Edward (ed. y trans.) (1972) [http://libro.uca.edu/lipskey/chronicle.htm ''Poem of Almería. The Chronicle of Alfonso the Emperor: A Translation of the Chronica Adefonsi Imperatoris''.] ''PhD dissertation'', [[Northwestern University]]. . Retrieved 12 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The heraldic symbol of León is the prominent feature of flags of León, including the historical standards of the former [[Kingdom of León]], the flags of the [[León, Spain|City of León]] and the [[Province of León]], and others representing the [[León (historical region)|region known as León or the Leonese Country]].

== History ==
=== One of the earliest heraldic symbols in Europe ===
[[File:Comitiva municipal Cabezadas 2006 León (España).jpg|250px|thumb|left|''The Royal Standard of León preceding to the Council of the City, at the procession to [[Basilica of San Isidoro, León|Royal Collegiate of San Isidoro]] of the "''Forum or Offer''" Ceremony'']]

The development of the modern heraldic language cannot be attributed to a single individual, time, or place.  Although certain designs that are now considered heraldic were evidently in use during the [[eleventh century]], most accounts and depictions of shields up to the beginning of the [[twelfth century]] contain little or no evidence of their heraldic character.  For example, the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], illustrating the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066, and probably commissioned about [[1077]], when the cathedral of Bayeux was rebuilt,{{efn-lr|This was undertaken by Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and half-brother of William I, whose conquest of England is commemorated by the tapestry.}} depicts a number of shields of various shapes and designs, many of which are plain, while others are decorated with dragons, crosses, or other typically heraldic figures.  Yet no individual is depicted twice bearing the same arms, nor are any of the descendants of the various persons depicted known to have borne devices resembling those in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;John Woodward and George Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign'', W. &amp; A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The animals of the "barbarian" ([[Eurasian nomads|Eurasian]]) predecessors of heraldic designs are likely to have been used as [[totemism|clan symbol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"They [animal style designs] have also been explained as totems venerated by the various clans of nomads as ancestors. Their transformation into clan symbols would have followed naturally and easily. The heraldic beasts of medieval chivalry, which include many deer and felines like those on the British royal coat of arms, may certainly be traces back to emblematic devices of later barbarian tribes from central Asia" Hugh Honour, John Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (2005), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qGb4pyoseH4C&amp;pg=PT166  p. 166].&lt;/ref&gt;
Adopted in [[Germanic art|Germanic tradition]] around the [[Germanic Iron Age|fifth century]],&lt;ref&gt;
Danuta Shanzer, Ralph W Mathisen (2013) ''Romans, Barbarians, and the Transformation of the Roman World: Cultural Interaction and the Creation of Identity in Late Antiquity'', [https://books.google.ch/books?id=1jNRbpoQOscC&amp;pg=PA322  p. 322].&lt;/ref&gt; they were re-interpreted in a  [[Germanic Christianity|Christian context]] in the western kingdoms of [[Francia|Gaul]] and [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Italy]] in the [[sixth century|sixth]] and [[seventh century|seventh centuries]].  

During the eleventh century, crosses appearing on seals of Spanish princes and were used for authentication privileges until King Alfonso VII started using a lion (1126), alluding to the name of his main realm ''[[Lion|lion]]'' ({{lang-es|león}}), an example of [[canting arms]].&lt;ref&gt;The actual etymology of ''[[Kingdom of León|León]]'' is ''[[Roman legion]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Emblem of the kingdom of León of Alfonso IX of Leon.jpg|thumb|A lion ''[[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant]] [[purpure]]'', device of Alfonso IX ''(Tumbo A)''.]]
The lion as a heraldic charge is present from the very earliest development of [[heraldry]] in the 12th century. One of the earliest known examples of armory as it subsequently came to be practiced decorates the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield with golden lions rampant and wearing a blue helmet adorned with another lion.  A chronicle dated to about 1175 states that Geoffrey was given a badge of a gold lion when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128.&lt;ref&gt;C. A.

Alfonso VII's use of the lion as a heraldic emblem for León predates the earliest surviving [[Royal Arms of England]], a single lion visible on a half-shield depicted on the [[Great Seal of the Realm|First Great Seal]] (1189) of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]],&lt;ref name="Ailes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ailes |first=Adrian |title=The Origins of The Royal Arms of England|year=1982 |publisher=Graduate Center for Medieval Studies, University of Reading |location=Reading |pages=52–3, 64–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the three pale blue [[Lion (heraldry)|lions]] [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant]] of [[Coat of arms of Denmark|Denmark]] (ca. 1194),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartholdy|first1=Nils G.|title=Denmark's Arms and Crown|date=1995|publisher=[[Ministry of Culture (Denmark)|Ministry of Culture]]|location=Copenhagen|isbn=87-87361-20-5|page=16|url=https://www.sa.dk/aflevering-arkivet/statslige/kongekrone-rigsvaaben-brug-af|accessdate=26 May 2017|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[heraldry of the Holy Roman Empire]] (ca. 1200)&lt;ref name="DIEM"&gt;{{cite web|first= P.|last=Diem|url=http://peter-diem.at/History/doppeladler.htm |title=''Die Entwicklung des österreichischen Doppeladlers'' |language=german |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National emblem of France#History|French fleurs-de-lis]] coat (1211)&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau|Pastoureau, Michel]] (1997) ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series.

That Alfonso VII took the lion on his banners and arms was due to the dominance of León in the kingdom. When other parts of the ''Chronica'' refer to the raising the royal standards in the taken enemy fortress, it is referring to some flags which depicted the lion. It is disputed whether this animal represented to the monarch or kingdom, in the first case the strength of the sovereign but it seems a clearer identification between the words "''Legio''" and "''leo''" that would imply the adoption of the feline as image of the city and the kingdom. In favour of the second hypothesis is the fact that in the author of the ''Chronica'' made a rhyme  with the words "''legionis''" and "''leonis''".

=== Historical characteristics of the lion and the flag ===

The flag used in the [[Middle Ages]] is nothing like current ones. The lion was passant instead of [[Attitude (heraldry)#Rampant|rampant]]. All lions that appear on coins, devices and seals of Leonese monarchs are passant (sometimes [[Attitude (heraldry)#Positions indicating direction|dexter]], others [[Attitude (heraldry)#Positions indicating direction|sinister]]). There are two exceptions, the lions rampant depicted on shields of [[Ferdinand II of León|Ferdinand II]] and [[Alfonso IX]] in their respective representations of the ''Tumbo A Manuscript'' of [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]]. These cases show lions rampant, the reason is that the heraldic charges should always arranged in such a way that they take up the greater part of the field. In the case of a shield/coat of arms, the size a lion passant is equivalent to one-third of the field. However, the figure in a vertical position, and enlarged, the figure takes up the available space. This also avoids ''[[horror vacui]]'', dominant in the medieval art, filling of the entire surface of a space or an artwork with detail.

Relative to the [[Tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] of the lion, in the representations of the ''Tumbo A Manuscript'', under the effigies of the monarchs are two lions passant in an attitude of attack and their color is [[purpure]]. 

In the case of Alfonso IX, this lion is framed in a flag whose background is ''[[argent]]'' and has a narrow purple border. In addition, on the shield carrying by the monarch, the lion is that same tincture and the background is ''argent'' and the two lions passant que shown in the saddle have the same colors. The purple lion and the field argent were retained after the [[Crown of Castile|union]] with the [[Kingdom of Castile]] ([[1230]])&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Woodcock &amp; John Martin Robinson.

There was no space for two visible lions passant at quarterings, so them were rampant to take up the divisions completely. This is the disposition of the lions that has come to the present day on the [[coat of arms of Castile and León]], but the crowned lions were adopted by King [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] (1284-[[1295]]).&lt;ref&gt;Menéndez-Pidal de Navascués, Faustino (1999) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cfjHMK1BEE4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=leones+y+castillos+men%C3%A9ndez+pidal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M3eLqLOENf&amp;sig=XYzG_HieCNGICKuzBW-a2eAvtfo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zFr1S5TPG9KWOKWWrYkJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Leones y castillos: emblemas heráldicos en España]'' [Lions and castles: heraldic emblems in Spain], Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid.

The heraldic standard of the Leonese Monarch. It's one of the oldest heraldic flags; the documentation for the colours dates from ca. 1150. This flag, as an standard was not rectangular: it was a [[Swallowtail (flag)|swallow-tailed]] flag and the [[flag terminology|fly]] edge is pointed. It consisted of a lion passant purple filled the greater part of the field. The background was white, or grey very light (''Argent'').

Armies from [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Extremadura]], [[Asturias]], [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galician]] and even the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilians]] fought under this flag at times of King Alfonso VII, but it was not until [[1065]] that the County of Castile was separated from León and became a kingdom in its own right. León kept this sign, but Castile was forced to create a new one. In the beginning the Castilians used a simple cross until the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] ([[1212]]) when [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor of England]], wife of [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]], designed the [[canting arms]] of the Kingdom of Castile: [[gules]], a three towered castle [[Or (heraldry)|or]], masoned [[sable]] and ajouré [[azure (heraldry)|azure]].&lt;ref name="Menendez"&gt; Menéndez-Pidal de Navascués, Faustino (2004) ''El Escudo de España'' [The coat of arms of Spain], Real Academia Matritense de Heráldica y Genealogía, Madrid.

== Current coats of arms ==

The '''[[blazon]]''' of the arms of the [[Province of León|province of León]] is: ''Argent a lion rampant [[Gules]] crowned, langued and armed Or''. The provincial arms has as [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] a former royal crown, without [[Half-arch (crown)|arches]], orb and cross (used until the [[16th century]]). The arms of the [[León, Spain|city of León]] is described as follows: ''Argent a lion rampant Purpure, langued and armed Gules''. The arms of the capital of the province has a [[Coronet|marquesal coronet]] instead the former royal crown, are ornamented and the lion is not crowned.

Ferdinand III received the Kingdom of Castile from his mother, Queen [[Berengaria of Castile|Berengaria]] in 1217 and the Kingdom of León from his father [[Alfonso IX of León|Alfonso IX]] in 1230. From then on the two kingdoms were united under the name of the Crown of Castile. After the adoption of the quartering of the two kingdoms, King [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] (1284-[[1295]]) introduced the crown on the head of the lion in the Leonese quarters. The field of the Castilian arms has led to the lion began to be wrongly ''gules'' (red).&lt;ref name="Menendez"/&gt; The [[1833 territorial division of Spain]] divided the country into [[provinces of Spain|provinces]].&lt;ref name=Decreto&gt;{{es icon}} [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Real_Decreto_de_30_de_noviembre_de_1833 ''Real Decreto de 30 de noviembre de 1833''] on Wikisource;&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/docs/1833-12-03%20Decreto%20de%20division%20provincial.pdf ''Real Decreto de 30 de noviembre de 1833''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722105020/http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/docs/1833-12-03%20Decreto%20de%20division%20provincial.pdf |date=2012-07-22 }} on the official web site of the government of the Canary Islands, accessed 2009-12-31. &lt;br&gt; Original announcement in the [http://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1833/154/A00657-00658.pdf ''Gaceta num. 154.''] on the [http://www.boe.es/ ''Agencia Estatal Boletin Oficial del Estado of Spain''].&lt;/ref&gt; It was necessary to distinguish between the arms of the city and province. So it was decided to remove the crown to the lion used by the city, recovering the original.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The origin of the current flag is unknown, but probably not too old. The [[Royal Standard of Spain#History|crimson flag with the royal arms in the center]], proper of the Crown of Castile and the [[Monarchy of Spain|Hispanic Monarchy]] and it responds to a fairly late use. Secondly, the first description of a similar standard was found by the writer and linguist Waldo Merino Rubio in the ''Act of February 18, 1789'' of the Book of the Municipal Agreements (''Filandón, Diario de León'' June 5, 1987). According to ''Act February 18, 1789'' the standard of the city was crimson, with six small escutcheons ''Argent'' with lions ''Or'' and silk. In the past, it was frequently to renew the standards kept by the councils in every royal proclamation, so the number of escutcheons were variable. Something back is the standard that is kept in the office of the Mayor of León with the arms of the city, with a lion ''Or'' and two small escutcheons at the edges embroidered on crimson [[damask]]. According the historian Ricardo Chao, this was the standard of the city of León and served as a model for the current Leonese flag in the [[19th century|nineteenth Century]]. After a time, it also became in the symbol of the province and the historical region of León. During the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] a Leonese autonomy movement arose. This Leonesism movement uses a purple flag charged with a coat of arms in the center containing a crowned ''Purpure'' lion and a former royal crown as crest. The Leonese sovereigntist movement included the arms used by the autonomy movement within a yellow star and without crowns.&lt;ref name="chaoblog"/&gt;

==Biography==
Murrill was born in [[London]]. He studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] from 1925 to 1928 and thereafter was [[organ scholar]] at [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], from 1928 to 1931. In 1933 he married the concert pianist Alice Margaret Good. Murrill's second wife was the cellist Vera Canning. He was for a time in the 1930s organist of Christ Church, Lancaster Gate, London and St Thomas's Church, Regent Street, London.

From 1933 until his death, he was Professor of Composition in the Royal Academy of Music. He was for a time in the late 1930s Musical Director of [[Group Theatre (London)|The Group Theatre.]] He also worked for the [[BBC]] from 1936 onwards (save for a period in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] between 1942 and 1946, during part of which he time he served at [[Bletchley Park]]), reaching the post of Head of Music in 1950. He died in London.

==Musical works==
His works include a [[jazz]] [[opera]], ''Man in Cage'', which was performed in 1930 while he was still at university. He wrote film scores for ''[[And So To Work]]'' (1936) and ''[[The Daily Round]]'' (1937), both early films from the director [[Richard Massingham]], as well as incidental music for two plays by [[W. H. Auden]], ''[[The Dance of Death (Auden)|The Dance of Death]]'' and ''[[The Dog Beneath the Skin]]''. He wrote two cello concertos, of which the second ''The Song of the Birds'' (1951), written for and dedicated to [[Pablo Casals]] and quoting [[:ca:El cant dels ocells|the popular Catalan song of the same name]], has been called his "masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Foreman, liner notes on the premiere recording of the work (Raphael Wallfisch [cello], BBC Concert Orchestra, c. Vernon Handley) on White Line Classics CD WHL2153&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote some chamber and vocal works, as well as several piano pieces.

However, his most frequently performed works now are his choral and organ works: his setting of the ''[[Magnificat]]'' and ''[[Nunc dimittis]]'' in E major (published in 1947), an [[Organ (music)|organ]] piece called ''Carillon'', and his arrangement for organ of the orchestral march ''[[Crown Imperial (march)|Crown Imperial]]'' by [[William Walton]]. His piano duet arrangement of Walton's [[Symphony No. 1 (Walton)|First Symphony]] was published by OUP. He was also responsible for the official, martial orchestral version of the [[Jana Gana Mana|Indian national anthem]], approved by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] before independence in 1947.

The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' states that Murrill's affinities were Francophile and mildly middle-[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinskian]], both influences tempered by an English take on neo-classicism.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;[http://www.grovemusic.com/ R.

'''Hiram Abiff''' (also '''Hiram Abif''' or the '''Widow's son''') is the central character of an [[allegory]] presented to all candidates during the third degree in [[Freemasonry]]. 

Hiram is presented as the chief [[architect]] of [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's Temple]], who is murdered in the Temple he designed by three ruffians as they unsuccessfully attempt to force him to divulge the Master Masons' secret passwords. The themes of the allegory are the importance of fidelity, and the certainty of death.

==The Masonic legend of Hiram Abiff==
[[File:St John's Church, Chester - Hiram-Fenster 2.jpg|thumb|Architect Hiram, St. John's Church, Chester (1900)]]
[[File:Baumeister-Hiram-Erbauer-des-Salomonischen-Tempels.png|thumb|Bronze statue by Nickolaus-Otto Kruch, Berlin, Germany (2013)]]
The tale of Hiram Abiff as passed down in Masonic Lodges underpins the third degree. It starts with his arrival in [[Jerusalem]], and his appointment by Solomon as chief architect and master of works at the construction of his temple. As the temple is nearing completion, three fellowcraft masons from the workforce ambush him as he leaves the building, demanding the secrets of a master mason. Hiram is challenged by each in turn, and at each refusal to divulge the information his assailant strikes him with a mason's tool (differing between jurisdictions). He is injured by the first two assailants, and struck dead by the last.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/legend_hiram_abif.html Pietre Stones] Kent Henderson, The Legend of Hiram Abif, retrieved 14 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

His murderers hide his body under a pile of rubble, returning at night to move the body outside the city, where they bury it in a shallow grave marked with a sprig of acacia. As the Master is missed the next day, Solomon sends out a group of fellowcraft masons to search for him. The loose acacia is accidentally discovered, and the body exhumed to be given a decent burial. The hiding place of the "three ruffians" is also discovered, and they are brought to justice. Solomon informs his workforce that the secret word of a master mason is now lost.  He replaces them with substitutes. The actual word is considered a secret by Masons, but for hundreds of years various "revelations" of the word have been made, usually all differing from each other.  One such "revelation" is "Mach-benak" or "decay-apparently" based on gestures given and words spoken upon the discovery of Hiram's body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/morgan/morg14.htm William Morgan, Illustrations of Freemasonry, 1827] Second section of Master Mason lecture, retrieved 14 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Such is the general legend as related in the Anglo-American jurisdictions.

In [[Continental Freemasonry]] the tale is slightly different: a large number of master masons (not just Hiram) are working on the Temple, and the three ruffians are seeking the passwords and signs that will give them a higher wage. The result is the same, but this time it is master masons who find the body. The secrets are not lost, but Solomon orders them buried under the Temple, inscribed on Hiram's grave, and the same substitution is made as a mark of respect. The secrets "lost" in the other tradition are here given to new master masons as part of their ritual. In this version, Hiram is often renamed Adoniram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reunir.free.fr/fm/rituels.htm Rituels] French language collection of ritual, 18th-early 19th century, retrieved 14 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson's revised 1738 Constitutions describe the place of the Deputy Grand Master, to the left of the newly installed Grand Master [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu]], as the "Chair of Hiram Abiff".&lt;ref&gt;James Anderson, The New Book of Constitutions, 1738, p.113 in Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha, vol VII, 1890&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hirams in the Bible ==

In the [[Hebrew Bible]] or [[Old Testament]], there are three separate instances of people named Hiram that were involved in the construction of the temple of Solomon:

* [[Hiram I|Hiram]], King of the realm of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] (today, in the modern nation of [[Lebanon]]), is credited in [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]] 5:11 and 1 Kings 5:1-10 for having sent building materials and men for the original construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. In the Masonic drama,  "Hiram, King of Tyre" is clearly distinguished from "Hiram Abiff". The former is clearly a king and the latter clearly a master craftsman. They can be confused in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 5 &amp; 7:13-46 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%205,7:13-46&amp;version=NIV and 2 Chronicles 2:1-14 &amp; 4:11-16 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%202:1-14,4:11-16&amp;version=NIV&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[1 Kings]] 7:13–14, Hiram is described as the son of a widow from the tribe of [[Naphtali]] who was the son of a Tyrian bronze worker, sent for by Solomon to cast the bronze furnishings and ornate decorations for the new temple. From this reference, Freemasons often refer to Hiram (with the added Abiff) as "the widow's son." Hiram cast these bronzes in clay ground in the plain of the Jordan between [[Sukkot (place)|Succoth]] and [[Zaretan|Zarethan/Zeredathah]] (1 Kings 7:46-47).
* [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 2:13-14 relates a formal request from King Solomon of Jerusalem to King Hiram I of Tyre, for workers and for materials to build a new temple. King Hiram (Huram in Chronicles) responds "And now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, ''Ḥuram 'abi.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebrewoldtestament.com/B14C002.htm#V13 |title=http://www.hebrewoldtestament.com/B14C002.htm#V13 |publisher=Hebrewoldtestament.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre), skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your skillful men and with the skillful men of my lord David your father."&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 2:13-14, New King James Version - From [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=14&amp;chapter=2&amp;version=50 BibleGateway.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase italicised above is translated in the [[New King James Version]] as "Huram my master craftsman". Most translations of this passage take the "'ab-" in "'abi" as the construct state of 'abba, here translated as master. Older translations preferred to translate "'ab-" as father. The common translation of the -i suffix is "my", giving the problematic reading that Hiram was sending his own father, also called Hiram. This is found in the [[Vulgate]], the [[Douay–Rheims Bible]] and in [[Wycliffe's Bible]].&lt;ref name="studylight.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studylight.org/desk/?l=en&amp;query=2+Chronicles+2&amp;section=0&amp;translation=vul&amp;oq=2ch%25202&amp;new=1&amp;nb=2ch&amp;ngt=Go+To%3A&amp;ng=2&amp;ncc=2|title=Search results for '2 Chronicles 2' using the 'Jerome's Latin Vulgate (405)' - Bible Search - Reference Desk - StudyLight.org|work=StudyLight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other reading is as the old Hebrew genitive, and some variant of "of my father" is found in the [[Septuagint]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx/Chronicles%20II/index.htm |title=Chronicles II |publisher=Ecmarsh.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bishop's Bible]] and the [[Geneva Bible]].&lt;ref name="studylight.org"/&gt; In his 1723 "Constitutions", [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]] announced that many problems with this text would be solved by reading "'abi" as the second part of a proper name, which he rendered as "Hiram Abif",&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/25/ Anderson's 1723 Constitutions, in Franklin's 1734 reprint] retrieved 14 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; agreeing with the translations of [[Martin Luther]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lutherbibel.net/ |title=Biblia 1545 Ausgabe Letzter Hand |publisher=Lutherbibel.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Miles Coverdale|Miles Coverdale's]] reading of 2 Chronicles 4:16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studylight.org/desk/?t=en_mcb&amp;q=2%20Chronicles%204 Coverdale Bible] 2 Chronicles 4:16, retrieved 20 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other accounts of a biblical Hiram ==

[[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (Chapter 8:76) refers to Hiram as τεχνίτης, artificer, craftsman. "Now Solomon sent for an artificer out of Tyre, whose name was Hiram: he was by birth of the tribe of [[Naphtali]], on his mother's side (for she was of that tribe); but his father was Ur, of the stock of the Israelites."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-8.htm Sacred Texts] Flavius Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', Book VIII (in this version chapter 3 para 4 contains v76) retrieved 20 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Targum Sheni]], an [[Aramaic]] commentary on the [[Book of Esther]] written sometime between the [[fall of Rome]] and the [[Crusades]], credits Hiram with the construction of a miraculous [[throne]] for Solomon, which in Esther's time is being used by the descendants of [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Paulus Cassel (tr. A. Bernstein), An Explanatory Commentary on Esther, Edinburgh, 1888, pp267-275&lt;/ref&gt;

The most elaborate version of the legend occurs in [[Gérard de Nerval|Gérard de Nerval's]] 1851 account, ''[[Voyage to the Orient|Voyage en Orient]]'', where he relates the tale, inserting all the masonic passwords, as part of the story of [[Balkis]], the "Queen of the Morning" and "[[Islamic view of Solomon|Soliman]]", Prince of the [[Jinn|Genii]]. This is an elaboration of the second version above, where the Master Craftsman is named [[Adoniram]]. Before his death, he undergoes mystical adventures as his tale is interwoven with that of Solomon and Balkis, the [[Queen of Sheba]]. The ruffians who kill him are under the instruction of Solomon himself. De Nerval relates the story as having been told in an Eastern coffee house over a two-week period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/womenofcairoscen011741mbp The Women Of Cairo, Scenes Of Life In The Orient, Volume Two] English translation of Gerard de Nerval, Voyage en Orient (1851), Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co, New York, 1930, pp244-380&lt;/ref&gt; A similar account is given in [[Charles William Heckethorn]]'s ''The Secret Societies of all Ages and Countries'', where Solomon plots to destroy Hiram because of the mutual love between Hiram and the Queen of Sheba.&lt;ref&gt;Charles William Heckethorn, The Secret Societies of all Ages and Countries, London, 1897, Vol ii, pp3-7&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in 1862, the whole adventure of Adoniram's love for Balkis and his murder by three workmen in the pay of Solomon had been set to music in [[Charles Gounod]]'s opera, ''[[La reine de Saba]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charles-gounod.com/la-reine-de-saba.html Charles Gounod.com ''La Reine de Saba''], accessed 26 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other theories ==
[[File:Sequenre tao.JPG|thumb|Lomas and Knight claim the wounds of Sequenre Tao II make him a match for Hiram Abiff]]

According to authors [[Robert Lomas]] and [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]], the prototype for Hiram Abiff was the Egyptian king [[Seqenenre Tao II]], who (they claim) died in an almost identical manner.&lt;ref name=HiramKey&gt;Lomas, Robert and Chris Knight. ''The Hiram Key.'' Arrow Books LTD, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea is dismissed by most Masonic scholars.

In his book ''[[The Sufis]]'', the [[Afghan]] scholar [[Idries Shah]] suggested that [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] might have been the origin of the character Hiram Abiff in the masonic [[Master Mason ritual]]. The link, he believes, was through the [[Sufi order|Sufi sect]] [[Al-Banna]] ("The Builders") who built the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and the [[Dome of the Rock]] in Jerusalem. This fraternity could have influenced some early masonic guilds which borrowed heavily from the [[Arab architecture|Oriental architecture]] in the creation of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=The Sufis|year=1971|publisher=Anchor|isbn=0-385-07966-4|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French masonic historian [[Paul Naudon]] has highlighted the similarity between the death of Hiram and the murder of [[Renaud de Montauban]] in the late 12th Century [[chanson de geste]], ''[[The Four Sons of Aymon]]''. Renaud, like his prototype Saint [[Reinold]], was killed by a hammer-blow to the head while working as a mason at [[Cologne Cathedral]], and his body hidden by his murderers before being miraculously re-discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Naudon, The Secret History of Freemasonry, Bear, 2005, footnote p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown whether he was an actual historical person or a legendary figure. According to the Aztec chronicles he was the wisest man in Tollan, city of the Toltecs which may or may not be identical with the archeological site of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], and he owned many sacred books (called ''teoamoxtli'' in [[Nahuatl]]).

Huematzin's name is in a manuscript by the indigenous scholar and nobleman [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]], "Relaciones Históricas", written some time around 1600.

{{Use Indian English|date=July 2017}} '''Indian Gorkhas''' ({{lang-ne|भारतीय गोर्खा}}, '''Bharatiya Gorkha''') also known as '''Nepali-Indian''' ({{lang-ne|नेपाली भारतीय}}) are [[Nepali language]]-speaking [[Indian people|Indian citizens]]. The term "Indian Gorkha" is used to differentiate the [[Gorkhas]] of [[India]] from the [[Gurkhas]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110519065925/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/3/9/00004432.pdf India and Nepal.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[Gorkhas]]&lt;/b&gt;=Indian Born Citizens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[Nepalis|Nepalese]]&lt;/b&gt;=Nepal Born Citizens&lt;/p&gt;
Indian Gorkhas are citizens of India as per the gazette notification of the Government of India on the issue of citizenship of the Gorkhas of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gorkhalandstate.blogspot.com/p/gazette-notification-on-issue-of.html|title=Gorkhaland: Gazette Notification on the Issue of Citizenship of Gorkhas|website=Gorkhaland|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Indian Gorkhas are faced with a unique identity crisis with regard to their Indian citizenship because of the [[1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship|Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1950)]] that permits "on a reciprocal basis, the nationals of one country in the territories of the other the same privileges in the matter of residence, ownership of property, participation in trade and commerce, movement and other privileges of a similar nature". Thus, there are also many Nepalese citizens of [[Nepal]] living in India. Therefore, the Nepali-speaking Indian citizens are mistakenly identified as Nepalese citizens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darjeelingtimes.com/opinions/political/5163-flawed-media-reporting-hurts-gorkha-community-.html ‘Flawed’ media reporting hurts Gorkha community&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}

The Indian Gorkhas are a mixture of castes and tribal-ethnic clans. The caste groups include the [[Khas people|Khas-Parbatiyas]] including [[Bahun]] (Brahmins), [[Chhetri]], [[Kami (caste)|Kami]], [[Damai]], [[Sarki (ethnic group)|Sarki]], etc. There is a considerable presence of [[Newar people|Newar (Pradhan)]], [[Gurung]], [[Magars|Magar]], [[Tamang]], [[Thami]], [[Bhujel|Bhujel (Khawas)]], [[Rai people|Rai (Khambu)]], [[Limbu people|Limbu (Subba)]], [[Sunuwar|Sunuwar (Mukhia)]], [[Yakkha|Yakkha (Dewan)]], [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]], and [[Yolmo people|Yolmo]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gorkhas and Gorkhaland |year=2012 |publisher=Parbati Roy Foundation |location=Darjeeling, India |url=http://barunroy.com/the-librar/all-written-works/gorkhas-and-gorkhaland/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130110164033/http://barunroy.com/the-librar/all-written-works/gorkhas-and-gorkhaland/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-10 |author=Barun Roy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although each of them have their own language (belonging to the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] or Indo-Aryan languages), the [[lingua franca]] among the Gorkhas is the [[Nepali language]] with its script in [[Devnagari]], is one of the [[Languages with official status in India|official languages of India]].

===Forced displacement===

Nepalis in India have faced violence and ethnic cleansing, especially in the north-eastern states. In 1967, more than 8,000 Nepalis were driven out of Mizoram, while more than 2,000 in Manipur met with the same fate in 1980. Tens of thousands of Nepalis were banished from Assam (in 1979) and Meghalaya (in 1987) by the local militia groups&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=58WkvXaaPbEC&amp;pg=PA234&lt;/ref&gt;. The biggest displacement occurred in Meghalaya, when the Khasi Students' Union (KSU) targeted Nepalis living in the eastern part of the state. More than 15,000 Nepalis were driven out (mostly to Nepal), while about 10,000 were reduced to living in subhuman life in the refugee camps of Shillong&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19880215-nepalis-in-meghalaya-face-tribal-wrath-amid-official-apathy-796950-1988-02-15&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2010, there were riots between Khasis and the Gorkhas, which left several Gorkhas dead. One elderly Gorkha man was burnt alive&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.com.np/2010/06/08/khasi-nepali-ethnic-conflict-in-meghalaya-india/&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Joseph Walter Jackson''' (July 26, 1927 – June 28, 2018) was an American [[talent manager]] and patriarch of the [[Jackson family]] of entertainers that includes his children [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] and [[Janet Jackson|Janet]]. He was inducted into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame]] as a member of the class of 2014.

==Early life and ancestry==
Joseph Walter Jackson was born to Samuel Jackson (1893–1993), a schoolteacher,{{clarify|date=July 2018}} and Crystal Lee King (1907–1992), in [[Fountain Hill, Arkansas]], on July 26, 1928 (although, according to the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame and [[Katherine Jackson]]'s book, ''My Family, The Jacksons'', the year was 1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arblackhalloffame.org/honorees/joseph-joe-jackson/ |title=Arkansas Black Hall of Fame |website=Arblackhalloffame.org |date= |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jetzi-mjvideo.com/books-jetzi-04/kj/kj0a.html |title=JETZI : My Family, The Jacksons |website=Jetzi-mjvideo.com |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Jackson was the son of Israel Nero Jackson, a former slave. Nero’s father was July “Jack” Gale, a [[Choctaw Indians|Choctaw]] who was known to heal people. Jack fell in love with a slave named Gina Milam and had their first son Israel Gale, who later changed his surname to “Jackson” in honour of his father. Joseph Jackson was the eldest of five children. He was of African and Native American Ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schilling|first1=Vincent|title=Michael Jackson &amp; Rosa Parks: 10 Black People With Native Ancestry|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/culture/social-issues/10-african-americans-with-native-ancestry/|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson recalled from early childhood that his father was domineering and strict, and he described himself in his memoir, ''The Jacksons'', as a "lonely child that had only few friends". After his parents separated when he was twelve, his mother, two brothers, and sister moved to [[East Chicago, Indiana]], a suburb outside Chicago in [[Northwest Indiana]], and he moved with his father to [[Oakland, California]].&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite book|title=My Family, the Jacksons|last=Jackson|first=Katherine|author2=Rich Wiseman|publisher=[[St. Martin's Paperbacks]]|year=1990|isbn=0-312-92350-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 18, after his father remarried, he moved to East Chicago to live with his mother, two brothers, and sister.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; He soon got a job in East Chicago at [[Inland Steel Company]],&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; but did not finish high school. While in East Chicago, he began to pursue his dreams of becoming a [[boxer]] and found success with the [[Golden Gloves|Golden Gloves program]].&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; While he was preparing for a professional boxing career, he met 17-year-old [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine Scruse]], who also lived in East Chicago and attended [[Washington High School (East Chicago, Indiana)|Washington High School]];&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; Joe married another woman and in less than a year he was divorced before he started dating Katherine.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

Joseph and Katherine were married on November 5, 1949. In January 1950, they purchased a small two-bedroom home on 2300 Jackson Street near East Chicago in [[Gary, Indiana]].&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;&lt;ref name="starting-a-family"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/joseph-jackson-467150#starting-a-family |title=Starting a Family |website=Biography.com |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacksons' first child, Maureen Reillette "Rebbie" Jackson, was born four months later on May 29, 1950, in the Jackson house.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; Still employed at Inland Steel, Jackson left his hopes of becoming a professional boxer in order to support his family, and began working there as a full-time crane operator.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; He later took a second part-time job at American Foundries in East Chicago.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; In the meantime, his wife Katherine tended to their growing family. Eventually in the late 1950s she started working part-time at [[Sears]] in Gary.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; The Jacksons would go on to have ten children (their son Brandon Jackson died just after he was born).&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; During the early 1950s, Jackson briefly performed with his own blues band The Falcons&lt;!-- not the same as the Detroit group --&gt;, playing guitar.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; Despite their efforts, The Falcons did not get a recording deal and subsequently broke up after one of their members, Thornton "Pookie" Hudson, founded his own band in 1952. That band would go on to become a successful [[doo-wop]] group named [[The Spaniels]].&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

==The Jackson 5==
{{See also|The Jackson 5}}
Joseph Jackson began working with his sons' musical group in the early 1960s, first working with his three eldest sons, [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]] and [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]].&lt;ref name="thejacksons.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejacksons.com/history/the-jacksons-5-60-68/|title=History 60–68 – The Jacksons – The Official Website|author=|date=|work=thejacksons.com|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger sons [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] and [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] eventually joined the backing band.&lt;ref name="thejacksons.com"/&gt; Joseph began enforcing long and intense rehearsals for his sons. At first, the group went under ''The Jackson Brothers''.&lt;ref name="thejacksons.com"/&gt; Following the inclusions of Marlon and Michael in the group and Michael's increased vocal presence within the group, their name was changed to ''The Jackson 5''.&lt;ref name="thejacksons.com"/&gt; After a couple of years performing in talent contests and high school functions, Joseph booked them in more and more respectable venues until they landed a spot at the renowned [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana45s.com/2010/08/new-jackson-5-photo |title=Jackson 5 and Johnny &amp;#124; |publisher=Indiana45s.com |date=August 28, 2010 |accessdate=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/joseph-jackson-467150#commercial-success |title=Commercial Success |website=Biography.com |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21, 1967, ''The Jackson 5'' were signed by Jackson to their first professional contract with [[Gordon Keith (producer)|Gordon Keith]], owner and first president of [[Steeltown Records]] in Gary, Indiana. The group's first single "[[Big Boy (song)|Big Boy]]," with Michael as the lead singer, was released by Keith on January 31, 1968 on the Steeltown label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45rpmrecords.com/IN/Steeltown.php |title=Steeltown Records – Indiana Local Labels |website=45rpmrecords.com |date=November 4, 2007 |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Big Boy" became a local hit and the brothers became local celebrities after it was played on radio stations in the Chicago-Gary area.&lt;ref name="thejacksons.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackson5abc.com/steeltown/ |title=Big Boy 40 Jackson 5 |website=Jackson5abc.com |date= |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the year, Jackson helped to land his sons an audition for [[Motown Records]] in Detroit.&lt;ref name="thejacksons.com"/&gt; ''The Jackson 5'' were signed with Motown in March 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titojackson.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=44:the-jackson-5-early-days-1965-1969&amp;catid=22&amp;Itemid=125|title=Tito Jackson Official Website – Tito Jackson Official Website|author=|date=|work=titojackson.com|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson later relocated his family to California and supervised every recording session the group made for Motown.&lt;ref name="thejacksons.com"/&gt; The group began to receive nationwide fame after their first single for Motown, "[[I Want You Back]]", hit #1 following its release on October 7, 1969, followed by their first album, ''[[Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5]]'' in December 1969.&lt;ref name="jackson-1969"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejacksons.com/history/the-jackson-5-1969/|title=History 1969 – The Jacksons – The Official Website|author=|date=|work=thejacksons.com|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Jackson 5's first four singles, "I Want You Back" (''The Jackson 5'', 1969), "[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]" (''The Jackson 5'', 1970), "[[The Love You Save]]" (''The Jackson 5'', 1970), and "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" (''The Jackson 5'', 1970) sold 10 million copies in 10 months, setting a world record for sales, it became clear to Jackson that his dream to make his sons the first African-American teenagers to become internationally known recording stars had come true.&lt;ref name="jackson-1969"/&gt;

In 1973, wanting to reassert his control, Jackson had his family, including youngest son [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy]], and daughters [[Rebbie Jackson|Rebbie]], [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] and [[Janet Jackson|Janet]] perform at casinos and resorts in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], inspired by the success of fellow family act, [[The Osmonds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejacksons.com/history/the-jackson-5-1974/|title=History 1974 – The Jacksons – The Official Website|author=|date=|work=thejacksons.com|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph had also formed his own record label, ''Ivory Tower International Records'' and signed artists under his management in which they toured internationally with The Jackson 5 as opening acts in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uo8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|title=Jet|date=June 6, 1974|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=October 24, 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the Jackson 5, with the exception of Jermaine, left Motown and signed a lucrative deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Epic Records]]. Michael Jackson had brokered a deal where they could eventually produce their own songs, leading to Motown retaining the Jackson 5 name, so they renamed themselves ''The Jacksons'' in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warr.org/jacksons.html|title=Jackson 5 (and solo work)|author=|date=|work=warr.org|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Joseph's youngest son, Randy, released his solo single "How Can I Be Sure" on Joseph's record label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Randy-Jackson-How-Can-I-Be-Sure/release/5698885|title=Randy Jackson – How Can I Be Sure|author=|date=|work=discogs.com|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Joseph established [[Janet Jackson]]'s career at age 16 as a recording artist while managing her.&lt;ref name="JJ by Cornwell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornwell|first=Jane|title=Janet Jackson|publisher=[[Carlton Books]]|year=2002|pages=2, 10, 24|isbn=1-84222-464-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He financed the recording of his daughter's first demo then, arranged her a recording contract with [[A&amp;M Records]] and began recording her debut album, overseen by him.&lt;ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/&gt;

== Marriage ==
Joseph was alleged to have engaged in a lasting [[Affair#Extramarital affair|extramarital affair]]; this prompted Katherine to file for [[divorce]] on March 9, 1973 with a [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] clerk, but she chose to rescind the divorce papers.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/10/29/jacko-family-secrets-revealed.html|title=Jacko's Family Secrets Revealed|first=Roger|last=Friedman|date=October 29, 2004|work=foxnews.com|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Joseph fathered a child with Cheryl Terrell; their daughter, Joh'Vonnie Jackson, was born on August 30, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/michael-jacksons-secret-sister-johvonnie-418441|title=Michael Jackson's secret sister JohVonnie reveals her pain at being shunned by half-siblings|first=Ryan|last=Parry|date=September 14, 2009|work=mirror.co.uk|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Joseph and Cheryl to a 23-year-long affair while raising their daughter Joh'Vonnie.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; Katherine attempted once again to divorce her husband in 1982, but again was persuaded to drop the action. Joseph then moved away to [[Las Vegas]], with Katherine remaining at the Jackson family home ''Hayvenhurst'' in [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino, California]].

==Public image==
In the late 1980s, Joseph's image as a father became tarnished as the media reported stories told by his children that he was abusive towards them. When he managed his family, he allegedly ordered each of them to call him "Joseph", which contributed to several siblings having been estranged from him. Michael Jackson claimed that from a young age he was physically and emotionally abused by his father, enduring incessant rehearsals, whippings and name-calling, but also admitting that his father's strict discipline played a large part in his success.&lt;ref name="MJ's secret childhood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/82010/episode_about.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson's Secret Childhood |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate=June 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915120706/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/82010/episode_about.jhtml |archivedate=September 15, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in a 1993 interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]].

Despite the abuse allegations, Michael honored his father with an annual "Joseph Jackson Day" at [[Neverland Ranch]]&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Jackson's Private Home Movies''&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately forgave him, noting that Joseph's deep-South upbringing during the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] years and working-class adulthood hardened him emotionally and made him push his children to succeed as entertainers.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Michael.

==Later years==
[[File:JosephJackson2007(cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Jackson at an event in 2007]]

In 2011, Jackson was inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arblackhalloffame.org/alphabetical-order/j/|title=J – Arkansas Black Hall of Fame|author=|date=|work=arblackhalloffame.org|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Berlinger Breaux''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|oʊ}}; born March 1, 1944) is an American attorney and retired politician who was a member of the [[United States Senate]] from [[Louisiana]] from 1987 until 2005. He was also a member of the [[US House of Representatives]] from 1972 to 1987. He was considered one of the more [[conservative Democrat|conservative]] national legislators from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Breaux was a member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]]. After his congressional tenure, he became a lobbyist, co-founding the Breaux-Lott Leadership Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/71291-trent-lott-keeps-his-southern-ties-through-lobbying |title=Trent Lott keeps his Southern ties through lobbying|first=Ashley|last=Perks|date=December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm was later acquired by law and lobbying firm Patton Boggs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/01/AR2010070105008.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Dan | last=Eggen | title=Patton Boggs lobbying firm buys group run by Lott, Breaux | date=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; now [[Squire Patton Boggs]].

== Early life and career ==
Breaux was born in [[Crowley, Louisiana]], on March 1, 1944. He graduated from the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|University of Southwestern Louisiana (now called the University of Louisiana at Lafayette)]] in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] in 1964 and from [[Louisiana State University Law School]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1967. After graduation, he practiced law, and then served as an assistant to U.S. Representative [[Edwin Edwards]]. He was also a member of [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] Fraternity.

==Breaux in Congress==
Breaux was elected as a Democrat to the [[92nd United States Congress]] in a [[special election]] on September 30, 1972, to fill the vacancy created by Edwards' resignation in order to become governor. Breaux's campaign manager was [[Ron Faucheux]], a recent graduate of [[Georgetown University]] and later a member of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] and a nationally known political consultant and [[pundit]] from [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalpublications.net/page.php?D=ct_pd_2920&amp;DP=d3b3c037|title=Political Publications: The Debate Book|publisher=politicalpublications.net|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of twenty-eight, Breaux was the youngest member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Breaux was re-elected with ease to the seven succeeding Congresses and served until January 3, 1987.
[[File:Ford A9450 NLGRF photo contact sheet (1976-04-27)(Gerald Ford Library) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Breaux with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976]]
He was not a candidate for re-election to the House of Representatives in 1986, but was instead elected as a Democrat to the [[United States Senate]]. In the 1986 [[jungle primary]], Breaux finished second (447,328 or 37.3 percent) to [[Louisiana's 6th congressional district|Sixth District]] Republican Congressman W. [[Henson Moore]], III, of [[Baton Rouge]] (529,433 or 44.2 percent). State Senator [[Samuel B. Nunez, Jr.|Samuel B. Nunez]] polled another 73,504 votes (6.7 percent). In the general election, Breaux turned the tables on Moore: 723,586 (52.8 percent) to 646,311 (47.2 percent), a margin of 77,275 ballots. Thereafter, Moore took a sub-Cabinet position with the administration of [[George H. W. Bush]], and Breaux took the Senate seat that he would hold for eighteen years. Breaux was not seriously opposed in the 1992 and 1998 elections. In the latter contest, current state insurance commissioner [[Jim Donelon]] opposed Breaux, as did perennial candidate [[L.D. Knox]] of [[Winnsboro, Louisiana|Winnsboro]], who in 1979 legally changed his name to "None of the Above" Knox to highlight support for the "None of the Above" option on ballots.

On October 15, 1991, Breaux was one of seven Southern Democrats who voted to confirm the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court in a 52 to 48 vote, the narrowest margin of approval in more than a century.

Breaux was seen as a centrist in a Senate divided along partisan lines, and was frequently sought out by Republican leaders to corral a few Democratic votes when they needed them; conversely he also often served as the Democratic emissary in attempts to gather a few moderate Republicans to win votes on their proposals. He was pro-life and a supporter of Second Amendment rights, though he gradually moderated his position on gun control. He was more conservative on taxes than most in his party and challenged many environmental protections. He voted in favor of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), welfare reform, the [[balanced budget amendment]], and tighter bankruptcy laws. He was a key Democratic supporter of Republican attempts to abolish the [[estate tax]] and in 2001 was among the minority of Democrats to support Bush's tax cut and opposed virtually all attempts by Democrats to alter it. However Breaux had voted with the majority of Democrats in favor of the 1993 Budget. In 2003 he submitted an amendment to reduce the tax cut to $350 billion. In 1995 he notably voted twice with more liberal elements of his party against the widely approved lawsuit reform measures, the Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act and the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]]. Both acts were vetoed by President [[Bill Clinton]], although the second act was passed over his veto.

On June 22, 2004, Breaux cast the lone vote against amendment, S.A. 3464, which would increase the maximum fine from $27,500 to $275,000 when the FCC determines a broadcaster is guilty of "obscene, indecent or profane language." Breaux also opposed the loosening of FCC rules that would allow cross-media platforms in the same community to fall under a single owner.

In 1993, Breaux was elected by Senate Democrats as Deputy Majority Whip, a position he held until his retirement. He also held a number of key Senate committee positions. A senior member of the Finance Committee, Senator Breaux served as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy. From his position on the Finance Committee, he helped build the coalition that passed welfare reform and health insurance reform bills in 1996. He also pushed for a reduction in the capital gains tax and for tax relief for college education expenses. In 1998, Breaux was selected by the White House and House and Senate leaders to chair the [[National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare]]. Also in 1998, Senator Breaux co-chaired the National Commission on Retirement Policy, which produced legislation to help reform Social Security.

Breaux was the principal architect of the $400 billion Medicare Prescription Drug Modernization Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pear |first1=Robert|title=Sweeping Medicare Change Wins Approval in Congress|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/26/politics/26CONG.html |accessdate=October 11, 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=November 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breaux was a founder of the bipartisan [[Senate Centrist Coalition]] and served as chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council.

Breaux's state director and press secretary was the journalist [[Robert Mann (Louisiana)|Robert "Bob" Mann]], who holds the
Douglas Manship Chair of Journalism at Louisiana State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bobmannblog.com/about/|title=About Bob Mann|publisher=bobmannblog.com|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2003 Louisiana gubernatorial campaign, after flirting briefly with the possibility of running himself, Breaux campaigned hard for the successful Democratic candidate, [[Kathleen Babineaux Blanco]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]. That same year, Breaux was inducted into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html |title=Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame |publisher=cityofwinnfield.com |accessdate=August 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703054258/http://cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html |archivedate=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He announced that he would not run for re-election in 2004; by most accounts he was so popular that he would have breezed to a fourth term had he chosen to run again. He was succeeded in the Senate by Republican [[David Vitter]] of suburban [[New Orleans]]. Though Breaux was considered a popular politician in Louisiana, he was unable to dictate his successor in the Senate, as had Russell Long and [[Bennett Johnston, Jr.|J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.]] He endorsed the losing Democratic candidate, [[Chris John]], lawmaker from the same Seventh District that Breaux had earlier represented.

==Since the Senate==
[[File:Presentation of Final Report of the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Transformational Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] with (left to right): [[Thomas R. Pickering|Tom Pickering]], [[John Engler]] and John Breaux at the presentation of Final Report of the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Transformational Diplomacy]]
In February 2005, Breaux took a position as Distinguished Professor in the Douglas Manship School of Mass Communication at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]]. Since 2005, Breaux has been a lobbyist for [[Washington, DC]], firm [[Squire Patton Boggs]], specializing in issues of health care and energy law.

Since leaving office, Breaux has spearheaded his own national campaign, "Ceasefire on Health Care: Finding Common Ground for the Uninsured." Breaux coined the campaign name as a play on the [[CNN]] TV program ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'', which he points out has been canceled. Breaux has hosted multiple events with prominent members of both parties to establish a dialogue that will lead to real healthcare reform. Breaux developed the campaign alongside [[American University]]'s [[Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies]].

Beginning in February 2007, there was much speculation among Louisiana political commentators as to whether Breaux would announce his candidacy in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2007|2007 Louisiana governors' race]]. Breaux, arguably the most popular Democratic politician in Louisiana, was considering entering the race, if Blanco would be willing to step aside for Breaux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Clancy|last=Dubos|title=Breaux ex Machina|work=Gambit Weekly|date=December 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Chris |last=Cillizza |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/22/AR2007022201730.html|title=Breaux to the Rescue?|work=The Washington Post|date=February 23, 2007|accessdate=January 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=John|last=Maginnis |url=http://www.nola.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news-0/1172041792203960.xml?NOEJM&amp;coll=1|title=Desperate Dems look to Breaux again |work=The New Orleans Times-Picayune|date=February 21, 2007|accessdate=January 26, 2006|authorlink=John Maginnis (Louisiana political writer) |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930154733/http://www.nola.com/search/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-0%2F1172041792203960.xml%3FNOEJM&amp;coll=|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.lsureveille.com/media/storage/paper868/news/2007/02/27/News/Breaux.May.Be.Ineligible.For.Governor.Race-2745237.shtml Breaux may be ineligible to run for governor race] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302105244/http://media.www.lsureveille.com/media/storage/paper868/news/2007/02/27/News/Breaux.May.Be.Ineligible.For.Governor.Race-2745237.shtml |date=March 2, 2007 }} Louisiana State University ''The Daily Reveille'' February 27, 2007 Retrieved March 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 2007, Blanco announced that she would not run for re-election as governor. On March 29, 2007, John Breaux made his first Louisiana public appearance since speculation began concerning his potential candidacy. Breaux said that he intended to run, and would announce his candidacy as soon as Louisiana Attorney General [[Charles Foti]], a Democrat, gave a formal legal opinion on whether Breaux was eligible to run. It was alleged that he would not meet the residency requirements to run for governor as he is registered to vote, and has listed his primary address in [[Maryland]] since 2005. At issue was the clause in the Louisiana constitution that states that a candidate for governor must be a 'citizen' of the State of Louisiana; what constitutes a citizen is not defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ed|last=Anderson|url=http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1175234082230740.xml&amp;coll=1&amp;thispage=2|title=Breaux moves forward with campaign|work=New Orleans Times-Picayune|date=March 30, 2007|accessdate=March 30, 2007|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153751/http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-4%2F1175234082230740.xml&amp;coll=1&amp;thispage=2|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 13, 2007, Breaux released a statement that he would not be running for governor. Attorney-General Foti had declined to issue an opinion on Breaux's eligibility, stating it was an issue for the courts to decide. Breaux stated that he did not want the issue of eligibility to overshadow his campaign, as a court challenge would not occur until September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ed |last=Anderson |url=http://blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/04/breaux_says_he_wont_run.html|title=Breaux says he won't run for governor|work=New Orleans Times-Picayune|date=April 13, 2007|accessdate=April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breaux also serves on the Board of Directors for [[CSX Transportation]].

[[Image:Juana Ponce De Leon Smith.gif|right|200px|thumb|Juana Smith, at the age of 17, painted by an unknown artist 1815 in Paris]]
'''Juana María de los Dolores de León Smith, Lady Smith''' (27 March 1798 – 12 October 1872) was the wife of General [[Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet|Sir Harry Smith]], Governor of the [[Cape Colony]].

Born into an old [[Spain|Spanish]] noble family, she was a descendant of [[Juan Ponce de León]].

In 1812, at the age of fourteen, she found herself orphaned and only with a sister, when her home town [[Badajoz]] was [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|besieged]] for the fourth time during the [[Peninsular War]]. After the siege ended in a successful but very bloody storming by the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forces, the sisters sought protection from the plundering and pillaging soldiers by some British officers they found camping outside the city walls. One of them was Brigade-Major [[Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet|Harry Smith]], of the elite [[The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|95th Rifles]] scout regiment, whom she married a few days later.

Instead of letting herself be sent home to her husband's family, she chose to accompany him with the army. She remained with him throughout the rest of the war, accompanying the baggage train, sleeping in the open on the field of battle, riding freely among the troops, and sharing all the privations of campaigning. Her beauty, courage, sound judgment and amiable character endeared her to the officers, including the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], who spoke of her familiarly as Juanita; and she was idolized by the soldiers.

With the exception of his stint in the [[War of 1812|British-American War of 1812]] she accompanied her husband in all his deployments, most notably in two postings in [[South Africa]], where Sir Harry (he had been knighted in the meantime) served as Governor of [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] Colony and High Commissioner.

Juana Smith was given a pension of £500 by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] on 5 December 1848 in recognition of her husband's services to the country.

Known as Lady Smith in her later years, Juana Smith is commemorated directly in the name of [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]] and [[Ladismith]], [[Western Cape]], South-Africa, as well as indirectly in the name of [[Ladysmith, British Columbia|Ladysmith]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.

Lady Smith is sometimes said to have introduced the [[cantaloupe]] or [[muskmelon]] (''Cucumis melo cantalupensis'') to South Africa, where it is known as ''spanspek'' (or ''spanspec'' or ''sponspe(c)k''), which in [[Afrikaans]] literally means 'Spanish bacon' (''Spaanse spek''). However, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' shows that the term 'Spanish bacon' had been in use since at least the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;In J. van Donselaar (1989) Suriname-Dutch Dictionary, the oldest reference to the word is from 1770:&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representations in fiction==
Juana Smith and her husband are the central characters in the historic novel ''[[The Spanish Bride]]'' by [[Georgette Heyer]], which spans the period from just before their meeting after the [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|Battle of Badajoz]] to the aftermath of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in the latter part of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The couple also appear at the end of Georgette Heyer's ''[[An Infamous Army]]'' and are referenced in [[Sheila Walsh (novelist)|Sheila Walsh]]'s historical romance novel ''Improper Acquaintances''. Juana Smith is also briefly noted in the afterword of ''[[Sharpe's Company]]'' by [[Bernard Cornwell]].

Although it focuses primarily on her husband, Juana Smith is a central character in the 1984 book ''[[The Other Side of the Hill]]'' by Peter Luke, which recounts their meeting and first few years of their marriage during the latter part of the Peninsular War and the Waterloo campaign.

==Career==

===1993–2002: Career beginnings and breakthrough===
After getting an agent at the age of six, Knightley began working in commercials and small television roles. Her first on-screen appearance was in the 1993 television film, ''Royal Celebration''. She then played Natasha Jordan, a young girl whose mother is involved in an extramarital affair, in the romantic drama ''[[A Village Affair]]'' (1995). After appearing in a spate of television films through the mid-to-late 1990s, including ''[[Innocent Lies]]'' (1995), ''[[The Treasure Seekers (1996 film)|The Treasure Seekers]]'' (1996), ''[[Coming Home (TV serial)|Coming Home]]'' (1998), and ''[[Oliver Twist (1999 miniseries)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Biography Today, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt; Knightley landed the role of [[List of Star Wars handmaidens#S|Sabé]], [[Padmé Amidala]]'s handmaiden and [[decoy]], in the 1999 science fiction blockbuster ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''. Her dialogue was dubbed over by [[Natalie Portman]], who played Padmé. Knightley was cast in the role because of her close resemblance to Portman; even the two actors' mothers had difficulty telling their daughters apart when they were in full make-up.&lt;ref name="portman"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=MSN Movies| title=Keira Knightley| url=http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity/keira-knightley/?gallery=9700&amp;stab=3| accessdate=17 March 2006| first=Jason| last=Buchanan| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315161136/http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity/keira-knightley/?gallery=9700&amp;stab=3| archivedate=15 March 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her first major role, the 2001 [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] feature film ''[[Princess of Thieves]]'', Knightley played the daughter of [[Robin Hood]]. To prepare for the film, she trained for several weeks in [[archery]], [[fencing]] and [[horse riding]].&lt;ref name="Biography Today, p. 85"&gt;Biography Today, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, she appeared in ''[[The Hole (2001 film)|The Hole]]'', a thriller that received a [[direct-to-video]] release in the United States. The film's director [[Nick Hamm]] described her as "a young version of [[Julie Christie]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hole, The : Production Notes|url=http://cinema.com/articles/351/hole-the-production-notes.phtml|publisher=Cinema.com|accessdate=29 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827014350/http://cinema.com/articles/351/hole-the-production-notes.phtml|archivedate=27 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knightley also took on the role of Lara Antipova in the [[miniseries]] adaptation of ''[[Doctor Zhivago (miniseries)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', which first aired in 2002 to positive reviews and high ratings.&lt;ref name="Doctor Zhivago"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Sunday Herald |title=Keira Knightley |url=http://www.hansmatheson.org/zhivago/zhrev_promise.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001239/http://www.hansmatheson.org/zhivago/zhrev_promise.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Knightley starred as a pregnant drug addict in [[Gillies MacKinnon]]'s drama film ''[[Pure (2002 film)|Pure]]''.

In an interview with [[Tracy Smith (journalist)|Tracy Smith]] she said, "I remember telling friends I was doing this girls' soccer movie [...] And nobody thought that it was gonna be any good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Bend It Like Beckham"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/keira-knightley-2014/6/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=25 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426060523/http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/keira-knightley-2014/6/|archivedate=26 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[James Berardinelli]], who was largely laudatory of the film and the "energetic and likable" cast, noted that Knightley and Nagra brought, "a lot of spirit to their instantly likable characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berardinelli|first1=James|title=Bend it Like Beckham (United States/United Kingdom/Germany, 2002)|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/b/bend_it.html|website=Reelviews|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003–2007: ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and worldwide recognition===
Following the success of ''Bend It Like Beckham'', Knightley landed the role of [[Elizabeth Swann]], in the 2003 American [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[swashbuckler film]] ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''. The film, which was based on the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean attraction]] at [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]], saw Knightley, [[Orlando Bloom]], and [[Johnny Depp]] play the roles of 18th century pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl/ |accessdate=20 October 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022143947/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl/ |archivedate=22 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite boasting the names of Hollywood stars like Depp and Bloom and a hefty $135 million budget, ''Pirates'' was not the most anticipated release of the year, and was expected to fail at the box-office.&lt;ref name="nasahwaty"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nasahwaty|first1=Chris|title=Box Office Buccaneer|url=http://ew.com/article/2003/07/25/how-pirates-fits-johnny-depps-quirky-career/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=27 April 2017|date=25 July 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017212258/http://www.ew.com/article/2003/07/25/how-pirates-fits-johnny-depps-quirky-career|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knightley herself was not optimistic about its prospects: "I remember being on set just sort of going, 'OK, what is this?

Knightley's continued association with period dramas yielded varying results, as seen with two of her 2007 releases, [[François Girard]]'s ''[[Silk (2007 film)|Silk]]'', and [[Joe Wright]]'s ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]'', the feature film adaptations of the novels by [[Alessandro Baricco]] and [[Ian McEwan]] respectively.&lt;ref name="atonement"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=KillerMovies |title=Keira Knightley's 'Atonement' for Focus Features |url=http://www.killermovies.com/a/atonement/articles/6306.html |accessdate=25 August 2008 |date=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the former project failed at the box office, the latter became a critical and commercial success.

{{Kabbalah}}
This page lists figures in [[Kabbalah]] according to historical chronology and schools of thought. In popular reference, Kabbalah has been used to refer to the whole history of [[Jewish mysticism]], but more accurately, and as used in academic [[Jewish studies]], Kabbalah refers to the doctrines, practices and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] [[Exegesis#Judaism|exegetical]] method in [[Torah]], that emerged in 12th-13th century Southern France and Spain, and was developed further in 16th century [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Ottoman Palestine]]. These formed the basis of subsequent Jewish mystical development.

This is a partial list of Jewish Kabbalists; secondary literature incorporating Kabbalah is enormous, particularly in the voluminous library of [[Hasidic Judaism]] that turned esoteric Kabbalah into a popular revivalist movement. Hasidism both adapted Kabbalah to its own internalised psychological concern, and also continued the development of the Jewish mystical tradition. Therefore, only formative articulators of [[Hasidic thought]], or particularly Kabbalistic schools/authors in Hasidism are included here. In the [[Sabbatean]] mystical heresy that broke away from Judaism, only the founders are listed. Solely academic-university [[Jewish studies]] researchers of Jewish mysticism, not being "Kabbalists", nor necessarily Jewish, are not listed here; nor are separate non-Jewish derivative/syncretic traditions of Kabbalah.

Rabbinic figures in Judaism are often known after the name of their magnum opus, or as [[Hebrew acronyms]] based on their name, preceded by R for [[Rabbi]]/[[Rav]].

== Early Jewish mysticism ==

[[Talmudic]] [[tannaic]] sages: ''Maaseh [[Merkabah]]'' (mystical Chariot)-''Maaseh [[Genesis creation narrative|Bereishit]]'' (mystical Creation) (1st-2nd centuries). ''Yordei Merkabah'' (Chariot Riders)-''[[Heikhalot]]'' (Palaces) mysticism (1st-11th centuries). [[Kabbalah: Primary texts|Early-Formative texts]] are variously [[Oral Torah|Traditional]]/Attributed/Anonymous/[[Pseudepigraph]]ical:
* [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]] Traditional attribution of the ''[[Bahir]]''. 1st century
* [[Pardes (legend)|Four Who Entered the Pardes]] (including [[Rabbi Akiva]] c.40–137 CE)
* [[Simeon bar Yochai]] (RaSHBI) Protagonist of the ''[[Zohar]]'' 1st-2nd centuries

[[Hasidei Ashkenaz]] (1150-1250 German Pietists). Mystical conceptions influenced Medieval Kabbalah:
* [[Samuel of Speyer]] (Shmuel HaHasid)  12th century
* [[Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg]] (Yehudah HaHasid) 1140–1217
* [[Eleazar of Worms]] (Eleazar Rokeach) c.1176–1238

'''Luis Aranberri''' ([[Eibar]], 1945), better known as “Amatiño”, is one of the media professionals that best represents the new school of journalism in the [[Basque language]], or Euskara, which emerged around 1970 and which, in step with the creation of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]’s own institutions, was accompanied by the development and consolidation of a Basque news arena that was practically non-existent up to barely one generation ago.

==Background and career==
The opposition to any expression in a language other than [[Spanish language|Spanish]], political censorship and the pro-government bias of the media during [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]’s dictatorship had hindered the normal development of the press in Basque. 
 
At the same time, the absence of qualified Basque-speaking media professionals, together with the pronounced social and political commitment – almost akin to working underground – of the writers who cooperated with their opinion columns, meant that Basque language magazines tended more to reflection than general news.  This was the setting for such pioneers as [[Javier de Aranburu]], [[Miren Jone Azurza]], [[Mikel Atxaga]] and the youngest of them all, Luis Aranberri.
 
Concealed behind the pen name “Amatiño”, Luis Aranberri started off as the local correspondent for the weekly ''[[Zeruko Argia]]'' in 1964, and in 1972 he created the general news section [[ZENBAT GARA]], which immediately became the main source of news for the then incipient Basque cultural renaissance.  Barely five years later, the historian and essayist [[Joseba Intxausti]] wrote:

{{Cquote|Amatiño (a pen name that has become household name in a very short period of time) is essentially a journalist. His work is linked to ''Zeruko Argia'', the leading Basque weekly since [1963]. He has revealed an amazingly deft touch for a self-taught writer. He uses a direct, informative style of language and is not adverse to a hint of playful irony. In this field, he is arguably the country’s foremost writer.|200px||[[Joseba Intxausti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{eu}} [[Joan Mari Torrealday|Torrealday, Joan Mari]] (1977), ''Euskal idazleak, gaur'' {{ISBN|84-7240-065-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Amatiño’s popularity spilled over into the world of Spanish when in 1976 he joined the editorial board for the Culture section in the newly founded newspaper ''[[Deia (newspaper)|Deia]]'' and, yet more so, when he was put in charge of the News Services of [[EITB|ETB]], Basque public television, which began broadcasting for the first time on January 1, 1983.

== Biography ==
Xue was born in [[Xi'an|Xian]], [[China]].

In 1994, Xue was introduced to an opportunity in [[Beijing]], [[China]], to work as an assistant for Pittler Group China's chief representative. Xue quickly built a good reputation within the company and was sent to the [[Goethe-Institut|Goethe Institut]] in [[Beijing]] to study [[German language|German]]. After completing two semesters at the [[Goethe-Institut|Goethe Institut]], she continued to work for Pittler Group China.

In 1998, Xue joined CapitalClub China &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MTY3NzkwMQ==&amp;mid=204971103&amp;idx=3&amp;sn=9cd5b719b3ebd476e1d89a717c8bd1a6&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=09021yhplARZewMp6pkG4qEs#wechat_redirect|title=Comfort interview with UCCA CEO May Xue|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Comfort Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was hired as a membership officer. It only took Xue six months to be promoted to membership manager for [[China]]. Two years after her first promotion, Xue was once again promoted; this time to Capital Club's director of China. In 2002, Xue was awarded a chance to travel to any city in the world through Capital Club and chose [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The director of [[ClubCorp]] (Capital Club's parent company) in [[Los Angeles]] immediately offered Xue a position. Xue spent three years working as a private events manager for City Club on Bunker Hill in [[Los Angeles]] before moving back to [[China]] in 2005.

Xue continued to work at Capital Club in [[Beijing]], this time as a [[Marketing Director|marketing director]], until late 2005 where she took on a position in [[Chengdu]], [[China]], at the China Club (private business club) as a [[general manager]].

In 2006, Xue was hired by [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] to become the area [[Retail management|retail manager]] of [[North China]].

Imperial Connect also worked with [[Hainan Airlines]] to host the inaugural [[China]] to [[Seattle]] flight event. Most of Imperial Connect's clients were in the art industry. The Bruce Lee Gallery was one of Imperial Connect's clients. Xue, still running Imperial Connect, also worked with the Kent Logan Foundation, [[Lawrence Schiller]],  [[Chinese Contemporary Art Awards]] (CCAA) and [[Uli Sigg]].

This prompted Xue's entry into the art industry. In November 2008, shortly after Xue finished the CCAAs at [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art|UCCA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/archive/2008-09/28/content_16551119.htm|title=Beijing's 798 District_china.org.cn|website=www.china.org.cn|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was offered job by founder [[Guy Ullens]] who brought her on as [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art|UCCA]] Store&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coolhunting.com/design/ucca-at-design|title=UCCAstore @ DESIGN|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; retail director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/beijing/2010-09/02/content_11246024.htm|title=Yesterday, today and tomorrow |last=李齐|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Xue was promoted to [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of UCCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/culture/arts-entertainment/article/1989335/private-beijing-art-gallery-ucca-turning-point-owner-guy|title=Private Beijing art gallery UCCA at a turning point as owner Guy Ullens puts it up for sale|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Xue announced her resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2017/04/17/ullens-center-for-contemporary-art-ceo-may-xue-resigns/|title=Ullens Center for Contemporary Art CEO May Xue Resigns|last=Greenberger|first=Alex|date=2017-04-17|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mongolian death worm''' ({{lang-mn|олгой-хорхой}}, '''''olgoi-khorkhoi''''', "[[large intestine]] worm") is a creature
alleged to exist in the [[Gobi Desert]].

The creature first came to Western attention as a result of [[Roy Chapman Andrews]]'s 1926 book ''On the Trail of Ancient Man''. The American [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] was not convinced by the tales of the monster that he heard at a gathering of Mongolian officials: "None of those present ever had seen the creature, but they all firmly believed in its existence and described it minutely."&lt;ref name=virtuescience&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.virtuescience.com/mongolian-death-worm.html |title= The Mongolian Death Worm |accessdate=2010-01-29}}{{Self-published source|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 a specimen of [[Eryx tataricus|Tartar sand boa (''Eryx tataricus'')]] was shown to locals who claimed to have seen "olgoi-khorkhoi" and they confirmed that this was the animal they called "olgoi-khorkhoi"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2012/03/29/49030-ah-gobi Ах, Гоби! Путешествие по Монголии в поисках легенды]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Земноводные Монголии"&gt;[http://www.sevin.ru/news/Amphibhia_Mongolia.pdf Кузьмин С.Л., Дунаев Е.А., Мунхбаяр Х., Мунхбаатар М., Оюунчимэг Ж., Тэрбиш Х. Земноводные Монголии. Москва, КМК, 2017, с. 17-18]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Appearance==
The worms are purportedly between two and five feet long (60 cm to 1.5 meters) and are thick-bodied.&lt;ref name="Shuker2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuker|first=Karl P. N.|title=The Beasts that Hide from Man: Seeking the World's Last Undiscovered Animals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QNFR4xHHIegC&amp;pg=PA25|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61640-621-9|pages=25–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''On the Trail of Ancient Man'', Andrews cites Mongolian Prime Minister [[Jalkhanz Khutagt Sodnomyn Damdinbazar|Damdinbazar]] who in 1922 described the worm: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is shaped like a sausage about two feet long, has no head nor leg and it is so poisonous that merely to touch it means instant death. It lives in the most desolate parts of the Gobi Desert.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1932, Andrews published this information again in the book ''The New Conquest of Central Asia'', adding: "It is reported to live in the most arid, sandy regions of the western Gobi." Andrews, however, did not believe in the creature's existence.

==Habitat and behavior==
The worm is said to inhabit the western&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Conquest of Central Asia: a narrative of the explorations of the Central Asiatic expeditions in Mongolia and China, 1921-1930|author=Roy Chapman Andrews|publisher=|date=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; or southern&lt;ref name="virtuescience" /&gt; Gobi. In the 1987 book ''Altajn Tsaadakh Govd'', Ivan Mackerle described it as travelling underground, creating waves of sand on the surface which allow it to be detected.&lt;ref name=Skeptoid&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4344|number=344|title=Olgoi-Khorkhoi: The Mongolian Death Worm|accessdate= 10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongolians say it can kill at a distance, either by spraying a venom at its prey or by means of electric discharge.&lt;ref name="virtuescience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unexplainedmyst"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/column.php?id=98249 |title= The Mongolian death worm |author= Daniel Harris |date=2007-06-26 |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They say that the worm lives underground, hibernating most of the year except for June and July, when it becomes active. It is also reported that it most often comes to the surface when it rains and the ground is wet.&lt;ref name="virtuescience" /&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=May 2013}}

The Mongolians believe that touching any part of the worm will cause almost instant death and tremendous pain. It has been told that the worm frequently preyed on camels and laid eggs in its intestines, and eventually acquired the trait of its red-like{{clarify|date=November 2017}} skin. Its venom supposedly corrodes metal and local folklore tells of a predilection for the color yellow. The worm is also said to have a preference for local parasitic plants such as the ''goyo''.&lt;ref name="virtuescience" /&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=May 2013}}

==Mentions, investigations==
* In 1990 and 1992, Ivan Mackerle led small groups of companions into the Gobi Desert to search for the worm. Inspired by Frank Herbert's novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', in which giant fictional sandworms could be brought to the surface by [[Worm grunting|rhythmic thumping]], Mackerle constructed a motor-driven "thumper" and even utilised small explosive charges in a bid to find the animal.&lt;ref name=Skeptoid/&gt;
* In 2005, zoological journalist Richard Freeman of the Centre for Fortean Zoology mounted an expedition to hunt for the death worm but came up empty-handed. Freeman's conclusion was that the tales of the worm's powers had to be apocryphal, and that reported sightings likely involved an unknown species of worm lizard or [[Amphisbaena (lizard)|amphisbaena]].&lt;ref name=io9cryptid&gt;{{cite web|url= http://io9.com/5324945/the-hunt-for-the-mongolian-death-worm-begins-anew |title= The Hunt for the Mongolian Death Worm Begins Anew |date=2009-07-28 |author= Lauren Davis |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The worm is briefly mentioned in the 1959 novel ''[[The Land of Crimson Clouds]]'' by [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]].
* In 2009, the short-fiction [[podcast]] ''The Drabblecast'' presented a humorous, multi-part audio story called "In Search of the Mongolian Death Worm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.me.com/normsherman/Site/Podcast/Podcast.html |title=In Search of the Mongolian Death Worm|work=The Drabblecast|first=Norm|last=Sherman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their claim of the docudrama is that the bodies were never found, yet their equipment was recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://animal.discovery.com/videos/lost-tapes-death-worm.html |title= "Death Worm" – Video |date=Feb 11, 2009 |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8694">'''Pamela Schwerdt''' was the joint head gardener at [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden]] from 1959 to 1990, and a pioneering horticulturalist.

== Early life and education ==
Pamela Schwerdt was born on 5th April 1931 in Surrey&lt;ref name="Telegraph Obituary"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pamela Schwerdt (Obituary) |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/6231914/Pamela-Schwerdt.html |publisher=The Telegraph |date=25 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the granddaughter of [[Edith Vere Dent]], who founded the [[Wild Flower Society (UK)|Wild Flower Society]] in 1886, and the daughter of Violet Schwerdt MBE, who was subsequently editor of the society newsletter following on from her mother and sister. From 1936 the family lived in Newfoundland then Nova Scotia, returning to England in 1945, where Pam attended [[Lady Eleanor Holles School]] in Hampton, Middlesex.&lt;ref name="Guardian Obituary"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pamela Schwerdt obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/oct/06/pamela-schwerdt-obituary |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, aged 18, she joined Waterperry School of Horticulture for Ladies, at [[Waterperry Gardens]] in Oxfordshire. She was attracted by the fact that the clothes list included "two pairs of gumboots and a mackintosh" rather than the "cap and gown" required at Wye College, and this reflected the practical nature of the training offered by the school's founder, [[Beatrix Havergal]]. Whilst there she formed a close friendship with Sibylle Kreutzberger, a fellow student, with whom she was to work for the rest of her life. She passed the Waterperry diploma and was also awarded the Chittenden Prize for achieving the highest marks in the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s National Diploma of Horticulture. She stayed on the teaching staff after the course, remaining for eight years in total.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Obituary" /&gt;

== Career ==
By 1959 both Schwerdt and Kreutzberger felt Waterperry was "like being at school forever". Schwerdt contacted various gardening correspondents, including [[Vita Sackville-West]], in search of a walled garden to start a nursery. Sackville-West said she did not know of a site but subsequently wrote to say she needed a head gardener for the garden she had created at [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst Castle]]: would Pam be interested? Schwerdt replied "yes, but we are two".&lt;ref name="Guardian Obituary" /&gt;

From 1959 until retirement in 1990 she was the joint head gardener, with Kreutzberger, at the garden at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent. Kreutzberger focused on propagation, and Schwerdt had a higher public profile, although they were often seen and addressed as a pair. "Women were rare in horticulture in those days", recalled Kreutzberger in 2006. "When we first went to Sissinghurst, people used to point at us as though we were baboons at the zoo."&lt;ref name="SMH obituary"&gt;{{cite web |title=She led visitors up her gardens' paths |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/she-led-visitors-up-her-gardens-paths-20091004-ghtw.html |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=5 Oct 2009 |accessdate=16 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She served on several RHS committees, including the Floral A Committee (now Herbaceous Committee) for 32 years 1977–2008 and the Floral Trials Subcommittee (now Floral Trials Assessment Panel) for 30 years 1979–2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Former Sissinghurst gardener, 78, dies |date=2 October 2009 |url=https://www.hortweek.com/former-sissinghurst-gardener-78-dies/parks-and-gardens/article/942306 |newspaper=Horticulture Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times Obituary"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pamela Schwerdt: horticulturalist |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.obituaries/zwvvFBY4qb8 |website=Google Groups |publisher=The Times |date=25 Sep 2009 |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; both latterly as vice chair, and she was often a judge at RHS shows. She was made an associate of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RHS mourns passing of committee stalwart |url=https://gardenerscorner.gabrielash.com/rhs-mourns-passing-of-committee-stalwart/ |publisher=The Gardeners Corner}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the [[Victoria Medal of Honour]] in 2006, at the same time as Kreutzberger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHS honours champions of organic gardening, orchids and community horticulture|url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/news/pressreleases/awards290606.asp|website=Royal Horticultural Society|date=29 June 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901072605/http://www.rhs.org.uk/news/pressreleases/awards290606.asp|archivedate=1 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed MBE in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Supplement to the London gazette, 16th June 1990 |pages=B15 |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/52173/page/15 |publisher=The London Gazette |date=16 June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1992 she received, with Kreutzberger, the third International Carlo Scarpa Prize for Gardens awarded by the Fondazione Benetton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The International Carlo Scarpa Prize for Gardens, III Annual Award, 1992 |url=http://www.fbsr.it/en/landscape/the-international-carlo-scarpa-prize-for-gardens/sites-awarded/sissinghurst/ |publisher=Fondazione Benetton Studi Ricerche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the two women bought a house together at at Manor Farm, Condicote, near Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire, where they made a garden that was much admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ngs.org.uk/find-a-garden/garden/35106/ |title=The Garden House |publisher=national Garden Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph Obituary" /&gt;

Schwerdt died on September 11, 2009 at the age of 78, from a lung cancer caused by asbestos exposure, although the coroner could not determine where this came from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Renowned gardener died from asbestos exposure, inquest told |url=https://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/news/8311686.renowned-gardener-died-from-asbestos-exposure-inquest-told/ |newspaper=Cotswold Journal |date= 6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/news/8318084.horticulturist-died-from-asbestos-exposure/ |title=Horticulturist died from asbestos exposure |date=7 August 2010 |newspaper=Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; She never married.&lt;ref name="SMH obituary" /&gt;

== Horticultural innovation and influence ==
The widely copied "Sissinghurst look"&lt;ref name="Sissinghurst Look"&gt;{{citation |newspaper=Gardens and Landscapes |url=https://www.leicestershiregardendesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LGD-May-2018-ilovepdf-compressed-2.pdf |date=May 2018 |title=Get the Sissinghurst Look |pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;, owed as much, if not more, to Schwerdt and Kreuzberger as to Sackville-West (who died in 1962, only 3 years after the new head gardeners joined). "It's as much their garden as Vita's," said Alexis Datta, head gardener in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview – Alexis Datta, head gardener, Sissinghurst Castle Gardens |url=https://www.hortweek.com/interview-alexis-datta-head-gardener-sissinghurst-castle-gardens/landscape/article/1021454 |publisher=Horticulture Week |date=13 Aug 2010 |author=Gavin McEwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signature characteristics were planting a profusion of flowers in colourful tonal displays, dense rose beds, the use of topiary and trellises to give sculptural shapes, and selective wildness.&lt;ref name="Sissinghurst Look" /&gt; Partly by using annuals and tender perennials, they were able to make planting that Sackville-West considered to be over by mid July, last into autumn.&lt;ref name="Times Obituary" /&gt; This way of extending the season was copied in other gardens owned by the National Trust, and by home gardeners. During her tenure, visiting figures rose from about 6,000 a year in 1959 to 197,000 in 1991 (the year after she retired).&lt;ref name="Guardian Obituary" /&gt;

She was passionate about the need for close observance of plants, which she described as "living with plants".&lt;ref name="Times Obituary" /&gt; She gave lectures, in the UK (including on the English
Garden School's Plant and Plantsmanship course for eight years) and USA,&lt;ref name="SMH obituary" /&gt; although in general shunned publicity, saying "Gardening doesn't need celebrities, it's a celebrity in itself".&lt;ref name="Times Obituary" /&gt;

Their work was documented in various books, including "Gardening at Sissinghurst" by Tony Lord ({{ISBN|0-7112-0991-X}}) and "Sissinghurst: Portrait of a Garden" by Jane Brown ({{ISBN|0-7538-0437-9}}).

{{Zoroastrianism}}

A '''Parsi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑr|s|iː}}) or '''Parsee''' ("[[Persian people|Persian]]" in the [[Persian language]]) refers to a member of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] community who migrated to India (mainly; including present day Pakistan) from [[Persia]] during the Arab invasion of 636–651 AD; one of two (the other being [[Irani (India)|Iranis]]) mainly located in [[India]], with a few in [[Pakistan]]. According to the ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'', Parsis migrated from [[Greater Iran]] to [[Gujarat]], where they were given refuge, between the 8th and 10th century AD to avoid [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|persecution]] following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].&lt;ref name="Hodivala 1920 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Hodivala|1920|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boy148"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|2001|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ann205"&gt;{{harvnb|Lambton|1981|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns42"&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khan17&gt;{{harvnb|Khanbaghi|2006|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jack&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1906|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bleek212&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|Widengren|1971|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia, the dominant religion of the region (which was ruled by the [[Sasanian Empire]]) was [[Zoroastrianism]]. Iranians rebelled against Muslim conquerors for almost 200 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Muslim-Conquest-Persia-I-Akram/dp/0954866533|title=The Muslim Conquest of Persia|last=Akram|first=A.

During this time many Iranians (who are now called Parsis) chose to preserve their religious identity by fleeing from Persia to India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/parsi-communities-i-early-history PARSI COMMUNITIES i.

The word {{lang|fa|پارسیان}}, pronounced "Parsian", i.e., "Parsi" in the [[Persian language]], literally means ''Persian''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/138161 Parsee, n. and adj. - Oxford English Dictionary]. oed.com. Retrieved on 2015-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Farsi is the official language of modern [[Iran]], which was formerly known as Persia, and the [[Persian language]]'s [[endonym]] is ''Farsi'', an [[arabization]] of the word ''Parsi''.

The long presence of the Parsis in the [[India|Indian subcontinent]] distinguishes them from the smaller Zoroastrian Indian community of [[Irani (India)|Irani]]s, who are much more recent arrivals, mostly descended from Zoroastrians fleeing the repression of the [[Qajar dynasty]] and the general social and political tumult of late 19th- and early 20th-century Iran&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganesh|first=Kamala|date=2008|title=Intra-community Dissent and Dialogue: The Bombay Parsis and the Zoroastrian Diaspora|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23620804|journal=Sociological Bulletin|volume=57|issue=3|pages=315–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definition and identity ==
According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Parsi, also spelled Parsee, member of a group of followers in India of the Persian prophet [[Zoroaster]]. The Parsis, whose name means "Persians", are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India to avoid religious persecution by the Muslims. They live chiefly in Mumbai and in a few towns and villages mostly to the south of Mumbai, but also a few minorities near by in Karachi (Pakistan) and Bangalore (Karnataka, India). There is a sizeable Parsee population in Pune as well in Hyderabad. A few Parsee families also reside in Kolkata and Chennai. Although they are not, strictly speaking, a caste, since they are not Hindus, they form a well-defined community. The exact date of the Parsi migration is unknown. According to tradition, the Parsis initially settled at Hormuz on the [[Persian Gulf]], but finding themselves still persecuted they set sail for India, arriving in the 8th century. The migration may in fact have taken place as late as the 10th century, or in both. They settled first at [[Diu, India|Diu]] in [[Kathiawar]] but soon moved to south Gujarāt, where they remained for about 800 years as a small agricultural community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/444672/Parsi Parsi (people) - Encyclopædia Britannica]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''Pārsi'', which in the Persian language is a [[demonym]] meaning "inhabitant of [[Fars Province|Pārs]]" and hence "ethnic Persian", is not attested in Indian Zoroastrian texts until the 17th century. Until that time, such texts consistently use the Persian-origin terms ''Zartoshti'' "Zoroastrian" or ''Vehdin'' "[of] the good religion". The 12th-century ''Sixteen [[Shloka]]s'', a [[Sanskrit]] text in praise of the Parsis,&lt;ref&gt;Parsi legend attributes it to a Hindu author; [[cf.]] {{Harvard citation no brackets|Paymaster|1954|p=8}} incorrectly attributes the text to a Zoroastrian priest&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest attested use of the term as an identifier for Indian Zoroastrians.

[[File:Indian - Leaf from Bound Collection of 20 Miniatures Depicting Village Life - Walters 35176H.jpg|thumb|Parsis from India, c. 1870]]
The first reference to the Parsis in a European language is from 1322, when a French monk, [[Jordanus]], briefly refers to their presence in [[Thane]] and [[Bharuch]]. Subsequently, the term appears in the journals of many European travelers, first French and Portuguese, later English, all of whom used a Europeanized version of an apparently local language term. For example, Portuguese physician [[Garcia de Orta]] observed in 1563 that "there are merchants ... in the kingdom of [[Khambhat|Cambaia]] ... known as Esparcis. We Portuguese call them Jews, but they are not so. They are [[Gentile|Gentios]]." In an early 20th-century legal ruling (see [[#Self-perceptions|self-perceptions]], below), Justices Davar and Beaman asserted (1909:540) that "Parsi" was also a term used in Iran to refer to Zoroastrians.{{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I.373}} {{Harvtxt|Boyce|2002|p=105}} notes that in much the same way as the word "Hindu" was used by Iranians to refer to anyone from the Indian subcontinent, "Parsi" was used by the Indians to refer to anyone from Greater Iran, irrespective of whether they were actually ethnic Persian people. In any case, the term "Parsi" itself is "not necessarily an indication of their Iranian or 'Persian' origin, but rather as indicator – manifest as several properties – of ethnic identity" {{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I. 373}}. Moreover, if heredity were the only factor in a determination of ethnicity, the Parsis would count as [[Parthia]]ns according to the ''Qissa-i Sanjan''. {{Harvard citation|Boyce|2002|p=105}}

The term "Parseeism" or "Parsiism" is attributed to [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]], who in the 1750s, when the word "Zoroastrianism" had yet to be coined, made the first detailed report of the Parsis and of Zoroastrianism, therein mistakenly assuming that the Parsis were the only remaining followers of the religion.

In addition to above, the Parsi identity was well truly an identity even before they moved to India:
* The earliest reference to the Parsis is found in the Assyrian inscription of [[Shalmaneser III]] (circa 854-824 BC).
* [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] (521-486 BC) establishes this fact when he records his Parsi ancestry for posterity, “parsa parsahya puthra ariya ariyachitra”, meaning, “a Parsi, the son of a Parsi, an [[Aryan]], of Aryan family (Inscription at [[Naqsh-e Rustam|Naqsh-i-Rustam]], near [[Persepolis]], [[Iran]]).
* In Outlines of Parsi History, Dasturji Hormazdyar Dastur Kayoji Mirza, Bombay 1987, pp. 3-4 writes, “According to the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] text of [[Karnamak-i Ardeshir-i Papakan|Karnamak i Artakhshir i Papakan]], the Indian astrologer refers to Artakhshir ([[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king, and the founder of the Empire) as khvatay parsikan ‘the king of the Parsis’.
* [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], the two great historians who lived in the third and fourth centuries BC referred to Iranians as Parsis.&lt;ref&gt;Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani (1966) 68 Bom. L.R. 794&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In ancient Persia, Zoroaster taught that good ([[Ohrmazd]]) and evil ([[Angra Mainyu]]) were opposite forces and the battle between them is more or less evenly matched. A person should always be vigilant to align with forces of light. According to the ''[[asha]]'' or the righteousness and ''[[druj]]'' or the wickedness, the person has chosen in his life they will be judged at the [[Chinvat bridge]] to grant passage to Paradise, Hammistagan (A limbo area) or Hell by a sword. A personified form of the soul that represents the person’s deeds takes the adjudged to their destination and they will abide there until the final apocalypse. After the final battle between good and evil, every soul’s walk through a river of fire ordeal for burning of their dross and together they receive a post resurrection paradise. The Zoroastrian holy book, called the ''Avesta'', was written in the [[Avestan language]], which is closely related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]].

The ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'' is a tale of the journey of the Parsis to India from Iran. It says they fled for reasons of religious freedom and they were allowed to settle in India thanks to the goodwill of a local prince. However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to build a [[fire temple]].

=== As an ethnic community ===
[[Image:Parsi wedding portrait with Dastur MN Dhalla.jpg|thumb|left|Wedding portrait, 1948]]
Over the centuries since the first Zoroastrians arrived in India, the Parsis have integrated themselves into Indian society while simultaneously maintaining or developing their own distinct customs and traditions (and thus ethnic identity). This in turn has given the Parsi community a rather peculiar standing: they are Indians in terms of national affiliation, language and history, but not typically Indian in terms of [[consanguinity]] or ethnicity, cultural, behavioural and religious practices. &lt;!-- religion, and [[socio-cultural anthropology]] --&gt;
[[Genealogical DNA test]]s to determine purity of lineage have brought mixed results. One study supports the Parsi contention {{Harvard citation|Nanavutty|1970|p=13}} that they have maintained their Persian roots by avoiding intermarriage with local populations. In that 2002 study of the [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome]] (patrilineal) DNA of the Parsis of [[Pakistan]], it was determined that Parsis are genetically closer to Iranians than to their neighbours {{Harv |Qamar|Ayub|Mohyuddin|Helgason|2002| p=1119}}.

A 2004 study in which Parsi [[mitochondrial DNA]] (matrilineal) was compared with that of the Iranians and [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] determined that Parsis (in Gujarat, but not in other parts of India) are genetically closer to Gujaratis than to Iranians. Taking the 2002 study into account, the authors of the 2004 study suggested "a male-mediated migration of the ancestors of the present-day Parsi population, where they admixed with local females [...] leading ultimately to the loss of mtDNA of Iranian origin" {{Harvard citation|Quintana-Murci|Chaix|Wells|Behar|2004|p=840}}. To put all the doubts to rest a deeper study was conducted in 2017 [https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1244-9 “Like sugar in milk”: reconstructing the genetic history of the Parsi population] which confirms that Parsis are genetically closer to [[Neolithic]] Iranians than to modern Iranians, who have witnessed a more recent wave of admixture from the Near East.

=== Self-perceptions ===
[[Image:Parsi-navjote-sitting.jpg|thumb|right|Parsi ''[[Navjote]]'' ceremony (rites of admission into the Zoroastrian faith)]]
The definition of who is, and is not, a Parsi is a matter of great contention within the Zoroastrian community in India. It is generally accepted that a Parsi is a person who:

:(a) is directly descended from the original Persian refugees, and
:(b) has been formally admitted into the Zoroastrian religion, through the [[navjote]] ceremony.

In this sense, ''Parsi'' is an ethno-religious designator, whose definition is of contention among its members, similar to the contention over [[Who is a Jew?|who is a Jew]] in the West.

Some members of the community additionally contend that a child must have a Parsi father to be eligible for introduction into the faith, but this assertion is considered by most to be a violation of the Zoroastrian tenets of [[gender equality]] and may be a remnant of an old legal definition of the term Parsi.

An oft-quoted legal definition of Parsi is based on a 1909 ruling (since nullified) that not only stipulated that a person could not become a Parsi by converting to the Zoroastrian faith but also noted:

{{quote|the Parsi community consists of: a) Parsis who are descended from the original Persian emigrants and who are born of both Zoroastrian parents and who profess the Zoroastrian religion; b) Iranis [here meaning [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], not the other group of Indian Zoroastrians] professing the Zoroastrian religion; c) the children of Parsi fathers by alien mothers who have been duly and properly admitted into the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sir Dinsha Manekji Petit v. Sir Jamsetji Jijibhai|1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition was overturned several times. The equality principles of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] void the [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] restrictions expressed in the third clause. The second clause was contested and overturned in 1948. {{Harvard citation|Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar v. Merwan Rashid Yezdiar|1948}} On appeal in 1950, the 1948 ruling was upheld and the entire 1909 definition was deemed an [[obiter dictum]] – a collateral opinion and not legally binding (re-affirmed in 1966). ({{Harvnb|Merwan Rashid Yezdiar v. Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar|1950}}; {{Harvnb|Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani|1966}}).

Nonetheless, the opinion that the 1909 ruling is legally binding continues to persist, even among the better-read and moderate Parsis.

== Population {{anchor|Demographics}} ==
{{See also|List of countries by Zoroastrian population}}

According to the [[2011 Census of India]], there are 57,264 Parsis in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/where-we-belong-the-fight-of-parsi-women-in-interfaith-marriages-4900480/|title=Where we belong: The fight of Parsi women in interfaith marriages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Parsi-population-dips-by-22-per-cent-between-2001-2011-study/article14508859.ece|title=Parsi population dips by 22 per cent between 2001-2011: study}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Commission for Minorities]], there are a "variety of causes that are responsible for this steady decline in the population of the community", the most significant of which were childlessness and migration ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|pp=8, 21}}). Demographic trends project that by the year 2020 the Parsis will number only 23,000.&lt;!-- Taraporevala|2000|p=9 --&gt; The Parsis will then cease to be called a community and will be labeled a '[[tribe]]'. &lt;!-- "cease to be termed a community and will be labelled {{sic}} a 'tribe'" --&gt;({{Harvnb|Taraporevala|2000|p=9}}).

One-fifth of the decrease in population is attributed to migration ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=21}}). A slower birthrate than deathrate accounts for the rest&lt;!-- infant mortality is the other possibility, but is negligible among Parsis--&gt;: as of 2001, Parsis over the age of 60 make up for 31% of the community. Only 4.7% of the Parsi community are under 6 years of age, which translates to 7 births per year per 1000 individuals ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=14}}). Concerns have been raised in recent years over the rapidly declining population of the Parsi community in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02wmp5q|title=Saving India’s Parsis|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other demographic statistics ===
The gender ratio among Parsis is unusual: as of 2001, the ratio of males to females was 1000 males to 1050 females (up from 1024 in 1991), due primarily to the high median age of the population (elderly women are more common than elderly men). As of 2001 the national average in India was 1000 males to 933 females.

Parsis have a high [[literacy rate]]; as of 2001, the literacy rate is 97.9%, the highest of any Indian community (the national average was 64.8%). 96.1% of Parsis reside in [[urban area]]s (the national average is 27.8%).

In the Greater Mumbai area, where the density of Parsis is highest, about 10% of Parsi females and about 20% of Parsi males do not marry.({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|pp=18, 19}})

== History ==
=== Arrival in the Indian sub-continent ===
According to the [[Qissa-i Sanjan]], the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India composed at least six centuries after their tentative date of arrival, the first group of immigrants originated from [[Greater Khorasan]].{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This historical region of [[Central Asia]] is in part in northeastern Iran, where it constitutes modern [[Khorasan Province]], part of western/northern [[Afghanistan]], and in part in three Central-Asian republics namely [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

According to the ''Qissa'', the immigrants were granted permission to stay by the local ruler, [[Jadi Rana]], on the condition that they adopt the local language ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]) and that their women adopt local dress (the ''[[sari]]'').{{sfn|Hodivala|1920}} The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]], which is said to have been named after the city of their origin ([[Sanjan (Khorasan)|Sanjan]], near [[Merv]], modern Turkmenistan).{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This first group was followed by a second group from Greater Khorasan within five years of the first, and this time having religious implements with them (the ''alat''). In addition to these ''Khorasani''s or ''Kohistani''s "mountain folk", as the two initial groups are said to have been initially called,{{sfn|Vimadalal|1979|p=2}} at least one other group is said to have come overland from [[Sari, Iran]].{{sfn|Paymaster|1954}}

[[File:IslamicConquestsIroon.png|thumb|250px|Map of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and its surrounding regions on the eve of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]]]
Although the Sanjan group are believed to have been the first permanent settlers, the precise date of their arrival is a matter of conjecture. All estimates are based on the ''Qissa'', which is vague or contradictory with respect to some elapsed periods. Consequently, three possible dates – 716, 765, and 936 – have been proposed as the year of landing, and the disagreement has been the cause of "many an intense battle ... amongst Parsis".{{sfn|Taraporevala|2000}} Since dates are not specifically mentioned in Parsi texts prior to the 18th century, any date of arrival is perforce a matter of speculation. The importance of the ''Qissa'' lies in any case not so much in its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis – in the way they have come to view themselves – and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity. But, "even if one comes to the conclusion that the chronicle based on verbal transmission is not more than a legend, it still remains without doubt an extremely informative document for Parsee historiography."{{sfn|Kulke|1978|p=25}}

The Sanjan Zoroastrians were certainly not the first Zoroastrians on the subcontinent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Sindh]] touching [[Balochistan]], the easternmost periphery of the Iranian world, too had once been under coastal administration of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (226-651), which consequently maintained outposts there.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Even following the loss of [[Sindh]], the Iranians continued to play a major role in the trade links between the east and west.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The 9th-century Arab historiographer [[Al-Masudi]] briefly notes Zoroastrians with fire temples in al-Hind and in al-Sindh.{{sfn|Stausberg|2002|p=I.374}} There is evidence of individual Parsis residing in Sindh in the tenth and twelfth centuries, but the current modern community is thought to date from British arrival in Sindh.&lt;ref name="Hinnells2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHEc31SZStsC|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora:Religion and Migration: Religion and Migration|author=John R. Hinnells|date=28 April 2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-826759-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, for the Iranians, the harbours of Gujarat lay on the maritime routes that complemented the overland [[Silk Road]] and there were extensive trade relations between the two regions. The contact between Iranians and Indians was already well established even prior to the [[Common Era]], and both the [[Puranas]] and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' use the term ''[[Parasika]]s'' to refer to the peoples west of the [[Indus River]].{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}}

"Parsi legends regarding their ancestors' migration to India depict a beleaguered band of religious refugees escaping the new rule post the Muslim conquests in order to preserve their ancient faith."{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}}{{sfn|Paymaster|1954|pp=2–3}}{{sfn|Boyce|2001|p=148}}{{sfn|Lambton|1981|p=205}} {{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|p=42}}) However, while Parsi settlements definitely arose along the western coast of the Indian subcontinent following the Arab conquest of Iran, it is not possible to state with certainty that these migrations occurred as a result of religious persecution against Zoroastrians. If the "traditional" 8th century date (as deduced from the ''Qissa'') is considered valid, it must be assumed "that the migration began while Zoroastrianism was still the predominant religion in Iran [and] economic factors predominated the initial decision to migrate."{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}} This would have been particularly the case if – as the ''Qissa'' suggests – the first Parsis originally came from the north-east (i.e. Central Asia) and had previously been dependent on [[Silk Road]] trade {{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I.373}}. Even so, in the 17th century, Henry Lord, a [[chaplain]] with the [[British East India Company]], noted that the Parsis came to India seeking "[[liberty of conscience]]" but simultaneously arrived as "merchantmen bound for the shores of India, in course of trade and merchandise." The fact that Muslims charged non-Muslims higher duties when trading from Muslim-held ports may be interpreted to be a form of religious persecution, but this being the only reason to migrate appears unlikely.

=== Early years ===
The ''Qissa'' has little to say about the events that followed the establishment of Sanjan, and restricts itself to a brief note on the establishment of the "Fire of Victory" (Middle Persian: ''[[Atash Bahram]]'') at Sanjan and its subsequent move to [[Navsari]]. According to Dhalla, the next several centuries were "full of hardships" (''sic'') before Zoroastrianism "gained a real foothold in India and secured for its adherents some means of livelihood in this new country of their adoption".{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=447}}

Two centuries after their landing, the Parsis began to settle in other parts of Gujarat, which led to "difficulties in defining the limits of priestly jurisdiction."{{Harvard citation|Kulke|1978|p=29}} These problems were resolved by 1290 through the division of Gujarat into five ''panthak''s (districts), each under the jurisdiction of one priestly family and their descendants. (Continuing disputes regarding jurisdiction over the ''Atash Bahram'' led to the fire being moved to Udvada in 1742, where today jurisdiction is shared in rotation among the five ''panthak'' families.)

Inscriptions at the [[Kanheri Caves]] near Mumbai suggest that at least until the early 11th century, [[Middle Persian]] was still the literary language of the hereditary Zoroastrian priesthood. Nonetheless, aside from the ''Qissa'' and the Kanheri inscriptions, there is little evidence of the Parsis until the 12th and 13th century, when "masterly"{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=448}} Sanskrit translations and transcriptions of the [[Avesta]] and its commentaries began to be prepared. From these translations Dhalla infers that "religious studies were prosecuted with great zeal at this period" and that the command of [[Middle Persian]] and Sanskrit among the clerics "was of a superior order".{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=448}}.

From the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Zoroastrian priests of Gujarat sent (in all) twenty-two requests for religious guidance to their co-religionists in Iran, presumably because they considered the Iranian Zoroastrians "better informed on religious matters than themselves, and must have preserved the old-time tradition more faithfully than they themselves did" {{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=457}}. These transmissions and their replies – assiduously preserved by the community as the ''[[rivayat]]''s ([[epistle]]s) – span the years 1478–1766 and deal with both religious and social subjects. From a superficial 21st century point of view, some of these ''ithoter'' ("questions") are remarkably trivial – for instance, ''Rivayat'' 376: whether ink prepared by a non-Zoroastrian is suitable for copying [[Avestan language]] texts – but they provide a discerning insight into the fears and anxieties of the early modern Zoroastrians. Thus, the question of the ink is symptomatic of the fear of assimilation and the loss of identity, a theme that dominates the questions posed and continues to be an issue into the 21st century. So also the question of conversion of ''Juddin''s (non-Zoroastrians) to Zoroastrianism, to which the reply (R237, R238) was: acceptable, even meritorious.{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|pp=474–475}}

Nonetheless, "the precarious condition in which they lived for a considerable period made it impracticable for them to keep up their former [[proselytizing]] zeal. The instinctive fear of disintegration and absorption in the vast multitudes among whom they lived created in them a spirit of exclusiveness and a strong desire to preserve the racial characteristics and distinctive features of their community. Living in an atmosphere surcharged with the Hindu caste system, they felt that their own safety lay in encircling their fold by rigid caste barriers" {{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=474}}. Even so, at some point (possibly shortly after their arrival in India), the Zoroastrians – perhaps determining that the [[social stratification]] that they had brought with them was unsustainable in the small community – did away with all but the hereditary priesthood (called the ''asronih'' in Sassanid Iran). The remaining estates – the ''(r)atheshtarih'' (nobility, soldiers, and civil servants), ''vastaryoshih'' (farmers and herdsmen), ''hutokshih'' (artisans and labourers) – were folded into an all-comprehensive class today known as the ''behdini'' ("followers of ''daena''", for which "good religion" is one translation). This change would have far reaching consequences. For one, it opened the gene pool to some extent since until that time inter-class marriages were exceedingly rare (this would continue to be a problem for the priesthood until the 20th century). For another, it did away with the boundaries along occupational lines, a factor that would endear the Parsis to the 18th- and 19th-century British colonial authorities who had little patience for the unpredictable complications of the [[Indian caste system|Hindu caste system]] (such as when a clerk from one caste would not deal with a clerk from another).

=== Age of opportunity ===
Following the commercial treaty in the early 17th century between [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Jahangir]] and [[James I]] of England, the [[East India Company]] obtained the exclusive rights to reside and build factories in [[Surat]] and other areas. Many Parsis, who until then had been living in farming communities throughout Gujarat, moved to the English-run settlements to take the new jobs offered. In 1668 the English East India Company leased the [[Seven Islands of Bombay]] from [[Charles II of England]]. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent, and in 1687 they transferred their headquarters from Surat to the fledgling settlement. The Parsis followed and soon began to occupy posts of trust in connection with government and public works.&lt;!--{{Harvnb|Hull|1913}}--&gt;{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=47–57}}

Where literacy had previously been the exclusive domain of the priesthood, in the era of the British Raj the British schools in India provided the new Parsi youth with the means not only to learn to read and write but also to be educated in the greater sense of the term and become familiar with the quirks of the British establishment. These capabilities were enormously useful to Parsis since they allowed them to "represent themselves as being like the British," which they did "more diligently and effectively than perhaps any other South Asian community".{{sfn|Luhrmann|2002|p=861}} While the British saw the other Indians "as passive, ignorant, irrational, outwardly submissive but inwardly guileful",{{sfn|Luhrmann|1994|p=333}} the Parsis were seen to have the traits that the colonial authorities tended to ascribe to themselves. [[Johan Albrecht de Mandelslo]] (1638) saw them as "diligent", "conscientious", and "skillful" in their [[mercantile]] pursuits. Similar observations would be made by [[James Mackintosh]], Recorder of Bombay from 1804 to 1811, who noted that "the Parsees are a small remnant of one of the mightiest nations of the ancient world, who, flying from persecution into India, were for many ages lost in obscurity and poverty, till at length they met a just government under which they speedily rose to be one of the most popular mercantile bodies in Asia".{{sfn|Darukhanawala|Jeejeebhoy|1938|p=33}}

One of these was an enterprising agent named [[Rustom Maneck Seth|Rustom Maneck]]. In 1702, Maneck, who had probably already amassed a fortune under the Dutch and Portuguese, was appointed the first broker to the East India Company (acquiring the name "Seth" in the process), and in the following years "he and his Parsi associates widened the occupational and financial horizons of the larger Parsi community".{{sfn|White|1991|p=304}} Thus, by the mid-18th century, the brokerage houses of the [[Bombay Presidency]] were almost all in Parsi hands. As James Forbes, the Collector of Broach (now [[Bharuch]]), would note in his ''Oriental Memoirs'' (1770): "many of the principal merchants and owners of ships at Bombay and Surat are Parsees." &lt;!-- [...] ---&gt; "Active, robust, prudent and persevering, they now form a very valuable part of the Company's subjects on the western shores of [[Hindustan]] where they are highly esteemed".{{sfn|Darukhanawala|Jeejeebhoy|1938|p=33}}In the 18th century, Parsis with their skills in ship building and trade greatly benefited with trade between India and China.The trade was mainly in timber, silk, cotton and opium. For example [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]] acquired most of his wealth through trade in cotton and opium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palsetia|first1=Jesse S.|title=The Parsis of India : preservation of identity in Bombay City|date=2001|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden ; Boston ; Köln|isbn=9789004121140|pages=53–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=R6oNt3M_yLgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=opium+parsi&amp;ots=cUcgUz8fym&amp;sig=MXhuA5W74fJHqoa9h67egxE9JRc#v=onepage&amp;q=opium%20&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually certain families "acquired wealth and prominence (Sorabji, Modi, Cama, Wadia, Jeejeebhoy, Readymoney, Dadyseth, Petit, Patel, Mehta, Allbless, Tata, etc.), many of which would be noted for their participation in the public life of the city, and for their various educational, industrial, and charitable enterprises."{{sfn|Hull|1913}}{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=37–45, 62-64, 128-140, 334-135}}).

Through his largesse, Maneck helped establish the infrastructure that was necessary for the Parsis to set themselves up in Bombay and in doing so "established Bombay as the primary centre of Parsi habitation and work in the 1720s".{{sfn|White|1991|p=304}} Following the political and economic isolation of Surat in the 1720s and 1730s that resulted from troubles between the (remnant) Mughal authorities and the increasingly dominant [[Maratha]]s, a number of Parsi families from Surat migrated to the new city. While in 1700 "fewer than a handful of individuals appear as merchants in any records; by mid-century, Parsis engaged in commerce constituted one of important commercial groups in Bombay".{{sfn|White|1991|p=312}} Maneck's generosity is incidentally also the first documented instance of Parsi philanthropy. In 1689, [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] chaplain John Ovington reported that in Surat the family "assist the poor and are ready to provide for the sustenance and comfort of such as want it. Their universal kindness, either employing such as are ready and able to work, or bestowing a seasonable bounteous charity to such as are infirm and miserable, leave no man destitute of relief, nor suffer a beggar in all their tribe".{{sfn|Ovington|1929|p=216}}

[[Image:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
In 1728 Rustom's eldest son Naoroz (later Naorojee) founded the ''Bombay Parsi [[Panchayat]]'' (in the sense of an instrument for [[self-governance]] and not in the sense of the trust it is today) to assist newly arriving Parsis in religious, social, legal and financial matters. Using their vast resources, the Maneck Seth family gave their time, energy and not inconsiderable financial resources to the Parsi community, with the result that by the mid-18th century, the Panchayat was the accepted means for Parsis to cope with the exigencies of urban life and the recognized instrument for regulating the affairs of the community.{{sfn|Karaka|1884|pp=215–217}} Nonetheless, by 1838 the Panchayat was under attack for impropriety and nepotism. In 1855 the ''[[The Times of India|Bombay Times]]'' noted that the Panchayat was utterly without the moral or legal authority to enforce its statutes (the ''Bundobusts'' or codes of conduct) and the council soon ceased to be considered representative of the community.{{sfn|Dobbin|1970|pp=150–151}} In the wake of a July 1856 ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that it had no jurisdiction over the Parsis in matters of marriage and divorce, the Panchayat was reduced to little more than a Government-recognized "Parsi Matrimonial Court". Although the Panchayat would eventually be reestablished as the administrator of community property, it ultimately ceased to be an instrument for self-governance.{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=223–225}}

At about the same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other institutions arose that would replace the Panchayat's role in contributing to the sense of [[structural cohesion|social cohesiveness]] that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were keenly aware that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]] established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended.{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=135–139}} Accompanied by better education and social cohesiveness, the community's sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]] founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary [[Maneckji Limji Hataria]] may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the [[jizya]] for their co-religionists in 1882.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Parsis had emerged as "the foremost people in India in matters educational, industrial, and social. They came in the vanguard of progress, amassed vast fortunes, and munificently gave away large sums in charity".{{sfn|Dhalla|1948|p=483}} By the close of the 19th century, the total number of Parsis in colonial India was 85,397, of which 48,507 lived in Bombay, constituting 6% of the total population of the city (Census, 1881){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. This would be the last time that the Parsis would be considered a numerically significant minority in the city.

Nonetheless, the legacy of the 19th century was a sense of self-awareness as a community&lt;!-- {Palsetia|2001}--&gt;. The typically Parsi cultural symbols of the 17th and 18th centuries such as language (a Parsi variant of [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]), arts, crafts, and sartorial habits developed into [[Parsi theatre]], literature, newspapers, magazines, and schools. The Parsis now ran community medical centres, ambulance corps, [[Scouting]] troops, clubs, and [[Masonic Lodge]]s. They had their own charitable foundations, housing estates, legal institutions, courts, and governance. They were no longer weavers and petty merchants, but now were established and ran banks, mills, heavy industry, shipyards, and shipping companies. Moreover, even while maintaining their own cultural identity they did not fail to recognize themselves as nationally Indian, as [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], the first Asian to occupy a seat in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] would note: "Whether I am a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Parsi, a Christian, or of any other creed, I am above all an Indian. Our country is India; our nationality is Indian".{{sfn|Ralhan|2002|p=1101}}

== Religious practices ==
The main components of Zoroastrianism as practiced by the Parsi community are the concepts of purity and pollution (nasu), initiation (navjot), daily prayers, worship at Fire Temples, marriage, funerals, and general worship.

=== Purity and pollution ===
The balance between good and evil is correlated to the idea of purity and pollution. Purity is held to be of the very essence of godliness. Pollution's very point is to destroy purity through the death of a human. In order to adhere to purity it is the duty of Parsis to continue to preserve purity within their body as God created them. A Zoroastrian priest spends his entire life dedicated to following a holy life.

=== [[Navjote]] ===
Zoroastrians are not initiated by [[infant baptism]]. Normally, a child is initiated into the faith when he or she is old enough to choose to enter into the faith. The initiation begins with a ritual bath, then a spiritual cleansing prayer; the child changes into white pajama pants, a shawl, and a small cap. Following introductory prayers, the child is given the sacred items that are associated with Zoroastrianism: a sacred shirt and cord, [[sedreh|sudre]], and [[Kushti|kusti]]. The child then faces the main priest and fire is brought in to represent God. Once the priest finishes with the prayers, the child’s initiation is complete and he or she is now a part of the community and religion.

=== Marriage ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}{{main|Zoroastrian wedding}}
[[File:Parsee Wedding 1905.jpg|thumb|Parsi wedding 1905.]]
Marriage is very important to the members of the Parsi community, believing that, in order to continue the expansion of God’s kingdom, they must procreate. Up until the mid-19th century child marriages were common even though the idea of child marriage was not part of the religious doctrine. Consequently, when social reform started happening in India, the Parsi community discontinued the practice. There are, however, rising problems over the availability of brides. More and more women in the Parsi community are becoming well educated and are therefore either delaying marriage or not partaking at all. Women within the Parsi community in India are ninety-seven percent literate; forty-two percent have completed high school or college and twenty-nine percent have an occupation in which they earn a substantial amount of money. The wedding ceremony begins much like the initiation with a cleansing bath. The bride and groom then travel to the wedding in florally decorated cars. The priests from both families facilitate the wedding. The couple begins by facing one another with a sheet to block their view of one another. Wool is passed over the two seven times to bind them together. The two are then supposed to throw rice to their partner symbolizing dominance. The religious element comes in next when the two sit side by side to face the priest.

=== Funerals ===

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

{{main|Dakhma}}
[[File:Parsee Tower of Silence, Bombay.jpg|thumb|Parsi Tower of Silence, Bombay.]]
The pollution that is associated with death has to be handled carefully. A separate part of the home is designated to house the corpse for funeral proceedings before being taken away. The priest comes to say prayers that are for the cleansing of sins and to affirm the faith of the deceased. Fire is brought to the room and prayers are begun. The body is washed and inserted clean within a sudre and kusti. The ceremony then begins, and a circle is drawn around the body into which only the bearers may enter. As they proceed to the cemetery they walk in pairs and are connected by white fabric. A dog is essential in the funeral process because it is able to see death. The body is taken to the tower of death where the vultures feed on it. Once the bones are bleached by the sun they are pushed into the circular opening in the center. The mourning process is four days long, and rather than creating graves for the dead, charities are established in honor of the person.

=== Temples ===
[[File:Parsi Fire Temple of Ahmedabad - Gujarat, India (4586854549).jpg|thumb|Parsi Fire Temple of [[Ahmedabad]], India]]
Zoroastrian festivals were originally held outside in the open air; temples were not common until later. Most of the temples were built by wealthy Parsis who needed centers that housed purity. As stated before, fire is considered to represent the presence of Ahura Mazda, and there are two distinct differences for the types of fire for the different temples. The first type of temple is the Atash Behram, which is the highest level of fire. The fire is prepared for an entire year before it can be installed, and once it is, it is cared for to the highest possible degree. There are only eight such temples located within India. The second type of fire temple is called a Dar-i Mihr, and the preparation process is not as intense. There are about 160 of these located throughout India.

== Factions within the community ==
[[Image:Parsi-jashan-ceremony-1.jpg|thumb|right|Parsi ''Jashan'' ceremony (in this case, a house blessing)]]

=== Calendrical differences ===
''This section contains information specific to the Parsi calendar. For information on the calendar used by the Zoroastrians for religious purposes, including details on its history and its variations, see [[Zoroastrian calendar]].''

Until about the 12th century, all Zoroastrians followed the same 365-day religious calendar, which had remained largely unmodified since the calendar reforms of [[Ardashir I of Persia|Ardashir I]] (''r.'' 226-241 AD). Since that calendar did not compensate for the fractional days that go to make up a full solar year, with time it was no longer accordant with the seasons.

Sometime between 1125 and 1250 (''[[cf.]]'' {{Harvnb|Boyce|1970|p=537}}), the Parsis inserted an [[embolismic month]] to level out the accumulating fractional days. However, the Parsis were the only Zoroastrians to do so (and did it only once), with the result that, from then on, the calendar in use by the Parsis and the calendar in use by Zoroastrians elsewhere diverged by a matter of thirty days. The calendars still had the same name, ''Shahenshahi'' (imperial), presumably because none were aware that the calendars were no longer the same.

In 1745 the Parsis in and around Surat switched to the ''Kadmi'' or ''Kadimi'' calendar on the recommendation of their priests who were convinced that the calendar in use in the ancient homeland must be correct. Moreover, they denigrated the ''Shahenshahi'' calendar as being "royalist".

In 1906 attempts to bring the two factions together resulted in the introduction of a third calendar based on an 11th-century [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] model: the ''Fasili'', or ''Fasli'', calendar had leap days intercalated every four years and it had a New Year's day that fell on the day of the [[vernal equinox]]. Although it was the only calendar always in harmony with the seasons, most members of the Parsi community rejected it on the grounds that it was not in accord with the injunctions expressed in Zoroastrian tradition (''[[Denkard|Dēnkard]]'' 3.419){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}&lt;!-- Should have matching reference in reference list for Denkard--&gt;.

Today the majority of Parsis are adherents of the Parsi version of the ''Shahenshahi'' calendar although the ''Kadmi'' calendar does have its adherents among the Parsi communities of Surat and Bharuch. The ''Fasli'' calendar does not have a significant following among Parsis, but, by virtue of being compatible with the ''Bastani'' calendar (an Iranian development with the same salient features as the ''Fasli'' calendar), it is predominant among the Zoroastrians of Iran.

==== Effect of the calendar disputes ====
Since some of the [[Avesta]] prayers contain references to the names of the months, and some other prayers are used only at specific times of the year, the issue of which calendar is "correct" also has theological ramifications.

To further complicate matters, in the late 18th century (or early 19th century) a highly influential head-priest and staunch proponent of the ''Kadmi'' calendar, Phiroze Kaus Dastur of the Dadyseth Atash-Behram in Bombay, became convinced that the pronunciation of prayers as recited by visitors from Iran was correct, while the pronunciation as used by the Parsis was not. He accordingly went on to alter some (but not all) of the prayers, which in due course came to be accepted by all adherents of the ''Kadmi'' calendar as the more ancient (and thus presumably correct). However, scholars of [[Avestan language]] and linguistics attribute the difference in pronunciation to a vowel-shift that occurred only in Iran and that the Iranian pronunciation as adopted by the ''Kadmi''s is actually more recent than the pronunciation used by the non-''Kadmi'' Parsis.

The calendar disputes were not always purely academic, either. In the 1780s, emotions over the controversy ran so high that violence occasionally erupted. In 1783 a ''Shahenshahi'' resident of Bharuch named Homaji Jamshedji was sentenced to death for kicking a young ''Kadmi'' woman and so causing her to miscarry.

Of the eight Atash-Behrams (the highest grade of [[fire temple]]) in India, three follow the ''Kadmi'' pronunciation and calendar, the other five are ''Shahenshahi''. The ''Fassali''s do not have their own Atash-Behram.

=== Ilm-e-Kshnoom ===
{{Main|Ilm-e-Kshnoom}}
The ''Ilm-e-Kshnoom'' ('science of ecstasy', or 'science of bliss') is a school of Parsi-Zoroastrian philosophy based on a mystic and esoteric, rather than literal, interpretation of religious texts. According to adherents of the sect, they are followers of the Zoroastrian faith as preserved by a clan of 2000 individuals called the ''Saheb-e-Dilan'' ('Masters of the Heart') who are said to live in complete isolation in the mountainous recesses of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] (alternatively, in the [[Alborz]] range, around [[Mount Damavand]]).

There are few obvious indications that a Parsi might be a follower of the Kshnoom. Although their ''Kusti'' prayers are very similar to those used by the ''Fassali''s, like the rest of the Parsi community the followers of Kshnoom are divided with respect to which calendar they observe. There are also other minor differences in their recitation of the liturgy, such as repetition of some sections of the longer prayers. Nonetheless, the Kshnoom are extremely conservative in their ideology and prefer isolation even with respect to other Parsis.

The largest community of followers of the Kshnoom lives in Jogeshwari, a suburb of Bombay, where they have their own fire temple (Behramshah Nowroji Shroff Daremeher), their own housing colony (Behram Baug) and their own newspaper (''Parsi Pukar''). There is a smaller concentration of adherents in [[Surat]], where the sect was founded in the last decades of the 19th century.

=== Issues relating to the deceased ===
[[File:St. Mary's Cemetery, Wandsworth 17.JPG|thumb|Parsi funerary monument, [[St. Mary's Cemetery, Wandsworth|St Mary’s Cemetery, Wandsworth]]]]
It has been traditional, in Mumbai and [[Karachi]] at least, for dead Parsis to be taken to the [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]] where the corpses are quickly eaten by the city's [[vultures]]. The reason given for this practice is that earth, fire, and water are considered sacred elements which should not be defiled by the dead. Therefore, burial and cremation have always been prohibited in Parsi culture. However, in modern day Mumbai and Karachi the population of vultures has drastically reduced due to extensive urbanization and the unintended consequence of treating humans and livestock with antibiotics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/03/16/rspb.2009.0071.full Cellular and humoral immunodepression in vultures feeding upon medicated livestock carrion].

The Peregrine Fund (2012-08-23). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This issue led to the [[Indian vulture crisis]], which led to the ban of the drug [[diclofenac]]. As a result, the bodies of the deceased are taking much longer to decompose. Solar panels have been installed in the Towers of Silence to speed up the [[decomposition]] process, but this has been only partially successful especially during monsoons. In [[Peshawar]] a Parsi graveyard was established in the late 19th century, which still exists; this cemetery is unique as there is no [[Tower of Silence]]. Nevertheless, the majority of Parsis still use the traditional method of disposing off their loved ones and consider this as the last act of charity by the deceased on earth.

The Tower of Silence in [[Mumbai]] is located at [[Malabar Hill]]. In [[Karachi]], the Tower of Silence is located in Parsi Colony, near the [[Chanesar Goth]] and [[Mahmudabad, Karachi|Mehmoodabad]] localities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/386604/Tower-of-Silence Tower of Silence, Karachi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The genetic studies of Parsis of Pakistan show sharp contrast between genetic data obtained from [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and [[Y-chromosome]] DNA (Y-DNA), different from most populations. Historical records suggests that they had moved from Iran to Gujarat, India and then to Mumbai and Karachi, Pakistan. According to Y-DNA, they resemble the Iranian population, which supports historical records. When the mtDNA pool is compared to Iranians and Gujaratis (their putative parental populations), it contrasted Y-DNA data. About 60% of their maternal gene pool originates from South Asian haplogroups, which is just 7% in Iranians. Parsis have a high frequency of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]] (55%), similar to Indians, which is just 1.7% in combined Iranian sample. The studies suggest sharp contrast between the maternal and paternal component of Parsis. Due to high diversity in Y-DNA and mtDNA lineages, the strong drift effect is unlikely even though they had a small population. The studies suggest a male-mediated migration of Parsi ancestors from Iran to Gujarat where they admixed with the local female population during initial settlements, which ultimately resulted in loss of Iranian mtDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quintana-Murci|first=Lluís|last2=Chaix|first2=Raphaëlle|last3=Wells|first3=R.

A study published in ''[[Genome Biology]]'' based on high density [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] data has shown that the Parsis are genetically closer to Iranian and Caucasus populations than to their South Asian neighbours. They also share the highest number of haplotypes with present-day Iranians; the admixture of the Parsis with Indian populations was estimated have occurred approximately 1,200 years ago.

The Parsis have made considerable contributions to the history and development of India, all the more remarkable considering their small numbers. As the [[Maxim (literature)|maxim]] "Parsi, [[thy name is]] charity" [[allude]]s to, their most prominent contribution is their [[philanthropy]].

Although their people's name Parsi comes from the Persian-language word for a Persian person, in Sanskrit the term&lt;!-- need assistance: wordplay on -parSathas or paraseva? cf: CDSL ApR- --&gt; means "one who gives alms".&lt;ref name=jack/&gt;&lt;ref name=bleek212/&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi]] would note in a much misquoted statement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://parsikhabar.net/news/can-zoroastrians-save-their-faith/2060/ Can Zoroastrians save their faith?]. Parsi Khabar (2010-01-06). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; "I am proud of my country, India, for having produced the splendid [[Zoroastrian]] stock, in numbers beneath contempt, but in charity and philanthropy perhaps unequaled and certainly unsurpassed."{{Harvard citation|Rivetna|2002}}

'''Philéas Lebesgue''' (26 November 1869 in [[La Neuville-Vault]], [[Picardy]], France - 11 October 1958 in the same village) was a French essayist and translator. At once a poet, novelist, essayist, translator and literary critic.

== Introduction==
Philéas Lebesgue, French writer, editor of the ''[[Mercure de France]]'', was born and died in La Neuville-vault where his parents were farmers. He succeeded after their demise.  He then leads the head being a farmer in his village and a  literary career which will include travel to Portugal, Greece and Yugoslavia, the three countries which he held the literary chronicle the Mercure de France.

After the Latin, English and Greek, studied in college, he learned other languages and wrote his first poems. In 1896 he became editor of the Mercure de France, an  international journal  He was the chronicler of "Portuguese Letters" and will remain so until 1951.  It is one of the few critics to discover and enjoy the great Portuguese poet Pessoa, in 1913. 
Phileas Lebesgue included at least 16 foreign languages. These are German, English, Danish, Spanish, Galician, Welsh, Greek, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian Slovenian and Czech. Must be added the Sanskrit, Old French, and three regional languages in France: Breton, Provençal and Picard spoke to his village.  He has worked on magazines in foreign languages, including L'Arte (Coimbra, 1895-1896), Atlantida (Lisbon, 1917), O Mundo (Lisbon, 1915), The Panathenaic (Athens, 1910), Periodikon nios (Piraeus, 1900), The Vos (Madrid, 1923).&lt;ref&gt;Mémoire de DEA, Faculté des Lettres d'Amiens, 1994, Ed. Société des Amis de Philéas Lebesgue, 1995, 150 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1926, Phileas Lebesgue chairs the Academy of the ten provinces and the League of provincial writers, with which it attempts to consolidate regional writers, foreign and colonial French.

Poet symbolist in its infancy, Phileas Lebesgue written in verse as well as traditional free verse. He wrote a poem in free verse or traditional, often evoking the landscapes of his country of Bray.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Charpentreau et Georges Jean, Dictionnaire des poètes et de la poésie , coll. al. « folio junior en poésie », Gallimard, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a novelist, songwriter, playwright, literary critic, columnist, translator, and mayor of La Neuville-Vault from 1908 to 1947.  In his works, he was inspired by nature, history, rural life, his travels and esotericism.&lt;ref&gt;François Beauvy, Dictionnaire de biographie française ( Dictionary of French biography ) ,Paris, Ed. Letouzey et Ané, tome XX, fascicule 115, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Beauvy, Philéas Lebesgue et ses correspondants en France et dans le monde de 1890 à 1958, Thèse de doctorat (PhD), Ed. Awen, 2004, 674 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Garnier, ''Philéas Lebesgue, Poète de Picardie'', Éklitra, 1967, 43 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philéas Lebesgue and esotericism==
The esotericism of Phileas Lebesgue is only poetic as that of his friend Oscar Milosz .  In 1911, he joined the French Celtic League, created by the poet Robert Pelletier, to refute the "lies" of the Latin character of France. He agrees to be the « Grand Druide des Gaules »,  the spiritual authority of the Collège bardique des Gaules founded in 1933 by poet and publisher of music, Jacques Heugel, association that terminates in 1939.

He was already in Breton bard who received the second prize of L'Hermine in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;François Beauvy, Philéas Lebesgue et ses correspondants en France et dans le monde de 1890 à 1958 , Beauvais, Ed. Awen, 2004, p. 43 of the thesis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Société des Amis de Philéas Lebesgue (The association of Friends of Philéas Lebesgue)==
It was founded in 1930, Philéas Lebesgue's lifetime, by Camille Belliard and Marius Alphonse Gossez, teachers.  The purpose of association is then to make known the life and work of the writer.

'''Rolla Milton Tryon Jr.''' (August 26, 1916 – August 20, 2001) was an American [[botanist]] who specialized in the systematics and evolution of [[fern]]s and other spore-dispersed plants ([[pteridology]]).  His particular focus and interest lay in two areas, historical [[biogeography]] of ferns and the taxonomy of tropical American ferns.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gastony | first1=Gerald J. | last2=Barrington | first2 = David S. | last3=Conant | first3 = David S. | title=Obituary: Rolla Milton Tryon Jr. (1916–2001) | journal=American Fern Journal | year=2002 | volume=92 | issue=1 | pages=1–9 | doi=10.1640/0002-8444(2002)092[0001:ormtj]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tryon's first scientific paper was published in 1934 (at the age of 18) on the ferns in [[Chesterton, Indiana|Chesterton]], [[Indiana]] where his family’s summer cottage was located. In 1935, he received his A.A. degree and in 1937 his B.S., both from the University of Chicago. He enrolled in the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] for a Ph.M., graduating in 1938. Then, at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], earning he earned both his M.S. in 1940 and  Ph.D. in 1941&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; working with [[Merritt Lyndon Fernald]] and [[Charles Alfred Weatherby]] on ferns in the genera ''Pteridium'' and ''Doryopteris''.

During World War II, he worked as a lab technician in the [[U.S. Chemical Warfare Service]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. After the war, he returned to teach at [[Dartmouth College]]. then at the University of Wisconsin, where he met his future wife and lifelong collaborator, [[Alice F. Tryon|Alice Faber]], a student at the time. In 1947, Tryon joined the faculty at [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University in Saint Louis]] as an Associate Professor of Botany and became assistant curator in the herbarium of the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tryon left Missouri in 1957 to travel with Alice to [[Peru]] to study the fern flora of the American tropics. When they returned, Tryon served as a research associate at the [[University of California]]  Herbarium at [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. In 1958, Tryon returned to Harvard as Curator of Ferns at the [[Harvard University Herbaria|Gray Herbarium]] where he remained with his wife until 1987. In 1972, he became a professor of biology at Harvard.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The two Tryons wrote a complete survey of ferns, ''Ferns and Allied Plants: with Special Reference to Tropical America,'' with emphasis on [[Neotropic ecozone|tropical America]], which was published in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Tryon | first1=R.

Tryon was a member of the [[American Fern Society]] for 69 years, starting in 1932, and held various roles in the society including curator and librarian of the library and herbarium from 1946 to 1957; president from 1974-1975; he was made an honorary member in 1978.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = American Fern Journal|url = https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753002914619|website = Obituary: Rolla Milton Tryon Jr.|accessdate = 2015-12-17|date = March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the New England Botanical Club, he was recording secretary from 1964-1968, associate editor of the Society’s Journal Rhodora from 1961-1977, editor-in-chief from 1977-1981, vice-president from 1984-1986 and president from 1986-1988.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1984, he received a Merit Award from the [[Botanical Society of America]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Sarakatsani''' ({{lang-el|Σαρακατσάνοι}}, also written '''Karakachani''', {{lang-ro|Sărăcăceni}}) are an ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]] population subgroup&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1964|pp=3–6}}: "...the Sarakatsani, as they exist today, provide no evidence of a past history that was ever anything but Greek."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levinson|1998|p=41}}: "...[the Sarakatsani] are ethnically Greek, speak Greek, and are Greek Orthodox."&lt;/ref&gt; who were traditionally [[Transhumance|transhumant]] shepherds, native to [[Greece]], with a smaller presence in neighbouring [[Bulgaria]], southern [[Albania]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Historically centred on the [[Pindus]] mountains and other mountain ranges in continental Greece, most Sarakatsani have abandoned the transhumant way of life and have been urbanised.

==Name==
The most widely accepted theory for the origin of the name "Sarakatsani" is that it comes from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''karakaçan'' (from ''kara'' = 'black' and ''kaçan'' = 'fugitive'), used by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], in reference to those people who dressed in black and fled to the mountains during the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman occupation of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Babiniotis|first=Georgios|authorlink=Georgios Babiniotis|script-title=el:Λεξικό της νέας ελληνικής γλώσσας|trans-title=Dictionary of the modern Greek language|location=Athens|year=1998|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to another theory, the name derives from the village of Sakaretsi, the supposed homeland of the Sarakatsani.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aravantinos|1856}}: "Σαρακατσιάνοι ή Σακαρετσάνοι έχοντες την καταγωγή εκ Σακαρέτσιου..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
[[File:Karakachani_2.png|thumb|right|250px|A Sarakatsani Flaboura]]

Despite the silence of the classical and medieval writers, scholars argue that the Sarakatsani are a [[Greeks|Greek]] people, possibly descended from pre-[[Classical Greece|classical]] indigenous pastoralists, citing linguistic evidence and certain aspects of their traditional culture and socioeconomic organisation. A popular theory, based on linguistics and material culture, suggests that the Sarakatsani are descended from the [[Dorians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cusumano|first=Camille|title=Greece, a Love Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSMaCiNzSZcC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Seal Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-786-75058-0|page=72|quote=Legend tells us that the Sarakatsani, isolated for centuries in the mountains, are descended from the original Dorian Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dubin|first1=Mark|last2=Kydoniefs|first2=Frank|title=Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKbjunuEnC0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=New Holland Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-1-860-11122-8|page=192|quote=...while the dialect of the Sarakatsani shepherds is said to be the oldest, a direct descendant of the language of the Dorian settlers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kakouri|first=Katerina|title=Death and resurrection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prPRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q|publisher=G.

Their origins have been the subject of broad and permanent interest, resulting in several fieldwork studies by anthropologists among the Sarakatsani.

===Accounts===
Many of the 19th century descriptions of the Sarakatsani do not differentiate them from the other great shepherd people of Greece, the [[Vlachs]], a [[Romance languages|Romance]]-speaking population. In many instances the Sarakatsani were identified as ''Vlachs''. [[Panayiotis Aravantinos|Aravantinos]] discusses how another group, the Arvanitovlachs, were erroneously called ''Sarakatsani'', although the latter were clearly of Greek origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aravantinos|1905}}: "Τοιούτους Αρβανιτόβλαχους φερεωίκους ποιμενόβιους ολίγιστους απαντώμεν εν Θεσσαλία και Μακεδονία, Σαρακατσάνους καλουμένους καταχρηστίκους διότι οι Σαρακατσάνοι ορμόνται εξελλήνων και αυτόχρημα Έλληνες εισί."&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the differences between the two groups and stating that the Arvanitovlachs were actually yet another group, the ''Garagounides'' or ''Korakounides''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aravantinos|1856}}: "Οι Σαρακατσάνοι, οι Πεστανιάνοι, και οι Βλάχοι οι εκ του Σύρρακου εκπατρίσθεντες, οιτίνες και ολιγότερων των άλλων σκηνιτών βαρβαριζούσι. Διάφοροι δε των τριών είσιν οι Αρβανιτόβλαχοι λεγόμενοι Γκαραγκούνιδες ή Κορακούνιδες."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sarakatsani have also been referred to as ''Roumeliotes'' or ''Moraites'', names based on where they lived. [[Otto of Greece|Otto]], the first king of modern Greece, was well-known to be a great admirer of the Sarakatsani, and is said to have fathered an illegitimate child early in his reign with a woman from a Sarakatsani clan named Tangas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poulianos|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 20th century a multitude of scholars have studied the linguistic, cultural and racial background of the Sarakatsani. Among these, [[Denmark|Danish]] scholar [[Carsten Høeg]], who travelled twice to Greece between 1920 and 1925 and studied the dialect and narrations of the Sarakatsani, is arguably the most influential. He found no traces of foreign elements in the Sarakatsani dialect and  no traces of [[sedentism]] in their material culture. Furthermore, he looked for examples of nomadism in [[classical Greece]], similar to that of the Sarakatsani. He visited the Sarakatsani of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] and mentioned other groups with no fixed villages in several other parts of Greece as well.

Beuermann, a [[Germany|German]] scholar, rejects Høeg's interpretations that the Sarakatsani are "the purest of the ancient Greek population." There appears to be no written mention of the Sarakatsani previous to the 18th century, but that does not necessarily imply that they did not exist earlier. It is likely the term 'Sarakatsani' is a relatively new generic name given to an old population that lived for centuries in isolation from the other inhabitants of what is today Greece.

Georgakas (1949) and Kavadias (1965) believe that the Sarakatsani are either descendants of ancient nomads who inhabited the mountain regions of Greece in the pre-classical times, or they are descended from sedentary Greek peasants forced to leave their original settlements around the 14th century who became nomadic shepherds. Angeliki Hatzimihali, a Greek folklorist who spent a lifetime among the Sarakatsani, emphasises the prototypical elements of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] that she found in the pastoral way of life, social organisation and art forms of the Sarakatsani. She also points out the similarity between their decorative art and the [[geometric art]] of pre-classical Greece.&lt;ref name=Clogg167&gt;{{harvnb|Clogg|2002|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[England|English]] historian and anthropologist John K. Campbell arrives at the conclusion that the Sarakatsani must have always lived in—more or less—the same conditions and areas as they were found in his days of research in the mid-1950s. He also highlights the differences between them and the Vlachs, regarding the Sarakatsani as a distinctive social group within the Greek nation.&lt;ref name=Clogg166&gt;{{harvnb|Clogg|2002|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his field studies of the Sarakatsani of Epirus, [[N. G. L. Hammond|Nicholas Hammond]], a British historian, considers them descendants of Greek pastoralists living in the region of [[Gramos]] and Pindus since the early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]], who were dispossessed of their pastures by the Vlachs at the latest by the 12th century.&lt;ref name=migrations&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/293653?uid=3738128&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102627956891|title=American Journal of Philology|volume=99, No. 2|accessdate=3 March 2008|page=263|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year=1978|jstor=293653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other less popular theories about the origin of the Sarakatsani. Among them E. Makris (1990) believes that they are a pre-[[Neolithic]] people, while [[London]]-based scholar John Nandris inserts them into a more complex context of nomadic people interacting with one another, and [[Arnold van Gennep]] connects the Sarakatsani with the [[Yörüks]].

===Sarakatsani and Vlachs===
[[File:Sarakatsan_Greece_Pindus.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Sarakatsani girl in traditional costume; [[Pindus]], [[Greece]].]]
[[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Aromanian people|Aromanian]] scholars have tried to prove a common origin for the Sarakatsani and the [[Aromanians]] &lt;ref&gt;Capidan, Theodor: Sărăcăcianii. Un trib român grecizat în 'Dacoromania', 1924-6, vol.4, p.923-59 (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bujduveanu, Tănase - Sărăcăcianii, Editura Cartea Aromână 2005 (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt; The latter—also known as Vlachs—constitute the other major transhumant ethnic group in Greece and speak [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], an [[Eastern Romance languages|eastern Romance language]], while the Sarakatsani speak a  [[Varieties of Modern Greek|northern dialect]] of [[Greek language|Greek]].

The Sarakatsani partially share a common geographic distribution with the Vlachs in Greece, although the Sarakatsani extend farther to the south. Despite the differences between the two populations, they are often confused with each other due to their common transhumant way of life. Moreover, the term 'Vlach' has been used in Greece since the Byzantine times to  refer indiscriminately to all transhumant pastoralists.&lt;ref name=Clogg166/&gt; Besides, the presumption that a nomadic society, such as the Sarakatsani, would abandon its language, then translate all of its verbal tradition into Greek and create within a few generations a separate Greek dialect, has to be assumed with caution.

John Campbell states, after his own field work among the Sarakatsani in the 1950s, that the Sarakatsani are in a different position from the Vlachs, meaning the Aromanians and the Arvanitovlachs. The Vlachs are usually bilingual in Greek and Aromanian, while the Sarakatsani communities have always spoken only Greek and have known no other language. He also asserts that the increasing pressure on the limited areas available for winter grazing in the coastal plains has resulted in  disputes between the two groups on the use of the pastures. In addition, during the time of his research, many  Vlachs often lived in substantial villages where shepherding was not among their occupations, and demonstrated different art forms, values and institutions, from those of the Sarakatsani.&lt;ref name=Clogg166/&gt; The Sarakatsani also differ from the Vlachs in that they dower their daughters, assign a lower position to women and adhere to an even stricter patriarchal structure.&lt;ref name=migrations/&gt;

According to Gheorghe Bogdan, the Sarakatsans  based on linguistics and traditions are possibly a population descended from the [[Vlachs]], having assimilated to the Greek language.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe Bogdan, MEMORY, IDENTITY, TYPOLOGY: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RECONSTRUCTION OF VLACH ETHNOHISTORY, University of British Columbia, 1992, p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sarakatsani themselves have always stressed their Greek identity and deny having any relationship with the Vlachs. The Vlachs also regard the Sarakatsani as a distinct ethnic group, calling them Graeci (i.e. Greeks), a name used by Aromanians to distinguish the Greek-speaking populations from themselves, the Armânji.

==Culture==
{{Greeks}}
Today, almost all Sarakatsani have abandoned their nomadic way of life and assimilated to mainstream modern Greek life, but there have been efforts to preserve their cultural heritage. The traditional Sarakatsani settlements, dress and costumes make them a distinct social and cultural group within the collective Greek heritage, and they are not considered among the Greeks to constitute an ethnic minority.&lt;ref name=Clogg166/&gt; Their distinctive folk arts consist of song, dance, and poetry, as well as decorative sculptures in wood and embroidery on their traditional costumes, which resemble the [[geometric art]] of pre-classical Greece.&lt;ref name=Clogg167/&gt; In medicine, they use a number of [[Home remedy|folk remedies]] including herbs, honey and lamb's blood.

===Language===
The Sarakatsani speak a northern [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Varieties of Modern Greek|dialect]], Sarakatsanika (Σαρακατσάνικα), which contains many [[Ancient Greek|archaic Greek]] elements that have not survived in other variants of [[modern Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katsaros|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carsten Høeg]] states that there are no significant traces of foreign loan words in the Sarakatsani dialect, and that foreign elements are not found either phonetically or in the grammatical structure. Despite the fact that Sarakatsanika includes a few words related to pastoralism of [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] origin, the Aromanian influences on the Sarakatsani dialect are the result of recent contacts and economical dependencies between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~omladeno/BalkanConference/Docs/0Kahl_abstract.doc |title=Aromanian elements in Sarakatsan Greek |last=Kahl |first=Thede |year=2008 |publisher=[[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] |conference=16th Balkan and South Slavic Conference. 1–4 May 2008. [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kinship and honor of the kindred===
[[File:Sarakatsani Western Macedonia 1935.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sarakatsani men in [[West Macedonia]], [[Greece]] (1935).]]
The kinship system among the Sarakatsani adheres to a strong [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] descent system. When reckoning descent, lineage  is  traced along the paternal line alone; in determining family relationships, the descendants of a man's maternal and paternal grandparents provide the field from which his recognized kin are drawn. Kinship is not counted beyond the degree of the second cousin. Within the [[kinship]], the family constitutes the significant unit and is a corporate group. A conjugal pair is the core of the extended family, which also includes their unmarried offspring and often their young married sons and their wives. The Sarakatsani kindred constitutes a network of shared obligations and cooperation in situations concerning the honor of its members.

Their marriages are arranged and there can be no marriage between two members of the same kindred. The bride must bring into the marriage a dowry of household furnishings, clothing and more recently sheep or their cash equivalent. The husband's contribution is his share of the flocks held by his father, which remain held in common by his paternal joint household until some years after his marriage. The newlywed couple initially takes up residence near the husband's family of origin, while divorce and remarriage after widowhood are unknown.

The concept of honor is of great importance to the Sarakatsani and the behaviour of any member of a family reflects upon all its members. Therefore, the avoidance of negative public opinion provides a strong incentive to live up to the values and standards of propriety held by the community as a whole. Men have as their duty the protection of the family's honor and are watchful of the behaviour of the rest of the members of the household.

===Religion===
The Sarakatsani are [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] Christians and affiliated with the [[Church of Greece]].

The Sarakatsani honor the feast days of [[Saint George]] and [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Saint Demetrius]], which fall just before their seasonal migrations in late spring and early winter, respectively. Especially for the Saint George's feast day, a family feasts on lamb in the saint's honor, a ritual that also marks [[Christmas]] and the [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|Resurrection of Christ]], while [[Easter]] week is the most important ritual period in Sarakatsani religious life. Other ceremonial events, outside the formal Christian calendar, are weddings and funerals; the latter are ritual occasions that involve not only the immediate family of the deceased, but also the members of the largest kindred, while funerary practice is consistent with that of the church. [[Mourning]] is most marked among the women and most of all by the widow.

===Pastoralism===
The Sarakatsani traditionally have spent the summer months in the mountains and returned to the lower plains in the winter. The migration would start on the eve of [[Saint George]]'s day in April and the return migration  would begin on [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Saint Demetrius]]' day, on 26 October. However, according to a theory, the Sarakatsani were not always [[nomad]]s, but only turned to harsh nomadic mountain life to escape [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsaousis|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sofiatimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7092&amp;Itemid=2|script-title=el:Σαρακατσάνοι, οι σταυραετοί της Πίνδου|trans-title=Sarakatsani, the booted eagles of Pindus|publisher=Sofia Times Magazine|language=Greek|date=18 January 2007|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sarakatsani were found in several mountainous regions of continental [[Greece]], with some groups of northern Greece moving to neighbouring countries in the summer, since border crossings between Greece, [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]] were relatively unobstructed until the middle of the 20th century. After 1947, with the beginning of the [[Cold War]], borders between these countries were sealed;  and some Sarakatsani groups were trapped in other countries and not able to return to Greece.

Traditional Sarakatsani settlements were located on or near grazing lands both during summers and winters. The most characteristic type of dwelling was a domed hut, framed of branches and covered with thatch. A second type was a wood-beamed, thatched, rectangular structure. In both types, the centerpiece of the dwelling was a stone hearth. The floors and walls were plastered with mud and mule dung. Since the late 1930s, national requirements for the registration of citizens have led most of the Sarakatsani to adopt as legal residence the villages associated with summer grazing lands, and many have since built permanent houses in such villages.

[[File:Gyftokampos.jpg|thumb|right|500px|A reconstructed Sarakatsani [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in [[Skamneli]] village, in [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], Greece.]]
Their traditional settlements consist of a group of cooperating houses, generally linked by ties of kinship or marriage. They build the houses in a cluster on flat land close to the pasturage, with supporting structures nearby. This complex is called ''stani'' (στάνη), a term also used to refer to the cooperative group sharing the leased land. The head of each participating family pays a share at the end of each season to tselingas, the stani leader, in whose name the lease was originally taken. Inheritance of an individual's property and wealth generally passes to the males of the family; sons inherit a share of the flocks and property owned by their fathers and mothers, although household goods may pass to daughters.

Their life centers year-round on the needs of their flocks; men and boys are usually responsible for the protection and general care of the flocks, like shearing and milking, while women are occupied with the building of the dwellings, sheepfolds and goat pens; child care, and other domestic tasks, including preparing, spinning and dying the shorn wool; and tending chickens, the eggs of which are their only source of personal income. Women also keep household vegetable gardens, with some wild herbs used to supplement the family diet. When boys are old enough to help with the flocks, they accompany their fathers and are taught the skills they will someday need. Similarly, girls learn through observing and assisting their mothers.

==Demographics==
Until the mid-20th century, the Sarakatsani were scattered in many parts of [[Greece]], with those of the northern Greek regions moving frequently for the summer months to neighbouring countries, such as [[Albania]], southern [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[East Thrace]] in Turkey. In the 1940s the borders between these countries were closed, and small numbers of Sarakatsani had to settle down outside of Greece. Today, the majority of them do live in Greece, with some still in Bulgaria. There are no data on their number in Albania and the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

It has been difficult to establish the exact number of the Sarakatsani over the years, since they were dispersed and migrated in summer and winter and were not considered a distinct group such  that census data have not included separate information on them. As well, they were often confused with other population groups, especially the Vlachs. However, in the mid-1950s their number was estimated at 80,000 in Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clogg|2002|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was a period in which the process of urbanization had already started for large numbers of Greeks, and the number of the Sarakatsani who had already ceased to be transhumant shepherds sometime in the past was unknown.

The Sarakatsani populations can be primarily found in several regions of continental Greece:  in the [[Pindus]] mountain range and its southern extensions of [[Mount Giona|Giona]], [[Mount Parnassus|Parnassus]] and [[Panaitoliko (mountain range)|Panaitoliko]] in [[Central Greece]]; in central [[Euboea]], in the mountains of northern [[Peloponnese]], in the [[Rhodope Mountains]] in  Greece, in Greek  [[Thrace]], in the mountains near [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] and [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Ossa]] , and in parts of Greek [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. The vast majority of the Sarakatsani have abandoned the nomadic way of life and live permanently in their villages, while many members of the younger generation have moved to the principal Greek cities.

In [[Bulgaria]], according to the 2011 census, 2,556 individuals were identified as Sarakatsani, ({{lang-bg|каракачани}}, karakachani),&lt;ref name=bgcensus2011/&gt; a number significantly reduced from the 4,107 Sarakatsani identified in the 2001 census.&lt;ref name=etnicheski&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nccedi.government.bg/save_pdf.php?id=247 |title=Etnicheski maltsinstveni obshtnosti |trans-title=Ethnic minority communities |publisher=National Council for Cooperation on Ethnic and Integration Issues |year=2006 |accessdate=18 February 2007 |language=Bulgarian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416054328/http://www.nccedi.government.bg/save_pdf.php?id=247 |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their actual number is estimated to be as many as 25,000.&lt;ref name=newsbg/&gt; Most live in the areas of the [[Balkan Mountains|Balkan range]], [[Rila|Mount Rila]] and northeastern Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=IMIR/&gt; In 1991, they established the Federation of the Cultural and Educational Associations of Karakachans in [[Sliven]].&lt;ref name=IMIR/&gt;

The Sarakatsani in Bulgaria self-identify as Greeks, considering themselves the "purest of Greeks."

Bulgarians consider them to be probably of Vlach or [[Slavs|Slavic]] origin.&lt;ref name=etnicheski/&gt; An alternative Bulgarian theory claims that the Sarakatsani are descendants of [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] [[Thracians]] who, because of their isolation in the mountains, were not [[Slavicisation|Slavicised]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pimpireva|1995|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about the Sarakatsani in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] is scarce, probably to avoid any Greek claims upon the modern state's territory due to the Sarakatsani's Greek origin.&lt;ref name=UMBC/&gt; However, the Sarakatsani are said to have resided in mountainous regions near [[Bitola]] and south of [[Skopje]], but their presence has extended even further north, into [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref name=UMBC/&gt;

==Rootlessness and ritualization==
In her book ''An Island Apart'', the travel writer Sarah Wheeler traces scions of the Sarakatsani in [[Euboea]]. They can also be found in the island of [[Poros]]. She writes:

{{cquote|I was fascinated by this elusive, aloof transhumant tribe with beguilingly mysterious origin. They fanned out all over the [[Balkans]] and have most closely associated with the Pindus and the Rodopi mountains in the northern mainland: in the fifties there were about 80,000 of them. They spent half of the year in their mountain pastures and the other half in their lowlands. Their rootlessness was balanced by an elaborate ritualization of almost every aspect of their lives, from costume to the moral code. [[Euboea|Evia]] was the only island used by the Sarakatsani except Poros which was the furthest south they ever got (and perhaps [[Aegina]] too). In Evia they were, until this century, only found in the chunk of the island from the [[Chalcis]]-[[Kymi, Greece|Kymi]] axis northwards about as far an Ayianna, and the cluster of villages around Skiloyanni constituted the most heavily settled Sarakatsani region on the island. There were 50 Sarakatsani families living on Mount Kandili, working as [[resin gatherer]]s encased in layers of elaborate costume. Photographs taken only few decades ago of Sarakatsani women in traditional costume sitting outside their wigwam-shaped branch woven huts. Many of them had quite an un-Greek looks, and were fair; perhaps that explains the blond heads you see now. The Sarkatsanoi were known by various names by the indigenous population, usually based on where they were perceived to have come from, and in Evia they were generally called Roumi, Romi or Roumeliotes after the [[Central Greece|Roumeli]] region. People often spoke of them misleadingly as [[Vlachs]]. They are settled now, mainly as farmers, with their own permanent pasture land. Their story is one of total assimilation.}}

In a '''stay-behind''' operation, a country places secret operatives or organizations in its own territory, for use in the event that an enemy occupies that territory. If this occurs, the operatives would then form the basis of a [[resistance movement]] or act as [[espionage|spies]] from behind enemy lines. Small-scale operations may cover discrete areas, but larger stay-behind operations envisage reacting to the conquest of entire countries.

== History ==
Stay-behind operations of significant size existed during [[World War II]]. The [[United Kingdom]] put in place the [[Auxiliary Units]]. [[Soviet partisans|Partisans]] in Axis-occupied Soviet territory in the early 1940s operated with a stay-behind element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Collins| first= John M.| title= Military Geography| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=syGu2k0w-GEC| accessdate= 2013-09-28| year= 1998| publisher= Potomac Books, Inc.| isbn= 9781597973595| page = 122| quote= The Pripet Swamp, which created a great gap between German Army Group Center and Army Group North soon after ... June 1941, made it impossible for large military formations to conduct mutually supporting operations. Attempts to bypass such extensive wetlands proved perilous, because outflanked Soviet stay-behind forces and partisans pounced on logistical troops as soon as German spearheads disappeared.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Gill| first= Henry A.| title = Soldier Under Three Flags: Exploits of Special Forces' Captain Larry A.

Some of these units were left to operate as stay-behind or partisan units as the Soviets retreated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) sponsored stay-behind networks in many [[Europe]]an countries, intending to activate them in the event of that country being taken over by the [[Warsaw Pact]] or if a [[communist party]] came to power in a democratic election. According to Martin Packard they were "financed, armed, and trained in covert resistance activities, including assassination, political provocation and disinformation."&lt;ref name = "Packard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Packard|first=Martin|title=Getting It Wrong: Fragments From a Cyprus Diary 1964|year=2008|publisher=AuthorHouse | location = UK |isbn=978-1-4343-7065-5|page =364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many hidden weapons caches were found in [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and other countries, at the disposition of these "secret armies". The most famous of these NATO operations was [[Operation Gladio]], acknowledged by Italian Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] on October 24, 1990.

The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] regiments of [[Artists Rifles|SAS]] and [[Honourable Artillery Company]] provided such stay-behind parties in the UK's sector of West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The quiet Soldier | first = Adam | last = Ballinger|isbn=978-1-85797-158-3| year = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Theophilus the Penitent''' or '''Theophilus of Adana''' (died {{circa}} 538 AD) was a cleric in the sixth century [[Christianity|Church]] who is said to have made a [[deal with the Devil]] to gain an [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] position. His story is significant as it is the oldest story of a pact with the devil and was an inspiration for the [[Faust]] legend. His feast day is February 4.

[[Eutychianus of Adana]], who claimed to be an eyewitness of the events, is the first to record Theophilus's story. Although Theophilus is considered to be an historical personage, the tale associated with him is of an [[apocrypha]]l nature.

==Legend==
[[File:Maastricht Book of Hours, BL Stowe MS17 f255v-f256r.png|thumb|265px|Theophilus making a pact with the devil. Miniature in the ''[[Maastricht Hours]]'', ca. 1300-25]]
Theophilus was the [[archdeacon]] of [[Adana]], [[Cilicia]], which is part of modern [[Turkey]]. He was unanimously elected to be a [[bishop]], and when out of [[humility]] he turned the position down, another man was elected in his stead. When the new bishop unjustly deprived Theophilus of his position as archdeacon, Theophilus regretted his previous stance and sought out a [[necromancer]] to help him contact [[Satan]]. In exchange for his aid, Satan demanded that Theophilus renounce [[Jesus|Christ]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] in a contract signed with his own [[blood]]. Theophilus complied, and the devil gave him the position as bishop.

Later, fearful for his [[soul]], Theophilus repented and [[prayer|prayed]] to the Virgin for forgiveness. After forty days of [[fasting]], the Virgin appeared to him and verbally chastised him. Theophilus begged forgiveness and Mary promised to intercede with [[God]]. He then fasted a further thirty days, after which Mary appeared to him again, granted him [[absolution]]. However, Satan was unwilling to relinquish his hold over Theophilus, and three days later, Theophilus awoke to find the [[Damnation|damning]] contract on his chest. He then took the contract to the legitimate bishop and confessed all that he had done. The bishop burned the document, and Theophilus died out of sheer joy to be free from the burden of his contract.

==Variations==
Different versions of Theophilus's tale introduce various details, including:
*Theophilus's motivation for pursuing a deal with the devil is simple [[jealousy]].
*The magician is specifically referred to as a [[Jew]]. 
*The magician is omitted completely; Theophilus deals with the devil alone.
*Theophilus repents the day after he makes his deal, as the bishop apologizes to him.
*Mary appears immediately after Theophilus begins to pray.
*Mary does not appear at all, but Theophilus's contract appears on his chest the morning after he first prays.
*The devil provided Theophilus with great wealth in addition to his position in the [[Christian church|church]]. This wealth is then distributed to the poor before Theophilus's ecstatic death.

==Importance==
Theophilus's story played a role in establishing the importance of the intercession of the Virgin Mary, in addition to providing a basis for later tales involving the [[conjuration]] of devils.

The Virgin Mary increased in [[Mariology|her theological importance]] throughout the 11th century. The story was used to illustrate the power and necessity of her intercession by [[Pietro Damiani|Peter Damian]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Anthony of Padua]], [[Bonaventure]] and much later on by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]. The story of Theophilus formed the basis of a thirteenth-century [[miracle play]] by the [[trouvère]] [[Rutebeuf]], ''[[Le Miracle de Théophile]]'', one of the earliest pieces of [[French theatre]] extant.

The story of Saint Theophilus is an important example in the development of the theology of [[witchcraft]]. As seen in the tale, the summoning of devils was not originally considered to be a damning [[sin]], Theophilus's troubles come from the fact that he has sold his soul, not that he treated with the devil. This changed during the late 13th century and into the 14th century as [[Inquisition|Inquisitors]] such as [[Bernard Gui]] and [[Nicolau Aymerich]] sought to expand the power of the Inquisition, whose mandate was the suppression of heresy, by defining sorcery as a form of [[heresy]]. Accordingly, Theophilus would have been branded a heretic for his association with the devil.
&lt;!-- Other tales about a pact between man and the devil include the Faust legend, and the plays Mary of Nijmegen (Dutch, early 15th century, attributed to Anna Bijns) and Cenodoxus (German, early 17th century, by Jacob Bidermann).

None of these, however, have been noted to have been inspired or influenced by the legend of Theophilus. If connections with any other legends or tales are made in the encyclopedia, citations are needed. --&gt;

== The Legend in Art ==
The legend of Theophilus first appears in art in the 11th century in an historiated initial, which depicts the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] (who is seated between two angels) with Theophilus at her feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mâle|first1=Emile|translator1-last=Mathews|translator1-first=Marthiel |title=Religious Art in France: The Thirteenth Century|date=1986|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest intact narrative cycle is at the abbey church of [[Souillac, Lot|Sainte-Marie at Souillac]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cothren|first1=M.W.|title=The Iconography of the Theophilus Windows in the First Half of the Thirteenth Century|journal=Speculum|date=1984|volume=59|pages=308–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sculpture depicts four scenes of the legend: the signing of the bond, the oath of loyalty to the devil, Theophilus's repentance, and the return of the bond by the Virgin.

The legend was the most popular in art in the 13th century; it occurred most frequently in [[illuminated manuscripts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Root|first1=Jerry|title=The Theophilus Legend in Medieval Text and Image|date=2017|publisher=D.

'''Timothy William Sharp''' (born 9 May 1988) is an Australian artist who has been diagnosed with [[autism]] and is most famous for his creation of the colourful super hero Laser Beak Man. 
In 2010, Sharp's work garnered international attention when Laser Beak Man was turned into an eight episode animated television series screening in Australia on ABC3 TV and it was then sold to Cartoon Network Australia, New Zealand and Asia – a world first for a young man with autism to achieve.&lt;ref name="abc_a"&gt;{{cite web|last=Straker |first=Luise |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/02/09/2814028.htm |title=Laser Beak Man conquers TV – ABC Brisbane – Australian Broadcasting Corporation |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==

Sharp was born in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia in 1988.  Following concerns about his lack of language development – he only used one or two words occasionally and exhibited some unusual behaviours and was constantly upset – he was diagnosed with autism at the age of three.  The specialist's opinion was that the difficulties were so extensive that Tim would never learn anything and that the best thing that could be done would be to put him away and forget about him.  

His mother introduced drawing as a means of communicating with her son. After some time of watching his mother draw stick figures to explain a situation Sharp picked up a pencil at age four and began drawing. His mother remembers that his very first drawing displayed his quirky individual style.

Quickly, Sharp began to develop speech and went to using 10 words within a month, increasing to 100 words three months later, from which point his speech continued to develop.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2004/s1205805.htm |title=Australian Story – Only in America &amp; The Rex Files |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=20 September 2004 |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a lifelong passion and interest in superheroes, at age 11 Sharp created his own superhero from his imagination called Laser Beak Man.


At age 16, in 2004, Sharp was the only Australian selected by jury for the world's largest arts festival for people with disabilities, VSA ([[Very Special Arts]]) that was founded by Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of President John F. Kennedy. Sharp travelled to Washington, D.C. for the festival and carried the Australian flag into the opening ceremony at the John F Kennedy performing arts centre.  The [http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2004/s1205805.htm ABC’s Australian Story], made a documentary about Sharp's trip to Washington DC which screened in September 2005.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

== Career ==

Sharp is most famous for his bold and colourful artworks completed in crayon that all feature his superhero Laser Beak Man. Many of them are interpretations of pop culture icons or current topics of interest. Others are representations of Sharp's literal understanding of language, a common trait of autism. Most of them reflect Sharp's unique sense of humour and his often irreverent opinion of people and situations.

Sharp's art is in demand from collectors from around the world. Preferring to exhibit in his home country of Australia, his exhibitions are sellout successes, attracting the attention of many prominent Australians and art collectors from both Australia and around the world.&lt;ref name="arts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.qld.gov.au/artsupdate/2011/december/laser-beak.html |title=Laser Beak Man: the story of autistic artist Tim Sharp |publisher=Arts.qld.gov.au |date= |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Museum of Australia]] in Canberra holds an exhibition of Sharp's story and his art in its Eternity gallery. His art has been exhibited in the [[Sydney Opera House]].

In 2010 during an exhibition of his art at the [[Brisbane Powerhouse]], Sharp met visitors to the exhibition Sheldon Liebermann and his animator Igor Coric from [http://www.bigfish.tv/ BigfishTV] in Brisbane who suggested animating the art and produced the series for the Australian Broadcasting Commission.&lt;ref name="abc_a" /&gt;

In 2012, a film about Sharp produced by Arts Queensland was screened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York City as part of the Sprout Film Festival. Also, in 2012, The Ghost Ballerinas, a rock band from [[Nashville, Tennessee]], asked Sharp to create the artwork for their album "Play Me on the Radio". Together Sharp and the band members wrote the song "Laser Beak Man" which was included on the album and made available on [[iTunes]]. The band members were so inspired by Sharp, they wanted to help others with [[autism]] and raise autism awareness so they put on a music festival in Tennessee called the I Am What I Am music festival. Sharp travelled to Tennessee for the festival.&lt;ref name="arts" /&gt;

Sharp's 2014 TEDx Sydney talk received a standing ovation in the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=A double shot of happiness: Tim &amp; Judy Sharp at TEDxSydney 2014|date=2014-05-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78VbeiAbcYI|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best selling memoir of Sharp's life A Double Shot of Happiness was published in 2015.

A Theater production of Laser Beak Man is currently in development in conjunction with Dead Puppet Society and the New Victory Theatre at 42nd Street Studios in New York City.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6467">'''Urs Hans von Aesch''' was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizen suspected of the 2007 abduction and murder of five-year-old '''Ylenia Lenhard''' in [[Appenzell]], Switzerland.

== Abduction and suspected murder of Ylenia Lenhard ==
Von Aesch apparently committed [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head on July 31, 2007, a few hours after Lenhard disappeared, and shortly after shooting a 46-year-old man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpolizeibericht.ch%2Fger_details_2971%2FOberbueren_SG_Mann_angeschossen_-_weisser_Kastenwagen_mit_deutschen_Kennzeichen_gesucht_-_Kapo-Grossfahdung_erfolglos.html&amp;langpair=de%7Cen&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=Man wounded - a white van with German mark sought - unsuccessfully|date=2007-07-31|format=Google translated}} &lt;/ref&gt; Von Aesch's body was found the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polizeibericht.ch%2Fger_details_2988%2FOberbueren_Billwilerwald_SG_Gesuchtes_Auto_gefunden_Fahrer_des_Pw_mit_auslaendischen_Kontrollschildern_beging_Selbstmord.html&amp;langpair=de%7Cen&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=Seeking car found, driver of the Pw. with foreign control signs committed suicide|date=01.08.2007|format=Google translated}} &lt;/ref&gt; A backpack with Lenhard's clothes inside and her cycling helmet were found near von Aesch's body and was found to carry his DNA. Traces of Lenhard's DNA were also found in a white van owned by von Aesch, containing a mattress that he had been using to sleep on.&lt;ref name="nowpublic"&gt;{{cite news |title=Polizeibericht.ch - Police: Ylenia was in von Aeschs car |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpolizeibericht.ch%2Fger_details_3063%2FSt_Gallen_Oberbueren_SG_Appenzell_AI_Spuren_des_Auslandsschweizers_Von_Aesch_am_Rucksack_Helm_und_dem_Kickbrett_von_Ylenia.html_und_dem_Kickbrett_von_Ylenia.html&amp;langpair=de%7Cen&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;prev=%2Flanguage_tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witnesses have said a man matching von Aesch's description had been seen outside the public bath in Appenzell for at least 10 days.&lt;ref name="express"&gt;{{cite news | title =  Madeleine: Police to show her parents picture of child snatcher suspect who killed himself | publisher = [[Daily Express]] | date = 2007-08-07 |accessdate = 2007-09-13 |url = http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/15806/Madeleine-lookalike-snatched-by-pervert|archive-url = https://archive.is/20110522140318/http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/15806/Madeleine-lookalike-snatched-by-pervert|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2011-05-22}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss police announced on September 15, 2007 that a body had been discovered in the woods between the villages of Oberbüren and Niederwil considered almost certain to be Lenhard's.&lt;ref name="swissinfo"&gt;{{cite news | title =  Body of missing girl believed found| publisher = [[swissinfo]] | date = 2007-09-15 |accessdate = 2007-09-15 |url = http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/Body_of_missing_girl_believed_found.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=8221344&amp;cKey=1189931610000&amp;ty=st}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16 2007 the Swiss police confirmed that the found body was in fact the remains of Lenhard. The man who found the corpse on his own has received a reward of approximately $20,000. The sum was gathered by authorities and relatives to keep the search going.

The finder stated: "If the wild animals hadn't dug her up from the 1–2&amp;nbsp;foot deep hole where she was buried, probably no one would have ever found her." Wild animals had torn parts of the body, especially the upper torso, apart. This forced forensics to identify the body with a DNA match. Police think it is very probable that she was the victim of a rape-murder crime. Although on September 19, 2007, the police said, they didn't find any evidence that she was raped before or after she was murdered. The cause of her death was [[Toluene#Toxicology and metabolism|toluol]] poisoning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Von Aesch had a criminal record and was sentenced to 15 months in jail in 1961 after trying to extort ten thousand Swiss francs from a businessman in Zurich by threatening to kidnap his young son. He sent him a letter saying "...how terrible must it be, to live through the day not knowing if your dear Geni will return from day care..." (translated).

In 1990 he married and moved to [[Benimantell]], a village 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Benidorm]] in Spain. Police in [[St. Gallen]] have also re-opened enquiries into the disappearances of five other girls who disappeared in the area before von Aesch moved to Spain.

== Suspected in the McCann case ==
Von Aesch was also briefly a suspect in the [[disappearance of Madeleine McCann]]. He was thought to be close to [[Praia da Luz]] when Madeleine McCann disappeared. A white van with Spanish number plates matching the description of von Aesch's was seen parked for several days in front of the McCann's apartment. The van was not seen again after Madeleine disappeared.

On the 7 May 2013 it was reported that Scotland Yard officers, as part of their ongoing review, had travelled to St Gallen to investigate possible links between the two crimes. Hanspeter Krüsi, spokesman for the Swiss police, stated, that after the investigation no links could be established between the two cases, and this is what was communicated to Scotland Yard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24heures.ch/suisse/scotland-yard-enquete-stgall-affaire-maddie/story/31625403 Criminalité: Scotland Yard a enquêté à St-Gall pour l'affaire Maddie - Suisse - 24heures.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Machine gun DP MON.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[DP-28]]]]
'''Vasily Alekseyevich Degtyaryov''' ({{lang-ru|Васи́лий Алексе́евич Дегтярёв}}; January 2, 1880, [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] &amp;ndash; January 16, 1949, [[Moscow]]) was a [[Russia]]n engineer who specialised in [[weapon]]s design.

==Biography==
Degtyaryov was the [[Major General]] of the [[Engineering]] and [[Artillery]] Service, Doctor of Technical Sciences (1940), and [[Hero of Socialist Labor]] (1940; he received the second such award in its history just two weeks after [[Joseph Stalin]] himself). He became a [[CPSU]] member in 1941. 

Vasily Degtyaryov headed the first [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[firearms]] design bureau. He created several types of [[machine gun]]s, [[submachine gun]]s and [[anti-tank]] guns.

Vasily Degtyaryov was awarded the USSR's [[State Stalin Prize]] in 1941, 1942, 1944, and 1949 ([[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]]). He was also awarded three [[Order of Lenin|Orders of Lenin]], four other [[order (decoration)|order]]s and different [[medal]]s.

==Contributions==
*In 1927, the [[Red Army]] was equipped with the [[7.62 mm]] [[light machine gun]] called [[DP-28|''ДП'', or DP-28]] ({{lang-ru|'''Д'''егтярёва '''П'''ехотный}} ''Degtyaryov's infantry (machine gun)''). This design also led to
**Two [[aircraft]] machine guns: ''ДА'' (DA) and ''ДА-2'' (DA-2) ('''Д'''егтярёва '''А'''виационный)
**A [[tank]] machine gun: ''ДТ'', or DT ('''Д'''егтярёва '''Т'''анковый)
*Degtyaryov also designed a few models of submachine guns, the best of which would be adopted by the [[Soviet Army]] in 1934 (modernized in 1940) as the ''ППД'' [[PPD-40]] (from '''П'''истолет-'''п'''улемёт '''Д'''егтярёва, ''Degtyaryov's submachine gun'').
*In 1930, Degtyaryov designed his 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm large-[[caliber]] machine gun, the ''ДК'', or DK ('''Д'''егтярёва '''К'''рупнокалиберный). In 1938, this machine gun was upgraded by [[Georgi Shpagin]] and called  ''ДШК'' ([[DShK]]) ('''Д'''егтярёва '''Ш'''пагина '''К'''рупнокалиберный).
*In 1939, Degtyaryov designed his [[heavy machine gun]] called ''ДС'', or DS ('''Д'''егтярёва '''С'''танковый). The [[DS-39]] was issued to the Red Army and used in the [[Winter War]] of 1939-1940. The belt feed mechanism damaged the cartridge cases and the gun was found too complicated and liable to malfunctions and was withdrawn from service.
*During the [[Great Patriotic War]], the Soviet Army adopted Degtyaryov's 14.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[anti-tank rifle]] the ''ПТРД'', or [[PTRD]] ('''П'''ротиво'''т'''анковое '''Р'''ужьё '''Д'''егтярёва). 
*Near the end of World War II, Degtyaryov designed a belt-fed light machine gun chambered for the [[7.62x39mm]] intermediate cartridge, which entered Soviet service in 1946 as the [[RPD]] light machine gun and was exported to numerous countries worldwide.

==Honours and awards==
* [[Stalin Prize]]s;
**1942 - 1st class and 2nd class
**1946 - 2nd class
**1949 - 1st class (posthumous)
* [[Hero of Socialist Labour]] (1940)
* Three [[Orders of Lenin]]
* [[Order of Suvorov]], 1st and 2nd classes
* [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]]
* [[Order of the Red Star]]
* [[Medal "For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945"]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2694">'''Ziyar ibn Shahrakuya''' ({{lang-fa|کوی کشت و ابنشهر}}; also spelled '''Shahrakawayh'''), was a high-ranking [[Gilaks|Gilaki]] military officer who served the [[Buyids]].

Ziyar was the son of Shahrakawayh, the son of [[Harusindan]], the maternal uncle of the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]]. Ziyar had a cousin, who married the Buyid ruler [[Adud al-Dawla]], and bore him one son named [[Abu Kalijar Marzuban]]. During that period, Ziyar, along with a [[Daylamites|Daylamite]] officer named [[Fuladh ibn Manadhar]], dominated the Buyid court of [[Baghdad]]. 

After the death of Adud al-Dawla in 983, the Buyid Empire was thrown into civil war; the Empire was disputed between his two sons Abu Kalijar Marzuban (who took the name Samsam al-Dawla) and [[Sharaf al-Dawla]]. The [[Turkic people|Turkic]] soldiers of Iraq shortly betrayed Samsam al-Dawla, and went towards to the court of Sharaf al-Dawla. However, Ziyar managed to make most of them change their mind and stay loyal to Samsam al-Dawla. In 987, Sharaf al-Dawla marched towards Baghdad and deposed Samsam al-Dawla. He then imprisoned Fuladh and had Ziyar executed.
