The '''Château de Bercy''' was a [[Louis XIII style|Louis XIII]] [[château]] located in [[Bercy]], a part of modern-day [[Charenton-le-Pont]] in Paris, France.

== History ==
The château was constructed beginning in 1658 for Charles-Henri I de Malon de Bercy by [[architect]] [[François Le Vau]], [[Louis Le Vau]]'s younger brother. It was unfinished upon the death of the younger Le Vau in 1676. Malon de Bercy's son and heir, Charles-Henri II de Malon de Bercy (1678–1742), superintendent of finances, finished its construction, but modified the plans, filling in the moats, creating gardens, and altering the interior distribution. The château was reworked from 1702 to 1713 by the architect Jacques de La Guépière, who added to the service buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Hautecour 1948, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles-Henri II commissioned sculptors employed on royal buildings to modernize the château's furnishings in 1713-14.

The gardens, designed by [[André Le Nôtre]], extended to the banks of the [[Seine]] river. They were also known as the ''Parc de Bercy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/files/directions_services/caef/Documents/Expositions_virtuelles/ministere_ville/pages/ber-plan2.html |title=Le parc et le château de Bercy |publisher=Economie.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole Bercy area around the château and the river were full of gardens and other houses and mansions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/files/directions_services/caef/Documents/Expositions_virtuelles/ministere_ville/pages/ber-plan1.html |title=Le Petit Bercy et les villégiatures en bord de Seine, en marge du château de Bercy |publisher=Economie.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gradually gave way to more condensed housing as the city grew in population during the 19th century.

The château was sold and demolished in 1861. Today the main [[SNCF]] route from east to west, the [[Boulevard Périphérique|Périphérique]] and the [[autoroute de l'Est]] run where the garden of Le Nôtre used to be. Only two hunting pavilions survive, built 1713–1714 to the designs of Jacques de La Guépière and located on either side of the rue du Petit Château.&lt;ref&gt;Gallet 1995, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the console tables became a part of the collections of the [[Louvre Museum]].&lt;ref name="louvre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/console-table-chateau-de-bercy|title=Console table from the Château de Bercy|publisher=[[Louvre Museum]]|accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DAF 33''' is a compact saloon car produced by the [[DAF Trucks|DAF]] company of [[Eindhoven]], in the Netherlands between 1967 and 1974. Outwardly and technically it differed little from its predecessor, the [[DAF Daffodil]].

1966 had seen the introduction of the [[Giovanni Michelotti|Michelotti]] styled [[DAF 44]] which appeared to compete in virtually the same market segment as the Daffodil-based design; but the 33, its development costs presumably long since amortised,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} remained in production with its new name.  A more luxurious version became available in 1969.   Thereafter the car changed very little:  however, the 6 volt electrical system was replaced with a 12 volt one in 1972.&lt;ref name=DailyMailMotorShowReviewOct1972re1973&gt;{{cite journal|journal =Daily Mail Motor Show Review 1972 on 1973 Cars |volume = | authorlink =  |title = DAF 33| publisher=Associated Newspapers Group Ltd |location= London |pages = Page 14 (DAF 33)| date = October 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAF 33, in common with other DAF cars, featured a [[continuously variable transmission]] system, the DAF [[Variomatic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2686">'''DFS-Kopernikus''' (meaning ''Deutscher Fernmeldesatellit Kopernikus'') was the name of three [[geostationary satellite|geostationary satellites]] of [[Deutsche Bundespost]] and later [[Deutsche Telekom AG]]. They are no longer in use.

When DFS-Kopernikus 3 was nearing the end of its life, [[SES S.A.|SES]] sealed an agreement with Deutsche Telekom to use the 23.5° east position and frequencies, and in August 2001, [[Astra 1D]] was moved there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advanced-television.com/2001/2001_newsarchive/24%20Aug-2%20Sept.html "New position for ASTRA 1D"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009164902/http://www.advanced-television.com/2001/2001_newsarchive/24%20Aug-2%20Sept.html |date=2009-10-09 }} ''Advanced-Television.com'' (August 21, 2001). Retrieved on November 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Astra 23.5°E]] position was officially opened in March 2002 with the launch and positioning of [[Astra 3A]]. Deutsche Telekom contracted for 10 transponders on that craft and shortly switched over all traffic from DFS-Kopernikus 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA |date=May 30, 2002 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2002/4421175 |title= ASTRA 3A fully operational at 23.5° East |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Station Keeping ==

The orbital station keeping manoeuvres of the satellites were conducted by the Flight Dynamics Group of the [[German Aerospace Center]] (German Space Operations Center) in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]], Bavaria. The satellites were located at the following positions:

* '''DFS-Kopernikus 1''': 23.5° East, later 33.5° East (1989–1994?)
* '''DFS-Kopernikus 2''': 28.5° East (1990–2000?)
* '''DFS-Kopernikus 3''': 23.5° East (1992–2002)

== German satellite TV market share in 1990 ==
*[[SES S.A.|SES]]: ca. 80%
*Kopernikus: ca. 20%
*TV-SAT 2: under 1%

'''"Den vilda"''' (meaning ''The wild one'') is a winter-related song by [[Sweden|Swedish]] band [[One More Time (band)|One More Time]]. It won the Melodifestivalen 1996 contest and hence became the Swedish entry at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

The song was performed as the 23rd and last entry in the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest. It was written by Peter Grönvall. At the close of the voting it had received 100 points and placed 3rd out of 23 entries. It also peaked at #7 on the Swedish singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedishcharts.com/search.asp?cat=s&amp;artist=&amp;artist_search=starts&amp;title=Den+vilda&amp;title_search=starts|title=Swedish Charts Archive|accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One More Time also recorded an all-English version of the song under the title "'''The Wilderness Mistress'''".

==Dansaðu vindur==
"Dansadu vindur" is a 2013 adaptation of the song and is interpreted by [[Eivør Pálsdóttir]] (alternatively Eivör Pálsdóttir) from [[Faroe Islands]]. It uses the music of "Den vilda" with new lyrics in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. It became a hit in the winter of 2013 in Iceland. The single is taken from the 14-track Icelandic compilation album ''Frostrósir - Heyr himnasmiður'' with contributions by a number of well-known artists.

The '''East African Revival''' ({{lang-lg|Okulokoka}}) was an important [[Christian revival|renewal]] movement within [[Evangelicalism|Protestant Evangelicalism]] in East Africa during the late 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Kevin|title=The East African Revival:  History and Legacies|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Surrey, England|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Revival began at a [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS) mission station in the Belgian territory of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] in 1929, and spread to [[Uganda Protectorate]], [[Tanganyika Territory]] and [[Kenya Colony]] during the 1930s and 1940s.

The revival contributed to the significant growth of the Church in East Africa in the 1940s through the 1970s and had a visible influence on Western missionaries who were observer-participants of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacMaster|first=Richard K.|title=A Gentle Wind of God:  The Influence of the East Africa Revival|year=2006|publisher=Herald Press|location=Scottdale, PA|page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2012}}

It was registered with the [[Flag Institute]] on 8 April 2013 as the winning entry of a BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester competition.&lt;ref name="worcesternews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/10337675.Fly_the_flag_for_Worcestershire/|author=Worcester News|title=Fly the flag for Worcestershire|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first flown in a ceremony at [[Worcester Cathedral]] on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-22061580|author=BBC News|title=New Worcestershire county flag flown at cathedral|accessdate=10 April 2013|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Design==
Designed by Elaine Truby, the flag features the county's famed black pear ([[black worcester pear]]) – a symbol reported to have been used by Worcestershire units at the [[Battle of Agincourt]].  Additionally a pear tree is seen on the local council's arms.  Three of these pears are seen on a shield charged against a wavy green and blue background. These latter colours symbolise the verdant flood plain of the [[River Severn]] as it runs through the county. The dark green hue is that worn by the [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|county's cricket team]].

The flag was created after a competition was launched in 2013 by radio station BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester, to create an official flag for the county after it was discovered Worcestershire didn’t have one.

==Armorial Banner==
An alternate flag offered for sale commercially is a banner of the arms of [[Worcestershire County Council]] and as such is the property of the council and only represents it, not the wider county. In the absence of an adopted flag at the time, this council flag had been flown alongside the [[Union Flag]] above the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1946468|author=Department for Comminities and Local Government|title=Worcestershire flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government|date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10104">The '''Global Task Force on Expanded Access to Cancer Care and Control in Developing Countries''' (GTF.CCC) is a research and advisory initiative directed by the [http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k62597 Harvard Global Equity Initiative], the [[Harvard Medical School]], the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], the [[University of Washington]] and the University of Washington Medicine to address the global burden of cancer in developing countries. This initiative, originally convened in 2009 by four Harvard-based institutions including the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]], comprises a network of more than thirty leaders in the fields of cancer and global health from around the world. GTF.CCC also draws on more than 50 technical and strategic advisors, a private sector engagement group, a strategic advisory committee, and a dual secretariat of staff based at the Harvard Global Equity Initiative and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

[[File:GTFCCCFINAL.jpg|thumb|The Global Task Force on Expanded Access to Cancer Care and Control in Developing Countries]]

==Mandate==
&lt;br /&gt;The mandate of the GTF.CCC is to design, implement and evaluate innovative strategies for expanding access to cancer prevention, detection and care.  The initiative focuses on the creation of global facilities and strategies for the financing and procurement of affordable, essential cancer drugs, vaccines and services for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship and palliation.  Through local partners, the GTF.CCC supports implementation of innovative service delivery models that provide evidence for scaling up access to cancer care and control, and strengthening health systems in developing countries.

==Justification==
&lt;br /&gt;Although once considered a problem exclusive to high-income countries, cancer is a leading cause of death and disability in the developing world. Of the 7 million cancer deaths in the world today, approximately 70% occur in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Beaulieu N 2009"&gt;Beaulieu N, Bloom D, Bloom R, Stein R. Breakaway: The global burden of cancer - challenges and opportunities. The Economist Intelligence Unit. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2030, low and middle income countries will bear the brunt of an estimated 27 million new cancer cases and 17 million cancer deaths.&lt;ref name="Beaulieu N 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beaulieu N 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cancer control opportunities in low- and middle-income countries. Washington, DC: Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, National Academies Press; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferlay J, Bray F, Pisani P, Parkin DM. GLOBOCAN 2002: Cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence worldwide: International Agency for Research on Cancer; 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyle P, and Levin, B. World Cancer Report 2008. Lyon: International Agency for Research on Cancer; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanavos P. The rising burden of cancer in the developing world. Annals of Oncology 17 (Supplement 8): viii15–viii23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Case fatality for the cancers that can be treated or prevented is much higher in the developing world – a result of grave inequity in the opportunity to survive the disease. In the case of breast cancer, the ratio of deaths to incident cases in 2002 was an estimated 56% in low-income countries, 44% in low-middle income countries and 39% in high-middle income developing countries.  In the developed world, it was 24%.&lt;ref name="Beaulieu N 2009"/&gt;

The world faces a huge and largely unperceived cost of inaction from cancer in the developing world, which calls for an immediate and large-scale global response.

==Structure and Leadership==
&lt;br /&gt;The Task Force is a 36-member body combining leaders in cancer and global health and co-chaired by [[Julio Frenk]], Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health and [[Lawrence Corey]], President and Director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Her Royal Highness [[Princess Dina Mired of Jordan]] and [[Lance Armstrong]] serve as Honorary Co-Presidents. The Harvard Global Equity Initiative, under the direction of Felicia Knaul and Julie Gralow, serves as the Secretariat for the Task Force.

==History==
&lt;br /&gt;The GTF.CCC was launched on November 4, 2009 at Harvard University during the International Conference ‘[http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k62597&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup96975 Breast Cancer in the Developing World: Meeting the Unforeseen Challenge to Women, Health and Equity].’

==Activities==
&lt;br /&gt;A key contribution of the Task Force is the GTF.CCC Report published in 2011. The content of the GTF.CCC Report follows from the mandate of the Task Force and provides the building blocks of a strategy for expanded cancer care and control strategies in the developing world.

The report includes the below content:

'''•'''        A list of priority cancers in the developing world,

'''•'''        the definition of an essential package of services and drugs,

'''•'''        estimates of potential demand for drugs,

'''•'''        designs and strategies for service delivery models that harness the primary and secondary levels of health care systems and expand access while reducing cost,

'''•'''        mechanisms for regional and global negotiation of drug prices, and

'''•'''        options for scaling-up service delivery and monitoring health outcomes.

Following the dictum of thinking globally and acting locally, the GTF.CCC reviews and builds on the lessons learned from work in specific countries, as well as dedicating itself to expanding cancer care and control in these countries. Innovative and successful models have been identified constituting three models and spanning five countries of differing levels of income (Rwanda, Malawi, Haiti, Mexico and Jordan). These models will serve as dynamic learning laboratories for generating and applying the specific proposals and delivery models that are designed by the GTF.CCC and detailed in the report introduced above. The pilot programs will specifically focus on developing, designing, implementing and evaluating innovations in delivery in the areas of task shifting, infrastructure shifting and the use of technology.

The GTF.CCC partner projects were chosen based on the opportunity to expand access to cancer care and control, as well as the ongoing involvement of members of the GTF.CCC and/or the Secretariat. Thus, this aspect of the work of the GTF.CCC does not involve establishing new projects, but rather working to improve, extend, expand and scale-up initiatives and institutions that are already well-established. The partner programs listed below are locally entrenched and independently sustainable.

For 2010, the local partners and programs are:

==History==
Guatemala had diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union]] on April 19, 1945, during the [[Cold War]] era. However, during the armed conflict in Guatemala in 1960-1980, Guatemalan-Soviet relations were "frozen", but were not severed or interrupted. On January 4, 1991, a joint communique about the exchange of the diplomatic missions was signed. In 1995, the first Guatemalan embassy was opened in [[Moscow]], while Russia was represented in Guatemala through its embassy in [[Costa Rica]]. Nevertheless, in 2007, Russia had opened an embassy in [[Guatemala City]].

The Russian Federation together with other states and with international organizations supported the process of peaceful settlement in Guatemala.

'''HMS ''Grenadier''''' (Pennant number: T334) was a [[Military class trawler|Military class]] [[Admiralty trawler|trawler]] of the British [[Royal Navy]], which served as an [[Anti Submarine Warfare]] Vessel during the Second World War. The ship was built by [[Cook, Welton &amp; Gemmell]] in Beverley, England. She was laid down on 13 June 1942, launched on 26 September 1942 and finally commissioned on 10 February 1943&lt;!-- ? --&gt;. Her role was to support convoys, and deter attack by German u-boats using depth charges. This class of vessel could be fitted with extra guns, and the Grenadier was reported to have had an extra pair of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20mm guns]] and a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type_290|Type 290]] mast mounted radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Malcolm George|title=British and Commonwealth Warship Camouflage of WWII|pages=125|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CEauCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=HMS+Grenadier+T+334&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYpqyihrLWAhXHYlAKHVYRB0oQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=HMS%20Grenadier%20T%20334&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her most notable engagement occurred on 16 March 1945. That morning she was in convoy alongside the steam merchant ''[[Inger Toft]]'', now operating under the [[Ministry of War]] transport, when at 0900 ''Inger Toft'' was struck by a torpedo fired from [[German submarine U-722|German submarine ''U-722'']] and began to quickly sink. The skipper of ''Grenadier'' at the time was A/SkrLt&lt;!-- ? --&gt; Arthur George Day of the [[Royal Navy Reserve]]. It was common practice when under attack, for the skipper to order the crew to take the vessel to full propulsion whilst dropping depth charges, to avoid being hit whilst trying to hunt the culprit [[U-boat]]. A/SkrLt Day realised that the men of ''Inger Toft'' whose vessel had now fallen beneath the water would have little chance of survival if they followed this routine. He ordered his men to turn the vessel into the direction of the sunken vessel. Whilst ultimately risking his vessel and entire crew, they managed to save the entire 30 man crew of ''Inger Toft'' including the master from the freezing waters. For his actions A/SkrLt Arthur George Day was mentioned in dispatches, he received an oak leaf to be worn on his 1939-1945 war medal. Following the war he returned to his pre-war occupation as a skipper operating from the small fishing port of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/commanders/5973.html|title=A/Skr.Lt.  Arthur George Day   of the Royal Navy Reserve (RNR) - Allied Warship Commanders of WWII - uboat.net|website=uboat.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the war ended ''Grenadier'' was first sold to a merchant fishing firm in Grimsby, she was renamed ''Thurinigia'', later in 1947 she was converted for oil burning but by 1966 she was sold for scrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/3471.html|title=Inger Toft (British Steam merchant) - Ships hit by German U-boats during WWII - uboat.net|website=uboat.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/6284.html|title=HMS Grenadier (T 334)  of the Royal Navy - British ASW Trawler of the Military class - Allied Warships of WWII - uboat.net|website=uboat.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Istanbul Cooperation Initiative''' (ICI) is an initiative launched during [[NATO]]'s [[2004 Istanbul summit]].

During this summit, NATO leaders decided to elevate{{huh|date=June 2018}} the Alliance’s [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] to a genuine partnership and to launch the ICI with selected countries in the broader region of the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=NATO | title="NATO elevates Mediterranean Dialogue to a genuine partnership, launches Istanbul Cooperation Initiative" | date=29 June 2004 | url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2004/06-june/e0629d.htm | accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is an offer to engage in practical security cooperation activities with states throughout the [[Greater Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/06/20040628-2.html WHITE HOUSE, ''Fact Sheet: The Istanbul Cooperation Initiative '', June 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; This new initiative stands alongside NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] Program and the [[Mediterranean Dialogue]]. NATO itself regards these security cooperation partnerships as a response to the new challenges of the 21st century and as a complement to the [[G8]] and U.S.-EU decisions to support calls for reform from within the Broader Middle East region. The ICI offers practical cooperation with interested nations in the Greater Middle East in such areas as:
* Counter-[[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]];
* [[Counterterrorism]];
* Training and education;
* Participation in NATO exercises;
* Promoting military interoperability;
* Disaster preparedness and civil emergency planning;
* Tailored advice on defense reform and civil-military relations; and
* Cooperation on border security to help prevent illicit trafficking of drugs, weapons, and people.

'''Kosovan–Dutch relations''' are foreign relations between [[Kosovo]]{{ref label|status|a|}} and the [[Netherlands]]. Kosovo [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared its independence]] from [[Serbia]] on 17 February 2008 and the Netherlands [[International reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|recognised]] it on 4 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.minbuza.nl/en/news/newsflashes,2008/03/The-Netherlands-recognises-Kosovo.html|title=The Netherlands recognises Kosovo|date=2008-03-04|accessdate=2008-03-05|publisher=Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands has an embassy in [[Pristina]] since 27 June 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minbuza.nl/en/news/newsflashes,2008/06/The-Netherlands-opens-embassy-in-Kosovo.html "The Netherlands opens embassy in Kosovo"] Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 27 June 2008 Link accessed 30/06/08&lt;/ref&gt; and Kosovo opened an embassy in [[The Hague]] in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ks-gov.net/MFA/?page=1,49|title=Misionet e Kosovës Jashtë|year=2009|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo|language=Albanian|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the two countries are considered to be good and the [[Netherlands]] offers it support to various projects in Kosovo with the goal of aiding the country in its transition to democracy.&lt;ref name="Government of Netherlands"&gt;{{cite web|title=Relations the Netherlands - Kosovo|url=http://www.government.nl/issues/international-relations/kosovo|website=Government of Netherlands|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
The Netherlands participated in the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], which resulted in a [[UNMIK|UN administration]] of Kosovo and then to eventual independence. The Netherlands currently has 7 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the [[NATO]] led [[Kosovo Force]]. Originally there were 3,600 Dutch troops in KFOR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/kfor/structur/nations/placemap/kfor_placemat.pdf "Kosovo Force (KFOR)"] www.nato.int Link accessed 21-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
Economic cooperation between [[Kosovo]] and the [[Netherlands]] is limited although there are several areas for cooperation between the two countries in the energy and agricultural sectors.&lt;ref name="Government of Netherlands"/&gt;

==Development==
Outside of the EU framework, the [[Netherlands]] uses the Matra Programme, of which Kosovo is a beneficiary, to organise projects in countries in Central and Eastern Europe to aide them in their transition to democracy and rule of law. In the case of [[Kosovo]], the [[Embassy of the Netherlands, Berlin|Dutch Embassy]] uses this programme to encourage cooperation between the Serbian and Albanian communities in the North of [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref name="Government of Netherlands"/&gt;

'''"Little by Little"''' was the [[Lithuania]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Laura &amp; The Lovers]].

The song, which was written by two of Sweden's most experienced songwriters Bobby Ljunggren and William Butt, is an up-tempo number, with Laura singing to a lover about how she feels now that the two of them are starting to connect in their relationship.

As Lithuania had not qualified for the final at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Contest]], the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed second (following [[Austria]]'s [[Global Kryner]] with "[[Y así]]" and preceding [[Portugal]]'s [[2B (duo)|2B]] with "[[Amar (song)|Amar]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 17 points, placing 25th (last) in a field of 25 - thus requiring Lithuania to qualify through the semi-final at their next Contest appearance. "Little by Little" remained the highest scoring entry to have finished last in a Eurovision Song Contest semi-final until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012 Contest]] when [[Slovakia|Slovak]] entry "[[Don't Close Your Eyes (Max Jason Mai song)|Don't Close Your Eyes]]" performed by [[Max Jason Mai]] finished last in field of 18 countries scoring with 22 points.

It was succeeded as [[Lithuania in the Eurovision Song Contest|Lithuanian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 contest]] by [[LT United]] with "[[We Are the Winners]]".

[[File:Hauptdolomit.jpg|thumb|Main dolomite of the Langbathscholle, Kaltenbachwildnis, Austria]]

'''Main Dolomite''' ({{lang-de|Hauptdolomit}}, {{lang-it|Dolomia Principale}}) is a [[Lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphic]] unit in the [[Alps]] of Europe.

==Geology==
The formation is found in:
* the [[Northern Limestone Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]] of the [[Limestone Alps]], a mountain system of the western and [[Central Eastern Alps]].
* the [[Apennines]] in [[Italy]]
* the [[Geology of Western Carpathians|Western Carpathians]]

It is primarily made of [[dolostone]] or [[dolomite]] rock, ranging from {{convert|0|to|2200|m|ft}} in thickness. The formation was deposited in shallow lagoons during the Late [[Carnian]] and Early [[Norian]] ages of the [[Late Triassic]] Epoch in the [[Triassic|Triassic Period]], during the [[Mesozoic Era]].

===Fossils===
Fossil [[prosauropod]] tracks have been reported from the formation.&lt;ref name="dinosaurdistribution"&gt;Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osmólska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 517-607 {{ISBN|0-520-24209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Three of its rulers have been identified with certainty, through attestation in their inscriptions as šàr (lugal) ma-al-gi-im&lt;sup&gt;ki&lt;/sup&gt;, Takil-ilissu, son of Ištaran-asû,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = The Inscription of Takil-ili-su of Malgium | author = Thorkild Jacobsen | journal = Archiv für Orientforschung | volume = 12 | year = 1939 | jstor = 41680358 | page = 364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imgur-Sin, son of Ili-abi, and, probably the last one, Ipiq-Ištar, son of Apil-Ilišu, a contemporary of [[Hammurabi|Ḫammu-rāpi]] of Babylon, who celebrated conflict with the city in two of his year names (10 and 35). A further three rulers have been proposed, Šu-Kakka, Nabi-Enlil and Šu-Amurrum, three generations of a dynasty, based upon Šu-Kakka’s year name honoring the goddess Damkina. Their absolute position is uncertain but they seem to have reigned from the immediate aftermath of the downfall of the [[Ur III]] empire.&lt;ref name=boer/&gt;{{rp|19}}

The kings of Larsa targeted Malgium in their pursuit of territorial expansion with [[Gungunum]] celebrating its conquest in his 19th year name, circa 1914 BC,&lt;ref name=boer/&gt;{{rp|22}} [[Sin-Iddinam]] its defeat in his 5th year name ca. 1844 and Warad-Sîn commemorated mu ugnim mà-al-gu-um&lt;sup&gt;ki&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;giš&lt;/sup&gt;tukul ba(-an)-sìg, “Year : the army&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt; of Malgium was smitten by weapons”, ca. 1831 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = New Evidence for Warad-Sîn’s Mu-Malgium-Basig ('The Destruction of Malgium') Year Name | author = Kathleen Abraham | journal = Revue d'Assyriologie et d'archéologie orientale | volume = 102 | year = 2008 | jstor = 23281366 | page = 29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ḫammu-rāpi, in a grand coalition with [[Shamshi-Adad I]] and [[ Ibal-pi-el II|Ibal-pi-El II]] (of [[Eshnunna]]), campaigned against the [[city-state]] until its ruler bought them off with 15 [[talents of silver]]. Freed from its vassalage to [[Elam]], by Ḫammu-rāpi’s triumph over them, Malgium’s king, Ipiq-Ištar, concluded a treaty and subsequently provided aid and soldiers in Ḫammu-rāpi’s campaign against [[Larsa]]. For as yet uncertain reasons, Ḫammu-rāpi turned on his erstwhile ally and sacked the city ca. 1758, deporting much of its populace to Babylonia. Its state in the Middle Babylonian Period and later periods was much more humble as an administrative district called Malgu and a settlement referred to as Maliki.&lt;ref name=bryce/&gt;

'''Mustafa Centre''' is one of [[Singapore]]'s [[24/7|24-hour]] [[shopping mall]]s on Syed Alwi Road in the cultural district of [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]], within the [[Planning Areas of Singapore|planning area]] of [[Kallang]].&lt;ref name="about_page"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mustafa.com.sg/frmAboutUs.aspx | title=About Mustafa | publisher=Mustafa Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a walking distance from [[Farrer Park MRT Station|Farrer Park]] station on the [[North East MRT Line|North East Line]], Mustafa Centre is a retail hub attracting many shoppers with its wide variety of products and services.

In 1971, Mustaq Ahmad; his father, Haji Mohamed Mustafa (1916-2001); and his uncle, Samsuddin, founded '''Mohamed Mustafa and Samsudin Co Pte Ltd''' ('''MMSC'''), and opened a retail store on Campbell Lane in Singapore.&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt;  It mainly sold ready-made clothing and later expanded to sale of electronic items. In 1985, Mustaq moved his business to the ground floor of Serangoon Plaza.

As his business expanded, Mustaq bought a shophouse on Syed Alwi Road. Subsequently, he bought the neighboring units and decided to build a new shopping mall to house his business.&lt;ref name="infopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_442_2005-02-03.html | title=Mohamed Mustafa and Samsudin Co Pte Ltd | publisher=Singapore Infopedia | date=February 3, 2005 | accessdate=November 13, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417041545/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_442_2005-02-03.html | archivedate=April 17, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The business expanded internationally, to [[Chennai]], in 2000.&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt;

Mustafa Centre sold parallel imported cars in 2005 but has since stopped.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Facilities==
Mustafa Centre houses the Mustafa department store, which caters mainly to the budget market. The department store consists of two shopping centres: one retailing [[jewelry]] and [[household appliance]]s and functioning as a [[supermarket]], and the other selling a variety of other products such as [[book]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[watch]]es, [[Consumer electronics|electronic goods]], [[footwear]], [[toys]] and [[clothing]].

Mustafa Centre sells more than 300,000 items and provides many services such as [[Bureau de change|foreign exchange]] and [[travel]] arrangements.&lt;ref name="about_page"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011, Mustafa Centre opened a new rooftop restaurant named ''Kebabs ‘n Curries'' in its new wing. &lt;ref name="kebabs_curries_article"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hungrygowhere.com/dining-guide/critics-reviews/mustafa-rooftop-restaurant-opens-*aid-31dc3e00/ | title=Mustafa rooftop restaurant opens | publisher=HungryGoWhere Singapore | date=October 13, 2011 | accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant serves a range of Asian dishes from 5 pm till 2 am daily. &lt;ref name="kebabs_curries_info"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/Kebabs_n_Curries/ | title=Kebabs &amp; Curries, Jalan Besar Reviews | publisher=HungryGoWhere Singapore | accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' People's Reconciliation Party''' ({{lang-fr|Parti de la Réconciliation des Personnes}}, PRP) is a minor [[political party]] in [[Burundi]].

==History==
The party was established in September 1991 and registered on 30 June 1992.&lt;ref name=TL&gt;Tom Lansford (2014) ''Political Handbook of the World 2014'', CQ Press, p215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-express.com/afrique/burundi/burundi-partis-politiques.html Les principaux partis politiques du Burundi] Afrique Express&lt;/ref&gt; It nominated Pierre-Claver Sendegeya as its candidate for the [[Burundian presidential election, 1993|1993 presidential elections]]. Sendegeya finished third with 1.5% of the vote.&lt;ref name=AED/&gt;

Led by Jean Bosco Yamuremye, it received 1.4% of the vote in the [[Burundian legislative election, 1993|1993 parliamentary elections]], failing to win a seat.&lt;ref name=AED&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/bi.html Elections in Burundi] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1994 its leader Mathias Hitimana was arrested as the government considered the party to have extremist leanings. The arrest led to riots that affected [[Bujumbura]] for three days.&lt;ref name=TL/&gt; In March 1995 the PRP was given a ministerial post, but the party pulled out of the government in December, and Hitimana was arrested again in January 1996.&lt;ref name=TL/&gt;

The party was given a ministerial post in the transitional government in November 2001, but left the government again in July 2002, before returning in 2003. In 2006 party president Déo Niyonzima was arrested for alleged involvement in a coup plot, but was acquitted in January 2007.&lt;ref name=TL/&gt;

==Ideology==
The party supports the restoration of the [[List of Kings of Burundi|monarchy]].&lt;ref name=EKE&gt;Ellen K Eggers (2006) ''Historical Dictionary of Burundi'', Scarecrow Press, p125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WLW-XM173.jpg|thumb|right|200px|700 [[WLW]] on XM's '''Pioneer Inno'''.]]
The '''Pioneer Inno''' is a second-generation [[XM2go]] radio receiver model for use with the [[XM]] satellite radio service.  The Inno improves upon the first generation units by having an improved built-in antenna for live portable reception, improved recording capabilities allowing unlimited sessions, and increased recording capacity.  The Inno has the ability to record individual songs from the XM service and has a capacity of 1 GB for storage.  This flash storage is factory configured as two separate blocks, for approximately 22 hours of XM content, and approximately 518 MB of MP3 or WMA music or audio tracks and can be configured for 100% XM content for a full estimated 50 hours.  These files are stored internally in their native AACplus audio format and cannot be exported from the unit digitally.

On May 16, 2006 the [[RIAA]] (Recording Industry Association of America) sued XM, stating that the device infringes on copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   XM defends the device by stating that the songs recorded from the XM service cannot be exported from the particular Inno device it was saved on, and the owner of the Inno must remain an XM subscriber to continue to access material recorded from XM.

On September 6, 2006, XM Radio announced a Pink Inno available exclusively at Circuit City where $30 from each unit sold goes to benefit the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation's fight against breast cancer.

The '''Polish-Czechoslovak confederation''', or '''federation''',{{ref_label|a|a|none}} was a political concept from the time of [[World War II]], supported by the [[Polish government-in-exile]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. It was a revitalisation of the [[Międzymorze]] concept, proposing the creation of a federation based on [[Poland]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. The project had less support in the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]], which believed it did not need Polish support against the [[Soviet Union]], and was eventually sunk by the growing Soviet dominance, as [[Joseph Stalin]] did not want a strong and independent federation in [[Europe]] that could threaten his designs for Eastern Europe.

==Background==
Soon after the Polish defeat in the [[Polish September Campaign]], both the Polish and Czechoslovak governments (Czechoslovakia having been reduced to a German [[puppet state]] following the [[Munich Agreement]]) formed in exile in the West.&lt;ref name="Levy2007-199"/&gt; However, despite a common enemy, [[Czechoslovakia–Poland relations]] were less than friendly because of [[Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts]].&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeslieLeslie1983-2"/&gt; The Polish government aimed to revitalize the [[Międzymorze]] federation concept and to create a strong federation of states in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], revolving around Poland and Czechoslovakia, as a barrier to further German and Soviet aggression.&lt;ref name="Prażmowska1995-67-68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2007-200"/&gt; The Czechoslovak government, initially split between two groups (those of [[Milan Hodža]] and Beneš), was tentatively supportive of the idea, at least publicly.&lt;ref name="Levy2007-200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaneStadtmüller2005"/&gt;

==Negotiations==
[[File:Edvard Beneš.jpg|thumb|rught|150px|Beneš, the leader of the Czechoslovak government in exile]]
[[File:Sikorski prime minister.jpg|thumb|rught|150px|Sikorski, the leader of the Polish government in exile]]
Czechoslovak politicians Hodža and [[Jan Masaryk]] both wanted a confederation,&lt;ref name="LaneStadtmüller2005"/&gt; Beneš was more lukewarm; his goal was to ensure that the disputed [[Zaolzie]] territory that had passed to Poland in the aftermath of the [[Munich Agreement]] was regained by Czechoslovakia,&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orzoff"/&gt; and that became one of the major issues of contention in the ongoing negotiations.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prażmowska1995-142"/&gt; Beneš, who saw regaining the territory as a primary objective, saw the Soviet Union, particularly in the aftermath of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], as a potential ally and as a counterbalance to Poland, and he would steadily align his government more with the Soviet Union than Poland in the belief that an alliance with a powerful country would be more beneficial to Czechoslovakia than a federation with several other smaller powers.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeslieLeslie1983-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaneStadtmüller2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orzoff"/&gt; That was quite contrary to the Polish attitude, as the Polish leader of that time, [[Władysław Sikorski]], saw the Soviet Union as a major threat to the postwar European order.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wandycz1980"/&gt;

Thus, when Sikorski approached Beneš and proposed discussions over a future Polish-Czechoslovak federation in 1939, aiming to create a stronger postwar Poland and Czechoslovakia, Beneš's response was lukewarm at best, as he was not interested in strengthening Poland. He was content to see Czechoslovakia re-established within its pre-1938 borders.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;

Nonetheless, Beneš did not refuse Sikorski's proposal outright, as the federation proposal was supported by the UK and later by the US, which also supported the plans for other federations such as the [[Greek-Yugoslav confederation]]. He was afraid that open refusal would lead to the Poles opening negotiations with the Czechoslovak opposition or to his government being marginalized by the British [[Foreign Office]].&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wandycz1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2007-201"/&gt; Beneš decided to continue the negotiations with the Poles over the possibility of federation but with little haste; in fact, many of the Czechoslovak government's moves were designed to prolong the negotiations without any real commitment.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt; The negotiations proceeded slowly, with numerous conferences, and with joint declarations on 11 November 1940 (a declaration by the two governments about entering "a closer political and economic association"), on 23 January 1942 (in which both governments agreed to form a confederation after the war and mentioned common policies on diplomacy, defense, trade, education and communication) and on 10 June 1942.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2007-201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kühnhardt2009"/&gt; January 1941 saw the establishment of the Czechoslovak-Polish Coordinating Committee to oversee the process of the negotiations.&lt;ref name="Prażmowska1995-142"/&gt;

Some early proposals focused on economic co-operation, unified foreign policy, a customs union and a common currency but separate government offices.&lt;ref name="Levy2007-200"/&gt; A Polish proposal from 1941 called for the co-ordination of foreign and economic policies, including total economic unification.&lt;ref name="Prażmowska1995-142"/&gt; Beneš tried to frame the potential federation as no more than a tool for mutual defense against Germany and argued that the Soviet Union was not a threat but a potential ally.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt; The Czechoslovak position was so pro-Soviet that the Beneš government passed secret documents from the Czech-Polish negotiations to the Soviets and assured them that they were acting in the best interests of [[Czechoslovakia-Soviet Union relations]].&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;

The Soviets saw the Polish-led federation of Central and Eastern European states as a threat to their planned [[sphere of influence]].&lt;ref name="Levy2007-201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipgens1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larres2002"/&gt; They put further pressure on the Czechoslovak government, with promises of alliance and territorial guarantees.&lt;ref name="Levy2007-201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipgens1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larres2002"/&gt; By late 1942 and early 1943, as the Soviet Union's position was boosted by its military victories, Czechoslovak-Soviet cooperation became much stronger; on 12 November 1942, the Czechoslovak side suspended talks with the Poles until permission from the Soviet Union had been obtained, and on 10 February 1943, the Czechoslovak diplomat [[Hubert Ripka]] informed the Polish government that no agreement that could be seen as antagonistic towards the Soviet Union would be supported by the Czechoslovak government.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeslieLeslie1983"/&gt; That was a major blow to the Polish-Czechoslovakian negotiations.

==Aftermath==
Soon afterward, Poland and the Soviet Union broke [[Polish-Soviet relations|diplomatic relations]] over the [[Katyń massacre]].&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larres2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2007-202"/&gt; Beneš, meanwhile, focused on pursuing a Czechoslovakia-Soviet alliance.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larres2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2007-202"/&gt; The death of Sikorski that year was another major blow to the planned federation, as he was seen as the plan's major supporter in the international scene.&lt;ref name="Lipgens1985"/&gt; In December 1943, a new Treaty of Alliance (for 20 years) was signed between the Czechoslovak government in exile and the Soviet Union in Moscow, and a Treaty of Military Co-operation between the two followed next spring.&lt;ref name="Levy2007-202"/&gt;

Beneš's support for the Soviet Union went so far that during his 1943 visit to the US, he argued that the Soviet Union would never be a threat to either Czechoslovakia or Poland.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt; Beneš probably saw the threat of identity loss for Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak people in such a federation as more likely than the threat of a conflict or takeover by the Soviet Union, which he perceived as a benevolent ally.&lt;ref name=zaolzie/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orzoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipgens1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2007-202"/&gt; In the end, the Polish federation plan came to naught; instead, the short-term victory with regard to the Central and Eastern European geopolitical scene went to Beneš, and in the long term, it went to his Soviet allies.&lt;ref name="Lipgens1985"/&gt;

Czechoslovakia would regain most of the disputed Zaolzie territory, but by 1948, both it and Poland would have only nominal independence, as they would fall to communist takeovers and become part of the Soviet sphere of influence. Beneš died in 1948, soon after the communists took power in the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]] and forced him to retire from politics.

==Notes==
'''a''' {{Note_label|a|a|none}} As the details of the planned union were never finalized, it is not clear whether it would have been a [[federation]] or a [[confederation]]. Sources use both the term "Polish-Czechoslovakian federation" and the term "Polish-Czechoslovakian confederation".

'''Qortin Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott tal-Qortin}}), also known as '''Eskalar Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott t'Eskalar}}), is a [[redoubt]] in the limits of [[Mellieħa]], [[Malta]]. It was built by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] in 1715–1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. Today, the redoubt still exists, but it has some modern modifications.

==History==
Qortin Redoubt was built in 1715–1716 as part of the first building programme of coastal fortifications in Malta. It was part of a chain of fortifications that defended the northern coast of Malta, which also included [[Aħrax Tower]], several batteries, redoubts and entrenchments. The nearest fortifications to Qortin Redoubt are [[Tal-Bir Redoubt]] to the west and [[Vendôme Battery]] to the east.

The redoubt originally consisted of a pentagonal platform with a low parapet. A rectangular blockhouse was located at the centre of its gorge. It was not armed with any artillery.

Construction of Qortin Redoubt cost around 1239.8.19 scudi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Debono|first1=Charles|title=Fortifications - Eskalar Redoubt|url=http://www.mellieha.com/places_interest/fortifications/eskalar_redoubt.htm|website=Mellieha.com|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
Today, the pentagonal platform still exists, but the parapet has been removed. The blockhouse has been demolished and a summer residence has been built in its place.

==Plot==
*[[Tagline]]: ''In fights without rules, there is no rule that says: "Until first blood!"''

Fifteen-year-old Mustafa ([[Olzhas Nusupbayev]]) &amp;mdash; nicknamed "Shiza" for his weird behaviour in school &amp;mdash; has no money, power or a girlfriend in his young life. Working for his mother’s boyfriend, Shiza scouts for fighters for the illegal, underground circuit of bare-knuckle fist-fighting.

However, his life changes forever when a young fighter is accidentally and mortally wounded in the ring. Before dying, the fighter asks Shiza to deliver his prize money to his wife Zinka ([[Olga Landina]]). Shiza takes the money to the now-widowed woman as promised. Upon meeting, Shiza falls in love with her. Suddenly, he finds direction as he is compelled to support and protect his new love no matter what the cost.
