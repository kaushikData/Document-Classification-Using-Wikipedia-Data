'''Proposition 227'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618094226/http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |archivedate=2010-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[California ballot proposition]] passed on the June 2, 1998, ballot. Proposition 227 was repealed by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)|Proposition 58]] on November 8, 2016.

According to [[Ballotpedia]], "Proposition 227 changed the way that "Limited English Proficient" (LEP) students are taught in [[California]]. Specifically, it
*Required [[California public schools]] to teach LEP students in special classes that are taught nearly all in English. This provision had the effect of eliminating "bilingual" classes in most cases.
*Shortened the time that most LEP students stayed in special classes.
*Eliminated most programs in the state that provided multi-year special classes to LEP students by requiring that (1) LEP students move from special classes to regular classes when they had acquired a good working knowledge of English and (2) these special classes not normally last longer than one year.
*Required the state government to provide $50 million every year for ten years for English classes for adults who promised to tutor LEP students.&lt;ref&gt;http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_227,_the_%22English_in_Public_Schools%22_Initiative_%281998%29#cite_note-city-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill's intention was to educate [[Limited English proficiency]] students in a rapid, one-year program. It was sponsored by [[Ron Unz]], the runner-up candidate in the 1994 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial primary. The proposition was controversial because of its close proximity to heated political issues including [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], and [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]]. The methods of education enacted by the proposition reflected the electorate's support of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] over [[multiculturalism]]. It passed with a margin of 61% to 39%.

On September 28, 2014, the state legislature passed, and Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed, Senate Bill 1174, which added [[California Proposition 58 (2016)|Proposition 58]] to the November 2016 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB1174 | title=Senate Bill No. 1174, Chapter 753 | work = [[California Legislature]] | accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 58, which repealed most of Proposition 227, passed by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ulloa |first=Jazmine |title=California will bring back bilingual education as Proposition 58 cruises to victory |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 8, 2016 |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-58-bilingual-1478220414-htmlstory.html |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The number of bilingual credentials fell after Proposition 227's passage. A [[California Department of Education]] spokesperson anticipated a shortage of bilingual teachers after the passage of Proposition 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Renee |first=Alexa |title=Prop 58: Higher demand for bilingual teachers not helping teacher shortage |work=ABC 10 |location=Sacramento |date=November 9, 2016 |url=http://www.abc10.com/news/local/california/prop-58-higher-demand-for-bilingual-teachers-not-helping-teacher-shortage/350584412 |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audio induction loop''' systems, also called '''audio-frequency induction loops''' ('''AFILs''') or '''hearing loops''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get in the Hearing Loop|url=http://www.audiology.org/resources/consumer/Pages/Get_in_theHearingLoop.aspx|work=American Academy of Audiology|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are an assistive listening technology for individuals with reduced ranges of hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Get in the Hearing Loop" Campaign Promotes Doubling Functionality of Hearing Aids|url=http://www.hearingloss.org/content/get-hearing-loop|work=Hearing Loss Association of America|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hearing loop consists of a physical loop of cable or an array of loops of cable which are placed around a designated area, usually a room or a building. The cable generates a magnetic field throughout the looped space which can be picked up by a [[Telecoil|hearing aid]], [[cochlear implant|cochlear implant (CI) processors]], and specialized hand-held hearing loop receivers for individuals without telecoil compatible hearing aids.

The loops carry [[baseband]] audio-frequency currents; no carrier signal is used. The benefit is that it allows the sound source of interest—whether a musical performance or a ticket taker's side of the conversation—to be transmitted to the hearing-impaired listener clearly and free of other distracting noise in the environment.&lt;ref name="ny times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tierney|first=John|title=A Hearing Aid That Cuts Out All the Clatter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/science/24loops.html?scp=1&amp;sq=hearing%20loop&amp;st=cse|accessdate=25 October 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical installation sites include concert halls, ticket kiosks, high-traffic public buildings (for [[Public address|PA]] announcements), auditoriums, places of worship, courtrooms, meeting rooms, and homes.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helping Those With Hearing Loss Get In The Loop|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128268480|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, as an aid for disability, their provision, where reasonably possible, is required by the [[Equality Act 2010]] and previously by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]],&lt;ref&gt;Action on Hearing (formerly RNID/Deafness Research UK)&lt;/ref&gt; and they are available in "the back seats of all London taxis, which have a little microphone embedded in the dashboard in front of the driver; at 18,000 post offices in the U.K.; at most churches and cathedrals", according to Prof. David G. Myers.&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;

In the United States, an alternative technology using FM transmission to "neck loop" receivers was more widely adopted due to economic advantages. In comparison, hearing loop systems require a greater initial investment by the facility operator, but offer greater convenience and avoid the social stigma and hygienic concerns entailed by the FM system's paraphernalia for those who have hearing aids.&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;

Another alternative system, used primarily in theatres, uses invisible infrared radiation; compatible headsets can pick up the modulated infrared energy to reproduce sound.

==History==
The pickup coil in a hearing aid is known as a '''telecoil''' (or T-coil) because its early form was to pick up a magnetic field from coils within a [[telephone]].  These were included as a part of the method of enabling a two-way conversation over a single pair of wires.  The telecoil enabled hearing aid user hears the phone conversation clearly without also picking up background noise.

From this, the natural development was to generate audio magnetic fields which the telecoil could receive.

==Induction loop theory==
The simple form of AFIL is a single wire around a room, driven from a power amplifier as a [[loudspeaker]] would be driven.  The coupling of magnetic fields is described mathematically by [[Faraday's law of induction]].  A summary of the theory necessary for AFILs is included in British Standard '''BS&amp;nbsp;7594''', which is a guide to the design and installation of induction loops.

==Practical induction loops==

The simple form of AFIL using a general purpose amplifier suffers from some disadvantages.  The loop driver amplifier requires some additional circuits to overcome these.  Using anything other than a correctly designed loop driver amplifier is not only unsatisfactory, but may result in a loop installation that can generate [[harmonics]] when driven into distortion, and these will cause [[radio interference]].  This must be prevented, both for sound quality and for legal reasons as it is illegal to cause such [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]] in these circumstances.  In Europe, the [[EMC Directive]] applies, and it is also illegal to supply or install unsuitable electronic and electrical equipment.&lt;ref&gt;The EMC Directive of the European Union, and regulations under "enabling legislation".&lt;/ref&gt;

A second factor is that many forms of [[hearing impairment]] mean that [[DB SPL|sound levels]] must be kept fairly constant.  An effective loop driver will have an [[automatic gain control|automatic level control]] providing a constant loop signal for a wide range of source levels.  Meeting this requirement is likely to meet the interference requirement at the same time.  To do this, the loop driver should give constant output for at least 30[[Decibel|dB]] input range.

A third problem is the inductance of the loop cable, and its effect upon the higher frequencies of sound.  To overcome this, many loop drivers operate as current mode amplifiers instead of voltage mode.  By setting the amplifier characteristic between voltage and current mode, the overall performance is optimised for good bandwidth with minimum distortion.  There are other options for reducing the effect of cable inductance, including reducing inductance with a multi-core cable where the conductors are connected in parallel.

Structural steel, and other metalwork in buildings can cause a problem by reducing the field strength unevenly across the loop area and causing frequency distortions. In most cases, a solution can be found using combinations of loops with phase shift between them, combined with frequency correction and increased signal strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampetronic.co/design_metal.asp |title=Induction loop systems in metal structures |publisher=Ampetronic.co |date=2012-03-24 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different ways to configure conductive loops to give different patterns of magnetic fields and solve different technical problems such as the presence of metal structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampetronic.co/layouts_overview.asp |title=Audio induction loop system layouts |publisher=Ampetronic.co |date=2012-03-24 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other equipment within the magnetic field===

Audio induction loops create fairly high magnetic field levels.  Other equipment must be designed and installed to work properly within this field.

The most common cause of problems is [[Ground loop (electricity)|earth loops]], where different pieces of equipment are connected together by signal wires, but powered from different power sockets in different parts of the room or building.  The combination of the mains earth and signal earth creates a receiving loop that produces an interference signal proportional to the area within the earth loop.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance notes in BS7594&lt;/ref&gt; Various steps are used to prevent interference on audio and video equipment. Powering signal sources and output devices from the same mains circuit to prevent formation of an earth loop; shielded cables or signal isolators may be used.

==Technical standards==
An objective of the field strength requirements of standards for AFILs is to make the perceived loudness of sound from the loop the same as from the microphone in the hearing aid.  This is the basis of the average field strength of 100mA/m used to generate today's performance standards around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Introductory notes in various specifications&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IEC&amp;nbsp;60118-4''' (formerly Britain's BS&amp;nbsp;6083 part 4, also known as EN&amp;nbsp;60118-4) is now the main specification for international use.&lt;ref&gt;Standard available from the International Electrotecnical Commission or IEC www.iec.ch&lt;/ref&gt;  This is based on the principle that the long term average of the field strength at a typical listening location must be 100mA/m, +- 3&amp;nbsp;dB. To determine this long term average requires a measurement over 60 seconds or more. The standard therefore sets a more pragmatic requirement for determining the short term peaks of the signal. Short term peaks need to be 12&amp;nbsp;dB (x4) higher than the long term average, based on the fact that peaks of speech are approximately 12&amp;nbsp;dB higher than the long term average level of speech. Therefore, an induction loop system or AFILS must be capable of delivering field strength peaks of 400mA/m +- 3&amp;nbsp;dB (280 to 560mA/m). Peaks must be measured using fast RMS measurement (125ms averaging time).

In addition the IEC&amp;nbsp;60118-4 standard sets limits on acceptable background noise, and requires that the system delivers frequency response of +- 3&amp;nbsp;dB from 100&amp;nbsp;Hz to 5&amp;nbsp;kHz relative to the field strength at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. All measurements must be made with a coil that picks up only the vertical component of the magnetic field, the component that is picked up by the telecoil of a hearing aid.

'''BS&amp;nbsp;7594''' (published by the [[British Standards Institution|BSI]] and widely used in Britain) is a non-mandatory guideline for the design and installation of induction loops.  It has a comprehensive guide to theory, as well as guidance for those considering the installation of AFILs in buildings for which they may be responsible.  It also contains some valuable guidance relating to other equipment within the loop area.  The calibration of field strength measuring devices is also included.

Until the mid-1970s, BRAC concentrated on community development through village development programmes that included agriculture, fisheries, [[cooperatives]], rural crafts, [[adult literacy]], health and family planning, vocational training for women and construction of community centres. A Research and Evaluation Division (RED) was set up to evaluate its activities and decide direction, and in 1977, BRAC began taking a more targeted approach by creating Village Organisations (VO) to assist the landless, small farmers, artisans, and vulnerable women. That same year BRAC set up a commercial printing press to help finance its activities. The handicraft retail chain called Aarong, was established the following year.&lt;ref name=Aarong&gt;[http://www.aarong.com/about-aarong/ "This ethical brand began in 1978"... "supports 65,000 artisans with fair terms" in about-aarong at aarong.com] Accessed 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, BRAC entered the health field by establishing a nationwide Oral Therapy Extension Programme (OTEP), a campaign to combat [[diarrhoea]], the leading cause of the high child mortality rate in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chowdhury |first1=A.

In 1986, BRAC started its Rural Development Programme that incorporated four major activities – institution building including functional education and training, credit operation, income and employment generation and support service programmes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} 

In 1991, the Women's Health Development program commenced. The following year BRAC established a Centre for Development Management (CDM) in [[Rajendrapuram|Rajendrapur]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} 

Its Social Development, Human Rights and Legal Services programme was launched in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} 

In 1998, BRAC's Dairy and Food project was commissioned.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} BRAC launched an Information Technology Institute the following year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} 

In 2001, BRAC established a university called [[BRAC University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.bracu.ac.bd/academia/ "BRAC University was established by BRAC in 2001" at bracu.ac.bd/academia/] Accessed 8 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic development===
Microfinance, introduced in 1974, is BRAC's oldest programme. It spans all districts of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="microfinance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brac.net/content/microfinance |title=Microfinance |website=BRAC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625011027/http://brac.net/content/microfinance |archive-date=25 June 2011 |access-date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barber |first=Ben |date=May 2002 |title=No Free Lunch |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-86396661.html |journal=World &amp; I |volume=17 |issue=5 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides collateral-free loans to mostly poor, landless, rural women, enabling them to generate income and improve their [[standards of living]].&lt;ref name="microfinance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barber" /&gt; BRAC's microcredit program has funded over $1.9 billion in loans in its first 40 years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} 95% of BRACs microloan customers are women.&lt;ref name="AR2014" /&gt; According to BRAC, the repayment rate is over 98%.&lt;ref name="Glance2012" /&gt;. BRAC started community empowerment programme back in 1988 all over the country.

BRAC founded its retail outlet, Aarong (Bengali for "village fair") in 1978 to market and distribute products made by indigenous peoples. Aarong services about 65,000 artisans, and sells gold and silver jewelry, hand loom, leather crafts, etc.&lt;ref name=Aarong/&gt;

===Education===
BRAC is one of the largest NGOs involved in primary education in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="Ardt2005" /&gt; As of the end of 2012, it had more than 22,700 non-formal primary schools with a combined enrolment of 670,000 children.&lt;ref name="Glance2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brac.net/sites/default/files/BRAC-at-a-glance-december-2012.pdf |title=BRAC at a Glance |date=December 2012 |website=BRAC |access-date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Secondary source needed|date=September 2016}} Its schools constitute three-quarters of all NGO non-formal primary schools in the country.&lt;ref name="Ardt2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rih.stanford.edu/rosenfield/resources/Primary%20Education%20in%20Bangladesh.pdf |title=Report on Primary Education in Bangladesh: Challenges and Successes |last1=Ardt |first1=Kalene |last2=Hastings |first2=Chas |last3=Hopkins |first3=Katie |last4=Knebel |first4=Robin |last5=Loh |first5=Jun |last6=Woods |first6=Rodney |date=2005 |website=Rethinking International Health |publisher= Stanford University School of Medicine |access-date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BRAC's education programme provides [[Education in Bangladesh#Non-formal primary education|non-formal primary education]] to those left out of the formal education system, especially poor, rural, or disadvantaged children, and drop-outs.&lt;ref name="AR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brac.net/sites/default/files/ar2014/BRAC-annual-report-14.pdf |title=BRAC Bangladesh Annual Report 2014 |website=BRAC |format=PDF |access-date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its schools are typically one room with one teacher and no more than 33 students. Core subjects include mathematics, social studies and English. The schools also offer extracurricular activities.&lt;ref name="Ardt2005" /&gt; They incentivise schooling by providing food, allowing flexible learning hours, and conferring scholarships contingent on academic performance.&lt;ref name="Dawson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sanisoft.tripod.com/bdeshedu/gender.html |title=Gender Differences |website=Education in Bangladesh, a Dawson College term paper |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824202000/http://sanisoft.tripod.com/bdeshedu/gender.html |archive-date=24 August 2011 |access-date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh has reduced the gap between male and female attendance in schools.&lt;ref name="Dawson" /&gt; The improvement in female enrollment, which has largely been at the primary level, is in part attributable to BRAC.&lt;ref name="Ardt2005" /&gt; Roughly 60% of the students in their schools are girls.&lt;ref name="AR2014" /&gt;

===Public health===
BRAC started providing public healthcare in 1972 with an initial focus on [[curative care]] through paramedics and a self-financing health insurance scheme. The programme went on to offer integrated health care services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Image:A community health worker conducting a survey in the Korail slum, Bangladesh (8630810827).jpg|right|thumb|A BRAC community health worker conducting a survey in the Korail slum, Bangladesh]]BRAC's 2007 impact assessment of its North West Microfinance Expansion Project testified to increased awareness of legal issues, including those of marriage and divorce, among women participants in BRAC programs.

===Disaster relief===
BRAC conducted one of the largest NGO responses to [[Cyclone Sidr]] which hit vast areas of the south-western coast in Bangladesh in mid-November 2007.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} BRAC distributed emergency relief materials, including food and clothing, to over 900,000 survivors, provided medical care to over 60,000 victims and secured safe supplies of drinking water. BRAC is now focusing on long-term rehabilitation, which will include agriculture support, infrastructure reconstruction and livelihood regeneration.&lt;ref name="AR2007"&gt;Annual Report, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Secondary source needed|date=September 2016}}

==Partnership with the Nike Foundation==
BRAC has a collaboration with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s Girl Effect campaign to launch a new program to reach out to teenagers in [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=28 May 2008 |title=Nike Foundation and Buffetts join to invest $100 million in girls |url=http://www.nikefoundation.org/files/The_Girl_Effect_News_Release.pdf |publisher=Nike Foundation |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004165309/http://www.nikefoundation.org/files/The_Girl_Effect_News_Release.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Secondary source needed|date=September 2016}}

CSEM-BMP was founded as the Brunel Environmental Management Programme (BEMP)&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hutchinson_1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DfE_1993" /&gt;  or the Environmental Management Centre (EMC) within the [[Brunel Management Programme]] (BMP) by [[Ken Knight (environmentalist)|Ken Knight]] and [[Ross King (environmentalist)|Ross King]].&lt;ref name="imperial_college_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="king_1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt; The EMC later became the Centre for Sustainable and Environmental Management (CSEM),&lt;ref name="imperial_college_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt; then the Centre for Sustainability and Environmental Management (CSEM)&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;  and is now known as CSEM-BMP.&lt;ref name="green_energy_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

Through the EMC, BMP offered the first and largest broad senior level environmental management programme in Europe.&lt;ref name="brady_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

By 1993 the BEMP had organised 39 short courses, with 380 attendees.&lt;ref name="charter_1993" /&gt;

The EMC established the first modular masters degree in Environmental Management in 1993 / 1994.&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

By the end of 1994 about 1000 managers had attended EMC courses.&lt;ref name="king_1993" /&gt;

From that time the focus of the EMC was on both identifying and disseminating the requisite management knowledge and theory so that directors and managers could lead their organizations towards economically advantageous environmental and social sustainability.&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

Work has been done by CSEM-BMP on management development provision for each business function (such as purchasing, operations, marketing, and logistics) rethinking the function from a sustainability perspective, so that each function can relieve overburdened environmental specialists.&lt;ref name="brady_2011" /&gt;

== Sustainability Leadership Programme ==

In 2010 CSEM-BMP offered the Sustainability Leadership Programme (SLP) of Integrated Sustainability Management for Business. The programme offered by CSEM-BMP is for developing leadership and management. The programme is designed against the curriculum for an MBA, is based on sustainability principles and designed to meet the needs of each business function, process and level. It is designed for the needs of senior functional managers, those wishing to move into these positions, and those that need to communicate to such people. Being modular individual courses can be taken or combined in any combination including as a Masters programme.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

Each module on the SLP comprise one week of study and an eight-week work-based assignment. Assignments on the SLP are generally to apply the material from the module and further reading to participant's own organisation in the form of a board level paper. Additional support is provided on the SLP in the form of tutorials and self organised learning groups.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

The SLP highlights that any environmental or sustainability initiative requires a sound business case. It examines current management understanding and what needs to be done differently or better to operate with environmental and social limits. Core modules on the SLP help participants 'sit behind a chair' at the boardroom table, providing the ability to talk to board members and act as change agents in their organisation.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

SLP contributors include 50+ associates. These associates are among the leaders in their respective fields.&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

== Commendations ==

Philip Sadler, CBE, former CEO of [[Ashridge Business School]], Patron of the Tomorrowís Company Project has stated: ìCSEMís Sustainability Management Programme has long roots and huge experience and may be the Executive MBA of the future.î&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

In 2009 a programme review panel commended CSEM on:
* "a leading-edge programme providing what organisations need ...;
* the programme's pioneering nature giving learners business currency and practical information transfer;
* the design principles of the programme, the focus of the course design and the appropriate module content meeting students' need in creative ways;
* the tailoring of assignments to students' needs and those of their organisations;
* the learning set approach and the support it provides to students;
* the calibre of the tutors and the exceptional range of practitioner input."&lt;ref name="rob_2010" /&gt;

'''Charles Kassler Jr''' (September 9, 1897, [[Denver]], Colorado–April 3, 1979, [[San Diego, California]]) was a [[Painting|painter]], [[printmaker]], and [[lithographer]].

==Early life==
He lost a hand during a high school [[chemistry]] [[experiment]]. He studied [[art]] and [[architecture]] at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Chicago Art Institute]].

==Career==
From 1925 to 1932 Kassler continued his studies while living at various times in [[New Mexico]], [[Europe]], and [[North Africa]]. While in [[France]], he apprenticed himself to a well-known [[fresco]] painter.  After moving to [[Los Angeles]] in 1933, he painted the two largest frescoes done under the [[Treasury Section of Fine Arts|WPA]]; ''The [[Bison]] Hunt'' for the [[Los Angeles Public Library|Central Library]] in Downtown Los Angeles  which was destroyed by [[weather]] damage and ''Pastoral California'', at Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton, in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. It was whitewashed in 1938, just four years after Kassler completed it, but was restored in 1997 after spending almost 60 years hidden from view. Kassler was also commissioned by the WPA to paint eight fresco lunette murals for the [[Beverly Hills, California]] post office funded by the [[Treasury Section of Fine Arts]]. The murals depict the history of the Pony Express, postal service, and the daily life of the common American family. The post office is now home to the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts. After creating murals for the WPA, Kassler taught at [[Chouinard Art Institute]] and later worked as a [[designer]] in the [[aerospace]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts|url=http://www.thewallis.org/building-history|website=www.thewallis.org/building|publisher=The Wallis Organization|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While 'dada' is used in everyday life by people to address grandfather or elder brother.&lt;/ref&gt; is a yogic monk of [[Ananda Marga]] since 1971 and a social activist in New York City, where he also teaches [[Raja Yoga|Astaunga yoga]] meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pmc-mag.com/2011/07/dada-pranakrsnananda|title=Interview with Dada Pranakrsnananda|publisher=PMc Magazine|date=July 2011|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While participating in the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests, he became one of the first to be arrested on [[Brooklyn Bridge]] on October 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/16/interview-yogic-monk-occupy-cif-video|title=Interview with a yogic monk arrested at Occupy Wall Street – video|publisher=

Pranakrsnanada was personally initiated by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] aka Shrii Shrii Anandamurti into the order of [[avadhuta]], a monk or nun of an order close to the tradition of [[Shaivism|Shaeva Tantra]].

==OWS movement==
Dada Pranakrsnananda has warned that the focus of the OWS protests could shift to the conflict between the movement and the police, when it should remain on the injustice of corporate greed and inequity of wealth in society.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

'''Donald W. "Don" Graham''' (1883–1976)&lt;ref&gt;http://clan-graham-society.org/files/donwgraham-disney.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Canadian-American]] [[fine artist]] and [[art instructor]]. An early graduate and later a professor at the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] (later merged into the [[California Institute of the Arts]]), Graham is best known as the head of the internal training and orientation classes at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|the Walt Disney Productions animation studio]] from 1932 to 1940.&lt;ref name="training"&gt;Barrier, Michael (1999).

Assisted by Disney's top animators, Graham helped to document and establish many of the principles that make up the foundation of the art of [[traditional animation]].&lt;ref name="training" /&gt; he posthumously received the [[Winsor McCay Award]] for lifetime achievement in the animation field from [[ASIFA-Hollywood]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annieawards.org/winsor-mccay-award |title=46th Annual Annie Awards |accessdate=2007-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712035848/http://annieawards.org/winsor-mccay-award |archivedate=2015-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Don Graham really knew what he was teaching, and he "showed" you how to do something&amp;nbsp;– he didn't just talk. He taught us things that were very important for animation. How to simplify our drawings&amp;nbsp;– how to cut out all the unnecessary hen scratching amateurs have a habit of using. He showed us how to make a drawing look solid. He taught us about tension points&amp;nbsp;– like a bent knee, and how the pant leg comes down from that knee and how important the wrinkles from it are to describe form. I learned a hell of a lot from him!|[[Art Babbitt]]|''Once Upon a Time&amp;nbsp;— Walt Disney: The Sources of inspiration for the Disney Studios''&lt;ref name=Girveau&gt;Bruno Girveau (editor), ''Once Upon a Time&amp;nbsp;— Walt Disney: The Sources of inspiration for the Disney Studios'' (Prestel, London, 2006) {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3770-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] 

[[Margaret McMillan]] and Fred Jowett were members of the School Board which introduced [[free school meal]]s in Bradford. This was actually illegal and the School Board could have been forced to end this service. McMillan and Jowett tried to persuade Parliament to introduce legislation which encouraged all education authorities to provide free school meals for children. McMillan argued that if the state insists on compulsory education, it must take responsibility for the proper nourishment of school children. A report published in 1889 indicated that over 50,000 pupils in [[London]] alone were attending school "in want of food".  Other social studies, such as [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s ''Life and Labour of the People of London, 1899-1903'' and [[Seebohm Rowntree]]'s ''Poverty: A Study of Town Life in York, 1901'', found that nearly a third of the population and cities studied were living in poverty.  The 1904 ''Report into Physical Deterioration'' followed the large rejection of men from service in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], as they were malnourished.

The Bill became law over the objection of the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ham|first1=Paul|title=1913: The Eve of War|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Endeavour Press Ltd.|location=1071|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''educational system of Myanmar''' (also known as '''Burma''') is operated by the government [[Ministry of Education (Myanmar)|Ministry of Education]]. Universities and professional institutes from upper Burma and lower Burma are run by two separate entities, the Departments of Higher Education (Lower Burma and Upper Burma), whose office headquarters are in [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] respectively. The education system is based on the [[United Kingdom]]'s system, due to nearly a century of British and [[Christianity|Christian]] presences in Burma.
"The
first Government high school was founded by the British colonial administration
in 1874. Two years later, this Government High School was upgraded and
became University College, Rangoon."[https://web.archive.org/web/20110608032539/http://www.anu.edu.au/unesco/Tin.pdf]
Nearly all schools are government-operated, but recently, there has been an increase in privately funded schools (which specialise in English). Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school, probably about 9 years old, while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level.

The literacy rate of Burma, according to the [[2014 Burma Census]] stands at 89.5% (males: 92.6%, females: 86.9%).&lt;ref name="mip"/&gt; The annual budget allocated to education by the government is low; only about 1.2% is spent per year on education. English is taught as a second language from [[kindergarten]].

Most of the early mission schools are since 1860 (such as [[De La Salle Brothers in Myanmar|La Salle schools]]) in [[Burma]] were nationalised on 1 April 1965 after the order restoration of general [[Ne Win]].

==History==
During British colonial rule, educational access for women improved tremendously. In the pre-colonial era, male education was emphasised in the traditional Buddhist monastic education system. The number of female students enrolled in school rose 61% (by 45,000 students) from 1911-1921, and another 82% (100,000 students) from 1921 to 1931 with expansion of the colonial and private education system, primarily in the form of all-girls schools.&lt;ref name="ike"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ikeya |first1=Chie |year=2008 |title=The Modern Burmese Woman and the Politics of Fashion in Colonial Burma |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=67 |pages=1277–1308 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2541936 |doi=10.1017/S0021911808001782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was mirrored by an increase in female employment. From 1921 to 1931, there was a 33% increase in employment of women in public administration, law, medicine (96% increase), education (64% increase), and journalism sectors.&lt;ref name="ike"/&gt;

When Burma gained independence in 1948, the government sought to create a literate and educated population, and Burma was believed to be on its way to become the first [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Tiger]] in the region. However, [[1962 Burmese coup d'etat|1962 coup d'etat]] isolated and impoverished Burma. All schools were nationalised and educational standards began to fall. Burmese replaced English as the [[medium of instruction]] at Burmese universities in 1965, with the passing of the New University Education Law a year earlier.&lt;ref name="myat"&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic development of Myanmar |last=Thein |first=Myat |year=2004 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |location= |isbn=978-981-230-211-3 |pages=115–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a rapid decline in English proficiency among the Burmese.&lt;ref name="myat"/&gt; English was reintroduced as a medium of instruction in 1982.&lt;ref name="myat"/&gt; In 1977, the 2 year regional college system was introduced by the Burmese government, as a way to disperse college students until they were about to graduate (the third and fourth years were spent at a traditional university), a system that was ended in 1981.&lt;ref name="myat"/&gt;

Due to the student protests of the [[8888 Uprising]], all universities were closed in Burma for 2 years. During the 1990s, the newly introduced structure perpetuated a weak education system as the government's response to the crises was to introduce one 6-month term for each academic year. The [[State Peace and Development Council|SPDC]] government arranged irregular commencement dates for universities and colleges, but, students were still participated in clashes with the government. Another series of student strikes in 1996 and 1998 resulted in a further 3 years of closure.

After the re-opening of universities and colleges in 1999, the government scattered universities in different regions. The relocation of certain universities were made under relative ministries. The new system reduced university degrees by one year, providing a bachelor's degree for just three-year course. However, improvements were rapidly made despite the early disturbances. In 2005, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially announced that Burmese education was reaching international standards and the government had fully accredited 156 universities and colleges in Myanmar.

Today, Myanmar lags far behind in terms of educational standards. Learn-by-rote education, poorly-trained teachers, bribery, as well as use of out-dated resources have been the trademarks of primary and secondary schools of Myanmar. Furthermore, students are obliged to follow onerous after-school tuition since learning at school is not considered enough. Students learn everything by heart, from answers of English grammar questions to essays. All questions asked in tests are given in advance. Exceptionally, some grade 5, grade 9 and grade 11 test answers are unseen unless the test papers are stolen. Many universities have been built and scattered throughout cities to prevent students participation in potential unrest.

Besides these actions, students attending these universities are not allowed to speak freely, to write freely or to publish freely.

==Uniform==
School uniforms are mandatory throughout public schools in Burma, from kindergarten until the 10th standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no267/MyanmarTimes14-267/t008.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519185017/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no267/MyanmarTimes14-267/t008.htm |archive-date=19 May 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; From kindergarten to the 4th standard, the compulsory uniform for boys is a white shirt and green pants, which can be short or long. Shoes and Burmese sandals may be worn. The uniform for girls is similar, consisting of a white blouse and a skirt or pants. From the 5th standard until matriculation, traditional Burmese attire is considered appropriate school uniform. The uniform for boys is a white shirt (with a [[Mandarin collar]] or uncollared) and a green sarong called a ''[[longyi|paso]]'', along with Burmese sandals. For girls, a traditional Burmese blouse (either the ''yinzi,'' with a front opening, or the ''yin hpon'', with a side opening) and a green sarong called a ''htamein'' are worn, along with Burmese sandals.

==Preschool and kindergarten==
Preschools are opened for children over 2 years of age and they are in extensive care or public systems. Kindergarten starts from the age of 5 (not younger than 4 Years and 8 months at the time of school's commencement date). Primary, Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary Schools in Burma are under the Department of Basic Education. The official commencement date for those schools is 1 June.

==Primary education==
Primary education is officially compulsory. It lasts five years, and to continue onto secondary school, students must pass a comprehensive examination on basic subjects.

==Secondary education==
{{main|High schools in Burma}}

Secondary schools are usually combined, containing both middle and high schools.Secondary Middle schools offer classes from Grade 6 to grade 9 whereas Secondary High school offers classes up to Grade 11. Children of rich and well-known families are often given easier access to the more prestigious secondary schools. There is much corruption in educational equality. But in both primary and secondary schools, the system is "no-failure education system". Only at the end of the high schools or at the entrance of the college/university, the system is changed.

High schools students choose one of 2 tracks upon entering high school: science or arts. All high school students take [[Myanmar language|Myanmar]], [[English language|English]], and [[mathematics]]. However, Science-specialised students also take 3 additional subjects: [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[biology]] as part of their coursework, while arts-specialised students take [[geography]], [[history]] and [[economics]]. These routes also determine what matriculation subject exams they are administered and what tertiary schools they can apply to.

At the end of Standard 10(Grade 11), students take the [[University Entrance Examination]], commonly referred to as the [[matriculation]] exam in English, administered by the [[Board of Examinations]] annually in mid-March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Announcement for submitting matriculation exam applications |newspaper=The New Light of Myanmar |date=14 September 2007 |url=http://myanmargeneva.org/NLM2007/eng/9Sep/n070914.pdf |accessdate=3 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428013548/http://myanmargeneva.org/NLM2007/eng/9Sep/n070914.pdf |archive-date=28 April 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High marks in a subject garner a distinction known as ''gondu'' ({{my|ဂုဏ်ထူး}}). Students who achieve distinctions in five or more subjects (or a combined total of approximately 500/600) are generally guaranteed placement in one of Myanmar's medical universities, the most selective of universities. Test score results are released at testing sites throughout the country in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parents feel the stress of matriculation |newspaper=Myanmar Times |author=Min Zaw |date=17 March 2008 |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no410/n003.htm |accessdate=3 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430045116/http://www.mmtimes.com/no410/n003.htm |archive-date=30 April 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, [[Mon State]] has had the highest matriculation pass rates in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myanmar.com/newspaper/nlm/Aug02_06.html|title=Outstanding students given seats of honour in Mon State|date=2 August 2011|work=New Light of Myanmar|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who attend international English-language schools or other private schools are not eligible to sit for the matriculation exam, nor are they allowed to enroll in Burmese universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burma Considers Private Education |newspaper=The Irrawaddy |date=18 November 2009 |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17243&amp;page=2 |accessdate=3 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005133356/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17243&amp;page=2 |archive-date=5 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they typically study overseas, at destinations such as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. In 2010, 695 Burmese international students studied in the United States, particularly in private [[liberal arts college]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2011-07-25-burma-us-liberal-arts-colleges_n.htm|title=Liberal arts colleges attract Burmese students|last=Quizon|first=Derek|date=25 July 2011|work=USA Today|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myanmar secondary education has numerous problems.It completely emphasizes upon rote learning and memorization and regurgitation inhibiting students' creative thinking and critical thinking skills.Teachers themselves learn under the authoritative systems so they are usually resistive to current changes in teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://frontiermyanmar.net/en/features/learning-to-think|title=Learning to think|last=Downing|first=Jared|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elmfield Rudolf Steiner School Limited''' is an independent school situated in [[Stourbridge]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England. It educates around 260 children aged from 3 to 17 who follow the international Steiner [[Waldorf Education]] curriculum.&lt;ref name=ofsted1&gt;[http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/pdf/?inspectionNumber=294436&amp;providerCategoryID=16384&amp;fileName=\\school\\103\\s163_103876_20061021.pdf "Elmfield Rudolf Steiner School"], [[Office for Standards in Education|Ofsted]], 4 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school was established in 1934 and moved to its present site in 1946, using as a base two Victorian houses, Thornhill and Parkhill. New buildings were added in 1979 (the school hall) and 1995 (the Tobias and Gawain buildings). These provided additional classrooms, a science laboratory, a dance and music hall and facilities for information technology.&lt;ref name=ofsted1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmfield.com/ "Welcome to Elmfield!"], Elmfield Rudolf Steiner School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
In October 2006 Ofsted reported that the school provided a satisfactory standard of education. The moral, social and cultural development of the pupils was particularly good.&lt;ref name=ofsted1/&gt; In 2006 75% of [[student]]s obtained 5 or more A*-C [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/main.jhtml?xml=/education/leaguetables/secondary2007/resultse.xml "Secondary School and College Achievement and Attainment Tables 2007"], [[The Daily Telegraph]], 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

French and German are taught from age six. Regular class exchanges are held with other European Steiner Waldorf schools. Every year the pupils of class nine go on exchange to the [[Schloss Hamborn Steiner School]], Germany to stay with the class nine there. They take a full part in school life, as well as working on the school's farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisthemidlands.co.uk/midlands/features/MIDLANDS_FEATURES_INDEDB23.html "The spirit of the European Union"], This is the Midlands, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable teachers==
[[Eileen Hutchins]], teacher, author and founder of Elmfield School.

[[Walter Braithwaite (composer)|Walter Braithwaite]] (1906-1991) was a music teacher, piano teacher and pianist at the school. He wrote several songs for school plays and festivals, two of which (''Ut queant laxis'' and ''The Spring by the Wayside'' or ''Bare is the Rock'') are still regularly sung at Elmfield.

'''Emil Abderhalden''' (March 9, 1877 – August 5, 1950) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[biochemistry|biochemist]] and [[physiology|physiologist]]. His main findings, though disputed already in the 1920s, were not finally rejected until the late 1990s. Whether his misleading findings were based on fraud or simply the result of a lack of scientific rigor remains unclear. [[Abderhalden's drying pistol]], used in chemistry, was first described by one of his students in a textbook Abderhalden edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] | work = Chemistry World | date =February 2009 | title = Classic Kit: Abderhalden's drying pistol | author = Andrea Sella | url = http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2009/February/AbderhaldensDryingPistol.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Emil Abderhalden was born in [[Oberuzwil]] in the [[Canton of St. Gallen]] in [[Switzerland]].

Abderhalden studied medicine at the [[University of Basel]] and received his doctorate in 1902. He then studied in the laboratory of [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] and worked at the [[University of Berlin]]. In 1911 he moved to the [[University of Halle]] and taught physiology in the medical school.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; From 1931 to 1950, he was president of the [[German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina]]. In 1936 he was appointed member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/academicians/deceased/abderhalden.html | title=Emil Abderhalden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], he established a children's hospital and organized the removal of malnourished children to Switzerland. Subsequently, he resumed his research into physiological chemistry and began to study metabolism and food chemistry.

After [[World War II]] Abderhalden returned to Switzerland and got a position at the [[University of Zurich]]. He died there at age 73. The minor planet [[15262&amp;nbsp;Abderhalden]] was named in his honour.&lt;ref name="asteroid-Abderhalden" /&gt;

== Scientific work and controversy ==
Abderhalden is known for a [[Abderhalden reaction|blood test for pregnancy]], a test for [[cystine]] in urine, and for explaining the [[Abderhalden–Kaufmann–Lignac syndrome]], a recessive genetic condition.  He did extensive work in the analysis of proteins, polypeptides, and enzymes. His ''Abwehrfermente'' ("defensive enzymes") theory stated that immunological challenge will induce production of [[proteases]]. This was seemingly "proven" by many collaborators in Europe, although attempts to verify the theory abroad failed.

The pregnancy test was determined to be unreliable a few years after its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Slyke, Donald D. |author2=Vinograd-Villchur, Mariam |author3=Losee, J.R. | year = 1915 | title = The Abderhalden Reaction | journal = [[Journal of Biological Chemistry]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 377–406 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/23/1/377.pdf}} (experimental evidence of the unreliability of the Abderhalden pregnancy test)&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1912 Abderhalden's "defensive ferments reaction test" was applied to the differential diagnosis of [[dementia praecox]] from other mental diseases and from normals by Stuttgart psychiatrist August Fauser (1856–1938), and his miraculous claims of success were soon replicated by researchers in Germany and particularly in the United States. However, despite the worldwide publicity this "blood test for madness" generated, within a few years the "Abderhalden–Fauser reaction" was discredited and only a handful of American psychiatric researchers continued to believe in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Noll, R. | year = 2006 | title = The blood of the insane | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 17 | pages = 395–418 | doi =  10.1177/0957154X06059440 | pmid = 17333671 | issue = 68 Pt 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly by 1920 the test was all but forgotten in the USA. Abderhalden's reputation continued to grow in Germany, however, where collaborators managed to "replicate" his results, usually by simply repeating experiments until they succeeded and discarding the negative results. As Abderhalden was seen as the founder of scientific biochemistry in Germany, questioning his work could harm one's career, as [[Leonor Michaelis]] discovered in the mid-1910s; by 1922, Michaelis' reputation was so tarnished that he had to leave the country to embark on an outstanding career of scientific success abroad. [[Otto Westphal]] later called Abderhalden's ''Abwehrfermente'' work "a fraud from beginning to end".{{cite quote|date=August 2018}}

Abderhalden's work was strongly ideologically slanted: his theory was put to use for human experiments by [[Otmar von Verschuer]] and [[Josef Mengele]] to develop a blood test for separating "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" from "non-Aryan" individuals. While Abderhalden himself did not take part in this work, evidence suggests that he was instrumental in ideologically streamlining the German Academy of Natural Scientists ''[[German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina|Leopoldina]]'' by having the Jewish members purged&lt;ref name=Deichmann /&gt;  and replaced by [[Nazism|Nazi]] sycophants. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In another research project of the KWI-A Berlin Mengele worked officially in his role as camp doctor at Auschwitz. Biochemist Emil Abderhalden had turned in 1940 to Verschuer, because he needed the blood of twins to check the "Abderhalden reaction named after him" on identical twins. Abderhalden asserted here, that certain reactions of the immune system are stimulated by the production of each specific proteases. Due to the detection of such enzymes in the blood - Abderhalden called it "Defensive enzymes" - the detection of diseases such as mental illness or cancer through blood tests should be possible. Abderhalden also believed that racial characteristics were included in the proteins of the tissue and blood. These suggestions were taken up by Verschuer and developed into a research project on the inheritance of "specific white type bodies", from which he obviously hoped to, to be able to develop a blood test for the determination of human race. In an interim report of the KWI-A at the German Research Foundation, which funded the project, [[Verschuer]] explained that his assistant was posted as a camp doctor in Auschwitz, Dr Mengele, who was entered as an employee in this branch. "With the permission of the Reichsführer-SS be conducted anthropological studies of the various racial groups in this concentration camp and sent the blood samples to my laboratory for processing." Also, the biochemist [[Günther Hillmann]] was included in the project, was established as a specialist for protein research by the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biochemistry under [[Adolf Butenandt]]. Verschuer spoke in this context of 200 studied blood samples from family members of different "races" which substrates are made of.&lt;!--trans. from German: de.wikipedia.org, Joseph Mengele--&gt;

Despite of his theories being rejected as early as the mid-1910s, Abderhalden still loomed large as a kind of "father figure" in parts of the German scientific community and only by Deichmann and Müller-Hill's scathing 1998 review,&lt;ref name="Deichmann"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deichmann, U. |author2=Müller-Hill, B. | doi = 10.1038/30090 | title = The fraud of Abderhalden's enzymes | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | pmid = 9603512 | volume = 393 | issue = 6681 | pages = 109–111 | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; the entire extent of the rejection was revealed. However, in Abderhalden's days, the science of [[immunology]] was all but non-existent. That his experiments indeed seemed to "work" on occasion was probably due to [[immunoprecipitation]]. The crucial difference between this and Abderhalden's theory is that the former is an effect of [[antibodies]], whereas the fictitious ''Abwehrfermente'' were presumed to be [[proteases]]; a difference that has large implications for biochemistry and immunology.

The most comprehensive analysis of the issue as to whether Abderhalden was simply grossly mistaken or perpetuated deliberate fraud can be found in Kaasch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kaasch, M. | year = 2000 | title =  Sensation, Irrtum, Betrug? – Emil Abderhalden und die Geschichte der Abwehrfermente | journal = Acta Historica Leopoldina | volume = 36 | pages = 145–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernest Leroy Wilkinson''' (May 4, 1899 – April 6, 1978) was an [[United States|American]] academic administrator, lawyer, and prominent figure in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).  He was [[List of presidents of Brigham Young University|president]] of [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) from 1951 to 1971, simultaneously overseeing the entire LDS [[Church Educational System]]. He is credited with the expansion of Brigham Young University. Under his presidency, the student body increased six times to over twenty-five thousand students due to the physical growth of the university and his aggressive recruiting policies. The number of colleges at the university increased from five to thirteen and the number of faculty members increased four-fold. Wilkinson focused on recruiting more faculty and convincing current faculty to receive education outside the university. As a result, the number of teachers with doctorate degrees increased from 50 to 500. Associate and doctoral programs were created for Brigham Young University.

The J. Reuben Clark library (now the [[Harold B. Lee Library]]) was built and library resources were expanded by 500 percent. The number of buildings on Brigham Young University campus increased from 6 to over 300 buildings, representing an increase in floor space of about 4.2 million square feet. He initiated the construction of various student housing options to accommodate over 6,000 students. Additionally, he increased the number of student religious congregations. During his twenty-year presidency, the number of congregations increased from 1 student branch to 98 [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]] and 10 [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]] for LDS students. Under Wilkinson's presidency, the Brigham Young University Honor Code was more clearly established and was designed to include a strict dress code.

Wilkinson was a strongly conservative Republican. He unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1964, while he was president of Brigham Young University. Prior to his career in education, Wilkinson was a lawyer in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[New York City]], his most well-known and lucrative case being a $32 million settlement from the U.S. government for the Ute Indian Tribes.

== Background and education ==
Ernest Leroy Wilkinson was born in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], [[Utah]] on May 4, 1899. He was one of seven children of Robert Brown Wilkinson and Annie Cecilia Anderson. Robert Brown Wilkinson was a Scottish immigrant who arrived in the United States as a young boy. He married Annie Cecilia Anderson. Robert Wilkinson worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad for 25 years.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen||1975|p=506}} Robert Wilkinson supported the union and according to family, at one time ran for mayor of Ogden as a Socialist candidate. During Ernest Wilkinson's childhood, he associated mostly with older boys and men, as there were few boys his age. He became involved in cock fighting, buying a few cocks with the money he made from delivering ''Desert News'', but stopped cock fighting after police started persecuting offenders.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=507-508}}

In order to cultivate his Mormon faith, his mother suggested he attend Weber Academy, which was at the time owned by the LDS church. Before his graduation, he won the Dr. Edward S. Rich oratorical contest with his speech entitled, "American Ideals". He graduated from [[Weber Academy]] in Ogden in 1917.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=509-510}} He continued studies at the expanded Weber Academy, Weber College. During his time at Weber he organized the Public Service Bureau (a service organization), was editor of the yearbook, and was president of the student body for two years. He competed in forensics meets and won the state championship with his team. He received the Lewis Efficacy Medal for students excelling in scholarship and public service and was valedictorian of his class. After a year at Weber College, Wilkinson became a member of the [[Student Army Training Corps]] unit located at BYU.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=510}}  Wilkinson attributed his success to what he learned at Weber Academy and became interested in the idea of offering a religiously affiliated education to more LDS youth.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=508}} After the war, he became a regular student at BYU and among other things served as the editor of the weekly newspaper ''White and Blue'' and was president of his senior class. Wilkinson and a few colleagues received special recognition when they beat the [[Princeton University|Princeton]] debate team.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=511}} He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor of arts]] degree at BYU in 1921.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=513}}

He married Alice Valera Ludlow, a native of [[Spanish Fork, Utah|Spanish Fork]] whom he had met while they were both students at BYU. They were married in the [[Salt Lake Temple]] on August 16, 1923. The ceremony was performed by [[James E. Talmage]]. Alice was elected vice president of the student body with Wilkinson as her campaign manager and had studied drama at BYU. Ernest and Alice had five children together.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=515}}

==Career==
After graduation, Wilkinson began teaching English and speech at [[Weber State University|Weber College]]. During this time, Wilkinson began to take an active interest in politics. He ran as a Democrat for county auditor and lost.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=515}}

===Law School===
In 1923, Wilkinson was involved with the campaign of [[William H. King]] for [[United States Senate]]. King invited Wilkinson to be his secretary (administrative assistant) in Washington D.C. He agreed so that he could take evening classes at [[George Washington University]].{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=516}} When he arrived in Washington D.C., he was informed by King's current secretary that he was to arrange for another position for him. He was offered the position of assistant architect of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]]. Uninterested in architecture, Wilkinson found a job as a teacher of a business high school teaching shorthand and typing, still able to attend law school at night. He earned a law degree from George Washington University [[Latin honors|summa cum laude]] in 1926.{{sfn|Bergera|1996|p=137}} He was admitted to the Washington D.C., Utah, and New York bar associations.{{sfn|Bergera|1996|p=137}} He studied at [[Harvard Law School]] on scholarship for his graduate studies. Even though five years of teaching were prerequisite for entering in the doctoral program, he was granted exception from Dean Roscoe Pound of the law school due to his academics at George Washington University. In 1927, Wilkinson graduated from Harvard Law School with a [[Doctor of Juridical Science]].{{sfn|Bergera|1996|p=137}}

=== Teaching law ===
He initially accepted a position teaching law at the [[University of California]], but quickly resigned in order to pursue another offer to teach at the more prestigious [[New Jersey Law School]], the largest law school in the United States at the time, where he taught from 1927 to 1933. After aiding Hughes, Schurman, and Dwight law firm with a challenging tax problem, he was invited to join their law firm in New York City. He began practicing there as well as teaching at New Jersey Law School, where he was known as notoriously difficult professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=518}}; {{harvnb|Bergera|1996|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practicing law===
After working for future [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]],{{sfn|Hughes}} and working with Moyle &amp; Wilkinson in Washington D.C., Wilkinson opened up a private firm in 1940 where he practiced for eleven years.{{sfn|Bergera|1996|p=137}} One case involved a young, American soldier in Japan who was sentenced to death for accidentally killing a child in a motorcycle accident. He succeeded in lowering the sentence to only the time in jail that the man had already served. Even though he received no compensation for the case, he considered it the most gratifying case he ever worked on.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=520}} He served as attorney for the [[Ute Indian Tribes]] in their suit to be compensated for land never paid for by the U.S. government as part of the Treaty of 1880. In 1950, this suit was upheld by the [[United States Court of Claims]] and as a result, the Ute tribes were awarded $32 million.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=522}} Due to Wilkinson's work, the [[Indian Claims Commission Act|Indian Claims Commission]] was signed in 1946 by [[Harry S. Truman]]. This opened up more claims to be filed and prosecuted by Wilkinson, making his firm the most active in the country for tribal cases. Wilkinson's share of the Ute Indian settlement as the plaintiff's attorney made him independently wealthy, and allowed him to give up his law practice to pursue his interests in education.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=523}} When he became the 7th president of BYU, Wilkinson created a new law firm: Wilkinson, Cragun, and Barker. He was the senior partner, but management was left to his brother Glen Wilkinson, Cragun, and Barker.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=524}}

===Political===
Wilkinson was heavily interested in politics. Influenced by his socialist father from a young age, his viewpoints shifted to conservatism in his adult years. During the [[Cold War]], LDS Church leaders were particularly fearful of the influence of [[Communism]] in the United States. This was manifest in their choice of strictly conservative Wilkinson as the next BYU president. LDS Church leader [[Stephen L. Richards]] hoped in Wilkinson's inauguration that Wilkinson would, "implant in youth a deep love of country and a reverential regard for the Constitution of the United States."{{sfn|Bergera|1993|p=91}} Wilkinson made it clear that he supported the Republican party and disliked Communism. Some students at BYU criticized his "unabashed partisanship".{{sfn|Bergera|1993|p=94}} Despite his interest in politics during the beginning of his presidency at BYU, he did not seriously consider running for the U.S. Senate. Though his law career had taught him how to navigate federal bureaucracy, he did not feel that he had the skills to win a congressional race. In addition, he was more concerned, at the time, in the work he could accomplish in Utah as BYU president rather than in Washington.{{sfn|Bergera|1993|p=90}} Several times during the 1950s and 1960s, Wilkinson approached church president [[David O. McKay]] for his permission to run for public office. He was advised not to run until 1964 when he was given a one-year leave of absence to run for the senate.{{sfn|Bergera|1993|p=106}} In his absence, duties of the president and chancellor were taken up by [[Earl C. Crockett]] and [[Harvey L. Taylor]] respectively.{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=31}} In 1964, Wilkinson won the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination for the [[United States Senate]], defeating [[Sherman P. Lloyd]]. Wilkinson lost in the [[general election]] to incumbent Senator [[Frank Moss (politician)|Frank Moss]]. Within a month after his defeat, Wilkinson returned to BYU, but members of the Board of Trustees maintained that Harvey Taylor remain chancellor.{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=31}} As consolation, Wilkinson was granted a $20,000 salary, the largest salary of any BYU employee at the time.{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=32}}

==Presidency==
===The First Era: 1951&amp;ndash;1957===
==== Beginnings ====
After [[Howard S. McDonald]] resigned from his position as BYU President, Christian Jensen served as interim president for about ten months.{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=22}} In 1949, at a dinner for Jensen, Ernest L. Wilkinson gave a speech asserting the ways in which he believed Brigham Young University could excel. He expressed that he had high aspirations for the school and believed in the values of combining a spiritual and secular education. After the dinner, Wilkinson was invited to share his ideas with the First Presidency and the Board of Trustees.{{sfn|Wilkinson|Skousen|1976|pp=370-371}} The favorite candidate of [[J. Reuben Clark]] to fill the vacancy of BYU president was the vocally conservative Ernest Wilkinson who lobbied LDS Church leaders to be appointed as president of BYU and was offered the position in July 1950.{{sfn|Bergera|1993|p=90}} Wilkinson refused to be paid a salary, which attracted church officials in the aftermath of tense financial negotiations with previous president [[Howard S. McDonald]].{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=22}} In September 1950, Wilkinson changed the members of the board of trustees from local members to the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] with the President of the Church and his counselors serving as president and vice presidents, respectively, of the board.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=552}} Wilkinson wanted a direct line of communication to the David O. McKay, the president of the church at the time. Wilkinson would frequently counsel directly with President McKay, avoiding the Board of Trustees.{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=25}} From 1951 to the end of 1952, Wilkinson had no official assistants besides [[William F. Edwards]], the dean of the College of Commerce and [[William E. Berrett]], a professor of religion.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=559-562}} At the end of 1952, Harvey L. Taylor became Wilkinson's first administrative assistant.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=562}} Wilkinson was considered by most of his subordinates difficult to work with, citing him as dictatorial and inconsiderate. At 5'5", his nicknames among colleagues were "Little General" or "Little Napoleon".{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=24}} Aware of his difficulty getting along with his employees, he claimed he "[didn't] have time to be polite".{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=24}}

==== Unification and the Church Educational System ====
In 1953, in an attempt to unify Church schools, Wilkinson was named administrator of Church schools. Besides his duties at Brigham Young University, he oversaw the administrative duties of Ricks College (now [[Brigham Young University-Idaho]]), [[LDS Business College]], the [[Alfred McCune Home|McCune School of Music]], and [[Academia Juárez|Juarez Academy]] in Mexico, along with seventeen institutes and 193 seminaries.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=572}} Wilkinson proposed that the name Church Educational System be changed to University of Deseret, but his proposal was rejected for multiple reasons, one of them being that people were unwilling to drop the name of Brigham Young from their school.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=573-574}} After this expansion of the Church Educational System and thus Wilkinson's duties, he appointed Edwards and Barrett as vice presidents of the LDS Department of Education.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=576}} In 1953, the Church Educational System considered reacquiring [[Weber State University|Weber College]], [[Snow College]], and [[Dixie State University|Dixie College]] in order to increase the expanse of the Church Educational System.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=577-580}} A referendum was included on the November 1954 ballot to transfer these three junior colleges from the State of Utah back to the LDS Church Educational System. The controversial referendum was defeated in the election with less than 40% of voters in favor.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=581}} Still interested in pursuing junior colleges, the Church Educational System established the Church College of Hawaii (now [[Brigham Young University-Hawaii]]) in 1955 in [[Laie, Hawaii]].{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=585}} Shorty thereafter, the Church College of Hawaii and other Pacific LDS institutions were removed from the Church Educational System, considered to be closer to "missionary operations" and the presidents of the institution were subject to the local school systems rather than the large Church Educational System.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=585-586}}[[File:BYU hallway wilk.JPG|thumb|left|A hallway in the Wilkinson Center at BYU, named after President Ernest L. Wilkinson.]]

==== Enrollment and the establishment of colleges ====
The next concern for Wilkinson was increasing the enrollment of Brigham Young University. He instituted a program in which members of BYU faculty would travel with general authorities to stake conferences. They attended nearly 180 conferences, emphasizing the benefits of a BYU education. Enrollment increased by more than twenty-five percent in fall of 1952.{{sfn|Bergera|1997|p=107}} After discontinuing the program in 1952, Wilkinson continued to recruit for BYU by sending representatives to high schools and church missions, which received some criticism from mission presidents and was terminated by the First Presidency shortly after.{{sfn|Bergera|1997|pp=108-109}} Despite the criticisms, Wilkinson's tactics were successful and enrollment increased to over 10,000 by the 1956-57 school year.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=610}} Colleges were reorganized in order to group similar studies together and allow for the most growth and success of students. For example, the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Applied Sciences were broken into multiple colleges in 1954 including, but not limited to, the College of Biological and Agricultural Sciences and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=621-622}} The Department of Physical Education, Health, and Athletics was separated from the College of Education and established as its own college and the College of Education was forced to relinquish its monopoly on the training of teachers and made to be a college specific to teaching methods.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=642}} Wilkinson improved the salaries of faculty in order to recruit more talented professors and staff members to BYU.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=628-630}} The Army and Air Force [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] program at BYU was established by Wilkinson in 1951 for the Air Force and 1968 for the Army.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=630}} An engineering program with its own building was established by President Wilkinson with the help of [[Harvey Fletcher]], and in 1956, broke into three programs: civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=638-639}} Wilkinson also established a College of Family Living in late 1951, alleged to be the first in the United States, however, [[Purdue University]] had opened a Department of Family Life in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=644}}; {{harv|Purdue University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to increase the size and quality of the graduate program at BYU, Wilkinson instituted a policy that encouraged faculty to pursue graduate studies at other universities. Through the policy, the university could obtain faculty qualified to teach graduate students as well as faculty who have attended other universities and thus obtained a more well-balanced education, preventing the "academic inbreeding" that had been a problem at the institution.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=652-654}} The number of professors that held doctorates, especially from other universities, increased significantly.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=652-654}}

====Building construction====
Ernest L. Wilkinson sought to increase the size and the beauty of Brigham Young University campus. The first construction project during the presidency of Wilkinson commenced July 1952. The Student Service Center, or unofficially, the bookstore, was dedicated in March 1953.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=673}} After the planning committee devised a "master plan" for building and expansion of BYU campus, and the Church appropriated $500,000 for the acquisition of more land in pursuit of the building projects proposed in the master plan.{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=29}} Wilkinson received ten million dollars from the Board of Trustees in order to build student housing and academic buildings.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=676-681}} In order to accommodate more students, student housing was expanded. Heritage Halls were apartment-style dormitories that included a kitchen were built for girls, and Helaman Halls, which included a large dining hall, were built for men. With these additions, the number of women's accommodations increased to 2,000 students while the men's accommodations increased to 1,600 students.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=688-694}} 150 homes were bought from the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho and transported to Provo. Considered a fairly temporary solution, the complex was named Wyview Village and was intended to accommodate married students.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=698}} The Harvey Fletcher building was built and completed in 1953 in order to house the new engineering program, though other departments, namely the English department was allowed to share the space due to the lack of buildings.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=701-703}} The David O. McKay building was completed in 1954 for the College of Education. The college shared its walls with some other humanities disciplines until the campus was expanded more in later years.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=703-707}} The Benjamin Cluff Jr. Building, along with two greenhouses, was built to house the laboratories for the College of Biological and Agricultural Sciences in 1955.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=707-709}} These buildings were torn down for the new Life Science Building completed in 2014.{{sfn|Hollingshead|2011}} The Howard S. McDonald Student Health Center, which also housed the Air Force ROTC program, was completed in 1955 and contained an x-ray room and a hydrotherapy room.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=709-712}} A separate Student Health Center now exists.{{sfn|Brigham Young University a}} The Howard S. McDonald Building now contains BYU's MRI Research Facility.{{sfn|Brigham Young University b}} The Joseph F. Smith Family Living Center was built in 1957 to house the College of Family Living.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=714-716}} Dedicated in 2005 and still home to the College of Family, Home and Social Sciences, the Joseph Fielding Smith Building took the place of the Family Living Center.{{sfn|Fielding|2005}} A number of other smaller, miscellaneous buildings were built in the 50s including a ticket office for the football stadium and a poultry laboratory for the Animal Science Department. Significant effort was also put into improving the campus utilities and landscaping. The Department of Physical Plant was established in 1954.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=716-718}} Due to the nearly seventy hours of work President was putting in per week, Wilkinson suffered a heart attack in October 1956. He was permitted to return to work in January 1957. Taylor, Edwards, and Berrett took over his responsibilities while he was recovering.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|pp=718-720}}

===The Second Era: 1957&amp;ndash;1971===
====Building construction====
With the continuous growth of the student body, Wilkinson understood the need to continue expanding campus. The first large project was the BYU Motion Picture Studio (now the [[LDS Motion Picture Studios]]), built in 1958. In 1961, At a cost of nearly $4,000,000, the J. Reuben Clark Jr. Library (now the [[Harold B. Lee Library]]) was built due to lack of library resources and space in the Heber J. Grant Library. The library was built to accommodate 3,000 people and house one million books.{{sfn|Wilkinson|Arrington|1976|pp=21-25}} The Jesse Knight building was completed in 1960 to house the College of Commerce.{{sfn|Wilkinson|Arrington|1976|pp=25-28}} Plans were made in early 1960 for a new student center; student costs were raised by ten dollars each student to raise the funds for the project. The building cost $7 million, and two-thirds of the funds came directly from students. The building was six stories and contained a bookstore, cafeteria, two theaters, lounges, a bowling alley, and a barber shop. A consensus hadn't been reached on the name of the building. Students were interested in naming the building "Memorial Union" to honor BYU students killed in war. Shortly before the dedication, the Board of Trustees revealed they intended to name the building the Ernest L. Wilkinson Student Center. Although some students believed that they should have had the right to name the building since they paid for most of it, the Board of Trustees named the building after Wilkinson.{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=30}} During his presidency, church appropriations to the school increased from $1 million to $22 million annually, while university expenditures increased from $2 million to $65 million annually.{{sfn|Bergera|1996|p=171}}

====The Honor Code====
Ernest L. Wilkinson felt that his job was to prevent the decay of moral values of the students and increase administrative control of the [[Church Educational System Honor Code|BYU Honor Code]]. He instituted a strict dress code meant to prevent students from dressing like "go-go girls" or "surfers".{{sfn|Waterman|1998|pp=85-112}} Women's skirts and dresses were required to be below the knee and they were prohibited from wearing pants. Upon protestation, female students achieved a small victory when they were permitted to wear slacks at the university's bowling alley. Men were required to keep their hair cut short. Wilkinson pushed to increase the social interaction among the students, believing that it would be facilitated if every student was required to wear a name tag. Due to the unpopularity of the plan among students, this was never enforced. Wilkinson attempted to weed out students who were not following the honor code, because he felt that they prevented other worthy students from attending the university. Wilkinson also instituted a rule against male facial hair with the exception of a small, well-trimmed mustache.{{sfn|Waterman|1998|pp=85-112}}

====The 1966 BYU spy ring controversy====
Extremely conservative and anti-communist, Ernest L. Wilkinson wasn't bashful in expressing his political philosophy to BYU students and faculty. After his unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate in 1964, he "returned to campus with a vengeance".{{sfn|Blake|1995|pp=170-171}} Some of his employees publicly supported his opponent Sherman Lloyd in the primaries, which Wilkinson felt was disloyal.{{sfn|Blake|1995|pp=170-171}} When he returned to BYU, he became aware of a group of "liberal" teachers who were interested in changing the social and political atmosphere at BYU.{{sfn|Blake|1995|p=171}}  He invited right-wing speakers to BYU and gave highly political speeches on campus.{{sfn|Blake|1995|p=171}}  Wilkinson gave a lengthy May 1965 commencement address in which he attributed the beginning of moral decay of American values to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] as well as criticizing the current president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s views of [[Social Security (United States)|social security]].{{sfn|Waterman|1998|p=87}} Hoping to incite controversy, Wilkinson planned to give another politically charged speech in April 1966. He asked his [[comptroller]], Joseph Bentley, to find students to report on professors' reactions to the speech. Bentley in turn asked student Stephen Hays Russell to report on professors' reactions unofficially. The two made a list of professors to surveil, and Russell recruited ten students to take notes on what their professors said about Wilkinson's speech in their classes.{{sfn|Blake|1995|p=164–165}} Political science professor Ray Hillam was one of Bentley and Russell's targets. He was notified of the spy ring by one of his students and he requested a formal hearing be arranged. In the first hearing on September 15, presided over by vice presidents of the university, Hillam was formally charged for being pro-communist and disloyal to the university, with information gathered by the student spies used as evidence. Hillam rejected the charges and questioned the motives of all involved.{{sfn|Blake|1995|pp=165-166}} The vice presidents formally issued a report on October 17. The report did not address that Hillam was the target of a spy ring, only accusing him of "minor indiscretions".{{sfn|Blake|1995|p=167}} Ronald Hankin, one of the students involved, went to local television and radio stations to inform them of the spying scandal and Wilkinson's involvement in it. Wilkinson admitted that he recruited students to report on faculty members in an official statement. In the official history of Brigham Young University, Wilkinson included information about the spy ring, but omitted any information that led him to appear guilty.{{sfn|Blake|1995|pp=167-168}}

====End of presidency====
Wilkinson considered the most important accomplishment of his term as president to have been the organization of student wards and stakes. Wilkinson was the ninth [[Commissioner of Church Education]] of the LDS Church. During his tenure, he also bore the title "Administrator–Chancellor of the Unified Church Schools System".  On April 21, 1966, Wilkinson gave an address to the student body of BYU, entitled "The Changing Nature of American Government from a Constitutional Republic to a Welfare State." This was published in booklet form by [[Deseret Book Company]]. After President McKay died in 1970, Neal A. Maxwell was named the new commissioner of the Church Educational System. Wilkinson relied on David O. McKay as a buffer in interacting with [[Harold B. Lee]], a senior member of the Board of Trustee with whom Wilkinson differed greatly in educational and administrative philosophies.{{sfn|Fletcher|2013|p=9}} Sensing a lack of support among the church leaders, Wilkinson resigned from his position as BYU president in mid-1970 and was released at the beginning of 1971. Even though he was no longer president, Wilkinson hoped to be involved in the establishment of the [[J. Reuben Clark Law School]]. Due to his domineering reputation, school officials were unsure that he should continue to be so closely involved in administration of BYU, so they asked him to edit the university's official centennial history.{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=32}} Published in 1976, ''Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years'' was composed of four volumes.{{sfn|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=32}}

==Death==
Ernest L. Wilkinson died of a heart attack April 6, 1978.{{sfn|Embry|1994}} Before he died, he had been supervising the work on his biography, ''Ernest L. Wilkinson: Indian Advocate and University President''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|L.Tom Perry Special Collections|2002}}; {{harvnb|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LDS Church service==
In the early 1930s, Ernest L. Wilkinson served as branch president in New York and Queens, and later, bishop of the Queens Ward. His colleagues in the Hughes law firm called him the "Bishop of Wall Street".{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=524}} In 1940, he served as second counselor to [[Ezra Taft Benson]] in the Washington Stake Presidency and as first counselor from 1944 to 1948. He represented the Church on the General Commission for Chaplains of the Army and Navy.{{sfn|Arrington|Hafen|1975|p=524}}

==Legacy==
During the twenty years of Wilkinson's presidency at Brigham Young University, the student body increased from 4,004 students in 1951 to over 25,000 in 1971. The university went from having five colleges with 37 departments to 13 colleges with 71 departments. The number of faculty members increased by from 244 to 932, while the number of them holding a doctoral degree increased from 50 to more than 500. The first associate and doctoral programs were organized. The quarter system was changed to the semester system. The number of resources in the library increased by 500%. The number of buildings increased from six permanent buildings to 254 permanent buildings and 85 temporary buildings, an increase from 800,000 to 5 million square feet of floor space. After 1972, student housing could accommodate almost 6,000 students, an increase from the 1,200 student accommodations in 1951. The achievement Wilkinson was most proud of was the creation of student wards and stakes. In 1951, there was one branch for LDS students and in 1971, there were 98 wards and 10 stakes for LDS students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bergera|Priddis|1985|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Friel|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RevFrancisBurns1859.jpg|thumbnail|Rev. Francis Burns, engraved by J. C. Buttre (Philadelphia 1859).]] --&gt;
'''Francis Burns''' (1809 &amp;ndash; 1863) was an American [[Methodist]] minister who served as a missionary in [[Liberia]]. He was the first [[Missionary Bishop (Methodist Church)|Missionary Bishop]], and the first African-American Bishop of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] (elected in 1858).

==Birth, enslavement and early education==
Burns was born 5 December 1809 in [[Albany, New York]].  He was said to be ''"thoroughly African in his [[complexion]]."''  New York was still a [[slave state]] at this time.  His parents were so [[Poverty|poor]], such that at the age of four they placed their son in service with a farmer in [[Greene County, New York]].  At the age of eight, he was [[indentured]] to a Mr. Atwood (a farmer) to learn the farming business.

He was permitted to attend school with the other children of the neighborhood, during the winter season (which is when most early schools were open, the [[farm chores]] being fewer during the winter).  Two years later, however, his health becoming poor, he was sent to the district school during the entire summer.

==Early religious life and ministry==
The Atwood family was respectable and eminently [[pious]], living in Ashland, New York, in a house now owned by Samuel Creech. Burns attended the North Settlement Methodist Church, County Route 10 Ashland. Mrs. Atwood was a [[Methodist]] [[class-leader]]. One who knew her said she was "a holy and zealous woman." At fifteen years of age Francis was [[Christian conversion|converted]] to the Christian faith under the influence of Miss Stewart, a white teacher, the daughter of a [[Baptist]] preacher. At seventeen Francis felt that God required him to [[preach]]. Yet he refrained from doing so because he was bound to his master until the age of twenty-one.

His education was insufficient from Burns's own perspective, and there appeared no field in which he might labor to answer his calling. When the way finally opened, he felt unwilling to enter it. But possessing an unquenchable thirst for [[knowledge]], he employed all his efforts to obtain it. While attending a high school he began to hold religious meetings, and to exhort. He also began to teach school. Indeed, he is said to have been "the first [[colored]] student in a white school," the Academy at [[Lexington Heights, New York]]. He is also said to have been "the first colored teacher in a white school," in his own community, where he received marked respect. He was subsequently licensed as a local preacher on the Windham circuit.

Bishop [[Matthew Simpson]] said of Francis Burns, in reflection:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By his intelligence, his consistent piety, and by the force of his character, he rose above the disabilities of his color, and commanded the respect of all that knew him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Missionary service==
The Rev. Francis Burns became noticed as a pastor and a preacher.  A Dr. Terry of the Mission Rooms was chiefly instrumental in leading him into missionary work.  He encouraged Francis to enter upon a course of study, that he might be ready to go to Liberia or elsewhere, should the door open.  In 1833 Dr. Terry secured for Francis an [[interview]] with Bishop Hedding.  In 1834, when the Rev. John Seys was about to sail for [[Liberia]], it was arranged that the Rev. Burns should accompany him as a Missionary Teacher.  Sailing in September of that year, they arrived in [[Monrovia]] 18 October.

The Rev. Burns' first appointment in Liberia was as at [[Cape Palmas]].  For two years he suffered from the dreaded fever.  He joined the Liberia [[Annual Conference]] in 1838, and in 1840-42 was an assistant Preacher on the [[Bassa people (Liberia)|Bassa]] Circuit.  During 1843 and the early part of 1844 he was appointed to [[Monrovia]].  In due course he was elected to [[Holy Orders|orders]]. Then ten years after arriving in Liberia, returning to New York, Francis Burns was [[ordained]] by Bishop Janes.

The Rev. Burns performed hard and difficult work in the missionary field.  He also occasionally occupied the post of teacher in the Monrovia [[Seminary]].  He served as Editor of the ''Africa's Luminary,'' doing so with marked ability.

==Ordained ministry==
The Rev. Francis Burns returned to the U.S. in 1844.  He was ordained [[Deacon]] 16 June 1844 in [[Brooklyn, N.Y.]].  He was ordained [[Elder (religious)|Elder]] in the [[Mulberry Street (Manhattan)|Mulberry Street]] Church in New York City the same day, with Bishop Janes officiating at both services.  The Rev. Burns returned to Liberia later that year.

When, at the 1849 session of the Mission Conference, the work in Liberia was divided into districts, the Rev. Burns was appointed [[Presiding Elder]] of the [[Cape Palmas]] District.  For six years of the ten that he was Presiding Elder, he also served as President of the Conference, reporting clearly and comprehensively the business of the mission to the Missionary Board in New York.  In 1851, Burns also was sent to open an academy in Monrovia and to superintend the Mission there.

==Episcopal ministry==
The 1856 General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church made provision for the first time for the election and consecration of a [[Missionary Bishop]] (for the African work). Accordingly, in January 1858 the Liberia Annual Conference elected the Rev. Francis Burns as their first Bishop. He returned to the US for [[consecration]]. This took place 14 October 1858 at the session of the Genesee Annual Conference, meeting in [[Perry, New York|Perry]], [[Wyoming County, New York]]. Bishops Janes and Baker presided at the consecration.

Bishop Simpson, quoting Dr. John Robie (who was present at the Conference), described the proceedings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though of ebony complexion, he had gained wonderfully on the affection and respect of all who had made his acquaintance, and especially of those privileged to an intimate association with him. His manner is exceedingly pleasant, and his spirit is as kind, sweet, and good as ever beamed from human heart or disposition. He seems to be lacking in none of the qualifications of the [[gentleman]] and Christian minister. He possesses also an intelligent and cultivated mind, speaks readily and fluently, and even eloquently, and is in all respects a model African. Such is the man whom the Liberian Conference has selected for a bishop, and such the one the highest authorities of one American church have set apart for the sacred and responsible position.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bishop Burns returned to Africa almost immediately following his consecration, where he devoted himself to the work which devolved upon him for the next nearly five years.

==Failing health and death==
Bishop Burns' health began to fail.  He was therefore directed to take a [[sea voyage]].  On the advice of his physician, Bishop Burns then returned to the U.S.A.  He died 18 April 1863 within three days of his arrival in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], a mere three months after [[Emancipation Proclamation|Emancipation]] in the United States.  Bishop Burns was buried in [[Monrovia]], Liberia.

The '''General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York''', was founded on November 17, 1785, by 22 men who gathered in Walter Heyer's [[public-house]] on Pine Street in [[Lower Manhattan]].  The aims of the General Society were to provide cultural, educational and social services to families of [[tradesman|skilled craftsmen]]. The General Society during this early period celebrated the mutuality and centrality of the craft community. Besides its [[Charity (practice)|charitable]] activities, the society played a prominent part in the festivities that marked [[patriotic]] holidays, carrying banners emblazoned with its slogan 'By hammer and hand all arts do stand', echoing the motto of the [[Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths]].

The city of New York and the Society both benefited from the decision to make New York the seat of the Federal Government. In 1789, legislators and their assistants and families began to pour into the city. Business prospects brightened considerably. In 1792, the Society attained a membership of 413, and received a charter of incorporation.&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; Old documents reveal that the Society was quite active in the last years of the 18th century, corresponding with other business related associations, and petitioning the state legislature in the interests of industrial progress.

==Educational programing==
[[Image:Mechanics Hall, NYC, 1803.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mechanics' Hall, 1803]]  In 1820, The General Society opened one of the city's first free schools. During the early 1800s, New York had no public school system. Only two free schools were to be found in the whole city – one in the almshouse, and the other open only to the children of freed slaves. The school opened with 70 students. Children of members were admitted free of charge, and a small fee was required from all others. Later that same year the Society added a separate school for girls.  The school, which became the [[Mechanics Institute]] in 1858, continues to provide tuition-free evening instruction in trades-related education.  Currently, it is the oldest privately endowed tuition-free technical school in the city of New York, with more than 180,000 alumni.

===Library===
Also founded in 1820, the General Society Library is the second oldest in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;For context, see: [[List of libraries in 19th-century New York City]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Library's main reading room—which houses [[The Crouse Library for Publishing Arts]]—soars to a height of three stories topped by a magnificent skylight. The establishment of the Apprentices' Library put the Society well in the forefront of social reform. Later in the century there would be a great boom in libraries, and much thought would be directed toward public education, but in 1820 such ideas were still new, and the Apprentices' Library was one of the first public libraries in the city of New York.  Its aim was to provide good and instructive reading for apprentice boys who worked all day, and had no other access to books and the library therefore kept evening hours.

In 1833, by amendment to its charter, the Society was authorized to increase its usefulness by reserving a portion of its income for the purposes of "promoting and disseminating literary and scientific knowledge," which was determined could be best done by means of lectures,&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; and more recently, through the cultural and educational activities of the [[New York Center for Independent Publishing]]. The lecture series, which began in 1837—and continues today—featured such illuminaries as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry Ward Beecher]], [[Horace Greeley]], [[Wendell Phillips]], and Rear – Admiral [[Robert E. Peary]].  Known today as the Labor, Landmarks and Literature Lecture Series, the series continues the Society's long tradition of public lectures.

Individual Society members must have been prospering during these years, too. It was during the 1830s that the French observer Chevalier made this comment about the American mechanic and tradesmen: "He dresses like a member of Congress, and his women-folk dress the same as those of a wealthy New York merchant. His house is warm, neat, and comfortable; his table almost as plentifully provided as that of the wealthiest fellow-citizen."

In 1878, the General Society opened an Apprentices' Library at its headquarters "on Sixteenth-street, near [[Union Square (New York City)|Union-square]]" to house its collection of 60,000 books, mostly "practical works in serviceable bindings" of use to its 8,000 members. These members of the Apprentices' Library included about 4,000 apprentices and 3,000 "girls in shops", along with members of the general public, who paid $2 per year, and General Society members. The building had room for up to 100,000 books and featured an on-site residence for the librarian and janitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A new library building: its opening this morning|newspaper=New York Times|date=21 January 1878|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College scholarships===
During the 1840s the Society also provided college scholarships. It was decided that each year two students from Mechanics Institute would attend the [[University of the City of New York]], free of charge. In addition, the society paid to send certain students to other schools.

The library continued to be well patronized during these years, and in 1845, Benjamin DeMilt a watchmaker and former president of the Society, bequeathed his entire personal library to the Society, adding 1,800 volumes to the collection.

===Social reform===
The Society continued in its role as a pioneer in social reform by maintaining separate courses for women. In 1887, these classes for young women included stenography and typewriting – a very innovative idea at a time when few women were integrated into the office work force.

In 1861, when the Civil War broke out, the Society placed itself firmly behind the government of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. About $8,000 in government bonds were purchased and many Society members enlisted in the [[Volunteer Engineer Regiment]].

==Current location==
In 1885, the Society celebrated a landmark 100th birthday. A banquet was held at [[Delmonico's Restaurant]] and it was well attended both by Society members and by public officials. The Society's growth continued, and in 1899 the organization moved to the current home at 20 West 44th Street.

Between 1899 and 1908, [[Andrew Carnegie]], a Society member, contributed over half a million dollars to the Society. Generous gifts came in from other members as well, and by 1913 attendance at Mechanics Institute had reached 2,300. The curriculum now included such "mechanical age" courses as automobile drafting and industrial electricity.

Located today at 20 West 44th Street, across from the [[Harvard Club of New York]], the building is the fifth home of the General Society and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally designed by [[Lamb and Rich]] and constructed as the Berkeley School for Boys, the building was acquired by The General Society in 1899. Member and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie provided the funds to significantly expand the building in 1903.  In order to accommodate more students, two wings were added to the rear and three new upper stories replaced an original fourth-floor gymnasium. The expansion was designed by Ralph S. Townsend and blends monumental Beaux Arts classicism with Renaissance elements.

===Museum===
The Society is also home to the [[John M. Mossman Lock Museum]].  The Mossman collection represents one of the most complete anthologies of bank and vault locks in the world, with more than 370 locks, keys and tools dating from 4000 BC to the modern 20th-century. The museum is open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;https://generalsociety.org/?page_id=140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable members==
Notable General Society members include [[Duncan Phyfe]] (furniture maker), [[James Harper (publisher)|James Harper]] (publisher, 66th mayor of NYC), [[Peter Cooper]] (inventor, industrialist), [[Nathaniel Currier]] (lithographer), [[John Bishop Putnam]] (printer and publisher), [[Andrew Carnegie]] (industrialist and philanthropist), [[Abram S. Hewitt]] (Glue Manufacturer, 87th mayor of NYC) and former presidents of the society: [[Stephen Allen]] (sailmaker, 55th mayor of NYC), [[Gideon Lee]] (shoemaker, 61st mayor of NYC), and [[Jacob Aaron Westervelt]] (shipbuilder, 72nd mayor of NYC).&lt;ref name=gs&gt;{{harvnb|General Society|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Goldhaber fellows" are the recipients of the Gertrude and Maurice Goldhaber Dinstinguished Fellowship. The fellowship programs are governed by [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL). In 2001, BNL has created the Fellowships Program in honor of [[Gertrude Goldhaber]] and [[Maurice Goldhaber]], long-time scientists at the lab.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnl.gov/hr/goldhaber.asp BNL webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; The funds of fellowship comes from [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] and [[Stony Brook University]], partners in Brookhaven Science Associates. Each year, three to four Goldhaber Fellows are chosen from many nominations in all areas of science performed in the lab. These prestigious Fellowships are awarded to candidates with exceptional talent and credentials who have a strong desire for independent research at the frontiers of their fields. The fellowships are three-year appointments. Candidates should be less than three years past receipt of the Ph.D. at the time of the application. The intention of the program is to select individuals who will qualify for scientific staff positions at BNL upon completion of the appointment. Some Fellows stay on as new BNL scientific staff. Some move on to contribute to faculty positions at other institutions around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">'''Higher education policy''' refers to how [[higher education]] institutions like [[university|universities]] are organised, funded and operated in a society. According to Ansell (2006) there are "three different institutional forms of higher education provision: the Anglo-Saxon, [[Continental education system|Continental]] and the Scandinavian education system."&lt;ref name="ansell2006"&gt;Ansell, B. W. (2006, Apr)  "University Challenges: The Trilemma of Higher Education Policy in Advanced Industrial States" Paper presented at the annual meeting of The Midwest Political Science Association, Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois Online &lt;PDF&gt; Retrieved   2008-06-11 from [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p140531_index.html AllAcademic Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anglo-Saxon education system==
{{main|Anglo-Saxon education system}}

According to Ansell (2006), "[t]he Anglo-Saxon education system leads to a mass, partially private and publicly inexpensive system". The Anglo-Saxon system is sometimes described as an Anglo-American education system.&lt;ref name="lse"&gt;'Anglo-Saxon' or ' Continental ' Model: the EU's false dichotomy? - LSE Public Lectures and Events - LSE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental education system ==

According to Ansell (2006), "[t]he Continental educational system leads to an elite, fully public and inexpensive system".

According to Ansell (2006), "[t]he Scandinavian education system leads to a mass, fully public, but highly expensive system".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31249">[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale 1805 cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Jefferson]] claimed to read and write six different languages.]]
Of the 44 men who have served as [[List of Presidents of the United States|Presidents of the United States]], at least half have displayed proficiency in speaking or writing a language other than English. Of these, only one, [[Martin Van Buren]], learned English as his second language; his first language was Dutch. Four of the earliest Presidents were multilingual, with [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] demonstrating proficiency in a number of foreign languages.

[[James A. Garfield]] and [[Chester A. Arthur]] knew [[Ancient Greek]] and Latin, but it was Garfield's [[ambidextrous]] ability that would lead to rumors that he could write both at the same time. Both [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] spoke French, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] spoke German. [[Herbert Hoover]] spoke some [[Mandarin Chinese]].

==18th century==
===John Adams===
[[John Adams]], the second president of the United States, learned to read [[Latin language|Latin]] at a young age.&lt;ref name=Crapo&gt;Crapo (2007), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for attending [[Harvard University]], Adams attended a school for improving his Latin skills.&lt;ref name=McLeod&gt;McLeod (1976), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; While posted in France, Adams became fluent in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;McCullough (2001), 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
===Thomas Jefferson===
[[Thomas Jefferson]] spoke and read multiple languages, which included French. After his death, a number of other books, dictionaries, and grammar manuals in various languages were found in Jefferson's library, suggesting that he studied additional languages beyond those he spoke and wrote well. Among these were books in [[Italian language| Italian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name=JeffersonEncyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Languages_Jefferson_Spoke_or_Read#_note-2|title=Languages Jefferson Spoke or Read|last=Berkes|first=Anna|author2=Bryan Craig |date=10 December 2008|work=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]]|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Spanish, Jefferson told [[John Quincy Adams]] that he had learned the language over the course of nineteen days while sailing from the United States to France. He had borrowed a [[Spanish grammar]] and a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' from a friend and read them on the voyage. Adams expressed skepticism, noting Jefferson's tendency to tell "large stories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Spanish_Language|title=Spanish Language|last=Berkes|first=Anna|author2=Bryan Craig |date=10 December 2008|work=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]]|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Madison===
[[James Madison]] began his studies of Latin at the age of twelve&lt;ref name=Ketcham&gt;Ketcham (1990), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and had mastered Greek and Latin by the time he entered the College of New Jersey, later [[Princeton University]]. He produced many translations of Latin orations of [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Emer de Vattel|Vattel]].&lt;ref name=Ketcham/&gt; He also studied [[Horace]] and [[Ovid]].&lt;ref name=Ketcham/&gt; He learned Greek as an admissions requirement for higher college learning.&lt;ref name=Ketcham/&gt;

While in college, Madison learned to speak and read [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref name=Crapo/&gt; When he could have graduated, Madison remained at college for an additional year to study ethics and Hebrew in greater depth.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge and Nolan (2007), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Monroe===
[[James Monroe]] adopted many French customs while a diplomat in [[Paris]], including learning fluent French. The entire Monroe family knew the language, and often spoke it with one another at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umw.edu/magazine/face_to_world/default.php |title=Our Face to the World:  Clothing exhibit unveils lives of  James and Elizabeth Monroe |last=Budinger |first=Meghan |work=UMW Magazine |publisher=[[University of Mary Washington]] |accessdate=28 April 2010 |location=[[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095631/http://www.umw.edu/magazine/face_to_world/default.php |archivedate=27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Quincy Adams===
[[John Quincy Adams]] went to school in both France and the Netherlands, and spoke fluent French and conversational Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1874), 229&lt;/ref&gt; Adams strove to improve his abilities in Dutch throughout his life, and at times translated a page of Dutch a day to help improve his mastery of the language.&lt;ref name=Adams1&gt;Adams (1874), 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Official documents that he translated were sent to the [[Secretary of State of the United States]], so that Adams' studies would serve a useful purpose as well.&lt;ref name=Adams1/&gt; When his father appointed him [[United States Ambassador to Prussia]], Adams dedicated himself to becoming proficient in German in order have the tools to strengthen relations between the two countries.&lt;ref name=Adamspark&gt;{{cite web|title=John Quincy Adams Biography Page 2|url=http://www.nps.gov/adam/jqa-bio-page-2.htm|work=Adams National Historic Park|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=25 July 2011|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|page=2|date=30 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He improved his skills by translating articles from German to English, and his studies made his diplomatic efforts more successful.&lt;ref name=Adamspark/&gt;

In addition to the two languages he spoke fluently, he also studied Italian, but he admitted to making little progress in it since he had no one with whom to practice speaking and hearing the language, as well as Russian, but never achieved fluency.&lt;ref name=Adams1/&gt; Adams also read Latin very well, translated a page a day of Latin text,&lt;ref name=Adams2&gt;Adams (1874), 177.&lt;/ref&gt; and studied classical Greek in his spare time.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1874), 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Van Buren===
[[Martin Van Buren]] was the only American president who did not speak English as his first language. He was born in [[Kinderhook, New York]], a primarily Dutch community, spoke Dutch as his first language, and continued to speak it at home.&lt;ref&gt;Widmer (2005), ii.&lt;/ref&gt; He learned English as a [[second language]] while attending [[Kinderhook (village), New York|Kinderhook's]] local school house. He obtained a small understanding of Latin while studying at Kinderhook Academy and solidified his understanding of English there.&lt;ref&gt;Holland (1836), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Henry Harrison===
At [[Hampden–Sydney College]], [[William Henry Harrison]] spent a considerable time learning Latin, and favored reading about the [[military history of ancient Rome]] and [[Julius Caesar]] from Latin histories. While there, he also learned a small amount of French.&lt;ref&gt;Owens (2007), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Tyler===
[[John Tyler]] excelled at school, where he learned both Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;May and Wilentz (2008), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James K. Polk===
Although [[James K. Polk]] had no background in foreign languages upon entering college, he proved a quick learner.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo (2006), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduating from the [[University of North Carolina]], he was asked to give the welcoming address at graduation; he chose to do so in Latin. He proved very proficient in classical languages, and received honors in both Greek and Latin on his degree.&lt;ref&gt;Behrman (2005), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Buchanan===
[[James Buchanan]] studied a traditional classical curriculum, which included Latin and Greek, at the private Old Stone Academy before transferring to [[Dickinson College]]. He excelled in both subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2004), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rutherford B. Hayes===
[[Rutherford B. Hayes]] studied Latin and Greek at the Isaac Webb school in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. He initially struggled with the languages, but soon became proficient in them. He also briefly studied French there.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse (2002), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James A. Garfield===
[[James A. Garfield]] knew and taught both Latin and Greek, and he was the first President to campaign in two languages (English and German).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Abram Garfield|url=http://www.potus.com/jagarfield.html|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also [[ambidextrous]]. Stories emerged to the effect that Garfield would entertain his friends by having them ask him questions, and then writing the answer in Latin with one hand while simultaneously writing the answer in Greek with the other. However, specifics of these stories are not documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Portrait of James Garfield|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?151093-1/life-portrait-james-garfield|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=26 July 1999|quote=…James Garfield could write Greek with one hand and Latin with the other at the same time.  We know he was a wonderful scholar. Any truth to that long-held rumor? …I've heard the statement before about it. I believe it, but I'm not sure it's true. Shortly after his death, Garfield -- After Garfield's death, one of his sons tried to track that legend down because he had heard it, but he had never seen it happen. He wrote to lots and lots of people, relatives, friends, family. None of them supported it.  It's true that Garfield was ambidextrous, but he just wasn't that ambidextrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chester A. Arthur===
[[Chester A. Arthur]] was known to be comfortable enough in Latin and Greek to converse with other men who knew the languages.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves (1975), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

===Theodore Roosevelt===
A foreign correspondent noted that although Roosevelt spoke clearly and quickly, he had a German accent while speaking in French.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' (1909), 2. {{date}}&lt;/ref&gt; He read both German and French very well and kept a good number of books written in these languages in his personal library.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' (1898), IMS10. {{date}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quite often read fiction, philosophy, religion, and history books in both French and German.&lt;ref name=Wagenknecht&gt;Wagenknecht (2008), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; He was most comfortable with informal discussions in French, but he made two public addresses in the [[West Indies]] in French in 1916.&lt;ref name=Wagenknecht/&gt; He recognized that, while he spoke French rapidly and was able to understand others, he used unusual grammar "without tense or gender". [[John Hay]], secretary of state under Roosevelt, commented that Roosevelt spoke odd, grammatically incorrect French, but was never difficult to understand.&lt;ref name=Wagenknecht/&gt;

Though he could read and understand the language thoroughly, Roosevelt struggled to speak German. When Roosevelt attempted to speak with a native German, he had to apologize after botching the attempt.&lt;ref name=Wagenknecht/&gt; While not fluent in the language, Roosevelt was also able to read Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Edmund|date=22 March 2002|title=A Matter of Extreme Urgency: Theodore Roosevelt, Wilhelm II, and the Venezuela Crisis of 1902|journal=[[Naval War College Review]]|publisher=[[Naval War College]]|location=[[Newport, Rhode Island]]|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-88174230/matter-extreme-urgency-theodore.html|accessdate=22 March 2010|authorlink=Edmund Morris (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he at one point studied Greek and Latin, Roosevelt found both languages a "dreary labor" to translate.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenknecht (2008), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt understood some of the Dutch language and taught songs in Dutch to his children and grandchildren, as is documented in a letter in English that he wrote to the painter Nelly Bodenheim in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Undated letter to Nelly Bodenhem, copy in the possession of Pieter J. Dijkstra, the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodrow Wilson===
[[Woodrow Wilson]] learned German as part of earning his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in history and [[political science]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. However, he never claimed proficiency in the language. While he did read German sources when they were available, he often complained about the amount of time and effort it took him.&lt;ref name=Pestritto&gt;Pestritto (2005), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbert Hoover===

[[Herbert Hoover]] and his wife, [[Lou Hoover]], once translated a book from Latin to English.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/opinion/11iht-edkelly.1.15175920.html|title=Caught in the Grips of Linguistic Paranoia|last=Kelly|first=Nataly|year=2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=22 March 2010|location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair took five years, and sacrificed much of their spare time, to translating the Latin mining tract ''[[De re metallica]]''.&lt;ref name=Trans&gt;''Lewiston Evening News'' (1933), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; While at [[Stanford University]], Hoover had access to the extensive library of [[John Casper Branner]], where he found the important mining book which had never been fully translated into English.&lt;ref name=Trans/&gt; For years, five nights of the week were spent translating the book, including naming objects that the author had merely described.&lt;ref name=Trans/&gt; The Hoovers also spoke [[Mandarin Chinese]], having lived in China from April 1899 until August 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wais.stanford.edu/HooverInstitute/hooverinstit_herberthooverandchina112101.html |title=Herbert Hoover and China |language=English|publisher=World Association for International Studies|quote="The Hoovers arrived in China in April 1899 and lived through the siege of Tienjin. Being an engineer, Mr. Hoover and his detail were responsibie for maintaining the battleworks; Mrs. Hoover worked as a nurse. Although both Hoovers knew how to fire a gun, there is no evidence that they ever shot at the boxers. They left China in August 1900"."|date=21 November 2001|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lou Hoover studied the language daily in China but Herbert Hoover confessed that he "never absorbed more than a hundred words."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memoirs, vol. 1|last=Hoover|first=Herbert|publisher=Macmillan|year=1951|isbn=9781258120832|location=New York|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the two would converse in their limited Mandarin when they wanted to keep their conversations private from guests or the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=King|first=David|title=Herbert Hoover|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|location=[[Tarrytown, NY]]|year=2009|isbn = 0-7614-3626-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QrBeocgL5gIC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franklin D. Roosevelt===
[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] spoke both German and French. He was raised speaking both, as his early education consisted of governesses from Europe preparing him for boarding school in his teens. In particular, he had a German governess and a French governess who taught him their respective languages. A Swiss governess, Jeanne Sandoz, furthered his studies in both languages,&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1996), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  particularly stressing French.&lt;ref&gt;Coker (2005), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt spent one summer of his schooling in Germany;&lt;ref&gt;Harper (1996), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; both his time with his instructors and his frequent trips abroad allowed him to master both German and French, though he always spoke them with a distinct [[New England English|New England accent]].&lt;ref&gt;Coker (2005), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he never had a mastery of the language, his governesses also taught him a limited amount of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1992), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt gave a bilingual speech (in English and French) during a 1936 visit to Quebec City. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=15329 96 - Address in Quebec, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jimmy Carter===
[[Jimmy Carter]] has a functional command of Spanish, but has never been grammatically perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004699.html|title=The Linguistic Ability of the Presidential Candidates|last=Poser|first=Bill|date=8 July 2007|work=Language Log|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=22 March 2010|location=[[Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter studied the language at the [[United States Naval Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2004), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued his studies while an officer of the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Carter sometimes spoke Spanish in 1976 television campaign advertisements, but in his native South Georgia accent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

He could speak fairly fluently, but joked about his sometimes flawed understanding of the language while discoursing with native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;McBride (1978), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter has written and given a number of addresses in the Spanish language&lt;ref&gt;The Washington Post (2002), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes spoke to [[Electoral district|constituents]] in Spanish.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Associated Press (1976), 46.&lt;/ref&gt; To practice his Spanish, he and his wife [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]] read the Bible in Spanish to each other every night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Bill Clinton===
While a freshman at [[Georgetown University]], [[Bill Clinton]] was required to choose a foreign language to study, and chose German because he was "impressed by the clarity and precision of the language".&lt;ref&gt;Clinton (2005), 76.&lt;/ref&gt; He is able to hold casual conversation in the language.&lt;ref&gt;Maraniss (1996), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, while giving a speech at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], he gave part of a speech in German, pledging to the 50,000 Germans gathered there that "''{{lang|de|Amerika steht an Ihrer Seite jetzt und für immer}}''" ("America stands on your side, now and forever").&lt;ref&gt;Clinton (2005), 609.&lt;/ref&gt;

===George W. Bush===
[[George W. Bush]] speaks some [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and has delivered speeches in the language.&lt;ref&gt;Gormley (2000), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; His speeches in Spanish have had English interspersed throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hegstrom|first=Edward|title=Gore and Bush employ splintered Spanish|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/span27.shtml|accessdate=27 July 2010|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=27 September 1999|agency=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=[[Seattle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barack Obama===
From age six to ten (1967-1971), [[Barack Obama]] lived in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] and attended local Indonesian-language schools: as a result he was able to speak [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] fluently as a child. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYIK9QtNu3w&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1025&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1052&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brother Lucian Athanasius Reinhart, F.S.C.''' was an [[Americans|American]] [[De La Salle Brothers|De La Salle Brother]] who was last assigned to the [[De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines]] and was a President of [[De La Salle University|De La Salle College]] in [[Manila]].

== Early life ==

He was born '''James Hyde Reinhart''' on May 24, 1911, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and entered the [[novitiate]] of the Brothers of the Christian Schools at the La Salle Institute in [[Glencoe, Missouri]], and received the [[religious habit]] in 1926, at which time he was given the [[religious name]] '''Lucian Athanasius'''.  In 1929 he was assigned to the St. George High School in [[Evanston, Illinois]], and two years later, he would earn his [[Master of Arts]] degree from [[DePaul University]] in [[Chicago]].  In 1933, he was assigned to the De La Salle Institute, also in Chicago, and finally to the Christian Brothers College in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1934.

== Assignment to the Philippines ==

In the mid-1930s, [[Brother (Christian)|brother]] Reinhart volunteered for mission work and was sent to the Philippines, arriving in Manila on October 30, 1936.  Upon his arrival, he was assigned as Pro-Director of the Brothers' Community and concurrent [[Principal (school)|principal]] of the College's High School Department.  He was also the first American Brother in the Philippines to earn a Doctor of Philosophy Degree, after writing a [[dissertation]] on the Educational Philosophy of [[John Baptist de La Salle]] at the [[University of Santo Tomas]].

=== World War II ===

During [[World War II]], Reinhart was [[internment|interned]] at [[Los Baños, Laguna]], with the rest of the American Brothers.  He would be freed by [[United States Armed Forces|American troops]] in 1945 but would refuse to be returned to the [[United States]].

=== Rehabilitation of De La Salle College ===

Reinhart stayed in the Philippines to rehabilitate De La Salle College and was appointed its President in 1945. It was also during this time that he was forced to return to the United States due to health reasons. In July 1946, he returned to Manila and formed new Faculty and Brother missionaries.

He died on May 27, 1950. The gym (on which lot the [[Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall]] now stands) of the De La Salle College was named in his memory as well as De La Salle University's Sports Complex, now the Enrique M. Razon Sports Center.

'''Dame Catherine Margaret Mary Scott''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep=,|AC|DBE}} (born 26 April 1922) is a South African ballet dancer who found fame as a teacher, choreographer, and school administrator in [[Australia]]. As the first director of the [[Australian Ballet School]], she is recognized as one of the founders of the strong ballet tradition of her adopted country.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Potter, ''Dame Maggie Scott: A Life in Dance'' (Melbourne: Text Publishing, 2014). With an introduction by Graeme Murphy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and training==
Catherine Margaret Mary Scott was born in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. As a child, she was encouraged by her free-spirited family to pursue her interest in dance, which had developed early in her girlhood. Throughout her youth, she attended ballet classes at the Conmee School of Dancing, where, under the direction of London-trained Ivy Conmee, instruction was given according to the syllabus of the [[Royal Academy of Dancing]]. Upon graduation from the [[Parktown Convent|Parktown Convent School]], Scott went with her mother to London in 1939, when she was 17, and auditioned successfully for entrance to the [[Sadler's Wells Ballet School]]. There she polished her classical technique under the demanding tutelage of [[Ninette de Valois]] and a faculty of renowned teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey William Hutton and Michelle Potter, "Scott, Margaret," in ''International Encyclopedia of Dance'', edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 4, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dancing in England==
Despite the outbreak of [[World War II|war with Germany]] in September 1939, soon after her arrival in England, Scott decided to remain in London and continue her dance training. After some months at the Sadler's Wells school, she joined the [[Royal Ballet|Sadler's Wells Ballet]] and began her professional career. She stayed with the company only a year. Attracted by the more adventurous repertory of [[Rambert Dance Company|Ballet Rambert]], she applied to [[Marie Rambert]] and was engaged as a soloist with her company.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Clarke, ''Dancers of Mercury: The Story of Ballet Rambert'' (London: A. &amp; C. Black, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to principal dancer in 1943, Scott spent five more years with Ballet Rambert, dancing leading and supporting roles in the repertory, including audience favorites such as [[Michel Fokine]]'s ''[[Les Sylphides]]'' and [[Antony Tudor]]'s ''[[Jardin aux Lilas]]'' as well as new works by [[Andrée Howard]], [[Frank Staff]], and [[Walter Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;Angela Kane, "Rambert Dance Company" (parts 1-3), ''Dance Theatre Research'' (London), 8, 10 (Autumn 1990–Autumn 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The war years were difficult ones for the Rambert company, but it began to recover its strength and its popularity in the postwar years.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Crisp, Anya Sainsbury, and Peter Williams, eds., ''Ballet Rambert: Fifty Years and On'', rev. &amp; enl. ed. (Ilkley, West Yorkshire: Scolars Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Ballet Rambert went overseas, to Australia, under the auspices of D. D. O'Connor and the British Council. The company's immensely successful tour was extended several times until eighteen months had been spent away from home. When the tour finally ended, some dancers, including [[Sally Gilmour]] and Maggie Scott, chose to remain in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Macaulay, "Rambert Dance Company," in ''International Encyclopedia of Dance'', edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 4, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dancing in Australia==
In 1949, Scott was a founding member of [[Gertrude Johnson]]'s National Theatre Ballet, based in [[Melbourne]] and directed by Joyce Graeme, a former principal dancer with Ballet Rambert. During the Christmas season of 1949, Scott appeared in a featured role in ''The Glass Slipper'', a retelling of the Cinderella story, and early in 1950 she danced the barefoot role of the Thipa Thipa Bird in ''[[Corroboree (ballet)|Corroboree]]'', choreographed by Rex Reid to music by [[John Antill]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer, "Margaret Scott," Live Performance Australia, website, http://liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/margaretscott2.html. Retrieved 28 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year she restaged Frank Staff's charming ''Peter and the Wolf'', which he had created in 1940 for Ballet Rambert. In 1951, she tried her hand at original choreography, setting ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollon Musagète]]'' to the [[Igor Stravinsky]] score for [[Laurel Martyn]]'s Victorian Ballet Guild. She returned to London in 1952 and was one of six dancers invited by [[John Cranko]] to perform his works at the [[Kenton Theatre]] in Henley-on-Thames and at the [[Aldeburgh Festival]]. She then rejoined the Rambert company as ballet mistress and assistant to Madam Rambert, in which roles she was responsible for directing the company on tour.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, ''Dame Maggie Scott:: A Life in Dance'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Crisp et al., ''Ballet Rambert: Fifty Years and On'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching in Australia==
In March 1953, Scott married [[Derek Denton]], an Australian medical doctor and researcher and subsequently returned with him to Australia, which she had found so congenial on her previous visit. For the next two years she taught classes and managed the school of [[Paul Hammond (ballet dancer)|Paul Hammond]] and his wife Peggy Sager while they were on tour with the [[Edouard Borovansky|Borovansky Ballet]]. She then opened her own school in a church hall in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], a prestigious suburb of Melbourne. In the late 1950s, she participated in negotiations with the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]] that led to the formation of the [[The Australian Ballet|Australian Ballet]] in 1962 under the direction of [[Peggy van Praagh]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter, ''Dame Maggie Scott: A Life in Dance'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott then undertook planning for the foundation of the [[Australian Ballet School]], which was realized in 1964. Appointed by Van Praagh as the first director of the school, she remained in this post for 26 years, until she retired in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Ruskin, ''Invitation to the Dance: The Story of the Australian Ballet School'' (Sydney: Collins, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; During her long tenure, she exerted a powerful influence on the development of the school and its students, many of whom became remarkable dancers, choreographers, directors, and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Ruskin, "A Tribute to Dame Margaret," ''Dance Australia'' (Keyesborough) 46 (February-March 1990), pp. 23, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marilyn Rowe]], celebrated ballerina and former director of the Australian Ballet School, and [[Graeme Murphy]], former director of the Sydney Dance Company and internationally known choreographer, are only two of Dame Maggie's successful protégés.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Winkler, "Dancing through Life," ''The Age'', website, http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/20/1095651237495.html. Retrieved 28 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related activities==
During her years as director and administrator of the Australian Ballet School, Scott also choreographed several ballets, notably ''Recollections of a Beloved Place'', set to music by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], for Ballet Victoria in 1975. She expanded her activities in the performing arts as representative of Australia on the Council of the World Dance Alliance, as a jurist at international ballet competitions in Moscow, and as leader of a group of teachers at ballet companies in Beijing and Shanghai. During the 1990s, Dame Margaret returned to the stage on a number of occasions. In 1990, she danced as Aunt Sophy in a gala performance of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', produced in her honour by Robert Ray, and she showed herself to be a talented actress in a non-dancing role in the play ''In the Body of the Son'' by Nicholas Rowe, presented at the [[Darwin Festival]] in 1995. Her greatest triumph, however, came in 1992, when,  at the age of 70, she appeared as Clara the Elder in ''Nutcracker: The Story of Clara'', [[Graeme Murphy]]'s imaginative reinterpretation of the Christmas classic. She repeated the role during the 1994 and 2000 seasons of the Australian Ballet.&lt;ref&gt; Potter, ''Dame Maggie Scott: A Life in Dance'' (2014), pp. 267-283.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Lee Christofis, interview, "Coming of Age: Retrieving History with Dame Margaret Scott and Valrene Tweedie, OAM," ''Brolga: A Journal about Dance'' (Braddon, A.C.T.) 13 (December 2000), pp. 46-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Scott was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in 1976, Dame Commander (DBE) in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;Notice of Margaret Scott's damehood, ''London Gazette''. website, http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/48640/supplements/38. Retrieved 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] (AC) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt; It's an Honour: AC, website, http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1135851&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true.&lt;/ref&gt;  She has been the recipient of many other honours and awards, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1989 and an award for lifetime achievement at the [[Australian Dance Awards]] in 1998. Over the years, Scott had been a part-time student of teaching methods at the [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] (RMIT), where she eventually gained a graduate diploma in visual and performing arts in 2000. She was granted an honorary degree of Doctor of Education from her alma mater in 2001. In 2007, she was the recipient of the [[JC Williamson Award|James Cassius Williamson Award]], given by Live Performance Australia in recognition of "individuals who have made an outstanding contribution in the Australian live entertainment and performing arts industry and shaped the future of the industry for the better."&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer, "Margaret Scott," Live Performance Australia, website, http://liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/margaretscott2.html. Retrieved 28 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Scott met [[Derek Denton]], a doctor at the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]], in 1947, when she and her friend [[Sally Gilmour]] went there to deliver flowers received after the triumphant opening night of Ballet Rambert. They married in 1953 and had two sons. Dr. Denton, who founded the [[Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health]], is considered one of Australia's greatest scientific minds. After their marriage, he continued to publish his research into the nature of consciousness in animals, and she remained actively engaged in the dance world.&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, "Dancing through Life," ''The Age'', website, http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/20/10956512337495.html.. Retrieved 28 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in life, she established the Dame Margaret Scott Fund for Choreography, which assisted the creation of [[Alexei Ratmansky]]'s surrealistic ''Cinderella'', an outstanding success that played to sold-out houses in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Staff writers, "Dame Maggie: Ballet Legend," Behind Ballet, website, http://www.behindballet.com/dame-maggie-ballet-legend. Retrieved 28 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also had significant input into the choreographic initiatives of the Australian Institute of Classical Dance. She is the subject of a biography by [[Michelle Potter]], ''Dame Maggie Scott: A Life in Dance'' (2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8287">'''The McMullen Naval History Symposium''' is a biennial international academic conference held at the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] devoted to the history of the world's navies.  It has become the "largest regular meeting of naval historians in the world"&lt;ref&gt;[[John B. Hattendorf]], "Foreword," in Craig C. Felker and Marcus O. Jones, ''New Interpretations in Naval History: Selected Papers from the Sixteenth Naval History Symposium, ... 2009'', (Newport: Naval War College Press, 2012), p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as the U.S. Navy's "single most important interaction with [an] academic historical audience"&lt;ref&gt;John B. Hattendorf, "The Uses of Maritime History in and for the Navy," ''Naval War College Review'', vol. LVI, no. 2 (Spring 2003), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This regular biennial series of symposia began as the U.S. Naval Academy Naval History Symposium. The first regular symposium was held in Annapolis on 27–28 April 1973, following a successful 1971 conference that had been conceived as an annual event and on a smaller scale with limited, invited participation. In 1977 for the Third Symposium, the Naval Academy History Department decided to expand the concept and model it along the lines of the academic conferences sponsored by the [[American Historical Association]] and the [[Organization of American Historians]]&lt;ref&gt;William B. Cogar, "Foreword," ''Naval History: The Seventh Symposium of the U.S. Naval Academy'' (Wilmington DE: Scholarly Resources, 1988), p. xi,&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference that had been planned to open on 12 September 2001 was abruptly cancelled by the attacks that occurred in New York and Washington, D.C., on [[September 11, 2001]] and left the future of the conference in grave doubt. It took four years for the Naval Academy's leadership to approve the resumption of the conference on a biennial schedule, but with strong support the series resumed with the Fifteenth Conference in 2007.  Facilitating this, in 2006 the U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Foundation granted funds from the estate of Bill Daniels and the McMullen Seapower Lecture gift funds to support the symposium and to name it the McMullen Naval History Symposium in memory of Dr. [[John McMullen (engineer)|John J. McMullen]], Naval Academy Class of 1940, a naval architect, engineer, and sports club owner. Dr McMullen is also commemorated through a keynote McMullen Seapower lecture given at the symposium by the holder of the [[Class of 1957 Distinguished Chair of Naval Heritage]].

The symposium has shown strength and growth in recent years. Despite the economic recession, more than two-hundred participants from seventeen countries attended the 2009 symposium.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Felker, "Preface", ''New Interpretations in naval History'' ... 10–11 September 2009, (Newport; Naval War College Press, 2012), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011 symposium had over 250 in attendance over 125 papers presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navyhistory.org/2012/08/call-for-papers-2013-mcmullen-naval-history-symposium/   2013 Call for Papers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fellowships==
In 2009, the McMullen Seapower Fellowship was established for U.S Naval Academy faculty members to research, write, and deliver Seapower lectures at the biennial naval history symposium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usna.edu/History/_files/documents/finalprogramnhs2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panyaden International School''' is an international [[bilingual]] school for both [[preschool]] (nursery and kindergarten) and primary children south of [[Chiang Mai]] (north Thailand). The school was founded to deliver a [[holistic education]] that integrates [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purifymind.com/ResponsibilityLives.htm |title=Practical Buddhism: taking responsibility for our lives |publisher=Purifymind.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Environmentally friendly|green]] awareness with the International Primary Curriculum (IPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalprimarycurriculum.com/ |title=Home |publisher=The International Primary Curriculum |date= |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.panyaden.ac.th Panyaden School] was certified as an [[international school]] using the British curriculum alongside the IPC in August 2016. All other elements, such as [[Thai language]] and [[Culture of Thailand|culture]], remain the same.

Panyaden International School is registered with the Thai Ministry of Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.moe.go.th/ |accessdate=May 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304010229/http://www.en.moe.go.th/ |archivedate=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its curriculum is taught in both Thai (50 percent) and English (50 percent) from nursery to Year 6/7 (the end of primary school). Each class has a Thai teacher and fluent English-speaking teacher.

===Kindergarten===
The kindergarten curriculum focuses on the development of four areas: physical, emotional, moral/social, and intellectual through activity and play-based learning.

===Primary===
The primary school curriculum integrates Buddhist principles and green awareness with the International Primary Curriculum (IPC) which emphasizes learning through experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wondertime.go.com/learning/article/choosing-a-preschool_2.html |title=Parenting &amp;#124; Babble |publisher=Wondertime.go.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the National Curriculum for England framework developing enquiring minds and independent thinking.

The school uses a subject integration approach that supports deeper understanding of each subject and the natural interconnectivity between them. It stimulates the ability to look at situations and problems from different angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seameo.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=91 |accessdate=May 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923104443/http://www.seameo.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=91|title=Thailand: National Education System |archivedate=September 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional "life skills" classes cover topics such as valuing nature, healthy eating, and respect for others and give opportunities to practise core subjects through a variety of methods and activities.

==Teaching staff==
The staff consists of both Thai and native English teachers from Canada, the US, Australia, and the UK.

==Architecture==
The school is an example for [[Sustainable architecture|eco-friendly architecture]] and as such it has received both local as well as international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design Awards for Panyaden School|url=http://www.panyaden.ac.th/blog/design-awards-for-panyaden-school/|website=Panyaden School|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings that make up the school fall into two categories. The classrooms and offices were built with load bearing walls made of [[rammed earth]] which carry bamboo roofs, cladding as well as structural elements. Due to the high [[thermal mass]] of rammed earth walls, temperature variations are moderated, thus eliminating the need for air conditioning. In addition, rammed earth walls keep humidity at specific levels which are ideal for [[asthma]] sufferers. The several open pavilions (which are called ''[[Sala (architecture)|sala]]'' in Thai) that house the assembly hall, the Buddhist chapel, the school canteen, and a covered play area next to the swimming pool, are completely made out of [[bamboo]], also using bamboo set on large boulders of natural stone for the structural supports. ''24H Architecture'' from the [[Netherlands]] was responsible for the initial design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/undulating-bamboo-panyaden-school-in-thailand-teaches-kids-about-green-living/ |title=Undulating Bamboo Panyaden School In Thailand Teaches Kids About Green Living &amp;#124; |work=Inhabitat |date= |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dearchitect.nl/projecten/2011/27/chiang-mai-24h-architecture-school/chiang-mai-24h-architecture-school.html |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711071631/http://www.dearchitect.nl/projecten/2011/27/chiang-mai-24h-architecture-school/chiang-mai-24h-architecture-school.html|title=Panyaden School in Chiang Mai, Thailand |archivedate=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arquitecturasdeterra.blogspot.com/2011/02/rammed-earth-in-panyaden-schooltailand.html |title=Arquitecturas de Terra: Rammed Earth in Panyaden School Tailand |publisher=Arquitecturasdeterra.blogspot.com |date=2006-07-11 |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lecourrierdelarchitecte.com/article_3216 |title=Le Courrier de l'Architecte &amp;#124; Panyaden School (Thaïlande), une histoire de terre et de bambou |publisher=Lecourrierdelarchitecte.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/145859/panyaden-school-24h-architecture/ |title=Panyaden School / 24H &gt; architecture |publisher=ArchDaily |date=2011-06-27 |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the construction and subsequent designs of additional buildings by Chiangmai Life Construction.

Also in adherence to the concepts behind [[sustainable architecture]], [[waste water]] is treated before its re-entry into the environment, and [[food waste]] is recycled to produce [[biogas]] for cooking in the school kitchen, and as [[organic fertilizer]] for use on the school grounds. To minimise the need for artificial lighting, skylights are incorporated into the roofs of the buildings.

The '''Paradise Papers''' are a set of 13.4&amp;nbsp;million confidential electronic documents relating to [[offshore investment]]s that were leaked to the German reporters [[Frederik Obermaier]] and [[Bastian Obermayer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-a-german-newspaper-became-the-go-to-place-for-leaks-like-the-paradise-papers|title=How a German Newspaper Became the Go-To Place for Leaks Like the Paradise Papers|last=Zerofsky|first=Elisabeth|date=2017-11-11|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-12-12|issn=0028-792X|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223090008/https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-a-german-newspaper-became-the-go-to-place-for-leaks-like-the-paradise-papers|archivedate=23 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the newspaper'' [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]''.

==Background==
On 20 October 2017, an anonymous [[Reddit]] user hinted at the existence of the Paradise Papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|url=https://qz.com/1120925/paradise-papers-reddit-user-hinted-at-data-leak-16-days-before-news-broke|title=A Reddit user hinted at Paradise Papers 16 days before they leaked|date=6 November 2017|work=Quartz|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106105209/https://qz.com/1120925/paradise-papers-reddit-user-hinted-at-data-leak-16-days-before-news-broke|archivedate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ) approached the [[Offshore financial centre|offshore]] law firm [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]] with allegations of wrongdoing. Appleby said that some of its data had been stolen in a [[cyberattack]] the previous year, and denied the ICIJ's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodgson|first=Camilla |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/financial-secrets-of-super-rich-stolen-offshore-appleby-2017-10|title=Panama Papers 2?

Appleby stated the firm "was not the subject of a leak but of a serious criminal act" and that "this was an illegal computer hack". "Our systems were accessed by an intruder who deployed the tactics of a professional hacker", the company said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/appleby-reaction-to-media-coverage.aspx|title=Appleby reaction to media coverage|publisher=Appleby|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=8 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107153505/https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/appleby-reaction-to-media-coverage.aspx|archivedate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2017/11/07/data-leak-was-criminal-act|title=Data leak was 'criminal act' |work=Jersey Evening Post|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111042447/https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2017/11/07/data-leak-was-criminal-act|archivedate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents were acquired by the German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', which had also obtained the [[Panama Papers]] in 2016. According to the [[BBC]], the name "Paradise Papers" reflects "the idyllic profiles of many of the offshore jurisdictions whose workings are unveiled", so-called [[tax haven]]s, or "tax paradises".&lt;ref name="BBC need to know" /&gt;

The data breach comprises some 13.4&amp;nbsp;million documents—totaling about 1.4 terabytes—from two offshore service providers, Appleby and [[Asiaciti Trust]], and from the company registers of 19 tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paradise Papers|url=https://projekte.sueddeutsche.de/paradisepapers/wirtschaft/answers-to-pressing-questions-about-the-leak-e574659|work=Süddeutsche Zeitung|access-date=6 November 2017|date=5 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106132311/https://projekte.sueddeutsche.de/paradisepapers/wirtschaft/answers-to-pressing-questions-about-the-leak-e574659|archivedate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' journalists contacted the ICIJ, which has been investigating the documents with 100 media partners.

===Apple===
{{main|Leprechaun economics}}
A great deal of the company's [[intangible property]] was exposed around the time of an internal [[Apple Inc.]] reorganization of three [[Ireland|Irish]] subsidiaries. The company's 2015 [[gross domestic product]] showed a 26% increase, and close to $270&amp;nbsp;billion of [[intangible asset]]s suddenly appeared in Ireland as the year began – more than the entire value of all residential property in Ireland. This may indicate that Apple took advantage of a tax incentive known as a capital allowance, which gives Irish companies generous tax breaks for buying intangible property – essentially intellectual property like patents. In other words, Apple (some suggest) transferred them to a subsidiary located in Ireland for the tax incentives, and didn't have to pay any tax on the transaction in Bermuda either, on the value it declared on the property when it sold them to itself.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Following a 2013 US Senate investigation, which featured testimony by CEO [[Tim Cook]], Ireland announced that henceforth Irish companies would be required to declare [[tax residency]] somewhere in the world. Apple had been paying a lower rate of corporate taxes in Ireland in a so-called sweetheart deal. This attracted the attention of EU regulators as many multinationals were doing the same thing. As the tax break in the Netherlands came to a scheduled end, Apple's law firm, Baker McKenzie, researched island tax havens, asking Appleby officials in numerous jurisdictions to confirm "that an Irish company can conduct management activities ... without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction." Two of the subsidiaries moved to [[Jersey]] and took intellectual property with them{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The third is receiving tax breaks in Ireland for buying Apple IP from another Apple subsidiary{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) issued a Statement re Apple on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jerseyfsc.org/media/1596/2017-11-07_jfsc_statement_re_apple.pdf|title=Jersey Financial Services Commission Statement re Apple|publisher=JFSC|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JFSC confirmed that the two Apple subsidiaries referred to by the media are not Jersey-registered companies and their understanding is that Apple funds relating to these entities have not been remitted to or held in the Island.

The JFSC states that it has not seen any of the documentation that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) claims to hold following the Appleby data breach. If the ICIJ possesses data of a criminal or regulatory nature which relates to business activities in Jersey then the JFSC requested that this information is shared with them and, if there is any evidence of regulatory wrongdoing, then they would investigate and take action if appropriate.

The Government of Jersey (States of Jersey) also issued a statement of similar effect on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.je/News/2017/Pages/ApplebyStatement.aspx|title=Jersey Government Appleby Data Breach Statement|publisher=States of Jersey|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is of further note that the jurisdiction of Jersey has recently been independently assessed as fully compliant with international regulatory guidelines on tax transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/jersey/global-forum-on-transparency-and-exchange-of-information-for-tax-purposes-jersey-2017-second-round-9789264283824-en.htm|title=OECD Jersey Report 2017|publisher=OECD|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU, under the leadership of [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], threatened to sue Ireland over its tax deals, although Juncker himself had approved similar tax deals in his own country, [[Luxembourg]]. Apple paid all of its taxes in Ireland as required by that country so Ireland is appealing the EU decision. HP, Nike, Microsoft and others use the same tax arrangements in Ireland, Luxembourg and other countries,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} but Apple is frequently cited as a media example.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of public corporations by market capitalization#2017]]&lt;/ref&gt; Irish companies are required to pay taxes in Ireland, but if they convince authorities {{Which|date=February 2018}} that they are "managed and controlled" from abroad, the companies may win an exemption.

=== Avianca ===
[[Germán Efromovich]], founder of [[Synergy Group]], is linked to an offshore conglomerate used for the aerocommercial [[holding business]] with ramifications in Bermuda, Panama, and Cyprus. Efromovich used a Panamanian offshore that hid more than 20 firms located in tax havens. The conglomerate was used by Synergy Group's subsidiary [[Avianca Holdings]] in the purchase of MacAir Jet, now [[Avianca Argentina]], aircraft company owned by Macri Group, for an amount of $10&amp;nbsp;million. Allowing Avianca to make headway in the [[low-cost carrier]] business in Argentina. The Argentine government accepted this offshores as a financial [[guarantee]] to assign air routes to Avianca. The whole operation of assigning air routes is investigated by the Argentine federal justice system in a case called "Avianca" in which the [[President of Argentina]] [[Mauricio Macri]] and other officials were imputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 November 2017|last1=Delfino|first1=Emilia|last2=Crucianelli|first2=Sandra|last3=Fitz Patrick|first3=Mariel|last4=Brom|first4=Ricardo|last5=Jastreblansky|first5=Maia|last6=Ruiz|first6=Iván|last7=Alconada Mon|first7=Hugo|title=Paradise Papers – El entramado de más de 20 offshores detrás del desembarco de Avianca|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-el-entramado-de-mas-de-20-offshores-detras-del-desembarco-de-avianca.phtml|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110143321/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-el-entramado-de-mas-de-20-offshores-detras-del-desembarco-de-avianca.phtml|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Kremlin-owned firm]], [[VTB Bank]], put $191&amp;nbsp;million into DST Global, an investment firm part of [[Mail.ru]] Group and founded by Russian billionaire [[Yuri Milner]], which used it to buy a large share of [[Twitter]] in 2011. A subsidiary of the Kremlin-controlled [[Gazprom]] funded an investment company that partnered with DST Global to buy shares in [[Facebook]], reaping millions when the social media giant went public in 2012. Twitter similarly went public in 2013. The US government sanctioned VTB in 2014 because of the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian military intervention in Crimea]], but DST Global had by then sold its stake in Twitter. Four days after the Facebook [[IPO]], a DST Global subsidiary sold more than 27&amp;nbsp;million shares of Facebook for approximately $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=FBTwit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/kremlin-owned-firms-linked-major-twitter-facebook-investments-icij/|title=Kremlin-Owned Firms Linked To Major Investments In Twitter And Facebook: The Russian government quietly held a financial interest in U.S. social media|author=Spencer Woodman|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011238/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/kremlin-owned-firms-linked-major-twitter-facebook-investments-icij/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glencore ===
&lt;!-- some of this should go to the main page with an even more distilled version here. This is my best first pass at summarizing the several news stories though --&gt;
In 2009, [[Glencore]], an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company, loaned $45&amp;nbsp;million to Israeli billionaire [[Dan Gertler]] in exchange for his help with officials of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in negotiations over a [[joint venture]] with state-owned [[Gécamines]] at the [[Katanga Mining|Katanga copper mine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gertler, Dan (DGI Group): Rough and Polished: Information and Analytics on Diamond and Jewellery Markets|date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ben Doherty|author2=Oliver Zihlmann|publisher=Guardian|date=5 November 2017|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/the-inside-story-of-glencore-hidden-dealings-in-drc|title=The inside story of Glencore's hidden dealings in the DRC|accessdate=8 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106060148/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/the-inside-story-of-glencore-hidden-dealings-in-drc|archivedate=6 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current DRC president, [[Joseph Kabila]], the son of [[Laurent Kabila]], who sold Congolese diamond rights to Gertler, then used the proceeds to take power in a ''[[coup d'état|coup]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

One of the Katanga board members was Glencore major shareholder [[Telis Mistakidis]], a former employee whose [[stock options]] made him a billionaire in the IPO. Glencore, which had effectively taken over Katanga, agreed to vote for the joint venture. The loan document specifically provided that repayment would be owed if agreement was not reached within three months. Gertler and Glencore each have denied wrongdoing. Appleby had worked for Glencore and its founder [[Marc Rich]] on major projects in the past, even after his indictment in 1983.&lt;ref name=glencore&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|title=Revealed: Glencore's secret loan to secure DRC mining rights|author1=Ben Doherty|author2=Oliver Zihlmann|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/revealed-glencore-secret-loan-drc-mining-rights-paradise-papers|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106023739/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/revealed-glencore-secret-loan-drc-mining-rights-paradise-papers|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=room&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/|author1=Bastian Obermayer|author2=Edouard Perrin|author3=Frederik Obermaier|author4=Oliver Zihlmann|author5=Petra Blum|author6=Will Fitzgibbon|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|title=Room Of Secrets Reveals Glencore's Mysteries: Law firm's internal files reveal oil, mineral and grain trader Glencore signed secret deals and loaned millions to a high-risk business partner.|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106000453/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich was indicted in the United States on federal charges of [[tax evasion]] and making controversial oil deals with Iran during the [[Iran hostage crisis]].&lt;ref name="KingofOil"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Daniel Ammann|Ammann, Daniel]]|title=[[The King of Oil: The Secret Lives of Marc Rich]]|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|year=2009|isbn=0-312-57074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bill Clinton pardon controversy|controversial presidential pardon]] from [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on 20 January 2001, Clinton's last day in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/may/13/features.magazine37 |title=Profile: Marc Rich &amp;#124; From the Observer &amp;#124; The Observer |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=30 October 2012 |first=Mark |last=Honigsbaum |date=13 May 2001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204000206/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/may/13/features.magazine37 |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate ICIJ project found that tax auditors in [[Burkina Faso]] accused a Glencore subsidiary of deducting from its taxes "fictitious" payments to other Glencore subsidiaries, and of selling the zinc from its mine (to another Glencore compary) in unrefined form to minimize its revenue, which it publicly said in 2015 had not recovered from a 2017 downturn. Its CEO told shareholders before this that it expected a spike in demand, which did materialize. The mine is owned by Nantou Mining SA, which is owned by Merope Inc, a Bermuda shell company set up by Appleby with directors provided by the firm. Glencore sold Merope in April 2017 but before that it was 100% owned by Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd, which was, according to a document from the Paradise Papers leaks, 100% owned by Glencore Group Funding Ltd of the [[United Arab Emirates]], an entity in turn 100% owned by Swiss firm Glencore International AG, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore plc, registered in [[Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Burk&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|title=Development Dreams Stand Still While Mining Money Moves Offshore|author=Will Fitzgibbon|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=12 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061248/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents were also discovered discussing Glencore's desire to keep its substantial stake in SwissMarine a secret, and that although the subsidiary's annual report showed [[revenues]] of $1.9 billion in 2014, Glencore does not mention it in its disclosures to the [[London Stock Exchange]] or any other public filing because, it said, it did not consider this a significant investment.&lt;ref name=Swiss&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org//paradise-papers/glencores-hush-hush-swissmarine-fleet/|title=The Ships Glencore Wanted To Keep 'Hush Hush'|publisher=ICIJ|date=9 November 2017|accessdate=12 November 2017|author=Will Fitzgibbon}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian branch of Glencore has been demonstrated to have carried out some $25&amp;nbsp;billion in [[Interest rate swap|cross-currency interest rate swaps]], complex financial instruments the [[Australian Taxation Office]] suspects of being used to avoid paying taxes in Australia.&lt;ref name=GlencoreATO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/glencore-australian-arm-moved-billions-through-bermuda|title=Glencore's Australian Arm moved Billions Through Bermuda: Paradise Papers reveal use of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which are under investigation by the tax office|author=Ben Doherty|publisher=The Guardian|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106024102/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/glencore-australian-arm-moved-billions-through-bermuda|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nike ===
Appleby documents detail how Nike boosted its after-tax profits by, among other maneuvers, transferring ownership of its Swoosh [[trademark]] to a Bermudian subsidiary, Nike International Ltd. This transfer allowed the [[subsidiary]] to charge [[royalties]] to its European headquarters in [[Hilversum]], [[Netherlands]], effectively converting taxable company [[profit (accounting)|profits]] to an account payable in tax-free Bermuda.&lt;ref name=Nike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=How NikeStays One Step Ahead of the Regulators: When One Tax Loophole Closes, Another Opens|author=Simon Bowers|publisher=ICIJ|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011937/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the subsidiary was effectively run by executives at Nike's main offices in [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Oregon – to the point where a duplicate of the Bermudian company's seal was needed – for tax purposes the subsidiary was treated as based in Bermuda. Its profits were not declared in Europe and came to light only because of a mostly unrelated case in [[US Tax Court]], where papers filed by Nike briefly mention royalties in 2010, 2011 and 2012 totaling $3.86&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Nike /&gt; Under an arrangement with Dutch authorities, the tax break was to expire in 2014, so another reorganization transferred the intellectual property from the Bermudian company to a Dutch ''commanditaire vennootschap'' or limited partnership, Nike Innovate CV.

Dutch law treats income earned by a CV as if it had been earned by the principals, who owe no tax in the Netherlands if they do not reside there. One in six dollars of foreign [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] earned by US multinationals was earned, at least on paper, through a Dutch CV subsidiary. Companies with similar structures include [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[NetApp]] and [[Uber (company)|Uber]].&lt;ref name=Nike /&gt;

=== Odebrecht ===
Appleby managed 17 offshore companies for [[Odebrecht]], a Brazilian conglomerate, and at least one of them was used as a vehicle for paying bribes in the [[Operation Car Wash]]. Some of these offshore companies are publicly known to operate for Odebrecht in Africa and be involved in bribes. Among those involved in the operation who also are named in the papers are [[Marcelo Odebrecht]], Brazilian businessman and former Odebrecht' CEO, his father Emílio Odebrecht and his brother Maurício Odebrecht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delfino|first1=Emilia|title=Paradise Papers: Salen a la luz 17 offshore de Odebrecht y al menos una se usó para sobornos|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salen-a-la-luz-17-offshore-de-odebrecht-y-al-menos-una-se-uso-para-sobornos.phtml|accessdate=9 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=8 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108203827/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salen-a-la-luz-17-offshore-de-odebrecht-y-al-menos-una-se-uso-para-sobornos.phtml|archivedate=8 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PokerStars ===
Appleby and various banks in the [[Isle of Man]], including [[Conister Bank]] which is owned by [[Arron Banks]] and [[Jim Mellon]], had business with [[PokerStars]] and its founders, [[Mark Scheinberg]] and his father [[Isai Scheinberg]], until it was sold for $4.9&amp;nbsp;billion in 2014 to [[The Stars Group]], formerly known as Amaya.

The papers show that the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], a private estate of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], held investments in two [[offshore financial centre]]s, the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Bermuda]]. Both are [[British Overseas Territories]] of which she is monarch, and nominally appoints governors. Britain handles foreign policy for both islands to a large extent, but Bermuda has been self-governing since 1620. The Duchy's investments included [[First Quench Retailing]] off-licences and [[rent-to-own]] retailer [[BrightHouse (retailer)|BrightHouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osborne|first1=Hilary|title=Revealed: Queen's private estate invested millions of pounds offshore|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/revealed-queen-private-estate-invested-offshore-paradise-papers|publisher=''The Guardian''|access-date=5 November 2017|date=5 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105190200/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/revealed-queen-private-estate-invested-offshore-paradise-papers|archivedate=5 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour Party Leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] posited whether the Queen should apologize, saying anyone with money offshore for tax avoidance should "not just apologise for it, [but] recognise what it does to our society". A spokesman for the Duchy said that all of their investments are audited and legitimate and that the Queen voluntarily pays taxes on income she receives from Duchy investments.&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41883472|publisher=BBC|title=Paradise Papers: Queen should apologise, suggests Corbyn|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107042716/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41883472|archivedate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appleby has taken legal action against ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the ''[[BBC]]'' and this is widely seen as an attack on [[press freedom]].

Argentine Finance Minister [[Luis Caputo]] managed at least two [[Offshore bank|offshore]] [[Wealth management|wealth funds]].&lt;ref name=perfil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salpico-al-gobierno-de-macri-el-ministro-luis-caputo-manejo-inversiones-en-islas-caiman.phtml|title=Paradise Papers salpicó al Gobierno de Macri: el ministro Luis Caputo manejó inversiones en Islas Caimán|work=Peril|date=5 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105215607/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salpico-al-gobierno-de-macri-el-ministro-luis-caputo-manejo-inversiones-en-islas-caiman.phtml|archivedate=5 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither firm, the [[Cayman Islands]]–based Alto Global Fund, nor its [[Miami]]-based parent company Noctua Partners LLC, were listed in Caputo's financial disclosure statement, a statement that all public officials and candidates for office are required to make.&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt; Caputo is a first cousin of local industrialist and construction tycoon Nicolás Caputo, best friend of Argentine President [[Mauricio Macri]]. He told Argentine members of the ICIJ team that "it was an investment fund for friends and family."&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt; The funds, opened in 2009 and with over $100&amp;nbsp;million under management, remained under Caputo's management until December 2015, when Macri named him Finance Secretary, a post upgraded to Finance Minister this January.&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt;

Argentine Energy Minister [[Juan José Aranguren]] managed two offshore companies, Shell Western Supply and Trading Limited and Sol Antilles y Guianas Limited, both subsidiaries of [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. One is the main bidder for the purchase of diesel oil by the current government through the state owned CAMMESA (Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico).&lt;ref name="perfil1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aranguren: su paso por una offshore de Shell a la que el Estado le compró gasoil por US$ 150 M|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-aranguren-su-paso-por-una-offshore-de-shell-a-la-que-el-estado-le-compro-gasoil-por-us-150-m.phtml|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=7 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107155244/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-aranguren-su-paso-por-una-offshore-de-shell-a-la-que-el-estado-le-compro-gasoil-por-us-150-m.phtml|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the papers, Argentine hotelier and real estate developer [[Alan Faena]] was director and CEO of half a dozen companies in the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[British Virgin Islands]]. Faena also appears with bank accounts in [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Isle of Man]], linked to different hotels and real estate projects in [[Puerto Madero]]. In the offshore firms he was associated with different investors such as Soviet-born British-American businessman [[Leonard Blavatnik]]; American billionaire [[J. Christopher Burch]] and his brother Robert Burch; American business and media executive [[John Augustine Hearst]]; and French designer [[Philippe Starck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alan Faena, otro argentino en Paradise Papers|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/alan-faena-otro-argentino-en-paradise-papers-firmas-offshore-y-cuentas-en-suiza-y-luxemburgo.phtml|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=7 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107213019/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/alan-faena-otro-argentino-en-paradise-papers-firmas-offshore-y-cuentas-en-suiza-y-luxemburgo.phtml|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maggi told Brazilian outlet ''Poder360'' that he was not a direct beneficiary of the company and he had never received money from it.

[[Henrique Meirelles|Henrique de Campos Meirelles]], the current Brazilian Minister of Finance, told ''[[Poder360]]'' that he does not report income from his Sabedoria Foundation because it was set up to perform charitable functions after his death and therefore he receives no income from it.&lt;ref name=explore /&gt;

President of [[Colombia]] (2010–2018) [[Juan Manuel Santos]] is mentioned in the investigation. He was part of two offshore societies.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2017/11/05/59ff586f22601dea7f8b460c.html Juan Manuel Santos, el yerno de Trump y la reina Isabel II, implicados en los Paradise Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108023135/http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2017/11/05/59ff586f22601dea7f8b460c.html |date=8 November 2017 }}".

== Public reaction ==
In the United Kingdom, the public reaction to the Paradise Papers has been relatively muted compared to similar leaks in the past, such as the [[Panama Papers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/10/protest-paradise-papers-micah-white |title=Why aren't the streets full of protest about the Paradise Papers? |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |author=Micah White |date=10 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017 |quote=The street-level response to the Paradise Papers, the mighty follow-up punch to last year's Panama Papers, has been curiously tepid. This is probably not what many activists, and the 100 media organizations involved in the leak, expected to happen. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110124851/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/10/protest-paradise-papers-micah-white |archivedate=10 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible reasons include the absence of overt illegality in the information; most media sources are careful to point out that the schemes in the Paradise Papers are generally lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/bill-jamieson-is-it-so-bad-to-avoid-tax-within-the-law-1-4608429 |title=Bill Jamieson: is it so bad to avoid tax within the law? |publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]'' |author=Bill Jamieson |date=9 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017 |quote=Arguably most puzzling of all was the exact nature of the wrong doing. Both the Paradise Papers website and the BBC Panorama documentary ... repeatedly stressed that no laws had been broken and that UK tax due had been paid. Indeed, as the BBC documentary made clear, "the vast majority of the transactions involve no legal wrongdoing". |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109111745/http://www.scotsman.com/news/bill-jamieson-is-it-so-bad-to-avoid-tax-within-the-law-1-4608429 |archivedate=9 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement on behalf of Queen Elizabeth confirmed that the Royal Estate paid full UK tax on her offshore investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41878305|title=Paradise Papers: Queen's private estate invested £10m in offshore funds|publisher=BBC News|author=|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011244/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41878305|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other public comments by notable popular public figures who appeared in the Papers may also play a part; Bono stated "I've been assured by those running the company that it is fully tax compliant, but if that is not the case, I want to know as much as the tax office does, and so I also welcome the audit they have said they will undertake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bono-paradise-papers-u2-tax-offshore-investment-guernsey-malta-shopping-mall-statement-latest-a8044541.html |title=Paradise Papers: Bono says he welcomes investigation into offshore investment |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |author=Roisin O'Connor |date=9 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108213035/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bono-paradise-papers-u2-tax-offshore-investment-guernsey-malta-shopping-mall-statement-latest-a8044541.html |archivedate=8 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Peat has suggested that much of the media has ignored the story of the Paradise Papers because those media organisations are owned by individuals implicated in the papers, such as ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' owners [[Barclay brothers|David and Frederick Barclay]], ''[[Daily Mail]]'' owner [[Jonathan Harmsworth]], and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' owner [[Rupert Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peat |first=Jack |date=7 November 2017 |title=This is why there's been so little media coverage of the Paradise Papers |url=https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/theres-little-media-coverage-paradise-papers/07/11/ |work=The London Economic |access-date=12 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113113109/https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/theres-little-media-coverage-paradise-papers/07/11/ |archivedate=13 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the leak, more than 30 [[Members of the European Parliament]] issued an open letter criticizing the British government for failing to take action against the offshore tax industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Hilary|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|title=Britain criticised by MEPs for failing to take action on tax havens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/10/britain-criticised-meps-action-tax-havens-paradise-papers|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110143004/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/10/britain-criticised-meps-action-tax-havens-paradise-papers|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gavin St Pier]], an elected Deputy of the tax haven [[Guernsey]], stated that the "coverage was part of a well-orchestrated, ongoing campaign".&lt;ref name=GStP&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/38e99534-c48e-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675 |title=Paradise Papers shake Britain's offshore tax havens |publisher=''Financial Times'' |author=Vanessa Houlder |date=8 November 2017 |accessdate=8 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109172213/https://www.ft.com/content/38e99534-c48e-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675 |archivedate=9 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also averred that despite having the information since 2016, the timing of the release was deliberately delayed to coincide with the meeting of EU Finance Ministers ahead of the proposed discussion of a tax haven blacklist.&lt;ref name=GStP /&gt;

Commenting on the Paradise Papers leak, United States Senator and 2016 presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] warned of "rapid movement toward international oligarchy", saying, "The Paradise Papers shows how these billionaires and multinational corporations get richer by hiding their wealth and profits and avoid paying their fair share of taxes."&lt;ref name=Sanders&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/06/bernie-sanders-paradise-papers-leak-international-oligarchy|title=Bernie Sanders warns of 'international oligarchy' after Paradise Papers leak|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106190738/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/06/bernie-sanders-paradise-papers-leak-international-oligarchy|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] leader in the US Senate, [[Chuck Schumer]], and the ranking Democratic member of the Senate finance committee, [[Ron Wyden]], issued a joint statement accusing Republicans of "pushing a reform of the tax code that fails to close egregious loopholes revealed by the leaks."&lt;ref name=Sanders /&gt;

==Litigation==
On 18 December 2017 it was reported that Appleby had issued legal proceedings against the BBC and ''The Guardian'' for [[Breach of confidence in English law|breach of confidence]].  The BBC and ''The Guardian'' said they would "vigorously" defend the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42403700|title=BBC and Guardian sued over Paradise Papers leaks|publisher=BBC News|date=18 December 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221174814/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42403700|archivedate=21 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appleby released a media statement to explain the necessity to seek legal action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/appleby-takes-legal-action.aspx|title=Appleby Media Statement|publisher=States of Jersey|date=20 December 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided subsequent update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/why-appleby-is-taking-legal-action-against-the-guardian-and-the-bbc.aspx|title=Appleby Media Statement|publisher=States of Jersey|date=26 January 2018|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' and the BBC settled the dispute with Appleby in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tobitt |first=Charlotte |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/guardian-and-bbc-settle-paradise-papers-dispute-with-offshore-law-firm-appleby/ |title=Guardian and BBC settle Paradise Papers dispute with offshore law firm Appleby |work=Press Gazette |date=22 May 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, Swiss-based multinational [[Glencore]] lodged a writ with the Australian High Court to prevent the use of Paradise Papers documents by the Australian Taxation Office in any legal action against the miner. Glencore asserted that the documents in question are subject to legal professional privilege. Glencore’s writ has four plaintiffs: Glencore International AG (an intermediate holding company resident in Switzerland), Glencore Investment Pty Ltd (a company incorporated in Australia), Glencore Australia Holdings Pty Ltd (a company incorporated in Australia) and Glencore Investment Holdings Australia Ltd (a company incorporated in Bermuda).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/finance/news/glencore-seeks-injunction-against-tax-commissioner-to-prevent-use-of-paradise-papers/ar-BBNRXEJ|title=Glencore seeks injunction against tax commissioner to prevent use of Paradise Papers|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 October 2018|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Password Hashing Competition''' was an open competition announced in 2013 to select one or more [[key  derivation function|password hash functions]] that can be recognized as a recommended standard. It was modeled after the successful [[Advanced Encryption Standard process]] and [[NIST hash function competition]], but directly organized by cryptographers and security practitioners. On 20 July 2015, [[Argon2]] was selected as the final PHC winner, with special recognition given to four other password hashing schemes: [[Catena (cryptography)|Catena]], [[Lyra2]], [[yescrypt]] and [[Makwa (cryptography)|Makwa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://password-hashing.net "Password Hashing Competition"]
&lt;/ref&gt;

One goal of the Password Hashing Competition was to raise awareness of the need for strong password hash algorithms, hopefully avoiding a repeat of previous password breaches involving weak or no hashing, such as the ones involving

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">The '''Quality Reform''' was a [[reform]] initialized by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]] after recommendation from the ''[[Ole Danbolt Mjøs|Mjøs]] committee'' (1998–2000). It was introduced in 2002–03 and changed the entire system of [[higher education in Norway]] to comply with the [[Bologna process]]. This process is intended to take place throughout Europe to better integrate the higher educations systems, and Norway is among the first to implement this process. The Norwegian approach was a quick and brutal removal of the old system and replacement to the new instantly.

The main changes included a switch from the old system of Latin degrees to the international [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]], [[Master's degree|Master]] and [[Philosophiae Doctor]] degrees. This replaced the former system of three and a half or four year [[cand.mag.]] degrees followed by one and a half or two year ''hovedfag'' degrees. The system abolished many old master-level degree titles, including [[cand.scient.]] (sciences), [[cand.polit.]] (social sciences), [[cand.philol.]] (humanities), [[cand.oecon.]] (economics), [[cand.agro.]] (agronomy), [[cand.jur.]] (law), [[cand.theol.]] (theology), ''[[sivilingeniør]]'' (engineering) and ''[[siviløkonom]]'' (management). The length varied, and depended on the area of study, ranging from four to six years. The [[cand.psychol.]] (clinical psychology), [[cand.med.]] (medicine) and [[cand.med.vet.]] titles have been retained as six-year studies in [[clinical psychology]], [[medicine]] and [[veterinary medicine]]. All master-level titles are now awarded as [[Master of Science]], [[Master of Technology]] or [[Master of Philosophy]], all taking five years.

Other changed included replacing the former number scale (from 1.0 to 4.0) [[grade (education)|grades]] to A to F letter scale, reducing the number of passing grades from 41 to five. It also changed the former system credits of ''vekttall'' (with nominal 10 ''vekttall'' per semester) to the [[European Credit Transfer System]] (ECTS) with nominal 30 credits per semester. The reform set new requirements to the follow-up on students, forcing universities and colleges to spend more resources per credit, specially on demands related to assignments.

Established in 1963, the '''Ralph R. Teetor Educational Award''' recognizes and honors those young educators who are successfully preparing engineers for meeting the challenges that face society. Reflecting the firm belief of its donor that engineering educators are the most effective link between engineering students and their future careers, the SAE [[Ralph Teetor]] Educational Fund's major program is focused on younger engineering educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralph R.

'''Richard E. Mayer''' (born 1947) is an [[United States|American]] [[educational psychology|educational psychologist]] who has made significant contributions to theories of [[cognition]] and learning, especially as they relate to [[problem solving]] and the design of educational [[multimedia]]. Mayer's best known contribution to the field of educational psychology is [[multimedia learning theory]], which posits that optimal [[learning]] occurs when visual and verbal materials are presented together simultaneously. He is the year 2000 recipient of the [[E. L. Thorndike Award]] for career achievement in educational psychology, and the winner of 2008 Distinguished Contribution of Applications of Psychology to Education and Training Award from the [[American Psychological Association]]. He was ranked #1 as the most productive educational psychologist in the world for 1997-2001.&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Educational Psychology, vol. 28, pp.&amp;nbsp;422–430&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of more than 390 publications including 23 books on education and multimedia. He received a PhD in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Michigan]] (1973), and served as a [[Visiting scholar|Visiting Assistant Professor]] of Psychology at [[Indiana University]] from 1973-1975. Mayer is Professor of Psychology at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB) where he has served since 1975.

[[File:Scientific citations.png|thumb|Reference section in scientific paper.]]
'''Scientific [[citation]]''' is providing detailed reference in a scientific publication, typically a [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|paper]] or book, to previous published (or occasionally private) communications which have a bearing on the subject of the new publication. The purpose of citations in original work is to allow readers of the paper to refer to cited work to assist them in judging the new work, source background information vital for future development, and acknowledge the contributions of earlier workers. Citations in, say, a review paper bring together many sources, often recent, in one place.

To a considerable extent the quality of work, in the absence of other criteria, is judged on the number of citations received, adjusting for the volume of work in the relevant topic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} While this is not necessarily a reliable measure, counting citations is trivially easy; judging the merit of complex work can be very difficult.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Previous work may be cited regarding experimental [[Procedure (term)|procedures]], apparatus, [[goal]]s, previous theoretical results upon which the new work builds, [[theses]], and so on. Typically such citations establish the general [[wikt:framework|framework]] of [[wikt:influence|influences]] and the [[mindset]] of [[research]], and especially as "part of what science" it is, and to help determine who conducts the [[peer review]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Disciplined citation of prior works in mathematics and science is known at least as far back as [[Euclid]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Late in the first millennium, [[Islamic scholar]]s developed their practice of [[isnad]], or "backing", which established the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of sayings of [[Muhammad]] in the [[hadith]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The [[Asharite]] school of [[early Muslim philosophy]] extended this into [[fiqh]] or [[jurisprudence]], while the [[Mutazilite]] school used the traditional methods and applied them to [[Islamic science|science]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In some form, then, achieving authority for new work by citing accepted authorities is a near-universal idea among the peoples of the [[Mediterranean]], whose educated people were exposed to one or other of these practices well before the European [[Renaissance]] and the emergence of the formal [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Patent references==
In [[patent law]] the citation of previous works, or [[prior art]], helps establish the [[uniqueness]] of the [[invention]] being described.  The focus in this practice is to claim [[originality]] for [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes, and so the author is motivated to avoid citing works that cast doubt on its originality.  Thus this does not appear to be "scientific" citation. Inventors and lawyers have a legal obligation to cite all relevant art; not to do so risks invalidating the patent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The patent examiner is obliged to list all further prior art found in searches.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Citation frequency==
Modern scientists are sometimes judged by the number of times their work is cited by others—this is actually a key indicator of the relative [[impact factor|importance]] of a work in science.  Accordingly, individual scientists are motivated to have their own work cited early and often and as widely as possible, but all other scientists are motivated to eliminate unnecessary citations so as not to devalue this means of [[judgment]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} A formal [[citation index]] tracks which referred and reviewed papers have referred which other such papers. [[Baruch Lev]] and other advocates of [[accounting reform]] consider the number of times a [[patent]] is cited to be a significant metric of its quality, and thus of [[innovation]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''''Secular Homeschooling''''' was an [[United States|American]] magazine for people who [[homeschool]] for reasons other than religion. It began as a quarterly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicole Faires|title=The Whole Homeschool Catalog|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QOuLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=15 December 2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-0-557-04649-2|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became a bimonthly in July 2009. The magazine is no longer published and the final issue was released in 2011.

Because the magazine was written (and, presumably read) by people who consider religious belief a personal matter rather than a prerequisite of homeschooling, it might be seen as reflecting the diversity of the homeschooling community.&lt;ref name="Home Education Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Secular Homeschooling |url=http://www.homeedmag.com/979/secular-homeschooling/|work=Home Education Magazine |accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a specifically non-religious magazine, ''Secular Homeschooling'' discussed some topics differently from other homeschooling magazines. For example, one article discussed the particular difficulties of discussing and dealing with death for the non religious. In the article "The Most Difficult Subject", the author writes that death is, to religious families "less threatening as a concept, it’s also much more frequent and natural a subject of conversation and thought" because some of their religious beliefs focus on death (Jesus' death and resurrection, for example).

The magazine occasionally ran humor as well. One piece, "The Bitter Homeschooler's Wish List" – "a wish list from one homeschooler to other parents who ask annoying and inappropriate questions about the decision to homeschool"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What one homeschooler wants other parents to know |url=http://blog.syracuse.com/family/2008/01/what_one_homeschooler_wants_ot.html|work=Syracuse|accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; – has been described as a "legendary Internet screed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confessions of a home-schooler|url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2009/09/28/confessions_homeschooler/index2.html|work=Salon|accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list bitterly points out that not all homeschoolers are religious or homeschool for religious reasons, and that homeschoolers of all types tire of being criticized.

The '''Senior Secondary Certificate of Education''' (SSCE) is the graduation certificate awarded to most students in Australian [[high school]]s, and is equivalent to the [[Advanced Placement|Advance Placement]] in [[North America]] and the GCE [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Students completing the SSCE are usually aged 16 to 18 and study full-time for two years (years 11 and 12 of schooling). In some states adults may gain the certificate through a [[Technical and Further Education]] college or other provider.

The curriculum, assessment and name of the SSCE is different in each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]]. The government of each determines these themselves, although the curriculum must address mutually agreed national competencies.

[[Universities Australia]] generates a nationally standardised final score for each SSCE exam student called the [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]] (ATAR). Universities and other [[Higher Education]] providers typically use this mark as the main criterion in selecting domestic students. Most States and Territories in Australia uses the ATAR system with the exemption of Queensland. Queensland has its own ranking system called [[Overall Position]] (OP).

'''''The Stanford Prison Experiment''''' is a 2015 American [[thriller film]] directed by [[Kyle Patrick Alvarez]], written by Tim Talbott, and starring [[Billy Crudup]], [[Michael Angarano]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Keir Gilchrist]], [[Olivia Thirlby]], and [[Nelsan Ellis]]. The plot concerns the 1971 [[Stanford prison experiment]], conducted at [[Stanford University]] under the supervision of psychology professor [[Philip Zimbardo]], in which students play the role of either a prisoner or prison guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zimbardo.socialpsychology.org/ |title=Philip G. Zimbardo |author=Philip G. Zimbardo |date=January 17, 2013 |publisher=Social Psychology Network |accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was announced in 2002 and remained in development for twelve years, with filming beginning on August 19, 2014, in [[Los Angeles]]. The film was financed and produced by Sandbar Pictures and Abandon Pictures, and premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 26, before beginning a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] on July 17, 2015. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
[[Stanford University]] psychology professor [[Philip Zimbardo]] conducts a [[Stanford prison experiment|psychological experiment]] to test the hypothesis that the personality traits of prisoners and guards are the chief cause of abusive behavior between them. In the experiment, Zimbardo selects fifteen male students&lt;!-- Nine prisoners and six guards; this apparently differs from the real experiment. --&gt; to participate in a 14-day prison simulation to take roles as prisoners or guards. They receive $15 per day. The experiment is conducted in a mock prison located in the basement of Jordan Hall, the university's psychology department building. The students who are guards become abusive, as does Zimbardo himself, as they immerse themselves in their assigned roles. Two students who play the role of prisoners quit the experiment early due to psychological meltdowns, and, only after being chastised and roughly brought back to reality by his girlfriend, [[Christina Maslach]], Zimbardo abruptly stops the entire experiment after only six days.

==Production==
A film about the [[Stanford prison experiment]] was first announced in 2002, when producer Brent Emery signed Tim Talbott to write the script for the film. Problems beset and delayed the project for twelve years, including financing and the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike|2007 writers' strike]].&lt;ref name="thewrap-development" /&gt; In 2006, two competing films about the experiment were in development, one at [[Maverick Films]] and the other Inferno's ''[[The Experiment (2010 film)|The Experiment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DiOrio|first1=Carl|title=Stanford pics in stand-off|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/stanford-pics-stand-141105|accessdate=September 12, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maverick Films, having an ownership break up in August 2008, continued on as [[Imprint Entertainment]].

==Reception==
[[File:Kyle Patrick Alvarez at Sundance 2015.jpg|thumb|Director [[Kyle Patrick Alvarez]] at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]]]]
Upon its premiere at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]], ''The Stanford Prison Experiment'' received a positive response from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a "certified fresh" rating of 83%, based on reviews from 90 critics, with an average score of 6.9/10. The site's consensus states: "As chillingly thought-provoking as it is absorbing and well-acted, ''The Stanford Prison Experiment'' offers historical drama that packs a timelessly relevant punch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Stanford Prison Experiment (2015)| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_stanford_prison_experiment|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the review site [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-stanford-prison-experiment|title=The Stanford Prison Experiment|work=Metacritic|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Felperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a positive review, writing "For all its flaws it's a rich, thought-provoking film which, while challenging, is not without humor and visual pleasures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=‘The Stanford Prison Experiment': Sundance Review| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/stanford-prison-experiment-sundance-review-767468|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Smith of the ''[[New York Post]]'' felt that "Tim Talbott's dense script provides much to discuss and argue about, providing both left and right with talking points."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thriller ‘The Stanford Prison Experiment’ will give you chills| url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/27/thriller-the-stanford-prison-experiment-will-give-you-chills/|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Hoffman of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film four out of five stars and judged that "Director Kyle Patrick Alvarez deserves all the praise in the world for the way he cranks up this pressure cooker script."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sundance 2015 review – The Stanford Prison Experiment: notorious behaviour test becomes masterful film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/30/sundance-2015-review-the-stanford-prison-experiment|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Douglas in his review for ComingSoon praised the film, remarking "While this is going to be a polarizing and divisive film, it's one that people will talk about after seeing it, almost as if it was made as an experiment itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sundance Film Festival Diary – Day 5| url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/403479-sundance-film-festival-diary-day-5#2|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' criticized the film, saying "The combination of relentless forward drive and gruesomely fastidious detail, while audacious and admirable in theory, begins to pay dwindling returns in a picture that feels rather longer than its 122-minute running time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sundance Film Review: ‘The Stanford Prison Experiment’| url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-the-stanford-prison-experiment-1201415952/|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5436">'''Tutor expertise in adult education''', through the use of content and process experts, is important in the successful delivery of [[adult education]]. Each has a specific role and a particular set of attributes which they bring to the [[classroom]]. Content experts are those who are well acquainted with the subject. Either through years of practical experience or involvement with research, these individuals fully understand the topic they are discussing.&lt;ref&gt;Maudsley, G., BMJ 1999, 318:657-661&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the process expert is trained in the art of teaching. These individuals have a working knowledge of the subject for discussion but they will also have a concrete knowledge of facilitation and how to direct the student to assess their knowledge gaps and seek out answers on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Davis,W.K., Nairn,R., Paine, M.E., Anderson, R.M. and Oh, M.S., Academic Medicine 67(1992):470-474&lt;/ref&gt; Tutors may be totally content focused, totally process focused or some combination of the two, bringing with them prior personal and professional experience.

==Process experts==
The work of [[Malcolm Knowles]] discusses which type of tutor is better suited to address the needs of adult learners.  Knowles work assumes basic concepts about adult learners:
*Adult learners are independent and self-directing
*They have accumulated experience which is a resource for learning
*They value learning that integrates with the demands of their daily life 
*They are more interested in problem centered approaches than subject centered ones
*They are more often internally motivated rather than externally motivated.

[[Gerald Grow]] developed the [[Staged Self Directed Learning Model]] (SSDLM) as a tool to assist teachers to help learners work toward more self-directed learning. [[Phillip Candy]] also studied ways to assist learners to be self-directed. Process experts would be guided by these educational theorists.

==Content experts==
[[File:Computer in tuition centre.JPG|thumb|link=http://11plustutorsinessex.co.uk/|Computer based learning at a tuition centre]]
Research on the topic of content expertise has been done in the field of medical education. Traditionally, medical education was delivered in large lecture format by content experts. In the 1960s, [[Problem-based learning]] was first introduced at [[McMaster University]] in [[Ontario, Canada]]. Problem-based learning involves small groups working within a tutorial system. Students are encouraged to brainstorm within the group and generate questions based on the scenario they are working on. Problem-based learning fosters [[self-directed learning]], with the teacher taking on a new role as a facilitator, using their expertise only subtly and sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;Maudsley, G. BMJ 1999; 318:657-661&lt;/ref&gt; This style of learning is built on [[collaborative learning work]] theory. Students with a common interest are encouraged to reflect, share their thoughts with their peers and develop analytical thinking and communication skills during the process.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, M. and Wilkerson, L., Academic Medicine. 66 (1991) : 298-300&lt;/ref&gt; The break from the true collaborative approach is in having an authority figure present.

Supporters of the truly collaborative approach feel that there is no need for that authority to be a content expert.  However, studies conducted at several medical schools across Canada, the USA and Europe dispute this idea. For example, in an analysis of student performance following small group experiences with experts and non expert tutors, students at the [[University of Michigan Medical School]] rated their experiences with content experts significantly higher than those led by non-experts. They felt that even though an expert tutor may ask the same questions as a non-expert tutor, that the expert was more inclined to ask the questions at the most opportune time and was better able to reframe the question in a way that was more valuable to the students. Ultimately, the students who were assigned to the groups led by content experts scored significantly higher on their final exam.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, W.K. et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, conducted at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, it was determined that expert tutors use their knowledge to ask more effective questions and are better equipped to keep the groups from floundering.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, D.M. and Holmes,D.B., Medical Education 1998, 32:255-261&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the question of whether a process expert can adequately assess student progress and determine when intervention is optimal and beneficial.

==Effectiveness==
While ongoing debate and research on this topic continues, several common threads have evolved and opinions on the effectiveness of this approach include: 
 
*Effective tutors for self-directed learning are those who only make appropriate interruptions.
*Effective tutors need content expertise coupled with facilitation training. 
*The tutor's challenge is to avoid dispensing facts. 
*The effective tutor needs to be empathetic to student needs and capable of motivation.
Given these determinants, one dares to ask if the issue is actually content expertise versus process expertise or rather what is the minimum requirement of each component which would produce the most effective tutor? &lt;ref&gt;Albanese, M.A., Medical Education 2004; 38:916-920&lt;/ref&gt;

'''University of Economics in Bratislava''' ({{lang-sk|Ekonomická univerzita v Bratislave}}) is the oldest university of economics in [[Slovakia]].

==History==

The university was established in 1940 as a private university under the name 
'''Vysoká obchodná škola v Bratislave''' (College of Commerce in Bratislava), because of the situation in German-occupied [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] where college and universities were closed down, where also many Slovak students were studying. It was nationalized in 1945 and renamed to ''Slovenská vysoká škola obchodná'' (Slovak College of Commerce). It was renamed again in 1949 to ''Vysoká škola hospodárskych vied'' (College of Business / Economic Sciences) and once again in 1952 to ''Vysoká škola ekonomická'' (College of Economics). The current name is used since 1992.

'''Walter Adolph Georg Gropius''' (18 May 1883 – 5 July 1969) was a German [[architect]] and founder of the [[Bauhaus]] School,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/b/bauhaus Bauhaus], [[Tate|The Tate Collection]], retrieved 18 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; who, along with [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], is widely regarded as one of the pioneering masters of [[modernist architecture]].  Gropius was also a leading architect of the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/International-Style-architecture|title=International Style {{!}} architecture|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and early life ==
Born in [[Berlin]], Walter Gropius was the third child of Walter Adolph Gropius and Manon Auguste Pauline Scharnweber (1855–1933), daughter of the Prussian politician [[Georg Schwarnweber]] (1816-1894). Walter's uncle [[Martin Gropius]] (1824-1880) was the architect of the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin|Kunstgewerbemuseum]] in Berlin and a follower of [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], with whom Walter's great-grandfather Carl Gropius, who fought under Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]] at the Battle of Waterloo, had shared a flat as a bachelor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolf Burchard]],'"Onkel Walter": Family Memories of Walter Gropius', The Decorative Arts Society Newsletter 104 (Summer 2015): 5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Manon+Gropius+Alma 1918 (round-frame-194x194).png|thumb|left|Manon Gropius with her parents Alma Mahler and Walter Gropius, 1918]]
In 1915 Gropius married [[Alma Schindler|Alma Mahler]] (1879–1964), widow of [[Gustav Mahler]].  Walter and Alma's daughter, named [[Manon Gropius|Manon]] after Walter's mother, was born in 1916.  When Manon died of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] at age 18, in 1935, composer [[Alban Berg]] wrote his [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] in memory of her (it is inscribed "to the memory of an angel"). Gropius and Alma divorced in 1920. (Alma had by that time established a relationship with [[Franz Werfel]], whom she later married.) On 16 October 1923, Gropius married Ilse (later changed to Ise) Frank, and they remained together until his death in 1969. They adopted a daughter together, Beate Gropius, known as Ati.&lt;ref name="ARCHITECTS"&gt;[http://www.architects.org/architectureboston/articles/recollections-ati-gropius-johansen-daughter-walter-and-ise-gropius "Recollections by Ati Gropius Johansen, daughter of Walter and Ise Gropius"], ''ArchitectureBoston'', Summer 2013 issue: American Gropius (Volume 16 n2)&lt;/ref&gt; Ise Gropius died on 9 June 1983 in Lexington, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="bauhaus-online.de"/&gt;
Walter's only sister [[Manon Burchard]], née Gropius, is the great-grandmother of the German film and theater actresses [[Marie Burchard]] and [[Bettina Burchard]] and of the curator and art historian [[Wolf Burchard]].&lt;ref&gt;Deutsches Geschlechterbuch, volume 3, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career (1908–14) ==
[[File:Walter Gropius in his sergeant uniform in World War I.jpg|thumb|left|Gropius in his sergeant's uniform during World War I]]

Gropius could not draw, and was dependent on collaborators and partner-interpreters throughout his career. In school he hired an assistant to complete his homework for him. In 1908, after studying architecture in [[Munich]] and [[Berlin]] for four semesters, Gropius joined the office of the renowned architect and industrial designer [[Peter Behrens]], one of the first members of the utilitarian school.&lt;ref name="bauhaus-online.de"&gt;[http://bauhaus-online.de/en/atlas/personen/ise-gropius-frank "Ise Gropius (-Frank)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408225329/http://bauhaus-online.de/en/atlas/personen/ise-gropius-frank |date=8 April 2014 }}. bauhaus-online.de.&lt;/ref&gt;  His fellow employees at this time included [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Le Corbusier]], and Dietrich Marcks.

In 1910 Gropius left the firm of Behrens and together with fellow employee [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] established a practice in Berlin. Together they share credit for one of the seminal modernist buildings created during this period: the [[Fagus Factory|Faguswerk]] in [[Alfeld (Leine)|Alfeld-an-der-Leine, Germany]], a shoe [[last]] factory.  Although Gropius and Meyer only designed the facade, the glass curtain walls of this building demonstrated both the modernist principle that [[Form follows function|form reflects function]] and Gropius's concern with providing healthful conditions for the working class. The factory is now regarded as one of the crucial founding monuments of European modernism. Gropius was commissioned in 1913 to design a car for the Prussian Railroad Locomotive Works in Königsberg. This locomotive was unique and the first of its kind in Germany and perhaps in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, pp. 25 and 29&lt;/ref&gt;
Other works of this early period include the office and factory building for the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)]] in [[Cologne]].

In 1913, Gropius published an article about "The Development of Industrial Buildings," which included about a dozen photographs of factories and [[grain elevators]] in North America. A very influential text, this article had a strong influence on other European modernists, including [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Erich Mendelsohn]], both of whom reprinted Gropius's grain elevator pictures between 1920 and 1930.&lt;ref name="American Colossus"&gt;[http://www.american-colossus.com/ American Colossus: the Grain Elevator 1843–1943] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102080038/http://www.american-colossus.com/ |date=2 November 2009 }}, Colossus Books,
2009. american-colossus.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Gropius's career was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914. He was drafted August 1914 and served as a sergeant major at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western front]] during the war years (getting wounded and almost killed)&lt;ref name="beeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/audiointerviews/profilepages/gropiusw1.shtml|title=Walter Adolph Gropius 1883 – 1969|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104131501/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/audiointerviews/profilepages/gropiusw1.shtml|archivedate=4 November 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then as a lieutenant in the [[signal corps]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; Gropius was awarded he [[Iron Cross]] twice&lt;ref name="http://www.architectural-review.com"&gt;Paul Davies (30 April 2013) [http://www.architectural-review.com/reviews/walter-gropius/8646993.article "Walter Gropius"]. architectural-review.com.&lt;/ref&gt; ("when it still meant something," he confided to his friend Chester Nagel) after fighting for four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/03/ties-to-the-past/ "Ties to the past"]. news.harvard.edu (19 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Gropius then, like his father and his great-uncle [[Martin Gropius]] before him, became an architect.

== Bauhaus period (1919–28) ==
[[File:Bauhaus.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bauhaus]] (built 1925–26) in Dessau, Germany]]
[[File:Monument to the March dead.jpg|thumb|Walter Gropius's ''Monument to the March Dead'' (1921) dedicated to the memory of nine workers who died in Weimar resisting the [[Kapp Putsch]]]]

Gropius's career advanced in the postwar period. [[Henry van de Velde]], the master of the Grand-Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar was asked to step down in 1915 due to his [[Belgium|Belgian]] nationality. His recommendation for Gropius to succeed him led eventually to Gropius's appointment as master of the school in 1919. It was this academy which Gropius transformed into the world-famous [[Bauhaus]], attracting a faculty that included [[Paul Klee]], [[Johannes Itten]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Herbert Bayer]], [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[Otto Bartning]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. In principle, the Bauhaus represented an opportunity to extend beauty and quality to every home through well designed industrially produced objects. The Bauhaus program was experimental and the emphasis was theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, pp. 66–72&lt;/ref&gt; One example product of the [[Bauhaus]] was the armchair F 51, designed for the Bauhaus's directors room in 1920 – nowadays a re-edition in the market, manufactured by the German company TECTA/Lauenfoerde.

In 1919, Gropius was involved in the [[Glass Chain]] utopian [[Expressionist architecture|expressionist]] correspondence under the pseudonym "Mass." Usually more notable for his functionalist approach, the "Monument to the March Dead," designed in 1919 and executed in 1920, indicates that expressionism was an influence on him at that time.

In 1923, Gropius designed his famous door handles, now considered an icon of 20th-century design and often listed as one of the most influential designs to emerge from Bauhaus. Walter Gropius designed the newly constructed school building in 1925 on behalf of the city of [[Dessau]]. Gropius collaborated with Carl Fieger, [[Ernst Neufert]] and others within his private architectural practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/the-bauhaus-building-by-walter-gropius.html/ The Bauhaus Building by Walter Gropius]. bauhaus-dessau.de&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed large-scale housing projects in [[Berlin]], [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Dessau]] in 1926–32 that were major contributions to the [[New Objectivity (architecture)|New Objectivity]] movement, including a contribution to the [[Siemensstadt]] project in Berlin.

Gropius left the Bauhaus in 1928 and moved to Berlin. [[Hannes Meyer]] took over the role of Bauhaus director.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.de/en/past/people/directors/walter-gropius/ Bauhaus100. Walter Gropius] (Accessed: 6 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post Bauhaus (1933–45) ==
[[File:Walter Gropius photo Gropius house Lincoln MA.jpg|thumb|right|Gropius House (1938) in Lincoln, Massachusetts]]

The rise of Hitler in the 1930s would soon drive Gropius out of Germany. Before that, however,  he did accept an invitation in early 1933 to compete for the design of the new Reichsbank building and submitted a detailed plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/strange-bedfellows-modernists-nazis|title=Strange Bedfellows: The Modernists and the Nazis - Los Angeles Review of Books|author=|date=|website=lareviewofbooks.org|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of the English architect [[Maxwell Fry]], Gropius was able to leave [[Nazi Germany]] in 1934, on the pretext of making a temporary visit to Italy for a film propaganda festival; he then fled to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to avoid the fascist powers of Europe. He lived and worked in the artists' community associated with [[Herbert Read]] in [[Hampstead]], London, as part of the [[Isokon]] group with Fry and others for three years, before moving on to the [[United States]] with his family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Gowing]], ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.2 (Facts on File, 2005): 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Gropius and his second wife, Ise Gropius, arrived in the [[United States]] in February 1937, while their twelve-year-old daughter, Ati, finished the school year in England.&lt;ref name="historicnewengland.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100709232912/http://www.historicnewengland.org/historic-properties/homes/Gropius%20House/gropius-house-history Gropius House History]. Historic New England&lt;/ref&gt; Though built in 1938, the Gropiuses believed their house could embody architectural qualities similar to those practiced today, such as simplicity, economy, and aesthetic beauty.&lt;ref name="historicnewengland.org"/&gt; In designing his house, Gropius used the approach developed at the Bauhaus. The house the Gropiuses built for themselves in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]], [[Massachusetts]] (now known as [[Gropius House]]), was influential in bringing [[International Modernism]] to the U.S., but Gropius disliked the term: "I made it a point to absorb into my own conception those features of the New England architectural tradition that I found still alive and adequate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/gropiushouse/ Gropius House by Walter Gropius]. galinsky.com&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Storrow, a banker's wife and philanthropist, became Gropius's benefactor when she invested a portion of her land and wealth for the architect's home. She was so satisfied with the result that she gave more land and financial support to four other professors, two of whom Gropius designed homes for. With the Bauhaus philosophy in mind, every aspect of the homes and their surrounding landscapes was planned for maximum efficiency and simplicity. Gropius's house received a huge response and was declared a National Landmark in 2000.&lt;ref name="ncmodernist.org"&gt;[http://www.ncmodernist.org/gropius.htm "Walter Gropius"]. ncmodernist.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gropius and Seidler by Dupain 1954.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gropius with [[Harry Seidler]] in Sydney, 1954]]
Gropius and his Bauhaus protégé [[Marcel Breuer]] both moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (1937–1952)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~art00032 |accessdate=13 January 2017 |title=Gropius, Walter, 1883-1969. Papers, 1930-1972: A Guide |publisher=Harvard University }}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborate on projects including [[The Alan I W Frank House]] in Pittsburgh and the company-town Aluminum City Terrace project in [[New Kensington]], Pennsylvania, before their professional split. In 1938 he was appointed Chair of the Department of Architecture, a post he held until his retirement in 1952.&lt;ref name="http://www.britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/246573/Walter-Gropius/2889/Harvard-years "Walter Gropius"]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Gropius also sat on the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) Visiting Committee at the end of his career. The well-known architect designed the Richards and Child residence halls on the Harvard campus that were built in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="www.gsas.harvard.edu"&gt;[http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/current_students/gsas_residence_halls.php/ "GSAS Residence Halls"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427211927/http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/current_students/gsas_residence_halls.php/ |date=27 April 2014 }}. gsas.harvard.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

In 1946, Gropius founded the young architects' association, [[The Architects' Collaborative]] (TAC), a manifestation of his lifelong belief in the significance of teamwork, which he had already successfully introduced at the [[Bauhaus]]. Based in [[Cambridge]] with a group of younger architects, which the original partners included [[Norman C. Fletcher]], [[Jean B. Fletcher]], [[John C. Harkness]], [[Sarah P. Harkness]], [[Robert S. MacMillan]], Louis A. MacMillen, and [[Benjamin C. Thompson]]. One work produced by this office is the Graduate Center of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge]] (1949/50).&lt;ref name="http://bauhaus-online.de"&gt;[http://bauhaus-online.de/en/atlas/personen/walter-gropius "Walter Gropius"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401100516/http://bauhaus-online.de/en/atlas/personen/walter-gropius |date=1 April 2014 }}. bauhaus-online.de.&lt;/ref&gt; TAC would become one of the most well-known and respected architectural firms in the world. TAC went bankrupt in 1995.

In 1967, Gropius was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1968.

== Death ==
Gropius died on July 6, 1969, in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], aged 86. Walter Gropius was diagnosed with an illness that consisted of an inflammation of the glands, and was admitted to the hospital on 7 June. After a necessary operation performed on 15 June ended successfully there was hope of a full recovery. Gropius described himself as a "tough old bird" and continued to make progress for about a week. His lungs became congested and could not supply proper amounts of oxygen to the blood and brain and he lost consciousness and died in his sleep early Sunday morning.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Today, Gropius is remembered not only by his various buildings but also by the district of [[Gropiusstadt]] in Berlin. In the early 1990s, a series of books entitled [[The Walter Gropius Archive]] was published covering his entire architectural career. The CD audiobook ''Bauhaus Reviewed 1919–33'' includes a lengthy English Language interview with Gropius.

Upon his death his widow, Ise Gropius, arranged to have his collection of papers divided into early and late papers. Both parts were photographed with funds provided by the [[Fritz Thyssen Foundation|Thyssen Foundation]]. The late papers, relating to Gropius's career after 1937, and the photos of the early ones, then went to the [[Houghton Library]] at Harvard University; the early papers and photos of the late papers went to the Bauhaus Archiv, then in [[Darmstadt]], since reestablished in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gropius, Walter, 1883–1969.

The Gropius house was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988 and is now available to the public for tours.&lt;ref name="ncmodernist.org"/&gt;

[[Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv]] in the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]] recognizes the greatest concentration of Bauhaus buildings in the world.

In 1959 he received the [[AIA Gold Medal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2461">'''Wardell Baxter Pomeroy''' (December 6, 1913 &amp;ndash; September 6, 2001) was an [[United States|American]] [[sexologist]] and co-author with [[Alfred C. Kinsey]].

==Biography==
Pomeroy was born in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]].  He graduated from [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] (BA, 1935; MA, 1942) and earned a Ph.D. in [[psychology]] in 1954 from [[Columbia University]].  While working as a [[psychologist]] in an Indiana state hospital, he met Kinsey and came to work on his seminal sex-research project.  Pomeroy personally recorded approximately 6,000 sexual histories.  He was co-author with Kinsey on the landmark books ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' (1948) and ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'' (1953).  He went into the private practice of sex therapy in [[New York City]] in 1963 and wrote books about adolescent sexuality for popular consumption.  In 1976, he became dean of the [[Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality]] and an adjunct professor at [[California Medical School]] and [[California State University at Northridge]].  Pomeroy retired due to declining health in 1983 and died in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] of [[Lewy body dementia]].

Pomeroy was portrayed in the 2004 theatrical film ''[[Kinsey (film)|Kinsey]]'' by [[Chris O'Donnell]].

'''William Ward''' (1769–1823) was an [[England|English]] pioneer [[Baptist]] [[missionary]], author, printer and translator. On 10 May 1802 he was married at Serampore to the widow of [[John Fountain]], another missionary, by whom he left two daughters.

==Early life==
Ward was born at [[Derby]] on 20 October 1769, and was the son of John Ward, a carpenter and builder of that town, and grandson of Thomas Ward, a farmer at [[Stretton, Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire|Stretton]], near [[Burton upon Trent|Burton]] in [[Staffordshire]]. His father died while he was a child, and the care of his upbringing fell to his mother. He was placed with a schoolmaster named Mr Congreve, near Derby, and afterwards with another named Mr Breary.

On leaving school he was apprenticed to a Derby printer and bookseller Mr Drewry, with whom he continued two years after the expiry of his indentures, assisting him to edit the [[Derby Mercury]]. He then removed to [[Stafford]], where he assisted Joshua Drewry, a relative of his former master, to edit the [[Staffordshire Advertiser]] and in either 1794 or 1795 proceeded to Hull, where he followed his business as a printer, and was for some time editor of the [[Hull Advertiser]].

==Religion==
Ward early in life became an [[Anabaptist]], and on 26 August 1796 he was baptised at [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. Preaching constantly in the neighbouring villages, he became known as a man of promise, and, with the assistance of a member of the baptist community named Mr Fishwick, he proceeded in August 1797 to [[Ewood Hall]], near Halifax in Yorkshire, the theological academy of [[John Fawcett (theologian)|John Fawcett]] (1740–1817), where he studied for a year and a half.

==Missionary work==
In the autumn of 1798, the baptist mission committee visited Ewood, and Ward offered himself as a missionary, influenced perhaps by a remark made to him in 1793 by [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]]  concerning the need for a printer in the Indian mission field.

Ward sailed from England in the Criterion in May 1799, in company with [[Joshua Marshman]]. On arriving at [[Calcutta]] he was prevented from joining Carey by an order from the Government, and was thereby obliged to proceed to the Danish settlement of [[Serampore]], where he was then joined by Carey.

In India, Ward's time was chiefly occupied in overseeing the community's printing press, which was used to disseminate the scriptures, once they had been translated into Bengáli, Mahratta, Tamil, and twenty-three other languages. Numerous philological works were also issued and Ward still found time to both keep a copious diary and to preach the gospel to the natives.

Until 1806, he made frequent tours amongst the towns and villages of the province, but after that year the increasing claims of the press on his time, and the extension of the missionary labours in Serampore and Calcutta, prevented him quitting headquarters. In 1812 the printing office was destroyed by fire. It contained the types of all the scriptures that had been printed, to the value of at least ten thousand pounds. The moulds for casting fresh type, however, were recovered from the débris, and with the help of friends in Great Britain the loss was soon repaired.

==Serampore College==
[[File:William Ward Used Chair - Carey Museum - Serampore College - Hooghly 2017-07-06 0764.JPG|thumb|200px|William Ward used chair at the Serampore College.]]
In 1818, Ward, having been for some time in bad health, revisited England. Here he was entrusted with the task of pleading for funds with which to endow a new college at [[Serampore College|Serampore]] which he had founded along with [[Joshua Marshman]] &amp; [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]],  for the purpose of instructing natives in European literature and science.

He undertook a series of journeys throughout England and Scotland, and also visited Holland and North Germany. In October 1820 he embarked for New York, and travelled through the [[United States]], returning to England in April 1821. On 28 May he sailed for India in the Alberta, carrying funds for Serampore College; as a result, Ward, Marshman &amp; Carey became known as the [[Serampore trio]].

==Death==
Ward died of [[cholera]] at Serampore on 7 March 1823, and was interred in the mission burial-ground.

==Written works==
Besides his sermons, Ward was also the author of:

*‘Account of the Writings, Religion, and Manners of the Hindoos,’ Serampúr, 1811, 4 vols. 4to; 5th edit., abridged, Madras, 1863, 8vo.
*‘Farewell Letters in Britain and America on returning to Bengal in 1821,’ London, 1821, 12mo; 2nd edit. 1821.
*‘Brief Memoir of Krishna-Pal, the first Hindoo, in Bengal, who broke the Chain of the Cast by embracing the Gospel;’ 2nd edit., London, 1823, 12mo.

He was also the author of several sonnets and short poems which were printed as an appendix to a memoir of him by Samuel Stennett. A portrait, engraved by R. Baker from a painting by Overton, is prefixed to the same work.
