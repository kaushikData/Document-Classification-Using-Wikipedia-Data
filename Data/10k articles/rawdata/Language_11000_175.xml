'''Anna Olsson''' (19 August 1866, [[Värmland]], [[Sweden]] - 15 February 1946, [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]], [[Illinois]]) was a [[Swedish-American]] [[author]].

== Life ==
Anna Olsson was the first daughter and oldest surviving child of [[Olof Olsson|Olof]] and Anna Lisa Olsson.&lt;ref name=acbio&gt;{{cite web|title=Anna Olsson|url=https://www.augustana.edu/x17962.xml|work=Notable Faculty|publisher=Augustana College|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, a three-year-old Olsson and her parents emigrated from [[Värmland]], [[Sweden]]. They settled in [[Lindsborg, Kansas]], where Olof Olsson served as pastor. She would later use many experiences from her childhood on the prairie in her publications. Olsson's father accepted a professorship at [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College and Theological Seminary]] in 1876, and the family moved to Rock Island, Illinois. Olsson returned to Lindsborg in order to attend [[Bethany College (Kansas)|Bethany Academy]] in 1882 and 1883.&lt;ref name=ac_findingaid&gt;{{cite web|title=Olof Olsson Family Papers|url=http://www.augustana.edu/SpecialCollections/resources/finding%20aids/MSS3.html|work=Special Collections Finding Aids|publisher=Augustana Special Collections|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1883, Olsson reunited with her family in Rock Island and enrolled at Augustana College. She studied German language and literature, and was interested in philosophy. She earned her B.A. in 1888, and was only the second women to graduate from the college.&lt;ref name="hist of swedes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boaden|first1=Ann|title=An Augustana Day: women in the early years|url=http://www.augustana.edu/x19867.xml|website=Augustana College|publisher=Augustana College|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olof Olsson and his children traveled abroad in Europe from 1889 to 1890. They spent time in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy.&lt;ref name="hist of swedes" /&gt; During this trip, Olsson continued her education in a German school and attended literature and philosophy lectures at the [[University of Zurich]].&lt;ref name=acbio /&gt; From 1896 to 1898, she studied Italian, French, and literature at Augustana College.&lt;ref name="ac_findingaid" /&gt;

In March 1887, a year before Olsson graduated from Augustana College, her mother, Anna Lisa, died. Because of this loss, Olsson had to take on many of her mother's duties as a pastor's wife.&lt;ref name=acbio /&gt; She also looked after her younger siblings and maintained the household. It was only after her siblings were older and her father had died that she was able to focus on her career as a writer.&lt;ref name=rigov&gt;{{cite web|title=Olsson House (Anna Olsson)|url=http://www.rigov.org/index.aspx?NID=1038|website=Rock Island, Illinois|publisher=City of Rock Island|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Anna Olsson split her career between teaching and writing. She returned to Lindsborg, Kansas in 1888 to teach in the Children's Department at [[Bethany College (Kansas)|Bethany Academy]].&lt;ref name=acbio /&gt; She left that position to travel Europe with her family. In 1895, Olsson accepted a position as the principal of Ladies' Hall at Augustana College. She served as principal until 1900, when she became an instructor of English at the college. Her first work, a story printed anonymously in ''Ungdomsvännen'', was published in 1901 while she was still teaching.&lt;ref name="hist of swedes" /&gt; Olsson left her position at Augustana College in 1902.

Olsson wrote both fiction and non-fiction in Swedish and English, and often used a Swedish-American dialect in her texts. Her publications, written using the pen name Aina, were mostly aimed at children.&lt;ref name=acbio /&gt; According to a report prepared in order to designate her home as a historic landmark, Olsson was "as well known as Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe for her children's books."&lt;ref name=rigov /&gt; ''En prärieunges funderingar'', the book she is best known for, is a semi-autobiographical work about her family's immigration to the United States, their years in Kansas, and her school days at Augustana College.&lt;ref name="ac_findingaid" /&gt; Olsson was also a popular contributor to Swedish and Lutheran periodicals, publishing her work in ''Ungdomsvännen'', ''Fosterlandel'', ''Prairieblomman'', ''Julrunan'', and ''Julgranan'', among others.

Olsson continued to write until her death at the age of 79 on February 15, 1946.&lt;ref name="ac_findingaid" /&gt; She and her siblings never married or had children. The home they lived in after their father's death was designated as a [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]] landmark in 1996.&lt;ref name=rigov /&gt;

'''Bislish'''  is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[Visayan languages|Bisaya]]'' and ''[[Philippine English|English]]'', which refers to any of the [[Visayan languages]] of the [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippines]] [[Macaronic language|macaronically]] infused with [[Philippine English|English]] terms. It is an example of [[code mixing]]. An example of Bislish as spoken in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]-speaking areas would be, "Tired na jud&lt;ref name="gyud pronunciation"&gt;''Gyud'' is pronounced as either {{IPA|[dʒud]}}, {{IPA|[ɡjud]}}, or {{IPA|[ɡud]}}. In informal communications, it is also occasionally written as ''g&amp;#146;ud'' (often ''gud'' or ''jud'')&lt;/ref&gt; ko my friend, how far pa house nimo?" which means "I am so tired already my friend. How far is your house?". Another example in [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]-speaking areas is "Lagaw kita at the park, magkit-anay ta sa friends naton didto.", which means "Let's stroll at the park, we'll meet our friends there."

A '''crime boss''', '''crime lord''', '''mob boss''', '''kingpin''', or '''Don''', is a person in charge of a [[criminal organization]]. A boss typically has absolute or nearly absolute control over their subordinates, is greatly feared by their subordinates for their ruthlessness and willingness to take lives to exert their influence, and profits from the criminal endeavors in which their organization engages.&lt;ref&gt;Pistone, Joseph D. ''The Way of the Wiseguy: The FBI's Most Famous Undercover Agent Cracks the Mob Mind.'' Philadelphia: Running Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7624-2384-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;Manning, George A. ''Financial Investigation and Forensic Accounting.'' Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8493-2223-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups may only have as little as two ranks (a boss and his soldiers). Other groups have a more complex, structured organization with many ranks, and structure may vary with cultural background. Organized crime enterprises originating in [[Sicily]] differ in structure from those in mainland Italy. American groups may be structured differently from their European counterparts, and Latino and African American gangs often have structures that vary from European gangs. The size of the criminal organization is also important, as regional or national gangs have much more complex hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;Albanese, Jay, ''Contemporary Issues in Organized Crime.'' Monsey, N.Y.: Criminal Justice Press, 1995. {{ISBN|1-881798-04-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian Mafia==
The boss in the [[Sicilian Mafia|Sicilian]] and [[American Mafia]] is the head of the [[crime family]] and the top decision maker.  Only the boss, underboss or consigliere can initiate an associate into the family, allowing them to become a [[made man]]. The boss can promote or demote family members at will, and has the sole power to sanction murders inside and outside the family. If the boss is incarcerated or incapacitated he places an ''acting boss'' who responsible for running the crime family. When a boss dies the crime family members choose a new boss from inside the organisation.

The typical structure within the Mafia in Sicily and America is usually as follows:&lt;ref name="DeVico"&gt;DeVico, Peter J. ''The Mafia Made Easy: The Anatomy and Culture of La Cosa Nostra.'' [[Tate Publishing &amp; Enterprises|Tate Publishing]], 2007. {{ISBN|1-60247-254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Boss of all bosses – also known as the '''[[capo di tutti capi]]''' or '''godfather''', has been given by the media to the most powerful boss, although the Mafia never recognized the position itself. The highest body to decide on inter-family issues is the [[The Commission (mafia)|Commission]] (see also [[Sicilian Mafia Commission]]).
* Boss – Also known as the '''capofamiglia''', '''capo crimini''', '''representante''',  '''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]''' or '''godfather''', is the highest level in a crime family.&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeVico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raab"&gt;Raab, Selwyn. ''The Five Families: The Rise, Decline &amp; Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empire''. New York: St. Martins Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Underboss]] – Also known as the "capo bastone" in some criminal organizations, this individual is the second-in-command. He is responsible for ensuring that profits from criminal enterprises flow up to the boss, and generally oversees the selection of the caporegime(s) and soldier(s) to carry out murders.&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeVico" /&gt; The underboss may take control of the crime family after the boss's death. He keeps this position until a new boss is chosen, which in some cases was the Underboss.
* [[Consigliere]] – Also known as an advisor or "right-hand man," a consigliere is a counselor to the boss of a crime family. The boss, underboss, and consigliere constitute the "Administration."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ipsn.org/indictments/bellomo/indictment_criminal_genovese_family-2006-2-23.htm Genovese Indictment]" U.S. District Court. Southern District of New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The consigliere is third ranked in the hierarchy but does not have capos or soldiers working for him.&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeVico" /&gt; Like the boss, there is usually only one consigliere per criminal organization.&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt;
* [[Caporegime]] – Also known as a captain, skipper, capo, or "crew chief," the caporegime was originally known as a "[[capodecina]]" (captain of ten) because he oversaw only 10 soldiers. In more recent times, the caporegime may oversee as many soldiers as he can efficiently control.&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeVico" /&gt; A caporegime is appointed by the family boss to run his own ''borgata'' (regime, or crew) of ''soldato'' (soldiers). Each caporegime reports directly to the underboss, who gives him the permission to perform criminal activities. If the family needs to murder someone, the underboss normally asks a caporegime to carry out the order. The caporegime runs the day-to-day operations of his crew. The caporegime's soldiers give part of their earnings to him, and then he gives a share to the underboss. A caporegime can recommend to the underboss or boss that a recruit be allowed to join his crew as a mob associate.
* [[Soldato]] – Also known as a sgarrista, soldier, "button man," "[[made man]]", "wiseguy" or "goodfella", is the lowest level of mobster or gangster.&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeVico" /&gt; A "soldier" must have taken the [[omertà]] (oath of silence),&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeVico" /&gt; and in some organizations must have killed a person to be considered "made."&lt;ref&gt;Maas, Peter. ''Underboss: Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia.'' Paperback reissue. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1997. {{ISBN|0-06-109664-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeStefano, Anthony M. ''King of the Godfathers: Big Joey Massino and the Fall of the Bonanno Crime Family.'' New York: Kensington Publishing Corp., 2008. {{ISBN|0-8065-2874-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''picciotto'' is a low-level soldier, usually someone who does the day-to-day work of threatening, beating, and intimidating others.&lt;ref name="Nash"&gt;Nash, Robert Jay. ''World Encyclopedia of Organized Crime.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Da Capo Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-306-80535-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Associate – Also known as a "giovane d'onore" (man of honor), an associate is a person who is not a soldier in a crime family, but works for them and shares in the execution of and profits from the criminal enterprise.&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt; In Italian criminal organizations, "associates" are usually members of the criminal organization who are not of Italian descent.&lt;ref name="Nash" /&gt;

A boss will typically put up layers of insulation between himself and his men to defeat law enforcement efforts to arrest him. Whenever he issues orders, he does so either to his underboss, consigliere or capos. The orders are then passed down the line to the soldiers. This makes it difficult under most circumstances to directly implicate a boss in a crime, since he almost never directly gives orders to the soldiers.

==Mr Big==
The term '''Mr Big''' is used within [[Organized crime|the underworld]], and additionally during media reportings of persons associated with criminal activities, to refer to a leader of a body of persons functioning in the capacities of roles within [[organised crime]]. Sometimes bosses of the so-called [[Organized crime|gangland]] are referred to as being ''Mr Big'', as for example in the case of a report of the attempted assassination of an apparent leader of the [[Irish Republican Army]], a person named Alan Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sherry – [http://www.sundayworld.com/news/crimedesk/cops-foil-hit-on-mr-big Article titled: Drug lord avoids death after gardai intelligence stops attempted hit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304211904/http://www.sundayworld.com/news/crimedesk/cops-foil-hit-on-mr-big# |date=4 March 2016 }} Sundayworld Friday 23 May 2014 [Retrieved 2015-07-27]&lt;/ref&gt; The term implicitly indicates a degree of a possession of a higher intelligence of an individual.&lt;ref name="Fiona Brookman, Mike Maguire, Harriet Pierpoint, Trevor Bennett"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2F9sBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=Mr+Big+(criminology#v=onepage&amp;q=Mr%20Big%20(criminology&amp;f=false |title=Handbook on Crime |last=Fiona Brookman |last2=Mike Maguire |last3=Harriet Pierpoint |last4=Trevor Bennett |date=2010-02-01 |publisher=Routledge 1 February 2010, |isbn=9781317436751 |access-date=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term especially indicates the existence of involvement in what is known as ''big-time crime'', which would include for example [[armed robbery]], and the more organised aspects of careers within crime.&lt;ref name="Fiona Brookman, Mike Maguire, Harriet Pierpoint, Trevor Bennett" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Ridings – [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jJ7_xd0IpEAC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Gang+boss+Big+time+crime&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAmoVChMIodiI3q37xgIVy-sUCh12wwZp#v=onepage&amp;q=Gang%20boss%20Big%20time%20crime&amp;f=false Chicago to Springfield:: Crime and Politics in the 1920s] Arcadia Publishing 18 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the vernacular of underworld lexiconography within the 1940s of the United States of America, one source does not include the term as a known slang term, but does list ''Big Brains'', as referring to a [[gang]] leader.&lt;ref name="Vincent Joseph Monteleone"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nN81uyN8WmIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Vincent Joseph Monteleone|title=Criminal Slang: The Vernacular of the Underground Lingo|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. 1949|accessdate=2015-07-27|isbn=9781584773009|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Crime lords are highly popular key figures in the popular culture world.
* [[Marlon Brando]] portrayed [[Vito Corleone]], a senior Don in the Sicilian Mafia, in ''[[The Godfather]]''.
* [[Al Pacino]] is known for portraying [[Michael Corleone]] from ''The Godfather'' trilogy and [[Tony Montana]] in ''[[Scarface (1983)|Scarface]]''.
* [[James Gandolfini]] portrayed [[Tony Soprano]], a modern day Mafia Don on HBO's hit TV show ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

The '''Bunu''' (Punu) are the [[Yao people]] who speak [[Hmongic languages]]. That is, ''Bunu'' in the broad sense is a cultural rather than linguistic group. Strecker (1987) had classified [[Bu-Nao language|Bunu proper]] (Bu-Nao) as a Western (Chuanqiandian) Hmongic language, and the other Bunu (or ''Punuic'') languages—[[Younuo language|Younuo]], [[Wunai language|Wunai]] (Hm Nai), and [[Jiongnai language|Jiongnai]] (Kiong Nai)—as distinct branches of Hmongic.&lt;ref name="Strecker"&gt;Strecker, David. 1987. "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/strecker1987hmong.pdf The Hmong-Mien Languages]." In ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'', 10 , no. 2: 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Matisoff (2001) grouped all of these together in a ''Bunu'' branch of Hmongic (that is, outside Western Hmongic). Ratliff (2010) returned Bunu proper (Bu-Nao) to Western Hmongic, and moved Jiongnai to its own peripheral branch of Hmongic, but did not address Younuo or Wunai.&lt;ref name="Ratliff2010"&gt;Ratliff, Martha. 2010. ''Hmong–Mien language history''. Canberra, Australia: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao Zongwu (1997) found that Younuo, Wunai, and [[Pa-Hng language|Pa-Hng]] form a [[Bahengic languages|distinct branch]] of Hmongic.&lt;ref&gt;毛宗武, 李云兵 / Mao Zongwu, Li Yunbing. 1997. 巴哼语研究 / Baheng yu yan jiu (A Study of Baheng [Pa-Hng]). Shanghai: 上海远东出版社 / Shanghai yuan dong chu ban she.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bunu languages form a group in Chinese classification, but that is because Chinese classifications are not purely linguistic, but take into account ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/strecker1987some-addendum.pdf Wang Fushi, cited in Strecker (1987b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese speech synthesis''' is the application of [[speech synthesis]] to the Chinese language (usually [[Standard Chinese]]).  It poses additional difficulties due to the [[Chinese characters]] (which frequently have different pronunciations in different contexts), the complex [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], which is essential to convey the meaning of words, and sometimes the difficulty in obtaining agreement among native speakers concerning what the correct pronunciation is of certain [[phonemes]].

==Concatenation (Ekho and KeyTip)==
Recordings can be concatenated in any desired combination, but the joins sound forced (as is usual for simple concatenation-based [[speech synthesis]]) and this can severely affect prosody; these synthesizers are also inflexible in terms of speed and expression. However, because these synthesizers do not rely on a corpus, there is no noticeable degradation in performance when they are given more unusual or awkward phrases.

[http://e-guidedog.sourceforge.net/ekho.php Ekho] is an open source TTS which simply concatenates sampled syllables. It currently supports [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], and experimentally [[Korean language|Korean]].  Some of the Mandarin syllables have been pitched-normalised in [[Praat]].  A modified version of these is used in [http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/~ssb22/gradint Gradint]'s "synthesis from partials".

cjkware.com used to ship a product called KeyTip Putonghua Reader which worked similarly; it contained 120 Megabytes of sound recordings (GSM-compressed to 40 Megabytes in the evaluation version), comprising 10,000 multi-syllable dictionary words plus single-syllable recordings in 6 different prosodies (4 tones, neutral tone, and an extra third-tone recording for use at the end of a phrase).

==Lightweight synthesizers (eSpeak and Yuet)==
The lightweight open-source speech project [[eSpeak]], which has its own approach to synthesis, has experimented with Mandarin and Cantonese.  eSpeak was used by [[Google Translate]] from May 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2010/05/giving-voice-to-more-languages-on.html&lt;/ref&gt; until December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2010/12/listen-to-us-now.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The commercial product "Yuet" is also lightweight (it is intended to be suitable for resource-constrained environments like [[embedded system]]s); it was written from scratch in [[ANSI C]] starting from 2013.   Yuet claims a built-in [[Natural language processing|NLP]] model that does not require a separate dictionary; the speech synthesised by the engine claims clear word boundaries and emphasis on appropriate words.  Communication with its author is required to obtain a copy.&lt;ref&gt;http://sevenuc.com/en/tts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Both eSpeak and Yuet can synthesis speech for Cantonese and Mandarin from the same input text, and can output the corresponding romanisation (for Cantonese, Yuet uses [[Yale romanization of Cantonese|Yale]] and eSpeak uses [[Jyutping]]; both use [[Pinyin]] for Mandarin).  eSpeak does not concern itself with word boundaries when these don't change the question of which syllable should be spoken.

==Corpus-based==
A "corpus-based" approach can sound very natural in most cases but can err in dealing with unusual phrases if they can't be matched with the corpus.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/gradint/mistakes.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The synthesiser engine is typically very large (hundreds or even thousands of megabytes) due to the size of the corpus.

===iFlyTek===
Anhui USTC iFlyTek Co., Ltd (iFlyTek) published a [[W3C]] paper in which they adapted [[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] to produce a mark-up language called Chinese Speech Synthesis Markup Language (CSSML) which can include additional markup to clarify the pronunciation of characters and to add some prosody information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/2005/08/SSML/Papers/iFLYTech.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The amount of data involved is not disclosed by iFlyTek but can be seen from the commercial products that iFlyTek have licensed their technology to; for example, [https://archive.is/20130118112749/http://www.biderworld.com/speechplus.asp Bider's SpeechPlus] is a 1.3 Gigabyte download, 1.2 Gigabytes of which is used for the highly compressed data for a single Chinese voice.  iFlyTek's synthesiser can also synthesise mixed Chinese and English text with the same voice (e.g. Chinese sentences containing some English words); they claim their English synthesis to be "average".

The iFlyTek corpus appears to be heavily dependent on [[Chinese character]]s, and it is not possible to synthesize from [[pinyin]] alone. It is sometimes possible by means of CSSML to add pinyin to the characters to disambiguate between multiple possible pronunciations, but this does not always work.

===NeoSpeech===
There is an online interactive demonstration for NeoSpeech speech synthesis,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neospeech.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which accepts Chinese characters and also [[pinyin]] if it's enclosed in their proprietary "VTML" markup.&lt;ref&gt;for example &lt;vtml_phoneme alphabet="x-pinyin" ph="ni3hao3"&gt;&lt;/vtml_phoneme&gt;; see pages 7 and 25-27 of https://ondemand.neospeech.com/vt_eng-Engine-VTML-v3.9.0-3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mac OS===
[[Mac OS]] had Chinese speech synthesizers available up to version 9. This was removed in 10.0 and reinstated in 10.7 (Lion).&lt;ref&gt;Voice packs are automatically downloaded as needed when selected in System Preferences, Speech Settings, Text to Speech, System Voice, Customize.  Three Chinese female voices are available in the system.  One each for Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical corpus-based synthesizers (no longer available)===
A corpus-based approach was taken by [[Tsinghua University]] in SinoSonic, with the [[Harbin dialect]] voice data taking 800 Megabytes. This was planned to be offered as a download but the link was never activated. Nowadays, references to it can be found only on [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20040813054307/http://hcsi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/chinese/tts3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell Labs' approach, which was demonstrated online in 1997 but subsequently removed, was described in a monograph "Multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis: The Bell Labs Approach" (Springer, October 31, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-8027-6}}), and the former employee who was responsible for the project, Chilin Shih (who subsequently worked at the University of Illinois) put some notes about her methods on her website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722060510/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/cls/www/ Home Page: Chilin Shih] (Internet Archive link)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Square of opposition, set diagrams.svg|thumb|This diagram shows the contradictory relationships between [[categorical proposition]]s in the [[square of opposition]] of [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]].]]

In [[classical logic]], a '''contradiction''' consists of a logical incompatibility between two or more [[proposition]]s. It occurs when the propositions, taken together, yield two [[logical consequence|conclusion]]s which form the logical, usually opposite inversions of each other. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, [[Aristotle]]'s [[law of noncontradiction]] states that "One cannot say of something that it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time."

==History==
By creation of a [[paradox]], [[Plato]]'s ''[[Euthydemus (dialogue)|Euthydemus]]'' dialogue demonstrates the need for the notion of ''contradiction''. In the ensuing dialogue [[Dionysodorus (sophist)|Dionysodorus]] denies the existence of "contradiction", all the while that [[Socrates]] is contradicting him:
:"... I in my astonishment said: What do you mean Dionysodorus? I have often heard, and have been amazed to hear, this thesis of yours, which is maintained and employed by the disciples of Protagoras and others before them, and which to me appears to be quite wonderful, and suicidal as well as destructive, and I think that I am most likely to hear the truth about it from you. The dictum is that there is no such thing as a falsehood; a man must either say what is true or say nothing. Is not that your position?"
Indeed, Dionysodorus agrees that "there is no such thing as false opinion ... there is no such thing as ignorance" and demands of Socrates to "Refute me." Socrates responds "But how can I refute you, if, as you say, to tell a falsehood is impossible?".&lt;ref&gt;Dialog ''Euthydemus'' from ''The Dialogs of Plato translated by [[Benjamin Jowett]]'' appearing in: BK 7 ''Plato'': [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], editor in chief, 1952, ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'', [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Inc., [[Chicago]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== In formal logic ==
:Note: The symbol &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; ([[falsum]])&lt;!-- [[falsum]] hyperlink should redirect to the "[[False (logic)]] article... but I like the template I created so I will wait some days before correcting it :O)--&gt; represents an arbitrary contradiction, with the dual [[tee (symbol)|tee]] symbol &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; used to denote an arbitrary tautology.  Contradiction is sometimes symbolized by "O''pq''", and tautology by "V''pq''".  The turnstile symbol, &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is often read as "yields" or "proves".

In classical logic, particularly in [[propositional logic|propositional]] and [[first-order logic]], a proposition &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a contradiction [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi\vdash\bot&lt;/math&gt;. Since for contradictory &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; it is true that &lt;math&gt;\vdash\varphi\rightarrow\psi&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;\bot\rightarrow\psi&lt;/math&gt;), one may prove any proposition from a set of axioms which contains contradictions.  This is called the "[[principle of explosion]]" or "ex falso quodlibet" ("from falsity, whatever you like").

In a [[completeness (logic)|complete]] logic, a formula is contradictory if and only if it is [[unsatisfiable]].

===Proof by contradiction===
{{main|Proof by contradiction}}
For a proposition &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; it is true that &lt;math&gt;\vdash\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, i. e. that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], i. e. that it is always true, if and only if &lt;math&gt;\neg\varphi \vdash \bot&lt;/math&gt;, i. e. if the negation of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a contradiction. Therefore, a [[proof (logic)|proof]] that &lt;math&gt;\neg\varphi \vdash \bot&lt;/math&gt; also proves that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true. The use of this fact constitutes the technique of the proof by contradiction, which mathematicians use extensively. This applies only in a logic using the excluded middle &lt;math&gt;A\vee\neg A&lt;/math&gt; as an axiom.

===Symbolic representation===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Barbershop paradox]] --&gt;
In mathematics, the symbol used to represent a contradiction within a proof varies. [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf] Some symbols that may be used to represent a contradiction include ↯, Opq, &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;, ⊥, ↮, and ※; in any symbolism, a contradiction may be substituted for the truth value "[[False (logic)|false]]", as symbolized, for instance, by "0".  It is not uncommon to see [[Q.E.D.]] or some variant immediately after a contradiction symbol; this occurs in a proof by contradiction, to indicate that the original assumption was false and that its negation must therefore be true.

=== The notion of contradiction in an axiomatic system and a proof of its consistency ===
A [[consistency proof]] requires (i) an [[axiomatic system]] (ii) a demonstration that it is not the case that both the formula ''p'' and its negation ''~p'' can be derived in the system. But by whatever method one goes about it, all consistency proofs would ''seem'' to necessitate the primitive notion of ''contradiction''; moreover, it ''seems'' as if this notion would simultaneously have to be "outside" the formal system in the definition of tautology.

When [[Emil Post]], in his 1921 ''Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions'', extended his proof of the consistency of the [[propositional calculus]] (i.e. the logic) beyond that of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (PM) he observed that with respect to a ''generalized'' set of postulates (i.e. axioms) he would no longer be able to automatically invoke the notion of "contradiction" – such a notion might not be contained in the postulates:
:"The prime requisite of a set of postulates is that it be consistent. Since the ordinary notion of consistency involves that of contradiction, which again involves negation, and since this function does not appear in general as a primitive in [the ''generalized'' set of postulates] a new definition must be given".&lt;ref&gt;Post 1921 ''Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions'' in van Heijenoort 1967:272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post's solution to the problem is described in the demonstration ''An Example of a Successful Absolute Proof of Consistency'' offered by [[Ernest Nagel]] and [[James R. Newman]] in their 1958 ''[[Gödel]]'s Proof''. They too observe a problem with respect to the notion of "contradiction" with its usual "truth values" of "truth" and "falsity". They observe that:

:"The property of being a tautology has been defined in notions of truth and falsity. Yet these notions obviously involve a reference to something ''outside'' the formula calculus. Therefore, the procedure mentioned in the text in effect offers an ''interpretation'' of the calculus, by supplying a model for the system. This being so, the authors have not done what they promised, namely, ''''to define a property of formulas in terms of purely structural features of the formulas themselves''''. [Indeed] ... proofs of consistency which are based on models, and which argue from the truth of axioms to their consistency, merely shift the problem."&lt;ref&gt;boldface italics added, Nagel and Newman:109-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given some "primitive formulas" such as PM's primitives S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; V S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [inclusive OR], ~S (negation) one is forced to define the axioms in terms of these primitive notions. In a thorough manner Post demonstrates in PM, and defines (as do Nagel and Newman, see below), that the property of ''tautologous'' – as yet to be defined – is "inherited": if one begins with a set of tautologous axioms (postulates) and a [[deduction system]] that contains [[substitution (logic)|substitution]] and [[modus ponens]] then a ''consistent'' system will yield only tautologous formulas.

So what will be the definition of ''tautologous''?

Nagel and Newman create two [[mutually exclusive]] and [[Collectively exhaustive events|exhaustive]] classes K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into which fall (the outcome of) the axioms when their variables e.g. S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are assigned from these classes. This also applies to the primitive formulas. For example: "A formula having the form S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; V S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is placed into class K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if both S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are in K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; otherwise it is placed in K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;", and "A formula having the form ~S is placed in K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if S is in K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; otherwise it is placed in K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;".&lt;ref&gt;Nagel and Newman:110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagel and Newman can now define the notion of ''[[tautology (logic)|tautologous]]'': "a formula is a tautology if, and only if, it falls in the class K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; no matter in which of the two classes its elements are placed".&lt;ref&gt;Nagel and Newman:111&lt;/ref&gt; Now the property of "being tautologous" is described without reference to a model or an interpretation.

:For example, given a formula such as ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; V S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and an assignment of K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; one can evaluate the formula and place its outcome in one or the other of the classes. The assignment of K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; places ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and now we can see that our assignment causes the formula to fall into class K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus by definition our formula is not a tautology.

Post observed that, if the system were inconsistent, a deduction in it (that is, the last formula in a sequence of formulas derived from the tautologies) could ultimately yield S itself. As an assignment to variable S can come from either class K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the deduction violates the inheritance characteristic of tautology, i.e. the derivation must yield an (evaluation of a formula) that will fall into class K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. From this, Post was able to derive the following definition of inconsistency ''without the use of the notion of contradiction'':
:Definition. ''A system will be said to be inconsistent if it yields the assertion of the unmodified variable p [S in the Newman and Nagel examples].''

In other words, the notion of "contradiction" can be dispensed when constructing a proof of consistency; what replaces it is the notion of "mutually exclusive and exhaustive" classes. An axiomatic system need not include the notion of "contradiction".{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

== Philosophy ==
Adherents of the [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory of [[coherentism]] typically claim that as a necessary condition of the justification of a [[belief]], that belief must form a part of a logically non-contradictory [[system]] of beliefs.  Some [[dialetheism|dialetheists]], including [[Graham Priest]], have argued that coherence may not require consistency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=bId-cRNUWdAC&amp;dq=contradiction&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7GWw7Qk_h3&amp;sig=Od0aTst-tCcnbHDbOzpwBHssjEs&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1 In Contradiction: A Study of the Transconsistent] By Graham Priest&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pragmatic contradictions===
A pragmatic contradiction occurs when the very statement of the argument contradicts the claims it purports.  An inconsistency arises, in this case, because the act of utterance, rather than the content of what is said, undermines its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stoljar| first = Daniel| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Ignorance and Imagination | publisher = Oxford University Press - U.S.| year = 2006| location =| pages = 87| url =| doi =| isbn = 0-19-530658-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialectical materialism===

In [[dialectical materialism]]:  Contradiction—as derived from [[Hegelianism]]—usually refers to an opposition inherently existing within one realm, one unified force or object. This contradiction, as opposed to metaphysical thinking, is not an objectively impossible thing, because these contradicting forces exist in objective reality, not cancelling each other out, but actually defining each other's existence. According to Marxist theory, such a contradiction can be found, for example, in the fact that:&lt;br&gt;
: (a) enormous wealth and productive powers coexist alongside:
: (b) extreme poverty and misery;
: (c) the existence of (a) being contrary to the existence of (b).
Hegelian and Marxist theory stipulates that the [[Dialectic#Modern philosophy|dialectic]] nature of history will lead to the [[Aufheben|sublation]], or [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]], of its contradictions. Marx therefore postulated that history would logically make [[capitalism]] evolve into a [[Socialism|socialist society]] where the [[means of production]] would equally serve the [[proletariat|exploited and suffering class]] of society, thus resolving the prior contradiction between (a) and (b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sørensen -|first1=MK|title=CAPITAL AND LABOUR: CAN THE CONFLICT BE SOLVED?|date=2006|url=https://journals.aau.dk/index.php/ijis/article/download/181/121|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao Zedong's philosophical essay [[On Contradiction (Mao Zedong)|''On Contradiction'']] (1937) furthered Marx and Lenin's thesis and suggested that all existence is the result of contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm ON CONTRADICTION]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside formal logic==
[[Image:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement-en.svg|thumb|right|375px|Contradiction on [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Graham]]'s Hierarchy of Disagreement]]
[[Colloquialism|Colloquial usage]] can label actions or statements as contradicting each other when due (or perceived as due) to [[presupposition]]s which are contradictory in the logical sense.

[[Proof by contradiction]] is used in [[mathematics]] to construct [[Mathematical proof|proofs]].

The [[scientific method]] uses contradiction to falsify bad theory.

'''Dubthach maccu Lugair''' (fl. fifth century),&lt;ref&gt;also '''moccu Lugair'''; '''Dubthach Maccu Lugir''' and in later documents '''mac hui Lugair''' {{harvnb|Olden|1888|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a legendary Irish poet and lawyer who supposedly lived at the time of [[Saint Patrick|St Patrick]]'s mission in Ireland and in the reign of [[Lóegaire mac Néill]], high-king of Ireland, to which Dubthach served as Chief Poet and Brehon. In contrast to the king and his druids, he is said to have readily accepted the new religion. This event has played a major part in [[Hiberno-Latin]] and Irish sources as representing the integration of native Irish learning with the Christian faith.

==Biography==
King Lóegaire, jealous of the St. Patrick's power, had given orders that when he presented himself next at [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] no one should rise from his seat to do him honour. The next day was Easter day, and it was also a great feast with Lóegaire and his court. In the midst of their festivity, "the doors being shut as in our Lord's case, St. Patrick with five of his companions appeared among them. None rose up at his approach but Dubthach, who had with him a youthful poet named [[Fiacc the Fair|Fiacc]], afterwards a bishop. The saint upon this bestowed his blessing on Dubthach, who was the first to believe in God on that day. The ''[[Tripartite life of St. Patrick]]'' states that Dubthach was then baptised and confirmed, and Jocelyn adds that thenceforward he dedicated to God the poetic gifts he formerly employed in the praise of false gods.{{sfn|Olden|1888|p=83}}

When he had been some time engaged in preaching the gospel in [[Leinster]], St. Patrick paid him a visit. Their meeting took place at Domnach-már-Criathar, now [[Donaghmore, County Wexford|Donaghmore]], near [[Gorey]], [[county Wexford]], and St. Patrick inquired whether he had among his "disciples" any one who was "the material of a bishop, whose qualifications are enumerated in the ''[[Book of Armagh]]''". Dubthach replied he knew not any of his people save Fiacc the Fair. At this moment Fiacc was seen approaching. Anticipating his unwillingness to accept the office, St. Patrick and Dubthach resorted to a stratagem. The saint affected to be about to tonsure Dubthach himself, but Fiacc coming forward begged that he might be accepted in his place, and he was accordingly tonsured and baptised, and "the degree of a bishop conferred on him".{{sfn|Olden|1888|p=83}}

[[Edward O'Reilly (scholar)|Edward O'Reilly]], in his ''[[Irish Writers]]'', erroneously ascribes to Dubthach "an elegant hymn … preserved in the calendar of Oengus". One of the manuscripts of that work is indeed in the handwriting of a scribe named Dubthach, but he was quite a different person from Maccu Lugir. Another poem beginning "Tara the house in which lived the son of Conn", found in the ''[[Book of Rights]]'', and also assigned to him by O'Reilly, is there said to be the composition of Benen or [[Benignus of Armagh|Benignus]]. But there is a poem in the ''Book of Rights'' which is assigned to him by name. It relates to "the qualifications of the truly learned poet", and consists of thirty-two lines beginning "No one is entitled to visitation or sale of his poems".{{sfn|Olden|1888|p=83}}

There are also three other poems of his preserved in the ''[[Book of Leinster]]''. These have been published with a translation by O'Curry in his ''Manuscript Materials of Irish History''. They relate to the wars and triumphs of [[Énnae Cennsalach|Enna Cennselach]] and his son [[Crimthann mac Énnai|Crimthann]], both [[kings of Leinster]]. That these poems were written after his conversion to Christianity appears from the following: "It was by me an oratory was first built and a stone cross". The passage of greatest interest in these poems is that in which he says: "It was I that gave judgment between Lóegaire and Patrick". The gloss on this explains: "It was upon [[Nuadu Derg]], the son of Niall [brother of Lóegaire], who killed [[Odran (disciple of Saint Patrick)|Odhran]], Patrick's charioteer, this judgment was given".{{sfn|Olden|1888|p=83}}

The story is told in the introduction to the ''[[Senchus Mor]]'', By order of Lóegaire, Odhran, one of St. Patrick's followers, was killed by Nuadu in order to try whether the saint would carry out his own teaching of forgiveness of injuries. St. Patrick appealing for redress was permitted to choose a judge, and selected Dubthach, who found himself in a difficult position as a Christian administering a pagan law. "Patrick then (quoting St. Matthew 10:20) blessed his mouth and the grace of the Holy Ghost alighted on his utterance", and he pronounced, in a short poem which is preserved in the ''Senchus Mor'', the decision that "Nuadu should be put to death for his crime, but his soul should be pardoned and sent to heaven". This (it is stated) was "a middle course between forgiveness and retaliation". After this sentence "Patrick requested the men of Ireland" to come to one place to hold a conference with him. The result was the appointment of a committee of nine to revise the laws. It was composed of three kings, three bishops, and three professors of literature, poetry, and law. Chief among the latter was Dubthach.{{sfn|Olden|1888|pp=83–84}}

It became his duty to give an historical retrospect, and in doing so Dubthach exhibited "all the judgments of true nature which the Holy Ghost had spoken from the first occupation of this island down to the reception of the faith. What did not clash with the word of God in the written law and in the New Testament and with the consciences of believers was confirmed in the laws of the brehons by Patrick and by the ecclesiastics and chieftains of Ireland. This is the ''Senchus Mor''." It was completed 441 AD, and is supposed to have been suggested by the revision of the Roman laws by [[Theodosius the younger]]. It was put into metrical form by Dubthach as an aid to memory, and accordingly the older parts appear to be in a rude metre. The work was known by various names, ''[[The Law of Patrick]]'', ''Noifis'', or ''The Knowledge of Nine'', but more generally as the ''Senchus Mor''.{{sfn|Olden|1888|p=84}}

==Hagiographical traditions==
Dubhtach is placed by hagiography with his nephew, [[Saint Fiacc]] of Sletty, and the [[jurist]], Erc, at the court of Loegaire when Patrick visited [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]. O'Reilly's account states-
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When St. Patrick had come to Tara and was preaching before King Loegaire, we are told that the only one who rose on the saint's approach and respectfully saluted him was Dubhthach, the king's poet, who was the first to embrace the Christian faith in that place; and as Joceline says, "being baptized and confirmed in the faith, he turned his poetry, which in the flower and prime of his studies he employed in praise of false gods, to a much better use; changing his mind and style, he composed more elegant poems in praise of the Almighty Creator and His holy preachers."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The descendants of Dubhtach and Fiacc, who the tale says were converted, were blessed by this demonstration of respect. He is at a later date given to have been present on the occasion Patrick made Fiacc a bishop.

==Seanchas Mar==
Dubhthach gave a judgement against King Loegaire for killing Patrick's charioteer, [[Odran (disciple of Saint Patrick)|Saint Odran]]. A result of this was the revision of the laws of the [[pagan]] Irish to bring them in line with Christian values. Dubhtach was one of the nine who revised the laws. What accorded with Christianity was kept, what did not was excised.

==Surviving poems==
Four poems ascribed to Dubhtach are extant; one in the [[Book of Rights]], three in the [[Book of Leinster]]. [[Edward O'Reilly (scholar)|Edward O'Reilly]] gives a full account of these in his ''Irish Writers'', XXX sq.; d. anno 433.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6E_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR62&amp;dq=%22o'Cuill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Zy3wS833FsqC_Qa3rLyqBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22o'Cuill%22&amp;f=false |title=Transactions of the Iberno-Celtic Society for 1820 |publisher=Iberno-Celtic Society |year=1820 |volume=Vol. I |issue=Part I |location=Dublin |accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Dubthach may be related to Mo Laisse maccu Lugair, whose feast-day is given as 16 September in the ''[[Martyrology of Tallaght]]'' and ''[[Félire Óengusso]]''. Both martyrologies state that his church was found among the [[Uí Fhairchelláin]], near [[Mountrath]], County Laois.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, "Dubthach maccu Lugair"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descendants===
Dubhtach was in a later tradition made a prospective husband for [[Saint Brigit]]. She declined him, but helped him find a bride. He is given as the father of several sons, all saints and founders of churches, mainly in [[Leinster]]. They included [[Fachtna of Kiltoom]], in the barony of Fore, [[County Westmeath]], other sons were Trian, [[Saint Gabhran]], [[Saint Euhel]], Moninne, Lonan and [[Saint Molaisse Mac Lugair]]. His granddaughter, Dediva (also called Editua or Dedi or Deidi or Deighe or Deidiu or Deaga or Mediva), daughter of Trian, was the alleged mother of saints and poets, including [[Saint Senan of Laraghabrine]], son of Fintan, Saint [[Diarmaid the Just]], son of Lugna, [[Saint Caillin]], son of Niata, [[Saint Felim]] of Kilmore, son of Carill, Saint [[Daigh]], son of Carill, [[Saint Femia]], daughter of Carill, St. [[Manchin]], son of Collan of Corann and [[Senchán Torpéist]], another [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]], which latter son is in keeping with the tradition of ollams coming generally from families who had a tradition of producing ollams.

The '''early left anterior negativity''' (commonly referred to as '''ELAN''') is an [[event-related potential]] in [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), or component of brain activity that occurs in response to a certain kind of stimulus.  It is characterized by a negative-going wave that peaks around 200 milliseconds or less after the onset of a stimulus,&lt;ref name="frisch194"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frisch | first=Stefan |author2=Anja Hahne |author3=Angela D. Friederici | title=Word category and verb&amp;ndash;argument structure information in the dynamics of parsing | year=2004 | journal=Cognition | volume=91 | page=194 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.09.009 | pmid=15168895 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pulvermulleretal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Syntax as a reflex: Neurophysiological evidence for the early automaticity of syntactic processing | journal=Brain and Language | year=2008 | volume=104 | last=Pulvermüller | first=Friedemann |author2=Yury Shtyrov |author3=Anna S.

While it is frequently used in language research, there is no evidence yet that it is necessarily a language-specific phenomenon.

More recent work has criticized the design of many of the foundational studies that characterized the ELAN, such that apparent ELAN effects might be the result of spillover from words prior to the onset of the critical word. This raises important questions about whether the ELAN is a true ERP component or an artifact of certain experimental designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinhauer|first=Karsten|last2=Drury|first2=John E.|date=2012-2|title=On the early left-anterior negativity (ELAN) in syntax studies|journal=Brain and Language|volume=120|issue=2|pages=135–162|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2011.07.001|issn=1090-2155|pmid=21924483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osterhout, L., McLaughlin, J., Kim, A., Greewald, R., &amp; Inoue, K.

Clifton (Eds.), ''The on-line study of sentence comprehension: Eyetracking-ERPs, and beyond'' (pp. 271–308). New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The ELAN was first reported by [[Angela D. Friederici]] as a response to [[German language|German]] sentences with phrase structure violations,&lt;ref name="townsend"&gt;{{cite book | title=Sentence Comprehension: The Integration of Habits and Rules | last=Townsend | first=David J |author2=Thomas G. Bever | year=2001 | publisher=[[MIT Press]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vs31TzBbqIIC&amp;pg=PA382&amp;lpg=PA382&amp;dq=early+left+anterior+negativity | page=382 | isbn=0-262-70080-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as *''the pizza was in the eaten'' (as opposed to ''the pizza was eaten''); it can be elicited by English phrase structure violations such as *''Max's of proof'' (as opposed to ''Max's proof'') or *''your write'' (as opposed to ''you write'').&lt;ref name="mapping52"/&gt;  The ELAN is not elicited  by sentences with other kinds of grammatical errors, such as subject-verb disagreement (*"''he go to the store''" rather than "''he goes to the store''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hagoort | first=Peter | year=1993 |author2=C.M. Brown |author3=J. Groothusen | title=The syntactic positive shift (SPS) as an ERP measure of syntactic processing | journal = Language and Cognitive Processes | volume=8 | doi = 10.1080/01690969308407585 | pages=439–483}}&lt;/ref&gt; or grammatically dispreferred and "awkward" sentences (such as "''the doctor charged the patient was lying''" rather than "''the doctor charged that the patient was lying''");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Friederici | first=Angela |author2=Stefan Frisch | title=Verb Argument Structure Processing: The Role of Verb-Specific and Argument-Specific Information | year=2000 | journal=Journal of Memory and Language | volume=43 |doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2709 | pages=476–507}}&lt;/ref&gt; it only appears when it is impossible to build local phrase structure.

It appears rapidly, peaking between 100 and 300 milliseconds after the onset of the grammatically incorrect stimulus&lt;ref name="hagoort unification 21"/&gt; (other reports have placed its time course, or ''latency'', between 100 and 200ms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Friederici | first=Angela D. |author2=Karsten Steinhauer |author3=Stefan Frisch | year=1999 | title=Lexical integration: Sequential effects of syntactic and semantic information | journal=Memory &amp; Cognition | volume=27 | issue=3 | page=439 | doi=10.3758/bf03211539}}&lt;/ref&gt; "under 200ms",&lt;ref name="frisch194"/&gt; "around 125 ms",&lt;ref name="townsend"/&gt; or "about 160ms"&lt;ref name="task effects"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hahne | first=Anja |author2=Angela D. Friederici | title=Differential task effects on semantic and syntactic processes as revealed by ERPs | year=2002 | journal=Cognitive Brain Research | volume=13 | issue=3 | page=340 | doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(01)00127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The speed of the ELAN may also be affected by characteristic of the violating stimuli; the ELAN appears later to visual stimuli that are fuzzy or difficult to see, and may occur earlier in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] complex spoken words where much information about the meaning of the word precedes the word's [[recognition point (neurolinguistics)|recognition point]].&lt;ref name="task effects"/&gt;

Its name derives from the fact that it is picked up most robustly by EEG sensors on the left front regions of the scalp;&lt;ref name="task effects"/&gt; it may sometimes, however, have a bilateral (both sides of the scalp) distribution.&lt;ref name="hagoort2003"&gt;{{cite journal | year=2003 | last=Hagoort | first=Peter | title=Interplay between Syntax and Semantics during Sentence Comprehension: ErP Effects of Combining Syntactic and Semantic Violations | journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume=15 | issue=6 | doi=10.1162/089892903322370807 | pmid=14511541 | pages=883–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors consider the ELAN to be a separate response from the [[left anterior negativity]] (LAN),&lt;ref name="frisch194"/&gt;&lt;ref name="task effects"/&gt; while others label it as just an early version of the LAN.&lt;ref name="hagoort unification 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yeetal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ye | first1 = Zheng | last2 = Yue-jia | first2 = Luo | last3 = Friederici | first3 = Angela D. | last4 = Zhou | first4 = Xiaolin | year = 2006 | title = Semantic and syntactic processing in Chinese sentence comprehension: Evidence from event-related potentials | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1071 | issue = 1| page = 187 | doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2005.11.085 | pmid=16412999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ELAN has been reported in languages such as [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name="mapping52"/&gt;  It is possible, though, that it is not a response specific to language (in other words, that the ELAN might also occur in response to non-linguistic stimuli).&lt;ref name="hagoort unification"/&gt;

==Use in neurolinguistics==
The ELAN response has played an important role in studies of sentence processing, particularly in the development of the so-called "serial model" or "syntax-first model" of sentence processing.  According to this model, the brain's first step in processing sentences is to organize input and build [[Phrase|local phrase structure]] (for example, to take the words ''the'' and ''pizza'' and organize them into a [[noun phrase]] ''the pizza''), and it does not process [[Semantics|semantic]] information or meaning until after this step has succeeded.&lt;ref name="hagoort unification"&gt;{{cite journal | year=2003 | last=Hagoort | first=Peter | pmid=14597293 | title=How the brain solves the binding problem for language: a neurocomputational model of syntactic processing | journal=NeuroImage | volume=20 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.013 | pages=S18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mapping"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Friederici | first=Angela D. |author2=Jürgen Weissenborn | journal=Brain Research | year=2007 | title=Mapping sentence form onto meaning: The syntax-semantic interface | volume=1146 | doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.08.038 | pmid=16956590 | pages=50–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kim | first=Albert |author2=Lee Osterhout | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Memory and Language | title=The independence of combinatory semantic processing: Evidence from event-related potentials | volume=52 | issue=2 | page=206 | doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model predicts that if the initial building of local phrase structure fails (as in the above examples *''Max's of proof'' and *''your write'') then semantic processing (the brain's interpretation of the meaning of the sentence) does not go forward.&lt;ref name="frisch196"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frisch | first=Stefan |author2=Anja Hahne |author3=Angela D. Friederici | title=Word category and verb&amp;ndash;argument structure information in the dynamics of parsing | year=2004 | journal=Cognition | volume=91 | page=196 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.09.009 | pmid=15168895 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been tested by taking advantage of two brain responses: the ELAN, which reflects the phrase-structure-building, and the [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], which reflects semantic processing; the model predicts that sentences eliciting an ELAN (a violation of local phrase structure) will not elicit an N400, since the building of phrase structure is a prerequisite for semantic processing.&lt;ref name="yeetal2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frisch196"/&gt;  These types of studies have had subjects read or listen to sentences that have both a syntactic and semantic violation in the same place.  Some such studies have found such sentences to elicit an ELAN and no N400, thus supporting the claim of the "serial model",&lt;ref name="frisch"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frisch | first=Stefan |author2=Anja Hahne |author3=Angela D. Friederici | title=Word category and verb&amp;ndash;argument structure information in the dynamics of parsing | year=2004 | journal=Cognition | volume=91 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.09.009 | pmid=15168895 | issue=3 | pages=191–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have found both an ELAN and an N400, challenging the model.&lt;ref name="yeetal2006"/&gt;

In his book 'Language and economy',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the German sociolinguist [[Florian Coulmas]] discusses "the many ways in which language and economy interact, how economic developments influence the emergence, expansion, or decline of languages; how linguistic conditions facilitate or obstruct the economic process; how multilingualism and social affluence are interrelated; how and why language and money fulfill similar functions in modern societies; why the availability of a [[standard language]] is an [[Comparative advantage|economic advantage]]; how the unequal distribution of languages in [[Multilingual society|multilingual societies]] makes for [[economic inequality]]; how the [[economic value]] of languages can be assessed; why languages have an [[Internal economies of scale|internal economy]] and how they adapt to the demands of the [[external economy]]. Florian Coulmas shows that language is the medium of business, an asset in itself and sometimes a [[Trade barrier|barrier to trade]]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and economy|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|year=1992|isbn=978-0631185246|edition=|location=Oxford|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States shoulder language costs, because it maintains themselves by means of it, as does business which needs communication competence.

==Global language and global economy==
Languages are capital investments in a literal sense : language technology is the most important one. It requires substantial investments which, in the absence of profitability, only affluent countries and businesses can afford. In this respect, today ''English is seen as a consequence and an instrument of American imperial power, an appreciable asset for American anglophones in the twenty-first-century global contest for competitive advantage, prosperity, and power''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cohen, [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-american-linguistic-empire The Rise and Fall of American Linguistic Empire, I want you to speak English], [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/about-dissent-magazine Dissent Magazine], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Though the best business language remains the language of the customers, meaning multilingual business practices, an "ideal' global economy presupposes a single language for the whole world. But an "ideal" global language presupposes a common acceptable and fair language burden for all business partners. See in this respect [[language tax]] to counteract linguistic inequality, as also language for purposes of trade incurs costs to most countries and private entreprises, whereas governments of countries whose language occupies a leading position on the international language market refuse to subsidize the spread of other languages for which they believe they have no need. In his report ''L'enseignement des langues étrangères comme politique publique'', [[François Grin]] argues that 'though some languages would be more beneficial in terms of cost-benefit analysis' such as e.g. Esperanto  (Esperanto business groups such as IKEF have been active for many years), the problem is that a shifting pattern in the valuation of languages is not always brought about by rationally culculable factors only. In addition to its economic potential, language is also a carrier of political, cultural and sociopsychological properties. In spite of the non-economic values attached to language, what prevails in matters of language is often that which is profitable &lt;ref&gt;'The costliness of the polyglot world : language-related expenditures of government and busininess' in : in : Coulmas, Florian, Language and economy, 1992, p. 152, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and this can lead to the superiority of a dominant language as a means of production, with a high linguistic capital value. In this respect it is evident to see that the will (or necessity) to learn English in the last decades has grown so much and its range of action has been so wide that the economic necessity and other incentives of foreign-language study are generally perceived as unimportant. For similar reasons, former British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] tried to torpedo the LINGUA program of the European Community, as from her point of view, Britain was asked to pay for a program which benefited her country least. Because of the enormous imbalance on current accounts of the major European languages in favour of English, the [[LINGUA programme]] called for an expansion and diversification of foreign-language education in the Member States. For the individual speaker the unequal linguistic balances imply that the first language is an economically exploitable qualification for some who can simply marketing their mother tongue skills, whereas others can not.&lt;ref&gt;Value for Whom ? in : Coulmas, Florian, Language and economy, 1992, p.86, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It is in the general interest of the United States to encourage the development of a world in which the fault lines separating nations are bridged by shared interests. And it is in the economic and political interests of the United States to ensure that if the world is moving toward a common language, it be English; that if the world is moving toward common telecommunications, safety, and quality standards, they be American; that if the world is becoming linked by television, radio, and music, the programming be American; and that if common values are being developed, they be values with which Americans are comfortable." (David Rothkopf) in : "In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?", '''Foreign Policy''', Nr 107, Summer 1997, p. 38-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.udel.edu/globalagenda/2004/student/readings/rothkopfimperialism.html|title=In praise of cultural imperialism ?

== Origin and influence of the Esperanto Wikipedia ==
[[Chuck Smith (Esperantist)|Chuck Smith]], an [[United States of America|American]] [[Esperantist]], is considered to be Esperanto Wikipedia's founder. The encyclopedia started off when he imported the 139 articles of the {{lang|eo|[[Enciklopedio Kalblanda]]}} by Stefano Kalb, which took him three weeks following November 15, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.transparent.com/esperanto/founding-the-esperanto-wikipedia/ Founding the Esperanto Wikipedia (Part 2 of 4)&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he undertook a journey to [[Europe]] with the goal of popularizing Wikipedia among the speakers of [[Esperanto]] in European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.transparent.com/esperanto/promoting-the-esperanto-wikipedia/|title=Promoting the Esperanto Wikipedia (Part 4 of 4) - Esperanto Language Blog|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, already in November 2002 he gave a talk about Wikipedia at the 10th [[Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology]] in [[Dobřichovice]] ([[Czech Republic]]).

Esperanto speakers have also been involved in the founding of several other language versions of the Wikipedia ([[Czech Wikipedia|Czech]], [[Slovak Wikipedia|Slovak]], [[Ossetian Wikipedia|Ossetian]], [[Swahili Wikipedia|Swahili]]). The introduction of support for the [[Esperanto alphabet]] by [[Brion Vibber]], an Esperanto speaker and later [[Wikimedia Foundation]]'s first employee, in January 2002 has paved the way for [[alphabet]]s of languages other than [[English language|English]] and initiated the transition of the whole Wikipedia to [[Unicode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.transparent.com/esperanto/unicoding-the-esperanto-wikipedia/|title=Unicoding the Esperanto Wikipedia (Part 3 of 4) - Esperanto Language Blog|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2012-12-31/Interview|The Signpost: ''Interview with Brion Vibber, the WMF's first employee'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2018, the Esperanto Wikipedia has 287 articles of [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|feature quality]] ({{lang|eo|elstaraj artikoloj}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikipedio:Elstaraj_artikoloj|title=Vikipedio:Elstaraj artikoloj|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further 206 considered [[Wikipedia:Good articles|worth reading]] ({{lang|eo|legindaj artikoloj}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikipedio:Legindaj_artikoloj|title=Vikipedio:Legindaj artikoloj|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly community projects include a [[Wikipedia:Collaboration of the week|Collaboration of the Week]] ({{lang|eo|kunlaboraĵo de la semajno}})&lt;ref&gt;http://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikipedio:Kunlaboraĵo_de_la_semajno&lt;/ref&gt; which improves neglected articles and an Article of the Week featuring good-quality articles on the front page. The [[Esperanto community]] is a frequent contributor to the Meta project, [[:meta:Translation of the week|Translation of the week]].

According to the [[:meta:List of Wikipedias by sample of articles|List of Wikipedias by sample of articles]] at Meta, a list based on [[:meta:List of articles every Wikipedia should have|List of articles every Wikipedia should have]], Esperanto ranks 36th, lacking almost none of the list of vital articles, but having in general relatively short articles.

On 18 November 2008, the Esperanto Wikipedia implemented the [[Wikipedia:Flagged revisions|Flagged revisions]] extension.

As of February 2012, the Esperanto Wikipedia had the 5th greatest number of articles per speaker among Wikipedias with over 100,000 articles, and ranked 11th overall.&lt;ref&gt;http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias_by_speakers_per_article List of Wikipedias by speakers per article&lt;/ref&gt; These figures were based on ''[[Ethnologue]]''{{'}}s estimate of 2,000,000 Esperanto speakers.

Due to the geographical spread of its editors (see the box on the right), the Esperanto Wikipedia has a varied list of countries of origin of its editors.&lt;ref name="traffic" /&gt;

On 13 August 2014 Esperanto Wikipedia reached 200,000 articles.

[[File:2008-07-25 uk vp pavla dvorakova.JPG|thumb|300px|One of the Wikipedia meetups at [[World Esperanto Congress]], Rotterdam 2008]]
Along with learners and other Esperantists of all levels, many very experienced Esperantists and [[native Esperantists]] have joined the project. At least three editors are members of the [[Academy of Esperanto]], [[Gerrit Berveling]], [[John C. Wells]], and [[Bertilo Wennergren]], a notable Esperanto grammarian&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|eo|[http://bertilow.com/pmeg/libro.html Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko}}] by Bertilo Wennergren.&lt;/ref&gt; and the director of the Academy's section about Esperanto [[vocabulary]].

{{lang|eo|Vikipedio}} incorporates, with permission, the content of the 1934 {{lang|eo|[[Encyclopedia of Esperanto|Enciklopedio de Esperanto]]}} and also content from several reference books and the monthly periodical {{lang|eo|[[Monato]]}}.

The Esperanto Wikipedia has been featured in many Esperanto news media, including a radio interview at [[Radio Polonia]],&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/UnuaIntervjuoKunChuckSmithPriVikipedio Interview with Chuck Smith in Esperanto about the Esperanto Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; and articles at {{lang|eo|Esperanto}}, {{lang|eo|[[Kontakto]]}}, {{lang|eo|[[Libera Folio]]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|eo|[http://www.liberafolio.org/2007/antverpenviki/ Vikipedio kreskas kiam Antverpeno festas — Libera Folio, 2007]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|eo|Raporto.info}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|eo|[https://web.archive.org/web/20070510074149/http://raporto.info/2007/03/18/vikipedio-la-reta-esperanta-enciklopedio-progresas/ Raporto.info » Vikipedio, la reta esperanta enciklopedio progresas, 2007]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Esperanto Wikimania]], a gathering held in 2011 to celebrate the encyclopedia's 10th anniversary, has been subsidized by the host city of [[Svitavy]] ([[Czech Republic]]) and the [[Pardubice Region]] and covered by [[Czech Television]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparent.com/esperanto/esperanto-wikimania-in-svitavy/ Smith, Chuck: ''Esperanto Wikimania in Svitavy'' In ''Esperanto Language Blog'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ve Svitavách se sešli tvůrci Wikipedie v esperantu'' In ''Události v regionech (Brno)''. Česká televize. 2011-10-27, 18:00.

Esperanto organisations like [[Universal Esperanto Association]] do not contribute to {{lang|eo|Vikipedio}} but support it by providing chambers at Esperanto conventions for {{lang|eo|Vikipedio}} presentations and trainings. At the [[World Esperanto Congress]] in Rotterdam, summer 2008, there were two Wikipedian meetups and a lecture at the Esperantology Conference. In April 2013, [[:meta:Esperanto kaj Libera Scio|ELiSo]] (''Esperanto and Free Knowledge'') was established as one of the first [[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia]] user groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Affiliations_Committee/Resolutions/Esperanto_kaj_Libera_Scio_%E2%80%93_March_2013|title=Affiliations Committee/Resolutions/Esperanto kaj Libera Scio – March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wikipedia handbook in Esperanto ===
The Esperanto Wikipedia community has created and published a 40-page "Wikipedia: Practical Handbook" ({{lang|eo|Vikipedio: Praktika Manlibro}}) which is sold on-line and at conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|eo|[http://www.esperanto.be/fel/but/lib/mvik.php Vikipedio: praktika manlibro]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manual is intended to give new Wikipedians advice and information on how to edit Wikipedia in Esperanto. It is currently in its second printing.

'''Fact-checking''' is the act of checking factual assertions in [[non-fiction]]al text in order to determine the veracity and correctness of the factual statements in the text. This may be done either before (''ante hoc'') or after (''post hoc'') the text has been published or otherwise disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ante hoc – Oxford Reference |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195369380.001.0001/acref-9780195369380-e-221 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221211803/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195369380.001.0001/acref-9780195369380-e-221 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=21 February 2015 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195369380.001.0001/acref-9780195369380-e-221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ante hoc fact-checking''' (fact-checking before dissemination) aims to remove errors and allow text to proceed to dissemination (or to rejection if it fails confirmations or other criteria). '''Post hoc fact-checking''' is most often followed by a written report of inaccuracies, sometimes with a visual metric from the checking organization (e.g., [[#Organizations and individuals|Pinocchios]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ''Fact Checker,'' or ''TRUTH-O-METER'' ratings from [[PolitiFact]]). Several organizations are devoted to ''post hoc'' fact-checking, such as [[FactCheck.org]] and [[PolitiFact.com|PolitiFact]].

Research on the impact of fact-checking is relatively recent but the existing research suggests that fact-checking does indeed correct misperceptions among citizens, as well as discourage politicians from spreading misinformation.

== Post hoc fact-checking ==

=== Consistency across fact-checkers ===
One study finds that fact-checkers PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and ''Washington Post's'' Fact Checker overwhelmingly agree on their evaluations of claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amazeen|first=Michelle A.|date=1 October 2016|title=Checking the Fact-Checkers in 2008: Predicting Political Ad Scrutiny and Assessing Consistency|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15377857.2014.959691|journal=Journal of Political Marketing|volume=15|issue=4|pages=433–464|doi=10.1080/15377857.2014.959691|issn=1537-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amazeen|first=Michelle A.|date=2 January 2015|title=Revisiting the Epistemology of Fact-Checking|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08913811.2014.993890|journal=Critical Review|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1080/08913811.2014.993890|issn=0891-3811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study by Morgan Marietta, David C. Barker and Todd Bowser found "substantial differences in the questions asked and the answers offered." They concluded that this limited the "usefulness of fact-checking for citizens trying to decide which version of disputed realities to believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Barker|first2=David C.|last3=Bowser|first3=Todd|date=2015|title=Fact-Checking Polarized Politics: Does The Fact-Check Industry Provide Consistent Guidance on Disputed Realities?|url=https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Marietta-Barker-Bowser-2015-Forum.pdf|journal=[[American Press Institute|The Forum]]|volume=13|page=577|last1=Marietta|first1=Morgan|accessdate=27 September 2016|doi=10.1515/for-2015-0040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by Chloe Lim, Ph.D. student at Stanford University, finds little overlap in the statements that fact-checkers check. Out of 1065 fact-checks by PolitiFact and 240 fact-checks by ''The Washington Post''{{'}}s Fact-Checker, there were only 70 statements that both fact-checkers checked. The study found that the fact-checkers gave consistent ratings for 56 out of 70 statements, which means that one out every five times, the two fact-checkers disagree on the accuracy of statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_wUaJ01JSddZTNWVWpkRzVXUzg/view|title=Checking how fact-checkers check|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects ===
Studies of ''post hoc'' fact-checking have made clear that such efforts often result in changes in the behavior, in general, of both the speaker (making them more careful in their pronouncements) and of the listener or reader (making them more discerning with regard to the factual accuracy of content); observations include the propensities of audiences to be completely unswayed by corrections to errors regarding the most divisive subjects, or the tendency to be more greatly persuaded by corrections of negative reporting (e.g., "attack ads"), and to see minds changed only when the individual in error was someone reasonably like-minded to begin with.&lt;ref name="AmazeenWaPost15"&gt;Amazeen, Michelle (2015) "Monkey Cage: Sometimes political fact-checking works. Sometimes it doesn't. Here's what can make the difference.," ''The Washington Post'' (online), 3 June 2015, see [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/sometimes-political-fact-checking-works-sometimes-it-doesnt-heres-what-can-make-the-difference/], accessed 27 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Correcting misperceptions ====
A 2015 study found evidence a "backfire effect" (correcting false information may make partisan individuals cling more strongly to their views): "Corrective information adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website significantly reduced belief in the myth that the flu vaccine can give you the flu as well as concerns about its safety. However, the correction also significantly reduced intent to vaccinate among respondents with high levels of concern about vaccine side effects--a response that was not observed among those with low levels of concern."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nyhan|first=Brendan|last2=Reifler|first2=Jason|date=9 January 2015|title=Does correcting myths about the flu vaccine work?

A 2016 study found little evidence for the "backfire effect": "By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Thomas|last2=Porter|first2=Ethan|date=5 August 2016|title=The Elusive Backfire Effect: Mass Attitudes' Steadfast Factual Adherence|ssrn=2819073}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[Donald Trump]] supporters during the 2016 race similarly found little evidence for the backfire effect: "When respondents read a news article about Mr. Trump's speech that included F.B.I. statistics indicating that crime had "fallen dramatically and consistently over time," their misperceptions about crime declined compared with those who saw a version of the article that omitted corrective information (though misperceptions persisted among a sizable minority)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/upshot/fact-checking-can-change-views-we-rate-that-as-mostly-true.html|title=Fact-Checking Can Change Views?

Studies have shown that fact-checking can affect citizens' belief in the accuracy of claims made in political advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fridkin|first=Kim|last2=Kenney|first2=Patrick J.|last3=Wintersieck|first3=Amanda|date=2 January 2015|title=Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire: How Fact-Checking Influences Citizens' Reactions to Negative Advertising|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2014.914613|journal=Political Communication|volume=32|issue=1|pages=127–151|doi=10.1080/10584609.2014.914613|issn=1058-4609}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by a group of [[Paris School of Economics]] and [[Sciences Po]] economists found that falsehoods by [[Marine Le Pen]] during the 2017 French presidential election campaign (i) successfully persuaded voters, (ii) lost their persuasiveness when fact-checked, and (iii) did not reduce voters' political support for Le Pen when her claims were fact-checked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=Barrera|last2=David|first2=Oscar|last3=Guriev|first3=Sergei M.|last4=Henry|first4=Emeric|last5=Zhuravskaya|first5=Ekaterina|date=18 July 2017|title=Facts, Alternative Facts, and Fact Checking in Times of Post-Truth Politics|ssrn=3004631}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study in the ''Journal of Politics'' found that "individuals consistently update political beliefs in the appropriate direction, even on facts that have clear implications for political party reputations, though they do so cautiously and with some bias... Interestingly, those who identify with one of the political parties are no more biased or cautious than pure independents in their learning, conditional on initial beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Seth J.|date=16 August 2017|title=Learning Together Slowly: Bayesian Learning about Political Facts|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/692739|journal=The Journal of Politics|pages=000–000|doi=10.1086/692739|issn=0022-3816|volume=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Yale University cognitive scientists Gordon Pennycook and [[David G. Rand]] found that Facebook tags of fake articles "did significantly reduce their perceived accuracy relative to a control without tags, but only modestly".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennycook|first=Gordon|last2=Rand|first2=David G.|date=12 September 2017|title=Assessing the Effect of "Disputed" Warnings and Source Salience on Perceptions of Fake News Accuracy|ssrn=3035384}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dartmouth study led by Brendan Nyhan found that Facebook tags had a greater impact than the Yale study found.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/upshot/why-the-fact-checking-at-facebook-needs-to-be-checked.html|title=Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked|last=Nyhan|first=Brendan|date=2017-10-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "disputed" tag on a false headline reduced the number of respondents who considered the headline accurate from 29% to 19%, whereas a "rated false" tag pushed the number down to 16%.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Yale study found evidence of a backfire effect among Trump supporters younger than 26 years whereby the presence of both untagged and tagged fake articles made the untagged fake articles appear more accurate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In response to research which questioned the effectiveness of the Facebook "disputed" tags, Facebook decided to drop the tags in December 2017 and would instead put articles which fact-checked a fake news story next to the fake news story link whenever it is shared on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.axios.com/facebook-drops-fake-news-flags-because-they-had-reverse-effect-2520310212.html|title=Facebook stops putting "Disputed Flags" on fake news because it doesn't work|date=2017-12-27|work=Axios|access-date=2017-12-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the findings of a 2017 study in the journal ''Psychological Science,'' the most effective ways to reduce misinformation through corrections is by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/business/media/fight-fake-news.html|title=How to Fight 'Fake News' (Warning: It Isn't Easy)|last=Chokshi|first=Niraj|date=18 September 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=19 September 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* limiting detailed descriptions of / or arguments in favor of the misinformation; 
* walking through the reasons why a piece of misinformation is false rather than just labelling it false; 
* presenting new and credible information which allows readers to update their knowledge of events and understand why they developed an inaccurate understanding in the first place; 
* using video, as videos appear to be more effective than text at increasing attention and reducing confusion, making videos more effective at correcting misperception than text.
A forthcoming study in the ''Journal of Experimental Political Science'' found "strong evidence that citizens are willing to accept corrections to fake news, regardless of their ideology and the content of the fake stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Ethan|last2=Wood|first2=Thomas|last3=Kirby|first3=David|date=2017-11-17|title=Sex Trafficking, Russian Infiltration, Birth Certificates, and Pedophilia: A Survey Experiment Correcting Fake News|ssrn=3073294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by Andrew Guess (of Princeton University), Brendan Nyhan (Dartmouth College) and Jason Reifler (University of Exeter) found that consumers of fake news tended to have less favorable views of fact-checking, in particular Trump supporters.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-2016.pdf|title=Selective Exposure to Misinformation: Evidence from the consumption of fake news during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper found that fake news consumers rarely encountered fact-checks: "only about half of the Americans who visited a [[fake news website]] during the study period also saw any fact-check from one of the dedicated fact-checking website (14.0%)."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A 2018 study found that Republicans were more likely to correct their false information on voter fraud if the correction came from Breitbart News rather than a non-partisan neutral source such as PolitiFact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=They See Dead People (Voting): Correcting Misperceptions about Voter Fraud in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15377857.2018.1478656?journalCode=wplm20|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/15377857.2018.1478656|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political discourse ====
A 2015 experimental study found that fact-checking can encourage politicians to not spread misinformation. The study found that it might help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. The researchers sent, "a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Effect of Fact-Checking on Elites: A Field Experiment on U.S. State Legislators|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12162/abstract|journal = American Journal of Political Science|date = 1 July 2015|issn = 1540-5907|pages = 628–40|volume = 59|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12162|first = Brendan|last = Nyhan|first2 = Jason|last2 = Reifler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political preferences ====
One experimental study found that fact-checking during debates affected viewers' assessment of the candidates' debate performance and "greater willingness to vote for a candidate when the fact-check indicates that the candidate is being honest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wintersieck|first=Amanda L.|date=5 January 2017|title=Debating the Truth|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X16686555|journal=American Politics Research|doi=10.1177/1532673x16686555|volume=45|pages=304–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign found that while fact-checks of false claims made by Trump reduced his supporters' belief in the false claims in question, the corrections did not alter their attitudes towards Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=n.d. |first=Brendan |last=Nyhan |authorlink=Brendan Nyhan |first2=Ethan |last2=Porter |first3=Jason |last3=Reifler |first4=Thomas J. |last4=Wood |title=Taking Fact-checks Literally But Not Seriously?

===Controversies and criticism===
Political fact-checking is sometimes criticized as being [[opinion journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riddell|first1=Kelly|title=Eight examples where 'fact-checking' became opinion journalism|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/26/eight-examples-where-fact-checking-became-opinion-/|accessdate=27 September 2016|work=[[Washington Times]]|date=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graves|first1=Lucas|title=Deciding What's True: The Rise of Political Fact-Checking in American Journalism|date=2016|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcGlDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, a [[Rasmussen Reports]] national telephone and online survey found that "just 29% of all Likely U.S. Voters trust media fact-checking of candidates' comments.

== Ante hoc fact-checking ==
Among the benefits of printing only checked copy is that it averts serious, sometimes costly, problems, e.g. lawsuits and [[Discrediting tactic|discreditation]]. Fact-checkers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes; they are not [[guarantee]]d safeguards against those who wish to commit [[journalistic fraud]]s

The possible societal benefit of honing the fundamental skill of fact-checking has been noted in a round table discussion by Moshe Benovitz, who observes that "modern students use their wireless worlds to augment skepticism and to reject dogma," but goes on to argue that this has positive implications for values development. He argues:{{quote|1="We can encourage our students to embrace information and vigorously pursue accuracy and veracity. Fact-checking can become a learned skill, and technology can be harnessed in a way that makes it second nature… By finding opportunities to integrate technology into learning, students will automatically sense the beautiful blending of… their cyber… [and non-virtual worlds]. Instead of two spheres coexisting uneasily and warily orbiting one another, there is a valuable experience of synthesis…".&lt;ref name=Benovitz12&gt;Moshe Benovitz et al., 2012, "Education: The Social Media Revolution: What Does It Mean for Our Children?" ''Jewish Action'' (online), August 24, 2012, New York, NY, USA:Orthodox Union, see [https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/08/2012/the-social-media-revolution-what-does-it-mean-for-our-children/], accessed 28 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He closes, noting that this constitutes "new opportunities for students to contribute to the discussion like never before, inserting technology positively into academic settings" (rather than it being seen as purely as agent of distraction).&lt;ref name=Benovitz12/&gt;

===Controversy===
One journalistic controversy is that of admitted and disgraced reporter and plagiarist [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]], who began his journalism career as a fact-checker. The fact-checkers at ''[[The New Republic]]'' and other weeklies for which he worked never flagged the numerous fictions in Glass's [[reportage|reporting]]. [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], who edited some of Glass's concocted stories, blamed himself, rather than the fact-checkers, saying: "Any fact-checking system is built on trust ... If a reporter is willing to fake notes, it defeats the system. Anyway, the real vetting system is not fact-checking but the editor." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Watson |url=https://factchecksrilanka.com/2017/04/02/what-is-fact-checking/ |title=What is Fact Checking? – FactCheck Sri Lanka |publisher=Factchecksrilanka.com |date=2017-04-02 |accessdate=2017-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015349/https://factchecksrilanka.com/2017/04/02/what-is-fact-checking/ |archive-date=7 November 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individuals===
* Sarah Harrison Smith spent some time and also headed the fact-checking department for ''[[The New York Times]]''. She is the author of the book, ''The Fact Checker's Bible''.
* Jim Fingal worked for several years as a fact-checker at ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'' and ''[[McSweeney's]]'' and is co-author with [[John D'Agata]] of ''The Lifespan of a Fact'' which is an inside look of a battle between himself as fact-checker and author D'Agata regarding one of his essays that pushes the limits of "artistic license" that is acceptable of a non-fiction work.

[[File:Forum of Pompeii.jpg|thumb|Forum of Pompeii, seen from above the Basilica with a drone]]

A '''forum''' ([[Latin]] ''forum''  "public place outdoors",&lt;ref&gt;
From [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*dʰworom'' "enclosure, courtyard", i.e. "something enclosed by a door"; cognate with Old Church Slavonic дворъ ''dvorŭ'' "court, courtyard".&lt;/ref&gt; plural ''fora''; English plural either ''fora'' or ''forums'') was a public square in a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[municipium]], or any [[civitas]],  reserved primarily for the vending of goods; i.e., a marketplace, along with the buildings used for shops and the [[stoa]]s used for open stalls. Many fora were constructed at remote locations along a road by the magistrate responsible for the road, in which case the forum was the only settlement at the site and had its own name, such as [[Forlimpopoli|Forum Popili]] or [[Forlì|Forum Livi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Frank Frost | last=Abbott | first2=Allan Chester | last2=Johnson | year=1926 | title=Municipal Administration in the Roman Empire | location=Princeton | publisher=Princeton University Press | url=https://archive.org/stream/municipaladminis032553mbp#page/n27/mode/2up | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The functions of a forum==
[[File:Jerash BW 12.JPG|thumbnail|right|The Forum of [[Jerash]], in Jordan. The columns mark the location of a [[stoa]], or covered walkway, where the stalls of open-air vendors might be located in bad weather. Note the semi-circular shape and traces of a central podium, similar in function to a theatre.|300px]]
In addition to its standard function as a marketplace, a forum was a gathering place of great social significance, and often the scene of diverse activities, including political discussions and debates, rendezvous, meetings, et cetera. In that case it supplemented the function of a [[conciliabulum]].

Every [[municipium]] had a forum. Fora were the first of any civitas [[synoecism|synoecized]] whether Latin, Italic, Etruscan, Greek, Celtic or some other. The first forums were sited between independent villages in the period, known only through archaeology. After the rise of the [[Roman Republic]], the most noted forum of the Roman world, the [[Roman Forum]] in [[Rome]] itself, served as a model of new construction. By the time of the late Republic expansions refurbishing of the forums of the city had inspired [[Pompey Magnus]] to create the [[Theatre of Pompey]] in 55 BC. The Theatre included a massive forum behind the theatre arcades known as the Porticus Pompei (Colonnades of Pompey). The structure was the forebearer to Julius Caesar's first Imperial forum and the rest to follow.

Other major fora are found in [[Italy]]; however, they are not to be confused with the [[piazza]] of the modern town, which may have originated from a number of different types of ancient civic centers, or more likely was its own type. While similar in use and function to fora, most were created in the Middle Ages and are often not a part of the original city footprint.

Fora were a regular part of every Roman province in the Republic and the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], with archaeological examples at:

*[[Roman Forum (Pompeii)|Forum]] of [[Pompeii|Pompeii, Italy]]
*[[Roman Forum (Thessaloniki)|Forum]] of [[Thessaloniki|Thessaloniki, Greece]]

In new Roman towns the forum was usually located at, or just off, the intersection of the main north-south and east-west streets (the [[Cardo]] and [[Decumanus Maximus|Decumanus]]). All fora would have a Temple of Jupiter at the north end, and would also contain other temples, as well as the [[Basilica]]; a public weights and measures table, so customers at the market could ensure they were not being sold short measures; and would often have the baths nearby. At election times, candidates would use the steps of the temples in the forum to make their election speeches, and would expect their clients to come to support them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4949">'''Gevil''' or '''Gewil''' ({{lang-he-n|גוויל}}) is animal [[Rawhide (textile)|hide]] that has been prepared as a [[writing material]] in Jewish scribal documents, in particular a [[Sefer Torah]] (Torah scroll).

[[File:Yemenite Sefer Torah on Givil 200 years old.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A 200-year-old Yemenite Sefer Torah, on Gevil, from the Beith Keneseth Rambam in Jerusalem. The Sofer was from the Sharabi family]]
According to most views of Jewish Law,  a sefer Torah (scroll) should be written on gevil as was done by Moses for the original Torah scroll he transcribed.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Bava Batra 14b and Gittin 54b&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a reading of the earliest extant manuscripts of the [[Mishneh Torah]] indicate that gevil was halakha derived from [[Moses]] and thus required for Torah scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Torah - Hilkoth Tefillin 1:8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]] wrote that it is the law transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai that a Torah scroll must be written on ''gevil'' or alternatively on ''[[klaf]]'' and that scrolls written on an alternative material are invalid for use, however it is preferable that they be written on ''gevil'' (Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillin 1:14).

==Definition of ''gevil''==
''Gevil'' is a form of skin made from the whole hide, after the hair is removed. The precise requirements for processing ''gevil'' are laid by the [[Talmud]], [[Geonim]] and [[Rishonim]]. They were reconfirmed as "the law according to Moses" by Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah. According to law, the preparation of gevil hide must include salt, flour and ''mey afatzim'' (wasp residue/[[gall]]-nut water). Gall nuts—rich in tannic acid—are a tree's reaction to an invasive parasitic wasp's egg; the pure black tint of the ink used on Torahs results from the reaction between the tannic acid and iron sulfate (a powder used to make the ink).&lt;ref&gt;Shabboth 79a&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three forms of skin known to Jewish law. The other two qualities result from splitting the hide into two layers; however, there is some confusion about their identification. 
Others deviate from this process, and use modern chemical processes. However, some believe that this invalidates the parchment for scribal use.

According to the ''Halakhot Gedolot'', klaf is the inner layer, adjacent to the flesh, while ''dukhsustos'' is the outer layer, on which the hair grows.  The same view is expressed in the oldest extant manuscripts and critical editions of Maimonides' [[Mishneh Torah]] and the Babylonian Talmud.  This is also the same definition which appears in the minor Talmudic tractate called Sofrim. However, more recent authorities reverse the two descriptions, and many printed editions of the Mishneh Torah are "adjusted" to reflect this.  The reason for this original adjustment away from the original definition is a mystery. Some suspect that copying errors are to blame. As a result, many have become confused, in terms of which part of the skin should be used for writing. Using the full hide known as gevil for Sifrei Torah does avoid this issue, unfortunately this solution won't work for tefilin which must be written on Klaf and are not kosher if written on gevil.

==Uses of ''gevil''==
According to the Talmud (Tractate Bava Batra 14b and Gittin 54b), ''gevil'' existed during the time of Moses (approximately 1280 BCE); Moses is described as using ''gevil'' for the Torah scroll he placed into the Holy [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Elsewhere in the Talmud (Tractate Gittin 54b), there is testimony that Torah scrolls were written on ''gevil''.

Today, a handful of Jewish scribes and artisans continue to make scroll material in this way.  However, the majority of Torah scrolls are written on ''klaf'', in their belief that the Talmud recommends (as opposed to requires) ''gevil'' and relates to the optimal beautification of the scrolls rather than an essential halachic requirement.  Given the uncertainty about which layer of the hide is in fact the ''klaf'', there is a growing movement for insisting on a return to ''gevil'' in Torah scrolls - in order to avoid all doubts. Clearly, the antiquity of gevil (as the original practice) is not being debated by anyone.

Most of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (200 BCE), found in and around the caves of [[Qumran]] near the Dead Sea, are written on ''gevil''.

Properly, ''klaf'' should be used for [[tefillin]] and ''dukhsustos'' for [[mezuzah|mezuzot]].  Once more, this rule is often relaxed in practice but there is a minority which seeks to return to the actual law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17580">[[File:Mysterio RAW 800.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Wrestler [[Rey Mysterio]] uses a Mexican 'luchador' gimmick.]]

In [[professional wrestling]], a '''gimmick''' generally refers to a wrestler's in-ring persona, character, behaviour, attire and/or other distinguishing traits while performing which are usually artificially created in order to draw fan interest.

These in-ring personalities often involve costumes, [[makeup]] and catchphrases that they shout at their opponents or the fans.

Gimmicks can be designed to work as good guys ([[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]s) or villains ([[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]s)  depending on the wrestler's desire to be popular or hated by the crowd. A [[tweener (professional wrestling)|tweener]] gimmick falls between the two extremes. A wrestler may  portray more than one gimmick over their career depending on the angle or the wrestling [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] that they are working for at that time.

Promotions will use gimmicks on more than one person, albeit at different times, occasionally taking advantage of a masked character which allows for the identity of the wrestler in question to be concealed. Razor Ramon was portrayed by both [[Scott Hall]] and [[Rick Bognar]].

Occasionally, a wrestler uses a gimmick as tribute to another worker; such is the case of [[Ric Flair]]'s Nature Boy persona which he took on as an homage to the original Nature Boy, [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]].

When a wrestler acts outside his or her gimmick this is known as 'breaking [[kayfabe]]', a term showing pro wrestling's linkages to [[theatre]], where the more common term "breaking the [[fourth wall]]" is used.

Gimmicks are annually rated for the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] awards by the publication's owner, professional wrestling journalists, and various industry insiders, such as [[Dave Meltzer]], promoters, agents and performers, other journalists, historians, and fans. The two awards are given to the [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Best Gimmick|best]] and [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Worst Gimmick|worst]] gimmick of that year. Current winners are [[Los Ingobernables de Japon]] and [[Bray Wyatt]] respectively.

==History==

[[File:Gorgeous George wrestler circa 1940s.JPG|thumb|180px|Photo postcard of Gorgeous George, one of pro wrestling's first modern gimmicks]]

=== Beginnings (1860s to 1940s) ===

Pro wrestling's history has been tied to the use of gimmicks from its infancy. From its circus origins in the 1830s, showmen presented wrestlers under names such as “Edward, the steel eater”, “Gustave d’Avignon, the bone wrecker”, or “Bonnet, the ox of the low Alps” and challenged the public to knock them down for 500 francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unitedworldwrestling.org/organization/history|title=History of Wrestling - United World Wrestling|website=unitedworldwrestling.org|access-date=2016-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327060219/https://unitedworldwrestling.org/organization/history|archive-date=2016-03-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century-early 20th century, when wrestler [[Frank Gotch]] rose to prominence, the focus became on contests largely legitimate (see [[catch wrestling]]), which largely resulted in the abandoning previous character gimmicks.

=== Television era (1950s to 1970s) ===

It was not until the First Golden Age of Professional Wrestling in the United States during the 1940s–1950s, when [[Gorgeous George]] created pro wrestling's first major gimmick. His [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] character focused on his looks and quickly antagonized the fans with his exaggerated effeminate behaviour. Such showmanship was unheard of for the time; and consequently, arena crowds grew in size as fans turned out to ridicule George.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg100&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorgeous George's impact and legacy on wrestling gimmicks was enormous, demonstrating how fast television changed the product from athletics to performance. Before him, wrestlers gimmicks imitated "ethnic terrors" (Nazis, Arabs, etc.), but his success birthed a more individualistic and narcissist form of character.&lt;ref name=sex,lies-pg11&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the first pro-wrestlers to use entrance music, "[[Pomp and Circumstance]]" which always played as he made his way to the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=The Fabulous, Freaky, Unusual History of Pro Wrestling (Unusual Histories)|publisher=Velocity Business Publishing|year=2010|pages=48|isbn=1429647892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, television took British wrestling to the next level when in 1964, it went full-time as part of the ''[[World of Sport (UK TV series)|World of Sport]]'' show.

The style of wrestling at the time was unique with strong emphasis on clean technical wrestling. Heels made up a minority of the roster, with most shows containing an abnormally high proportion of clean sportsmanly matches between two "blue-eyes" (as faces were known backstage in the UK). This would remain the case for several decades to come. Gimmick matches were a rarity, midget wrestling failed to catch on, while women were banned by the Greater London Council until the late 1970s.

=== Explosion (1980–present) ===
[[File:Hulk Hogan3.jpg|thumb|right|Hogan making his entrance at [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]] in 2005]]
{{Main|1980s wrestling boom}}

During the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|Second Golden Age]] of pro wrestling in the 1980s–1990s a rise of cartoonish, outlandish gimmicks became popular with the increase of [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]]'s popularity.

The WWF contributed to the explosion of gimmicks by becoming the most colourful and well-known wrestling brand because of its child-oriented characters, soap opera dramatics and cartoon-like personas. Most notable was the muscular [[Hulk Hogan]], who marked the 1980s with his "all-American" gimmick and made his main events into excellent ratings draws. His dominant role in the industry at that time led to this era to be also known as "Hulkamania". Around this time,  wrestling became a form of entertainment rather than an official sport.

Other wrestlers from this era with similarly outlandish characterisation include [[Ric Flair]], Sting and [[The Undertaker]].

In recent years, the emphasis has been on more realistic gimmicks which portray the wrestler as an actual person, sometimes using their real names, albeit with exaggerated personality traits. Wrestlers like [[Randy Orton]], [[Dave Bautista|Batista]], and [[John Cena]] are prime examples of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimcornette.com/cornettes-commentary/character-actors|title="CHARACTER" ACTORS - Jim Cornette.com|website=jimcornette.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common gimmicks ==


===Related to origin===
Exaggerating the characteristics of a wrestler's (on occasion [[kayfabe|fabricated]]) origin is one of the most commonly exploited gimmicks, in which overarching characteristics of a character play up to clichés and [[stereotypes]].

A long list of wrestlers in this category includes:  '''''African''''' ([[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]], [[Abdullah The Butcher]]),  '''''Bulgarian''''' ([[Rusev (wrestler)|Rusev]]), '''''Canadian'''''  ([[Team Canada (TNA)]], [[Team Canada (WCW)]]), '''''Cowboy'''''  ([[Bob Orton Jr.]]),  '''''French''''' ([[La Résistance (professional wrestling)|La Résistance]]), '''''Irish '''''([[Dave Finlay|Finlay]], [[Sheamus]]), '''''Iranian''''' ([[The Iron Sheik]], [[Ariya Daivari]]), '''''Hawaiian''''' ([[Leilani Kai]], [[Ricky Steamboat]]), '''''Indian''''' ([[The Great Khali]], [[Jinder Mahal]]), '''''Italian''''' ([[Santino Marella]]), '''''Jamaican''''' ([[Kofi Kingston]]), '''''Korean''''' ([[Gail Kim]]), '''''Mexican''''' ([[Alberto Del Rio]], [[The Mexicools]]), '''''Native American/American Indian''''' ([[Chief Jay Strongbow]], [[Tatanka_(wrestler)|Tatanka]]), '''''Russian''''' ([[Vladimir Kozlov]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Lana_(wrestler)|Lana]]), '''''Samoan''''' ([[Samoa Joe]], [[The Wild Samoans]]), '''''Swiss''''' ([[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]]), and '''''Thai''''' ([[Hercules (wrestler)|Super Invader]]).

The undeniable influence of the [[Puroresu]] style in the world of Professional Wrestling has resulted in many wrestlers using fabricated '''''Japanese''''' origins or being billed from a Japanese city, without actually being natives of the country. Prime examples of this include [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]], [[Kia Stevens|Awesome Kong]], Hawaiians [[Professor Tanaka]] and [[Mr. Fuji]], and British wrestler [[Kendo Nagasaki]]. Several Japanese wrestlers who wrestle outside of their home country are known to play up or exaggerate aspects of their cultural heritage as part of their gimmicks for an overseas audience.

===Masked===
Masked wrestlers made their appearance in Europe (Theobaud Bauer in France, 1865) and the United States (Mort Henderson as "Masked Marvel" in 1915) considerably earlier than in Mexico, but it was the latter that popularised the use of masks. This, in some cases to signify a high-flyer style, influenced by [[Lucha Libre]].

A specific masked gimmick may be used by more than one wrestler at a [[Professional wrestling promotion|wrestling company]]'s request since their identity can be permanently concealed. This is the case of Mexican [[Sin Cara]] and Japanese [[Tiger Mask (professional wrestling)|Tiger Mask]]. Masks also allow a wrestler to perform as more than one character for a variety of wrestling promotions.

Other wrestlers that have used masks in their performances include: Mexican-Americans [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Misterio]] and [[Kalisto (wrestler)|Kalisto]], Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame inductee [[Big Van Vader]], [[Daniel Bryan|Bryan Danielson]] during his masked American Dragon phase, Japanese legend [[Jyushin Thunder Liger]] and British wrestler [[El Ligero]].

===Sports===
A high number of wrestlers who start their careers in another sport incorporate their athletic abilities as part of their act. That is the case for Olympic medallist [[Kurt Angle]], who previously competed in [[freestyle wrestling]] and alludes to it in his attire and wrestling style. [[Brock Lesnar]] is also an ex-[[amateur wrestling|amateur wrestler]], [[National Football League|NFL]] player and [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] champion.

In the [[women in WWE|women's]] division, Ric Flair's daughter [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] has a gymnastics and volleyball background, [[Dana Brooke]] was a gymnast for 18 years and is a well known [[Fitness and figure competition|fitness competitor]] whilst [[Naomi (wrestler)|Naomi]] was a [[cheerleader]] and dancer for [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] team Orlando Magic.

===Superheros and Comic Characters===
The theatrical nature of [[Professional Wrestling]] easily blends with comic hero characters, made popular in the 1980s by legend [[The Ultimate Warrior]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], whose character was inspired by the 1994 movie ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', based on the [[The Crow|comic book of the same name]].

Other wrestlers with superhero gimmicks include late [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]' sons [[Goldust|Gold]] [[Cody Rhodes and Goldust|and]] [[Cody Rhodes|Stardust]], Samoan [[Rosey (wrestler)|Rosey]] during his "the Super Hero in Training" (the S.H.I.T.) phase and his tag-team partner [[Hurricane Helms|The Hurricane]] and valet [[Stacy Keibler]].

Some of these characters are brought during very short periods of time for entertainment value. [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] and [[Harley Quinn]] from the [[Batman]] comics have inspired wrestling attire for Sting and [[Alexa Bliss]] respectively. [[Finn Bálor]]'s Demon King persona is visually based on [[Spider-Man]] villains [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].

===Supernatural===

Similarly to superheros, supernatural characters add to entertainment value. Most famously in this category is [[The Undertaker]], considered one of the most respected wrestlers in the business, whose gimmick is a horror-themed character of an undead, macabre and paranormal dark presence prone to scare tactics. He was managed by the ghostly character that was [[Paul Bearer]] and tagged with his half-brother [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in [[The Brothers of Destruction]] stable.

Other wrestlers displaying supposed supernatural powers include [[Matt Hardy]] (as his Broken/Woken persona), [[Bray Wyatt]], [[Mordecai (wrestler)|Mordecai]], [[Papa Shango]], and [[The Boogeyman (wrestler)|The Boogeyman]]. Japanese [[Onryo (wrestler)|Onryo]] portrays a dead wrestler who returned for vengeance.

[[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] was a vampire stable, composed of [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]], [[Christian Cage|Christian]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=46|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Juggernaut]]===
Since its beginnings in the circus circuit, the professional wrestler's stereotype has been that of large, powerful and strong. Various wrestlers have banked on the larger size which has influenced their in-ring style and persona.

Notable examples of these kind include Swede [[Tor Johnson]], who weighed 181 kilograms, [[Big Show]] (7 ft 2 in), [[André the Giant]] (7 ft 4in), [[The Great Khali]] (7 ft 3 in), [[Gorilla Monsoon]] (182&amp;nbsp;kg), [[Kia Stevens|Awesome Kong]] (123 kg) and [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]] (6 ft 6 in).

===Comedy===
Whilst humour has long been present in [[Professional wrestling match types|Professional Wrestling matches]] and many wrestlers incorporate elements of comedy in their act, full on comedic gimmicks are not commonly seen. These are sometimes reserved for wrestlers who not always have the stereotypical physique required in the industry and instead exploit their entertainment abilities.

Wrestlers who fall under this category are Scottish comedian and actor [[Grado (wrestler)|Grado]], [[Doink The Clown]] which was majorly portrayed by [[Matt Osborne]] until 2013, [[Ring of Honor]]'s [[Colt Cabana]], [[Santino Marella]], Japanese Wrestlers [[Stalker Ichikawa]], [[Gran Naniwa]] and [[Kuishinbo Kamen]], [[Charlie Haas]] during his impersonations run, and [[WWE]]'s 1990s turkey character [[Gobbledy Gooker]]. [[Damien Sandow]] is also in this category, he always mocks what ever his opponents do.

===Self-absorbed===
Usually a villainous gimmick, initiated by [[Gorgeous George]]. Wrestlers that followed on with this trend include [[Bobby Roode]], [[Ravishing Rick Rude]], [[Rick Martel]], TNA's [[Jessie Godderz|Mr Pec-tacular]], [[Curt Hennig]]'s Mr Perfect, [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]'s [[Tyler Breeze]], WWE's The Miz, Canadian [[Tye Dillinger]]'s Perfect 10 and women's tag team [[The Beautiful People (professional wrestling)|The Beautiful People]].

===Music===
Music influences are another popular choice for gimmicks, as demonstrated by [[John Cena]]'s original rapper character, [[CM Punk]]'s [[straight edge]] iconoclast hardcore [[punk subculture|punk]], party boy [[Adam Rose]], [[Chris Jericho]], [[The Honky Tonk Man]], [[Disco Inferno (wrestler)|Disco Inferno]], [[Brodus Clay]] and his fun-loving, funk dancing gimmick "The Funkasaurus" and WWE's [[Fandango (wrestler)|Fandango]] who includes salsa dancing in his routine.

===Evil billionaire/Tyrant===
The millionaire tyrant character works well as a villain in contrast to professional wrestling's working class fan-base. It is because of this audience that [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]' ''Common Man'' was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|highly successful]] with the crowds.

The original gimmick of this type was created by "Million Dollar Man" [[Ted DiBiase]] which consequently inspired wrestlers like [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]], [[Tiger Ali Singh]], [[John Layfield|JBL]] and most recently [[Alberto Del Rio]]'s arrogant rich Mexican aristocrat character.

An '''information commons''' is an information system, such as a physical library or online community, that exists to produce, conserve, and preserve information for current and future generations. [[Wikipedia]] could be considered to be an information commons to the extent that it produces and preserves information through current versions of articles and histories. Other examples of an information commons include [[Creative Commons]].

==Introduction==
The concept of the "information commons" refers to the shared knowledge-base and the processes that facilitate or hinder its use. It also refers to a physical space, usually in an academic library, where any and all can participate in the processes of information research, gathering and production. The term [[commons]] refers to the land (or common grounds) that villagers shared for grazing purposes in simpler times. The issues that fall under this topic are varied and include:
* [[License]]s written to access digital content,
* [[Copyright]] law and similar [[intellectual property]],
* [[Freedom of information]],
* [[International trade]],
* [[Privacy]],
* [[Open-source software]],
* [[Open access (publishing)|Open-access publishing]],
* Academic [[libraries]] integrated with CIT facilities, particularly in the United States, but including:
** [[Information Commons, Sheffield|Information Commons]], a learning and study space at the [[University of Sheffield]];
** [[Business/SPEA Information Commons]], Indiana University, created August 2007.

Some believe{{who|date=September 2014}} that the increasing control and [[commodification]] of information restricts humanity's ability to encourage and foster positive developments in its cultural, academic, and economic growth.

==The Internet==
The internet took the information commons to another level. The internet age empowered consumers to become creators, producers, and distributors of information.&lt;ref&gt;Kranich, Nancy. "The Information Commons." (2004): 6. Weborn 6 May 2011. &lt;http://www.fepproject.org/policyreports/InformationCommons.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The internet facilitated a decentralized production and distribution of information. It bypasses the control of some of the more traditional publishing methods. These information are neither regulated by managers nor are they coordinated by price signals in the market. This result in a common-based production of knowledge that can be easily shared among individuals.

==Software commons==
{{see also|Open-source software movement|Free software movement|History of free and open-source software}}
The ''software commons'' consists of all [[computer software]] which is available at little or no cost and which can be reused with few restrictions. It includes [[open source software]] which can be modified with few restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fepproject.org/policyreports/infocommons.I.html |title=The Free Expression Policy Project |publisher=Fepproject.org |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eu.conecta.it/paper/brief_history_open_source.html |title=A brief history of open source software |publisher=Eu.conecta.it |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the commons also includes software outside of these categories – for instance, software which is in the [[public domain]].

Many innovative programmers have and released open source applications to the public, without the restrictive licensing conditions of commercial software. A popular example is [[Linux]], a open source operating system. The [[Server (computing)|server computers]] for [[Google Search]] run Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/corporate/history.html |title=Our history in depth – Company – Google |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[History of free and open-source software|Open-source programs]] started emerging in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hackers |author=Levy, S. |publisher=Anchor/Doubleday, New York |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM was one of the first computer companies to offer their products to the public.  Most of these computers came with free software that was universal among similar computers, and could be altered by anyone with the software.  This changed in the 1970s when IBM decided to take more control of their products, removing the source codes and not allowing the redistribution of their software.

In the 1980s and 1990s the software commons grew with the help of a [[Bulletin board system|bulletin board servers]], accessed with dial-up [[modems]]. This expanded in the late 1990s with the growth of the [[Internet]], which facilitated international cooperation and allowed individuals and groups to share their products more freely. The [[GNU Project]] was founded in 1983 to develop [[free software]].

In 1998 [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] announced that all future versions of their software would be free of charge and developed by an Open Source Community (Mozilla). This included [[Netscape Navigator]], then the most popular [[web browser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/history/netscape.htm |title=Browser History: Netscape |publisher=Blooberry.com |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing commons==
Licensing is the process that copyright owners use to monitor reproduction, distribution, or other use of creative works. Many commercial licensing conditions are costly and restrictive. Licensing models used in information commons typically grant permission for a wide range of uses. The [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), developed by [[Richard Stallman]] at [[MIT]] in the 1980s is one such license: ''"The GNU Free Documentation License is a form of [[copyleft]] intended for use on a manual, textbook or other document to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifications, either commercially or non-commercially."'' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly commons==
{{see also|Open access}}
“In the 1980s, many professional societies turned over their journal publishing to private firms as a way to contain membership fees and generate income.” &lt;ref&gt;Kranich, Nancy. "The Information Commons." (2004): 18. Weborn 6 May 2011. &lt;http://www.fepproject.org/policyreports/InformationCommons.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prices of scholarly journals rose dramatically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The cost of journals |url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/scholcomm/journalcosts.html |website=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing corporations restricted access to these journals through expensive licenses. Research libraries had no other choice but to cut many of their journal subscriptions. European and American academic communities began to find alternate ways to distribute and manage scholarly information. The [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] (SPARC) was founded in 1998. “It is an international alliance of academic and research libraries working to correct imbalances in the scholarly publishing system. Its pragmatic focus is to stimulate the emergence of new scholarly communication models that expand the dissemination of scholarly research and reduce financial pressures on libraries." &lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.arl.org/sparc/about/index.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jayanth Kaikini''' (or '''Jayanta Kāykiṇi'''; born 24 January 1955) is an Indian poet, short stories author and a lyricist working in [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada cinema]].

==Early life==
Kaikini was born in [[Gokarna, India|Gokarna]] to [[Gourish Kaikini]], a school teacher, and a Kannada litterateur and Shanta, a social worker. After a Masters in [[Biochemistry]] from [[Karnataka University]], [[Dharwad]], he moved to [[Mumbai]] where he worked as a chemist for many years.&lt;ref name="kaikini"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indialog.co.in/publications/kaikini.asp |title=Jayant Kaikini}}&lt;/ref&gt; He now lives in [[Bangalore]] with his wife Smita and two children, Srajana (daughter) who is an [[Odissi]] dancer and a researcher/curator, and Ritwik(son), a multimedia artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=63125&amp;n_tit=B'lore%3A+Srajana+Kaikini+wins+International+Recognition+for+Creative+Architectural+Concept&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Kannada Jayanth is fluent in Konkani (his mother tongue), Marathi, Hindi and English.

==Career==
Kaikini is regarded as one of the most significant of the younger writers in Kannada today. He is a writer of short stories, film scripts and poetry, and is based in Bangalore. His poetry is characterised by subtle imagism, a minute documentation of the seemingly commonplace, a colloquial idiom and a conscientious refusal to engage in any poeticising. He has so far published six anthologies of short stories, four books of poetry, three plays and a collection of essays.

In an introduction to Dots and Lines, an English translation of Kaikini’s short stories, critic C.N. Ramachandran writes, “To understand Jayanth’s works, we have to situate him in the literary context of the last two decades of the 20th century. During that period, there arose a group of writers who consciously differed from both the earlier Modernist writers (called Navya in Kannada) and those contemporaneous to them, the Writers of Protest (called Bandaya in Kannada) and Dalit writers. They did not subscribe to any particular philosophical or political system of thinking – be it Existentialism of the Modernists or the Leftist ideologies of the Dalit and Protest writers. On the other hand, what they wished to do was to select precise and authentic details of daily life and organise them in such a way as to culminate in a particular experience . . . Generally, their style was comic-ironic; and the language they used was the spoken language of day-to-day life. They were neither idealists nor cynics; they just wished to observe the life around them – generally mediocre – to register all the fleeting details that marked an ordinary man’s daily routine, and lead up to an experience rich in connotations. Jayanth was a major figure in this group of writers who, loosely, can be called ‘post-modernist’.”

Dr. Jayanth Kaikini started writing lyrics to film songs beginning from movie [[Chigurida Kanasu]].
He is the credited with revolutionising the image of Kannada film songs, with the classic touch of literature and beautiful imagery. Films like [[Mungaaru Male]], [[Gaalipata]], [[Milana]] etc. have some touching and memorable songs with lyrics penned by him.

He was hosting a TV Show "Rasa Rushige Namaskara" in [[Etv Kannada]] which a biography on Rashtrakavi [[Kuvempu]]. This show was very popular with a particular section of audience. He continued it with other series' such as "Kadala Theerada Bharghava",..etc.Lately he was seen judging the
reality show "Yede tumbi Haaduvenu" along with the legendary singer [[S.P.Balasubrahmanyam]] and famous [[Kannada]] music director and lyricist naada brahma [[Hamsalekha]].

Kaikini received the Karnataka Sahitya Academy award for his first poetry collection at the age of nineteen in 1974. He received the same award again in 1982, 1989 and 1996 for his short story collections. He has been awarded the [[Dinakara Desai]] award for his poetry, the B. H. Sridhar award for fiction, as well as the Katha National award and Rujuwathu trust fellowship for his creative writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5761">The '''Juba dance''' or '''hambone''', originally known as '''Pattin' Juba''' ('''Giouba''', Haiti: '''Djouba'''), is an African American style of [[dance]] that involves stomping as well as slapping and patting the arms, legs, chest, and cheeks. "Pattin' Juba" would be used to keep time for other dances during a [[walkaround]]. A Juba Dance performance could include:

*counter-clockwise turning, often with one leg raised
*stomping and slapping
*steps such as "the Jubal Jew," "Yaller Cat," "Pigeon Wing" and "Blow That Candle Out."

The dance traditionally ends with a step called "the Long Dog Scratch". Modern variations on the dance include [[Bo Diddley]]'s "[[Bo Diddley Beat]]" and the step-shows of [[African American]] Greek organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cocojams.com/secular_slave_rhymes_example%200104.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040628003710/http://www.cocojams.com/secular_slave_rhymes_example%200104.htm |date=June 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the dance==

The Juba dance was originally brought by [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] slaves to [[Charleston, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.be/books?id=TmzTyI5rfDMC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=charleston+kongo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m1fcu2T7sc&amp;sig=-pksxkbAb6DOroaxCX7HkEzXyMU&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE5oDIgKTTAhXSLFAKHXBkAakQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=charleston%20kongo&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; It became an [[African-American]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] dance that was performed by [[slave]]s during their gatherings when no rhythm instruments were allowed due to fear of [[Hidden message|secret codes]] hidden in the drumming. The sounds were also used just as [[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] and [[Music of Haiti|Haitian]] [[drum (communication)|talking drums]] were used to communicate.&lt;ref name="streetswing1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3juba.htm |title=Juba Dance - Streetswings Dance History archives - Main Page |publisher=Streetswing.com |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}} The dance was performed in Dutch Guiana, the Caribbean, and the southern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9044061 |title=juba (dance) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2007-10-25 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the mid-19th century, music and lyrics were added, and there were public performances of the dance. Its popularization may have indirectly influenced the development of modern [[tap dance]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. The most famous Juba dancer was William Henry Lane, or [[Master Juba]], one of the first black performers in the United States. It was often danced in [[minstrel show]]s, and is mentioned in songs such as "Christy's New Song" and "Juba",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdrcdata.lib.uiowa.edu/libsdrc/details.jsp?id=/jacksonju/3&amp;page=2 |title=Traveling Culture |publisher=Sdrcdata.lib.uiowa.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612111159/http://sdrcdata.lib.uiowa.edu/libsdrc/details.jsp?id=%2Fjacksonju%2F3 |archivedate=2011-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter by [[Nathaniel Dett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/sgo/texts/dett.html |title=Nathaniel R.

{{nihongo|'''Kotoeri'''|ことえり}} was a [[Japanese language]] [[Japanese input methods|input method]] that comes standard with [[macOS|OS X]] and earlier versions of [[Classic Mac OS]] until [[OS X Yosemite]]. ''Kotoeri'' (written ことえり or 言選り) literally means "word selection".

==To convert ''kana'' to ''kanji'' in macOS==
Here is an example of using the Kotoeri input method to enter the ''[[kanji]]'' character for "crane" or "stork". From the International menu, a user would configure Kotoeri as one of the input methods to appear on the drop-down language selector.

The user must first select the "hiragana" [[syllabary]] in the international menu. Then type in the pronunciation of the word (in this case, "tsuru"), and the user will see "つる". Then, the user must press the spacebar and select the appropriate kanji for the word (鶴) on the menu that appears.

===Converting ''kana'' to other non-''kanji'' representations===
With some ''[[katakana]]'' or ''[[hiragana]]'' text selected by highlighting it, the user may choose the "Convert to related character" option on the drop-down menu. The highlighted word is now shown underlined. Clicking on the underlined word presents a pop-up menu with four options. These are the ''hiragana'', ''katakana'', full-width ''[[rōmaji]]'' and half-width ''rōmaji'' equivalents of the selected word. Choosing the first option, for example, converts the selected word to the ''hiragana'' equivalent {{Nihongo|"crane"|つ る|tsuru}}.

===Converting ''kana'' to ''kanji''===
With some ''katakana'' or ''hiragana'' text selected by highlighting it, the user may choose the "Reverse conversion" option on the drop-down menu. A pop-up menu appears, which provides several possible ''kanji'' [[homophone]]s:&lt;br&gt;
{{Nihongo|crane|鶴|tsuru}}, {{Nihongo|vine|蔓|tsuru}} or {{Nihongo|bow-string|弦|tsuru}}, for example.&lt;br&gt;
At this point one chooses the ''kanji'' character or characters correctly representing the meaning of the desired word: 鶴.

{{Bertrand Russell}}'''Logical atomism''' is a philosophy that originated in the early 20th century with the development of [[analytic philosophy]]. Its principal exponent was the British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]. It is also widely held that the early work (the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' and pre-''Tractatus'' writings) of his Austrian-born pupil and colleague, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], defend a version of logical atomism. Some philosophers in the Vienna Circle were also influenced by logical atomism. [[Rudolf Carnap]] was also deeply sympathetic to some of the philosophical aims of logical atomism.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. (1934), "On the Character of Philosophic Problems (Über den Charakter der philosophischen Probleme)," translation by W. M. Malisoff, ''Philosophy of Science'', 1, pp. 5–19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Bergmann]] also developed a form of logical atomism that focused on an ideal phenomalistic language, particularly in his discussions of J.O. Urmson's work on analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergmann|first=Gustav|date=1957|title=The Revolt Against Logical Atomism--I|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2217296|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly (1950-)|volume=7|issue=29|pages=323–339|doi=10.2307/2217296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name for this kind of theory was coined in March 1911 by Russell, in a work published in French titled "Le Réalisme analytique" (published in translation as "Analytic Realism" in Volume 6 of ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSd9Iu1uXHoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=analytic+realism,+russell,+collected+papers+volume+6&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYvKqd1dvdAhUI0awKHQ0bAskQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=logical%20atomism&amp;f=false|title=Logical and Philosophical Papers, 1909-13|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|last2=Slater|first2=John Greer|last3=Frohmann|first3=Bernd|date=1992|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415084468|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was developing and responding to what he called "[[logical holism]]"—i.e., the belief that the world operates in such a way that no part can be known without the whole being known first.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=logical-atomism |title=Russell's Logical Atomism}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is commonly called [[monism]], and Russell (and [[G. E. Moore]]) criticized the [[absolute idealism]] dominant then in Britain and exemplified in works of [[F. H. Bradley]] and [[J. M. E. McTaggart]].&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; Logical atomism is partly understood as a developed alternative to logical holism, or the "monistic logic" of Idealists, on which logical analysis is a kind of falsification.

The theory holds that the world consists of ultimate logical "facts" (or "atoms") that cannot be broken down any further. Having originally propounded this stance in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', Wittgenstein rejected it in his later ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (§§46–49, §81, §91).{{Wittgenstein|Movements}}
== Origin ==

The term "logical atomism," partly because it was first introduced in a French paper that remained untranslated in Russell's lifetime, became widely associated with Russell's views in the English-speaking world after Russell gave a series of lectures in January-to-March 1918 under the title "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism". These lectures were subsequently published in 1918 and 1919 in ''The Monist'' (Volumes 28 and 29), which at the time was edited by [[Philip Jourdain|Phillip Jourdain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/jstor-27900704|title=THE PHILOSOPHY OF LOGICAL ATOMISM [with Discussion]|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|date=1918-10-01|publisher=The Monist|others=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell's ideas as presented in 1918 were also influenced by Wittgenstein, as he explicitly acknowledges in his introductory note. This has partly contributed to the widely-held view that Wittgenstein was also a logical atomist, as has Wittgenstein's atomistic metaphysics developed in the ''Tractatus''.

However, logical atomism has older roots. Russell and Moore broke themselves free from British Idealism in the 1890s. And Russell's break developed along its own logical and mathematical path. His views on philosophy and its methods were heavily influenced by revolutionary nineteenth-century mathematics by figures like [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]], and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]]. As he says in his 1901 essay, republished in his 1917 collection ''Mysticism and Logic, and Other Essays'' under the title "Mathematics and the Metaphysicians":&lt;blockquote&gt;What is now required is to give the greatest possible development to mathematical logic, to allow to the full the importance of relations, and then to found upon this secure basis a new philosophical logic, which may hope to borrow some of the exactitude and certainty of its mathematical foundation. If this can be successfully accomplished, there is every reason to hope that the near future will be as great an epoch in pure philosophy as the immediate past has been in the principles of mathematics. Great triumphs inspire great hopes; and pure thought may achieve, within our generation, such results as will place our time, in this respect, on a level with the greatest age of Greece. (pg. 96)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924059441125|title=Mysticism and logic, and other essays|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|date=1918|publisher=New York, Longmans, Green and co.|others=Cornell University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As we can see, Russell thought the revolutionary mathematical work could, through the development of logic, produce a similar revolution in philosophy. This ambition overlays the character of Russell's work from 1900 onward. Russell believes in fact that logical atomism, fully carried out and implemented throughout philosophy, is the realization of his 1901 ambition. As he says in the 1911 piece where he coins the phrase "logical atomism":&lt;blockquote&gt;The true method, in philosophy as in science, should be inductive, meticulous, respectful of detail, and should reject the belief that it is the duty of each philosophy to solve all problems by himself. It is this method which has inspired analytic realism [a.k.a. logical atomism], and it is the only method, if I am not mistaken, with which philosophy will succeed in obtaining results as solid as those obtained in science. (pg. 139)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Logical atomism rightly makes logic central to philosophy. In doing so, it makes philosophy scientific, at least in Russell's view. As he says in his 1924 "Logical Atomism":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfsPAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions:ISBN041509917X&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=new+instrument+for+the+discussion|title=Essays on language, mind, and matter, 1919-26|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|last2=Slater|first2=John Greer|last3=Frohmann|first3=Bernd|date=1988|publisher=Unwin Hyman|isbn=9780049200753|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The technical methods of mathematical logic, as developed in this book [''Principia Mathematica''], seem to me very powerful, and capable of providing a new instrument for the discussion of many problems that have hitherto remained subject to philosophical vagueness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In summary, Russell thought that a moral of the revolutionary work in mathematics was this: equally revolutionary work in philosophy could occur, if we only make logic the essence of philosophizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/ourknowledgeofth005200mbp|title=OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD|last=BERTRAND RUSSELL|publisher=GEORGE ALLEN &amp; UNWIN LTD|others=Universal Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspiration lies at the origin, and motivates and runs through, logical atomism.

== Principles ==

Russell referred to his atomistic doctrine as contrary to the tier "of the people who more or less follow Hegel" (PLA 178).

The first principle of logical atomism is that the World contains "facts". The facts are complex structures consisting of objects ("particulars"). A fact may be that an object has a property or that it stands in some relation to other objects. In addition, there are judgments ("beliefs"), which are in a relationship to the facts, and by this relationship either true or false.

According to this theory, even ordinary objects of daily life "are apparently complex entities". According to Russell, words like "this" and "that" are used to denote particulars. In contrast, ordinary names such as "Socrates" actually are definitive descriptions. In the analysis of "Plato talks with his pupils", "Plato" needs to be replaced with something like "the man who was the teacher of Aristotle".

In 1905, Russell had already criticized [[Alexius Meinong]], whose theories led to the paradox of the simultaneous existence and non-existence of fictional objects. This theory of descriptions was crucial to logical atomism, as Russell believed that language mirrored reality.

=== Russell's principles ===

Bertrand Russell's theory of logical atomism consists of three interworking parts: the atomic proposition, the atomic fact, and the atomic complex. An atomic proposition, also known as an elemental judgement, is a fundamental statement describing a single entity. Russell refers to this entity as an atomic fact, and recognizes a range of elements within each fact that he refers to as particulars and universals. A particular denotes a signifier such as a name, many of which may apply to a single atomic fact, while a universal lends quality to these particulars, e.g. color, shape, disposition. In Russell's [[Knowledge by acquaintance|Theory of Acquaintance]], awareness of these particulars and universals comes through [[sense data]]. Every system consists of many atomic propositions and their corresponding atomic facts, known together as an atomic complex. In respect to the nomenclature that Russell used for his theory, these complexes are also known as molecular facts in that they possess many atoms. Rather than decoding the complex in a top-down manner, logical atomism analyzes its propositions individually before considering their collective effect. According to Russell, the atomic complex is a product of human thought and ideation that combines the various atomic facts in a logical manner.

Russell's perspective on belief proved a point of contention between him and Wittgenstein, causing it to shift throughout his career. In logical atomism, belief is a complex that possesses both true and untrue propositions. Initially, Russell plotted belief as the special relationship between a subject and a complex proposition. Later, he amended this to say that belief lacks a proposition, and instead associates with universals and particulars directly. Here, the link between psychological experience – sense data – and components of logical atomism – universals and particulars – causes a breach in the typical logic of the theory; Russell’s logical atomism is in some respects defined by the crossover of metaphysics and analytical philosophy, which characterizes the field of [[naturalized epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bertrand Russell's Flirtation with Behaviorism|last = Kitchener|first = Richard F.|date = 2004|journal = Behaviorism and Philosophy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his theory of Logical Atomism, Russell posited the highly controversial idea that for every positive fact exists a parallel negative fact: a fact that is untrue. The [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence theory]] maintains that every atomic proposition coordinates with exactly one atomic fact, and that all atomic facts exist. The Theory of Acquaintance says that for any given statement taking the form of an atomic proposition, we must be familiar with the assertion it makes. For example, in the positive statement, “the leaf is green,” we must be acquainted with the atomic fact that the leaf is green, and we know that this statement corresponds to exactly this one fact. Along this same line, the complementary negative statement, “the leaf is not green," is clearly false given what we know about the color of the leaf, but our ability to form a statement of this nature means that a corresponding fact must exist. Regardless of whether the second statement is or isn't true, the connection between its proposition and a fact must itself be true. One central doctrine of Logical Atomism, known as the Logically Perfect Language Principle, enables this conclusion. This principle establishes that everything exists as atomic proposition and fact, and that all language signifies reality.  In Russell’s viewpoint, this necessitates the negative fact, whereas Wittgenstein maintained the more conventional [[Principle of Bivalence]], in which the states "P" and "Not (P)" cannot coexist.

=== Wittgenstein's principles ===

In his ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', Ludwig Wittgenstein explains his version of logical atomism as the relationship between proposition, state of affairs, object, and complex, often referred to as “Picture theory”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wittgenstein, Ludwig {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/wittgens/#H2|website = www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of Russell’s version, the propositions are congruent in that they are both not convoluted statements about an atomic entity. Every atomic proposition is constructed from “names” that correspond to “objects”, and the interaction of these objects generate “states of affairs,” which are analogous to what Russell called atomic facts. Where Russell identifies both particulars and universals, Wittgenstein amalgamates these into objects for the sake of protecting the truth-independence of his propositions; a self-contained state of affairs defines each proposition, and the truth of a proposition cannot be proven by the sharing or exclusion of objects between propositions. In Russell’s work, his concept of universals and particulars denies truth-independence, as each universal accounts for a specific set of particulars, and the exact matching of any two sets implies equality, difference implies inequality, and this acts as a qualifier of truth. In Wittgenstein’s theory, an atomic complex is a layered proposition subsuming many atomic propositions, each representing its own state of affairs.

Wittgenstein's handling of belief was dismissive and reflects his abstention from the epistemology that concerned Russell. Because his theory dealt with understanding the nature of reality, and because any item or process of the mind barring positive fact, i.e. something absolute and without interpretation, may become altered and thus divorced from reality, belief exists as a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] of reality but not reality itself. Wittgenstein was decidedly skeptical of epistemology, which tends to value unifying metaphysical ideas while depreciating the casewise and methodological inspection of philosophy that dominates his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [http://www.utppublishing.com/Wittgenstein-and-the-Study-of-Politics.html ''Wittgenstein and The Study of Politics''], Chapter 3 – Wittgenstein's Method of Perspicuous Representation |last = Temelini|first = Michael|publisher = University of Toronto Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4426-4633-9 |location = Toronto/Buffalo/London |pages = 68–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Wittgenstein concerned himself with defining the exact correspondence between language and reality wherein any explanation of reality that defies or overburdens these semantic structures, namely metaphysics, becomes unhinged. Wittgenstein’s work bears the exact philosophical determinants that he openly admonished, hence his later abandonment of this theory altogether.

=== Differences between Russell's and Wittgenstein's atomism ===

At the time Russell delivered his lectures on logical atomism, he had lost contact with Wittgenstein.  After [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], Russell met with Wittgenstein again and helped him publish the [[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]], Wittgenstein's own version of Logical Atomism.

Although Wittgenstein did not use the expression ''Logical Atomism'', the book espouses most of Russell's logical atomism except for Russell's Theory of Knowledge (T 5.4 and 5.5541). By 1918 Russell had moved away from this position. Nevertheless, the ''Tractatus'' differed so fundamentally from the philosophy of Russell that Wittgenstein always believed that Russell misunderstood the work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The differences relate to many details, but the crucial difference is in a fundamentally different understanding of the task of philosophy. Wittgenstein believed that the task of philosophy was to clean up linguistic mistakes. Russell was ultimately concerned with establishing sound epistemological foundations. Epistemological questions such as how practical knowledge is possible did not interest Wittgenstein.  Wittgenstein investigated the "limits of the world" and later on meaning. For Wittgenstein, metaphysics and ethics were nonsensical, though he did not mean to devalue their importance in life by describing them in this way. Russell, on the other hand, believed that these subjects, particularly ethics, though belonging not to philosophy nor science and of possessing an inferior epistemological foundation, were of certain interest.

== Influence and decline ==
The immediate effect of the ''Tractatus'' was enormous, particularly by the reception it received by the [[Vienna Circle]]. However, it is now claimed by many contemporary [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic philosophers]], that the Vienna Circle misunderstood certain sections of the ''[[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus|Tractatus]]''. The indirect effect of the method, however, was perhaps even greater long-term, especially on [[Logical Positivism]]. Wittgenstein eventually rejected the atomism in Logical Atomism in his posthumously published book, ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', and it is debatable whether he ever held the wide-ranging version that Russell expounded in his 1918 logical atomism lectures. Russell, on the other hand, never abandoned logical atomism. In his 1959 ''[[My Philosophical Development]]'', Russell said that his philosophy evolved and changed many times in his life, but he described all these changes as an "evolution" stemming from his original "revolution" into logical atomism in 1899-1900:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjncL40ZIR0C&amp;q=logical+atomism#v=snippet&amp;q=logical%20atomism&amp;f=false|title=My Philosophical Development|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|date=1995|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415136013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;There is one major division in my philosophical work: in the years 1899-1900, I adopted the philosophy of logical atomism and the technique of Peano in mathematical logic. This was so great a revolution as to make my previous work, except such as was purely mathematical, irrelevant to everything that I did later. The change in these years was a revolution; subsequent changes have been of the nature of an evolution. (Chapter 1: "Introductory Outline")&lt;/blockquote&gt;Even into the 1960s, Russell claimed that he "rather avoided labels" in describing his views—with the exception of "logical atomism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=U.G.

The '''Manifesto of Rauma''' ({{lang-eo|Manifesto de Raŭmo}}) is a historic document of the [[Esperanto movement]], ratified in 1980 at the [[International Youth Congress]] in [[Rauma, Finland]]. It is the ideological foundation of [[Raumism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esperantio.net/index.php?id=10 Manifesto de Raŭmo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Manifesto of Rauma was written and ratified in 1980 at the 36th International Youth Congress. In the Manifesto, the traditional goals of [[Esperanto movement]] are criticized and the [[Esperantujo|Esperanto community]] is defined as "a [[Stateless society|stateless]] [[Diaspora|diasporic]] [[linguistic minority]]" based on freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esperantio.net/index.php?id=13&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifesto of Rauma is the ideological foundation of Raumism. It is also used by the members of the Community of Esperanto Citizens (''Esperanta Civito'') to describe their ideology, although some Raumists see the Community as contradictory to the spirit of the Manifesto.

Spouses '''Maryna Yuryevna Dyachenko and Serhiy Serhievich Dyachenko''' ('''Marina and Sergey Dyachenko''') (rus. Марина и Сергей Дяченко, ukr. Марина та Сергій Дяченки) are [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]&lt;ref name="pentacle"&gt;Генри Лайон Олди, Марина и Сергей Дяченко, Андрей Валентинов. "Пентакль". "Пять авторов в поисках ответа": &lt;br /&gt;Марина .&lt;/ref&gt; co-authors of [[fantasy literature]]. They write in [[Russian language|Russian]], but also often first publish their books in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].&lt;ref name="pentacle"/&gt; The Dyachenkos hail from [[Kiev]] and currently reside in [[California]].

==Work==
Marina and Sergey claim that the bulk of their work is "M"-realism (a possible guess is that "M" stands for [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]], but it was never confirmed by either author).

Their first work, ''The Gate-Keeper'' ({{lang-ru|Привратник}}), was published in 1994. This novel received the "Crystal Table" prize ({{lang-ru|Хрустальный стол}}) at the book festival Zoryany Schlyach, the novel was awarded the title "Best Debut Work" during EuroCon competition in 1995. ''The Gate-keeper'' became the first novel in Dyachenko's fantasy tetralogy ''Wanderers'' ("Скитальцы"). With publishing of ''The Scar'' ({{lang-ru|Шрам}}) (1997), the sequel of ''The Gate-Keeper'', Dyachenko established themselves as masters of psychological fantastic fiction. ''The Scar'' has received  "Sword in the Stone" award for best fantasy novel in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusf.ru/awards/mechi/index.htm#1997 Rusf.ru Премия "Мечи"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 a new novel, ''The Ritual'' ({{lang-ru|Ритуал}}) was published - a story about princess and the dragon. This work is very strange and unusual, since the dragon in this tale is a half-human. This novel did not receive much attention and was not awarded any prizes.

The novel ''Age of the Witch'' (1997) ({{lang-ru|Ведьмин век}}) has a unique setting - it contains characters from various (mainly Slavonic) mythologies, creating a unique background.

The novel ''Armaged-Home'' ({{lang-ru|Армагед-дом}}) (1999) is a result of the long-term effort, written in the genre of [[social science fiction]]. The book describes different periods of the female heroine's life and the society she lives in. In the opinion of many critics and readers, it is one of the best Dyachenko's novels.

''The Green card'' (2000) ({{lang-ru|Зелёная карта}}) - this work is not a fantastic novel. It is a tale about people from [[Kiev]], who have received an opportunity to immigrate to the United States. A screenplay was based on this book.

A variation on [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' classic, novel ''Last Don Quixote'' (2000) ({{lang-ru|Последний Дон Кихот}}) became a base for a theatrical play. The novel was awarded the "Bronze Snail" ({{lang-ru|Бронзовая Улитка}}) (2001).

The novel ''Pandem'' ({{lang-ru|Пандем}}) took the "Silver Caduceus" prize at the "Star Bridge -2003" festival.

The novel ''Varan'' ({{lang-ru|Варан}}) was awarded the "Bronze Caduceus" prize at the "Star Bridge -2004" festival.

The novel ''The Pentacle'' ({{lang-ru|Пентакль}}), in co-authorship with A. Valentinov ({{lang-ru|А.Валентиновым}}) and G. L. Oldi ({{lang-ru| Г. Л. Олди}}), was awarded the "Golden Caduceus" prize at the "Star Bridge - 2005" festival.

Лана}}) - is a fantasy fairy tale, written under impression of the music of the Ukrainian singer [[Ruslana]] ({{lang-uk|Руслана}}). The book was dedicated to Ruslana as well.

Extremely survivable, resistant to high temperature, they need no shelter and are able to get through the apocalypse without taking cover. ''Dalphins'' in this novel resemble real [[dolphin]]s. They have evolved to survive the apocalypse in the following way: females lay eggs once every twenty years, right before the apocalypse. Critical changes in the environment, and sometimes just the warning signs, stimulate development of the larvae. Creatures migrate back to the ocean when seismic activity is over. Their next stage of the development is the cocoon. ''Dalphin'' spends inside the cocoon from the one to two month, an adult species emerges afterwards. In the world of this book, mentioning of the glaives is a taboo, probably from the fear of them. The word [[glaive]] means an edged weapon that was used in the medieval times.
* "The Yellowmore" ({{lang-ru|Желтомар}}) (from the book ''Bastard'') is a wizard's trap. It looks like an old man carved out of a tree. This old man smokes a pipe that emits yellow smoke. Smoke kills living things, by homing on the body heat.
* "The Devourer" ({{lang-ru|Зажора}}) (from the book ''Bastard'') is a wizard's trap. It is a hole in the ground that attracts its victims with a children's cry for help. Approaching victim gets sucked in by a whirlwind.
* "Calidons" ({{lang-ru|Калидоны}}) (from the book ''The Ritual'') are gigantic white birds, which live near the dragons. They pluck their own soft white feathers in order to hatch their chicks.
* "Mryga" ({{lang-ru|Мрыга}}) (from the book ''Armaggedon-Home'') is an apocalypse, that comes periodically, approximately every twenty years. During this period "The gates" are formed: objects of the unknown nature, that look like a stone arch with a mirror inside. People who enter the mirror are safe from the apocalypse and are able to return after it is over. "Minor gates" are formed as well, these are used by the animals and can not be employed by humans. There are enough gates formed, so every person has an opportunity to be saved if he/she enters the nearest one. These gates are transmitting some kind of signal, but humans were not able to determine what it is.
* "Nav", "Navka", "Nyavka" ({{lang-ru|Навь, навка, нявка}}) (from the book ''Age of the Witch'') is a magic creature that takes its form after a person who has recently died. It is brought to life if someone loved that dead person and wished for him/her to come back. Nav is using deception to kill a person who brought it to life. Nav, as well as Chugaister, are taken from Ukrainian mythology, but differ from the source material in many ways. For example: in the classic Ukrainian novel ''The Forest Song'' ({{lang-uk| Лісова Пісня}}) by [[Lesya Ukrainka]], the main characte is a Navka, a spirit of the forest or sprite.
* "Chugaister" ({{lang-ru|Чугайстер}}) (from the book ''Age of the Witch'', probably taken from a book "The Forest Song" by Lesya Ukrainka ) are magical creatures that are very similar to the human. Chugaisters, sometimes by themselves, sometimes in a group, destroy Navs (see above), by dancing around them. By doing so they make Navs to dance with them until they collapse dead. Chugaister was taken from the Ukrainian mythology, but is somewhat different from the original creature.
* "Elfoush" ({{lang-ru|Эльфуш}}) (from the book ''The Well Master'') is a little flying somewhat intelligent creature, which resembles an [[elf]]. Little children and people who are in love can understand what elfoushes say, thus becoming their prey.
* "Housekeeper" ({{lang-ru|Домохранец}}) (from the book ''The Well Master'') is a little house demon, looks like a little man with spider's legs.

'''Micheál de Búrc''', [[Irish language|Irish]] [[poet]], c.1800 – 6 July 1881.

==Biography==

Born sometime about 1800 in the townland of Bresk, parish of Kiltullagh, four miles east of [[Athenry]] town, Micheál de Búrc was educated at the nearby [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] College at Esker. In time he became schoolmaster at Esker National School, hence his nickname,''The Schoolmaster of Esker''. Writing in 2018, Martyn said of him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many details of his early life remain unknown. The only man of the name documented in the 1821 census is thirty-two year old Michael Burke, his twenty-six year old wife, Mary, and their two year old daughter, Mary; but Michael is listed as a “Farmer &amp; Labourer” (Mary a “Flax spinner”) and resided at “Careenlea, Kiltullagh”. Therefore, identifying him with Micheál de Búrc is problematic. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Known as a good scholar who spoke, read and wrote in [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]], de Búrc emigrated to the [[United States]] sometime after 1839. [[Jeremiah O'Donovan]] wrote that as of 1853, “He teaches in the [Roman Catholic] Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn .. is both a scholar and poet, and composes in the Irish language”. De Búrc died at his home in [[Brooklyn]] in 1881.

==''Oíche na Gaoithe Móire''==

De Búrc's chief claim to fame is the poem ''Oíche na Gaoithe Móire'' ([[Night of the Big Wind]]), concerning a severe windstorm which swept across Ireland on the night of 6–7 January 1839 causing severe damage to property and several hundred deaths. According to Mary Burke,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The hurricane-like storm of 1839 arrived suddenly after a strangely calm day, plunging towns into immediate darkness, which magnified the terror. Author Peter Carr notes that eddying winds caused the contents of houses to dance in the air and the din forced those huddled together to sign in order to communicate. Thousands hastily abandoned badly built and suddenly roofless houses, innumerable farm animals perished, and the Shannon flooded vast areas of the surrounding countryside.  ... Irish-speaking areas constituted the island’s poorest and most isolated regions, so there is a double silence to their unrecorded and unrecordable suffering.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Oíche ...'' runs to fifteen verses which give a very vivid description of the event, comparing it to God venting his anger as he did with the [[Noah's Ark|Deluge]]. However, de Búrc noted that the damage caused made good work for tradesmen such as thatchers, slaters, carpenters and masons.
While Martyn notes that the poem "was well known in de Búrc's lifetime ... both he and it had been entirely forgotten by the 1900s, even in his home parish, as was the language in which it was composed."

'''Noor Mohammed Danish''' ({{lang-ur|نور محمد دانش}} ; born 1958) known '''Noon Meem Danish''' is a Pakistani poet of [[Africans|African]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] descent.

==Early life and education==
Danish was born in 1958 in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] to a working-class family. He was raised in [[Lyari]], a largely [[Sheedi]] neighbourhood, which he describes as "Karachi's [[Harlem]]". He did his early education at the Okhai Memon School in [[Kharadar]], and began writing poetry in 1974. Danish's African appearance often led people around him to assume he was a foreigner; he describes being asked frequently where he was from and why he spoke [[Urdu]] so well.&lt;ref name="Dawn20071209"/&gt;

==Career==
After receiving his [[master's degree]] in [[Urdu]] from the [[University of Karachi]] in 1984, Danish began teaching at the [[Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science &amp; Technology|Urdu College]].&lt;ref name="Dawn20071209"&gt;{{citation|periodical=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|publisher=Pakistan Herald Publications|publication-place=Pakistan|date=2007-12-09|accessdate=2007-12-13|title=AUTHOR: A poet in New York|last=Farrukhi|first=Asif|url=http://www.dawn.com/weekly/books/books6.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invited Indian poet [[Bashir Badr]] to recite poetry at [[Karachi University]] one time; Badr was delayed, and the students began to become restless; he responded to their complaints about their pre-lunch hunger with the comment to the effect that he would not have arranged for such an eminent poet to come if he had known that "the students of the Urdu Department had their brains in the stomach and not the head."&lt;ref name="Dawn20060619"&gt;{{citation|title=Poetry and the dreamland|periodical=Dawn|date=2006-06-19|accessdate=2008-03-07|url=http://www.dawn.com/2006/06/19/fea.htm#3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
He adopted "[[Danish (name)|Danish]]" as his ''[[Takhallus]]'' ([[pen-name]]).{{When|date=February 2011}} ''Bachay, Titli, Phool'', his first collection of poems, was published in 1997. He quickly garnered recognition for the anger he expressed through his works, in which he often made reference to his experiences as a member of the [[African diaspora]]; his work attracted the attention of leading Urdu critic [[Shamsur Rahman Farooqi]], who had them published in [[India]]n literary journal ''[[Shabkhoon]]''.&lt;ref name="Dawn20071209"/&gt; In 2000, he emigrated to the [[United States]]; he had remarked to a friend that he would prefer to be "a third class citizen of a first class country than a first class citizen of a third class country," but put off going through the procedures for almost two years due to his ambivalence about leaving his home.&lt;ref name="Dawn20060619"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UrbanFolk"&gt;{{citation|last=Catafago|first=Paul|issue=3|year=2004|periodical=Urban Folk Magazine|publisher=Queens Council of the Arts|publication-place=New York|url=http://www.movementone.org/catafago.html|accessdate=2007-12-14|title=The Beautiful Mosaic: The life of poetry in Queens}}. Includes a translation of one of his Urdu works into English.&lt;/ref&gt; He first took up residence in the [[Kew Gardens]] neighborhood of [[Queens]], [[New York City]]; he chose it because of its diversity, which helped him to feel less of a stranger as well as affording him the opportunity to study others' cultures.&lt;ref name="UrbanFolk"/&gt; At first, he could only find job as a security guard, but he eventually joined the faculty of [[New York University]]; he later moved to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] as a language consultant.&lt;ref name="Dawn20071209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn20060619"/&gt;

Danish cites Urdu poets such as [[Mustafa Zaidi]], [[Obaidullah Aleem]], [[Noon Meem Rashid]], and [[Sirajuddin Zafar]] as his major influences.&lt;ref name="Dawn20071209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn20060619"/&gt; He is also an admirer of [[Langston Hughes]] and hopes to translate his works into Urdu.&lt;ref name="UrbanFolk"/&gt; He is married and has two children.&lt;ref name="UrbanFolk"/&gt;

'''Robby Garner''' (born 1963) is an American [[natural language]] programmer and software developer. He won the 1998 and 1999 [[Loebner prize|Loebner Prize]] contests with the program called [[Albert One]]. He is listed in the 2001 [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as having written the "most human" computer program.

==Life==
A native of [[Cedartown, Georgia]], Robby attended Cedartown High School. He worked in his father's television repair shop and began programming for his family's business at age 15. He was commander of his AFJROTC squadron as a junior in high school, while attending joint-enrollment college classes at the local community college. Forming a software company called Robitron Software Research, Inc.&lt;ref name="tvshop"&gt;{{cite web |last=Laven |first=Simon |url=http://www.simonlaven.com/fred.htm |title=Fred by Robby Garner at Robitron Software Research |work=SimonLaven.com |accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1987 with his father, Robert J. Garner, and his sister Pam, he worked as a software developer until 1997 when his father retired and the company was disbanded.

==Early conversational systems==
One of the first web chatterbots, named Max Headcold, was written by Garner in 1995. Max served two purposes, to collect data about web chat behavior&lt;ref name="specom"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caputo |first1=L. |last2=Garner |first2=R. |url=https://getinfo.de/app/D2-6-The-Tight-Sponge-method-an-applied-system/id/BLCP%3ACN056207336 |title=The 'Tight-Sponge' method: an applied system for the interaction between humans and intelligent agents |work=Proceedings International Workshop Speech and Computer |year=1998 |accessdate=2015-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120153/https://getinfo.de/app/D2-6-The-Tight-Sponge-method-an-applied-system/id/BLCP%3ACN056207336 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to entertain customers of the FringeWare online bookstore. This program was eventually implemented as a Java package called JFRED,&lt;ref name="jfred"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Luigi |last1=Caputo |first2=Robby |last2=Garner |first3=Paco Xander |last3=Nathan |chapter=FRED, Milton and Barry: the evolution of intelligent agents for the Web |title=Advances in Intelligent Systems |publisher=IOS Press |location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands |year=1997 |isbn=90-5199-355-2 |pages=400–407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Paco Nathan]] based on the C++ [[Fred (chatterbot)|FRED]] CGI program, and his own influences from Stanford and various corporations. Garner and Nathan took part in the world's largest online Turing test in 1998.&lt;ref name="TWML"&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Highfield |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/03/21/nmega21.html |title=Megalab 98: Thousands are taken in by robotic patter |work=The Telegraph |date=March 21, 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221215631/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1998%2F03%2F21%2Fnmega21.html |archivedate=2007-02-21 |accessdate=2015-03-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their JFRED program was perceived as human by 17% of the participants.

==Philosophy and collaborations==
A computational behaviorist after the term coined by Dr. Thomas Whalen in 1995,&lt;ref name="gen5"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Mathews |url=http://www.generation5.org/content/2000/garner.asp |title=Robby Glen Garner |year=2000 |work=Generation5.org |accessdate=2015-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031002021016/http://www.generation5.org/content/2000/garner.asp |archivedate=2003-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garner's first attempts at simulating conversation involved collections of internet chat viewed as a sequence of stimuli and responses. Kevin Copple of Ellaz Systems has collaborated with Garner on several projects, including Copple's Ella, for which, Garner contributed voice recordings and music. Garner and Copple believe that intelligence may be built one facet at a time, rather than depending on some general purpose theory to emerge.&lt;ref name="ellaz"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=EllaZ Systems |url=http://www.ellaz.com/AIV/Developers.aspx |title=Developers &amp; Credits |work=AIVault |accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loebner Prize contest==
Competing in six [[Loebner Prize]] contests, he used the competition as a way to test his prototypes on the judges each year.&lt;ref name="gen5"/&gt; After winning the contest twice in 1998 and 1999 with his program called [[Albert One]],&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/264663.stm |title=Albert is top talking computer |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=January 28, 1999 |accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; he began collaborating with other software developers in a variety of conversational systems. Garner created the Robitron Yahoo Group in 2002 as a forum and virtual watering hole for Loebner Prize contest participants and discussion of related topics.

==Current works==
The multifaceted approach,&lt;ref name="multi"&gt;{{cite web |first=Robby |last=Garner |url=http://www.robitron.com/Robby/Multifaceted.ppt |title=Multifaceted Conversational Systems |work=Colloquium on Conversational Systems |publisher=University of Surrey |year=2005 |accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented at a colloquium on conversational systems in November 2005, involves multiple chat bots working under the control of a master control program.  Using this technique, the strengths of various web agents may be united under the control of a Java applet or servlet.  The control program categorizes stimuli and delegates responses to other programs in a hierarchy. A spin-off of this technique is the Turing Hub,&lt;ref name="hub"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robby |last=Garner |editor1=Epstein, Robert |editor2=Roberts, Gary |editor3=Beber, Grace Beber |chapterurl=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n86142187u4024w2/?p=89f94cde8de24aec85e655376c830acd&amp;pi=18&amp;hl=u |chapter=The Turing Hub as a Standard for Turing Test Interfaces |title=Parsing The Turing Test |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |pages= 319–324 |isbn=978-1-4020-9624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; an automated [[Turing test]] featuring four of the top [[Loebner Prize]] contest competitors.

'''Saboktakin Saloor''' (October 26, 1923 - November 8, 1991) was a [[Iran|Persian]] journalist and historical novelist. He also wrote many popular serialized radio and television programs.

== Life and works ==
His novels, which include ''Ghorbangah'', ''Bedoone Esgh Hargez'', ''Ghobad'' and ''Gharatgaran'' were suspenseful stories usually marked by themes of sacrifice, honour, and family tragedy.

In 1980, following the [[Islamic revolution]], he was forced to flee [[Iran]] as the environment was no longer safe for a journalist and author known for his glorification of Persian monarchical history. He settled in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada, and died there in 1991.

Saloor had a passion for storytelling; his stories, usually set in Ancient Persia, expressed the importance of family and the patriarchal figure as a symbol of self-sacrifice. In terms of literary technique, he was heavily influenced by Persian literary masters such as [[Ferdowsi]], but also by American cinema, particularly [[Westerns]]. A master of building suspense, his stories were a constant draw for radio audiences in the 1960s.

Saloor's books remain in print to this day, and many of his stories continue to be serialized in Iranian newspapers across North America.

He was the great-grandson of [[Abdol-samad Mirza Ezz ed-Dowleh Saloor]].

'''Samaritan Hebrew''' ({{Lang-he-n|עברית שומרונית}}) is a reading tradition used liturgically by the [[Samaritans]] for reading the [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew language]] of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], in contrast to [[Biblical Hebrew]] (the language of the Masoretic [[Pentateuch|Jewish Pentateuch]]).

For the Samaritans, Ancient Hebrew ceased to be a spoken everyday language and was succeeded by [[Samaritan Aramaic]], which itself ceased to be a spoken language some time between the 10th and 12th centuries and was succeeded by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (or more specifically [[Palestinian Arabic|Samaritan Palestinian Arabic]]).

The [[phonology]] of Samaritan Hebrew is very similar to that of [[Varieties of Arabic|Samaritan Arabic]], used by the Samaritans in prayer.{{sfn|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|p=29}} Today, the spoken vernacular among Samaritans is evenly split between [[Modern Israeli Hebrew]] and [[Palestinian Arabic]], depending on whether they reside in [[Holon]] (Israel) or in [[Shechem]] (i.e. [[Nablus]], in Palestine’s [[Area A]]).

==History and discovery==
[[File:Samaritan letters and Jerusalem coin, Guillaume Postel 1538, Linguarum duodecim characteribus differentium alphabetum, introductio.png|thumb|In 1538 [[Guillaume Postel]] published the Samaritan alphabet, together with the first Western representation of a Hasmonean coin&lt;ref name=Madden&gt;[[Frederic Madden]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=T2JRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR16 History of Jewish Coinage and of Money in the Old and New Testament], page ii&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Genesis 5 18 as published by Jean Morin in 1631 in the first publication of the Samaritan Pentateuch.png|thumb|left|Genesis 5:18-22 as published by Jean Morin in 1631 in the first publication of the Samaritan Pentateuch]]
The Samaritan language first became known in detail to the Western world with the publication of a manuscript of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] in 1631 by [[Jean Morin (theologian)|Jean Morin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IOAtAAAAYAAJ Exercitationes ecclesiasticae in utrumque Samaritanorum Pentateuchum], 1631&lt;/ref&gt; In 1616 the traveler [[Pietro della Valle]] had purchased a copy of the text in [[Damascus]], and this manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a [[Paris]]ian library.{{sfn| Flôrenṭîn|2005|p=1|ps=: "When the Samaritan version of the Pentateuch was revealed to the Western world early in the 17th century... [footnote: 'In 1632 the Frenchman Jean Morin published the Samaritan Pentateuch in the Parisian Biblia Polyglotta based on a manuscript that the traveler Pietro Della Valle had bought from Damascus sixteen years previously.]"}} Between 1815 and 1835, [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] wrote his treatises on the original of the Samaritan version, proving that it postdated the Masoretic text.{{sfn|Flôrenṭîn|2005|p=2|ps=: "At the beginning of the 19th century, Wilhelm Gesenius wrote his great treatise on the origin of the Samaritan version. He compared it with the Masoretic text, analyzed the differences between the two versions, and proved that the Samaritan version postdates the Masoretic version of the Jews."}}

Between 1957 and 1977 [[Ze'ev Ben-Haim]] published in five volumes his monumental Hebrew work on the Hebrew and Aramaic traditions of the Samaritans. Ben-Haim, whose views prevail today, proved that modern Samaritan Hebrew is not very different from Second Temple Samaritan, which itself was a language shared with the other residents of the region before it was supplanted by Aramaic.{{sfn|Flôrenṭîn|2005|p=4|ps=: "A completely new approach which prevails today was presented by Ben-Hayyim, whose scientific activity was focused on the languages of the Samaritans - Hebrew and Aramaic. Years before the publication ol his grammar, with its exhaustive description of SH, he indicated several linguistic phenomena common to SH on the one hand, and Mishnaic Hebrew (MH) and the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls (HDSS), on the other. He proved that the language heard today when the Torah is road by the Samaritans in their synagogue is not very different from the Hebrew which once lived and flourished among the Samaritans before, during and after the time of the destruction of the Second Temple. The isoglosses common to SH. MH and HDSS led him to establish that the Hebrew heard in the synagogue by modernday Samaritans is not exclusively theirs, but rather this Hebrew or something resembling it, was also the language of other residents of Eretz Israel before it was supplanted by Aramaic as a spoken language."}}

==Orthography==
{{main article|Samaritan alphabet|Samaritan vocalization}}
[[File:Samaritan Pentateuch (detail).jpg|right|thumb|300px|Detail of the Nabul [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] in Samaritan Hebrew.]]

Samaritan Hebrew is written in the [[Samaritan alphabet]], a direct descendant of the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]], which in turn is a variant of the earlier [[Phoenician alphabet]].

The Samaritan alphabet is close to the script that appears on many Ancient Hebrew coins and inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Samaritan Language and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, all other varieties of Hebrew, as written by [[Jews]], employ the later 'square' [[Hebrew alphabet]], which is in fact a variation of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] that [[Jews]] began using in the [[Babylonian captivity]] following the exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE. During the 3rd century BCE, Jews began to use this stylized "square" form of the script used by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] for [[Old Aramaic language#Imperial Aramaic|Imperial Aramaic]], its chancellery script&lt;ref name="A History of the Hebrew Language"&gt;{{cite book|year=1993 |title=A History of the Hebrew Language |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-55634-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Samaritans continued to use the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, which evolved into the [[Samaritan alphabet]].

Samaritan Hebrew shows the following consonantal differences from Biblical Hebrew: The original phonemes */b g d k p t/ do not have spirantized allophones, though at least some did originally in Samaritan Hebrew (evidenced in the preposition "in" ב- /af/ or /b/). */p/ has shifted to /f/ (except occasionally */pː/ &gt; /bː/). */w/ has shifted to /b/ everywhere except in the conjunction ו- 'and' where it is pronounced as /w/. */ɬ/ has merged with /ʃ/, unlike in all other contemporary Hebrew traditions in which it is pronounced /s/. The laryngeals /ʔ ħ h ʕ/ have become /ʔ/ or null everywhere, except before /a ɒ/ where */ħ ʕ/ sometimes become /ʕ/. /q/ is sometimes pronounced as [ʔ], though not in Pentateuch reading, as a result of influence from Samaritan Arabic.&lt;ref name="bhq"&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|p=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; /q/ may also be pronounced as [χ], but this occurs only rarely and in fluent reading.&lt;ref name="bhq" /&gt;

Phonemic length is contrastive, e.g. /rɒb/ רב 'great' vs. /rɒːb/ רחב 'wide'.&lt;ref name="bh47-48"&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|p=47–48}} (while Ben-Hayyim notates four degrees of vowel length, he concedes that only his "fourth degree" has phonemic value)&lt;/ref&gt; Long vowels are usually the result of the elision of guttural consonants.&lt;ref name="bh47-48" /&gt;

/i/ and /e/ are both realized as [ə] in closed post-tonic syllables, e.g. /bit/ בית 'house' /abbət/ הבית 'the house' /ger/ גר /aggər/ הגר.&lt;ref name="bh49"&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, stressed /i/ shifts to /e/ when that syllable is no longer stressed, e.g. /dabbirti/ דברתי but דברתמה /dabbertimma/.&lt;ref name="bh49" /&gt; /u/ and /o/ only contrast in open post-tonic syllables, e.g. ידו /jedu/ 'his hand' ידיו /jedo/ 'his hands', where /o/ stems from a contracted diphthong.&lt;ref name="bhou"&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|p=44, 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other environments, /o/ appears in closed syllables and /u/ in open syllables, e.g. דור /dor/ דורות /durot/.&lt;ref name="bhou" /&gt;

===Stress===
Stress generally differs from other traditions, being found usually on the penultimate and sometimes on the ultimate.

==Grammar==

===Pronouns===

====Personal====
{|
|-
| I
| anáki
|-
| you (male)
| átta
|-
| you (female)
| átti (note the final ''[[yodh]]'')
|-
| he
| û
|-
| she
| î
|-
| we
| anánu
|-
| you (male, plural)
| attímma
|-
| you (female, plural)
| éttên
|-
| they (male)
| ímma
|-
| they (female)
| ínna
|}

====Demonstrative====

This: masc. ze, fem. zéot, pl. ílla.

That: alaz (written with a ''he'' at the beginning).

====Relative====

Who, which: éšar.

====Interrogative====

Who? = mi. What? = ma.

===Noun===

When suffixes are added, ê and ô in the last syllable may become î and û: bôr (Judean bohr) "pit" &gt; búrôt "pits". Note also af "anger" &gt; éppa "her anger".

[[Segolate]]s behave more or less as in other Hebrew varieties: beţen "stomach" &gt; báţnek "your stomach", ke′seph "silver" &gt; ke′sefánu (Judean Hebrew ''kaspe′nu'') "our silver", dérek &gt; dirkakimma "your (m. pl.) road" but áreş (in Judean Hebrew: ''’e′rets'') "earth" &gt; árşak (Judean Hebrew ''’arts-ekha'') "your earth".

====Article====

The [[definite article]] is a- or e-, and causes [[gemination]] of the following consonant, unless it is a [[guttural]]; it is written with a ''he'', but as usual, the ''h'' is silent. Thus, for example: énnar / ánnar = "the youth"; ellêm = "the meat"; a'émur = "the donkey".

====Number====

Regular plural suffixes are -êm (Judean Hebrew -im) masc., -ôt (Judean Hebrew: -oth.) fem: eyyamêm "the days", elamôt "dreams".

Dual is sometimes -ayem (Judean Hebrew: a′yim), šenatayem "two years", usually -êm like the plural yédêm "hands" (Judean Hebrew ''yadhayim''.)

===Tradition of Divine name===

Samaritans have the tradition of either spelling out loud with the Samaritan letters

"Yohth, Ie', Baa, Ie’ "

or saying "Shema"  meaning "([[Divinity|The Divine]]) Name" in Aramaic, similar to Judean Hebrew "Ha-Shem" .

[[File:Suspension-bb-lorelei-9016-jonwoods.jpg|thumb|A [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] scenario using period costumes]]
'''Sexual roleplay''' is [[roleplaying|roleplay]] that has a strong [[Eroticism|erotic]] element. It may involve two or more people who act out [[role]]s in a [[sexual fantasy]] and may be a form of [[foreplay]] and be [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]]. Many people regard sexual roleplay as a means of overcoming [[sexual inhibition]]s. It may take place in the real world, or via an internet forum, chat-room, video-game, or email—allowing for physically or virtually impossible erotic interests to be enacted.

How seriously the play is taken depends on the people involved, and the scenario may be anywhere from simple and makeshift to detailed and elaborate, complete with costumes and a script. Nearly any role could become the base material for an erotic experience, and there is no limit to what objects an individual could consider sexual. It may, for example, involve wearing of a costume which is regarded as erotic, such as a miniskirt and stockings, or one or both partners being nude, say for an evening. It may involve elements of dominance and submission, passivity or obedience. It may involve [[sexual bondage]], either being restrained or a sex partner being restrained.

Depending on the play scenario, the roleplay may be before spectators, and bystanders may be unknowing participants in a roleplay. For example, the roleplay may involve house guests or may be taken out of a couple's home and into, say, a bar, street, park etc. A role may require, for example, one or both partners to flirt with a stranger, or for one partner to seduce the other partner's friend, etc. It may also call for one or both partners to, say, strip in a car or park.

The popularity of the [[Internet]] has also allowed for online sexual encounters, known as [[cybersex]], which may involve roleplay.

== BDSM ==
Many of the most common sexual roleplays involve a power differential and form part of the [[dominance and submission]] aspect of [[BDSM]]. Roles can be general designations of power positions, or very specific, detailed fantasies. Some people, such as those living the [[Gorean]] lifestyle make use of an entire imaginary world. The controlling player is often called the [[Top (BDSM)|top]] or ''dominant'' while the controlled individual is called the [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]] or ''submissive''. It can be considered dangerous and therefore a [[safeword]] is advised to continue the safety of other(s) in such acts.

== Examples of scenarios ==
[[File:Sailor fuku model 3.jpg|thumb|[[Uniform fetish]]: A Japanese woman dressed as school student]]

Common scenarios include:
*Doctor/Nurse/Patient: [[medical fetishism]] where the participants play the roles of doctor, nurse, or patient.
*Escort – Client: one partner assumes the role of paid escort for an encounter.
*Executive – Secretary: one partner assumes the role of a business executive while the other takes the role of their secretary.
*[[Handyman]] – Housewife: the [[tradesman]] enters the housewife's home initially with the intent of carrying out plumbing/maintenance work.
*[[Master/slave (BDSM)|Master – Slave]]: the slave is required to comply with all demands of the master.
*Photographer – Model: this allows one partner to photograph the other as a precursor to sexual interaction.
*Stripper – Client: one participant performs a striptease for the other.
*Teacher – Student: the student dresses for the part and must do as he/she is told, or is punished.

Other scenarios include:
*[[Ageplay]]: where an individual acts and/or treats another as if they were a different age. The practice can be regressive, in which the goal is to re-experience childhood, or sexual, recreating a sexual relationship with people of the pretend and/or true ages. Generally this can involve someone pretending to be younger than they actually are, but more rarely can involve assuming an older role.
*[[Human animal roleplay|Animal-play]]: where a player is treated as a non-human animal such as a dog, pony, or cat.
*Authority figure/Misbehaving Adult: where a player takes on the role of an authority figure and blackmails or humiliates his or her partner into sexual activity.
*[[Feminization (activity)|Gender-play]]: where one or more players take on roles of another gender.
*Incest fantasy: also known as incest play, where two or more play the role of family members.
*Owner/Inanimate object: such as the bottom being [[human furniture]].
*Prison fetish: situational play set in a prison environment. Given real life prisons are same-sex communities, this fetish does lend itself to male on male or female on female activities and settings. Opposite gender play is also possible between inmates and guards or when the setting includes a co-ed facility/institution. Prison play is also an expansion of the [[uniform fetish]] by use of inmate, guard, and staff uniforms.
*Torturer/Captive prisoner: where one player is a captor who abuses the other, can also include [[rape fantasy|ravishment]] and kidnap scenarios.
*[[Uniform fetish]]: one participant dresses in uniform (for instance as a school student, [[cheerleader]], [[French maid]], etc.), while the other participant plays an authority figure (e.g., a parent, teacher, coach, police officer). Can also include scenarios with both participants in uniforms.

[[Sexologist]] [[Gloria Brame]] lists a number of these scenarios,&lt;ref name=Brame&gt;[[Gloria Brame|Brame, Gloria]] (2001). ''Come Hither!

The '''Slovak Sign Language''' is the [[sign language]] of the [[deaf]] community in [[Slovakia]]. It belongs to the French sign-language family. Bickford (2005) found that Slovak, Czech, and Hungarian Sign formed a cluster with Romanian, Bulgarian, and Polish Sign.&lt;ref&gt;Bickford, 2005. [http://www.sil.org/silesr/2005/silesr2005-026.pdf ''The Signed Languages of Eastern Europe'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the similarity of oral Slovak and Czech, SSL is not particularly close to [[Czech Sign Language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30064">Much of '''Tamil grammar''' is extensively described in the oldest available grammar book for [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the ''[[Tolkaappiyam|Tolkāppiyam]]'' (dated between 300 BC and 500 AD).  Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar ''{{IAST|[[Naṉṉūl]]}}'' which restated and clarified the rules of the Tolkāppiyam, with some modifications.

==Parts of Tamil grammar==
Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely {{IAST|eḻuttu}}, sol, porul, yāppu, and {{IAST|aṇi}}.  Of these, the last two are mostly applicable in poetry.&lt;ref name="five_parts_grammar"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.southasia.upenn.edu/tamil/lit.html
| title = Five-fold grammar of Tamil
| accessdate = 2007-06-01}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table gives additional information about these parts.

''{{IAST|eḻuttu}}'' defines and describes the letters of the Tamil alphabet and their classification. It describes the nature of phonemes and their changes with respect to different conditions and locations in the text.

''Sol'' defines the types of the words based on their meaning and the origin. It defines the gender, number, cases, tenses, classes, harmony, etc. This chapter also provides rules for compounding the words.

''Porul'' defines the contents of poetry. It gives guidance on which topic to choose for poetry based on certain conditions like the nature of the land or time or the people. It gives a distinction between ''Agam'' (Internal / love life) and ''Puram'' (external / worldly life).

''yāppu'' defines rules for composing Traditional poetry. It defines the basic building block ''Asai'' and describes how ''asai'' should be joined to form a ''sīr'', joining ''sīr'' for an ''adi''. 

''{{IAST|aṇi}}'' defines techniques used for comparing, praising and criticizing the taken topics.

==Letters==

The script of Tamil Language consists of 247 letters. The script falls under the category [[Abugida]], in which consonant-vowel sequences are written as a unit. The grammar classifies the letters into two major categories. 
*Prime Letters - முதலெழுத்து
*Dependent Letters - சார்பெழுத்து

===Prime Letters===
12 vowels and 18 consonants are classified as the prime letters. 
*The vowels (உயிரெழுத்துகள்):  அ (a), ஆ(ā), இ(i), ஈ(ī), உ(u), ஊ(ū), எ(e), ஏ(ē), ஐ(ai), ஒ(o), ஓ(ō), ஔ(au)
*The Consonants (மெய்யெழுத்துகள்): க், ங், ச், ஞ், ட், ண், த், ந், ப், ம், ய், ர், ல், வ், ழ், ள், ற்,ன்

The Vowels are called ''uyir'', meaning soul, in Tamil. The consonants are known as ''mei'', meaning body. When the alphasyllabary is formed, the letter shall be taking the form of the consonants, that is the body, and the sound shall be that of the corresponding vowel, that is the soul.

The vowels are categorized based on the length, as short (''kuril'') and long(''nedil''). The short vowels are pronounced for a duration 1 unit, while the long vowels take two units. Based on the duration of the sound, the vowels form 5 pairs. The other two vowels ஐ(''ai'') and ஔ(''au'') are diphthongs formed by joining the letters அ(a)+இ(i) and அ(a)+உ(u). Since these two are a combination two short letters, their pronunciation takes 2 units of time, that is they fall under ''nedil'' category. ஐ(ai) and ஔ(au) can also be spelt அய் and அவ். This form is known as ''eḻuttuppōli'' and is generally not recommended.

The consonants are categorised into three groups, வல்லினம்'vallinam'(hard), மெல்லினம்'mellinam'(soft) and இடையினம்'idaiyinam'(medium), based on the nature of the sound.

|}

From the 30 prime letters, the dependent letters are formed.

===Dependent Letters===

Tamil grammar defines 10 categories of Dependent letters. 

*Alphasyllabic letters உயிர்மெய் எழுத்து
*''Aidam'' ஆய்த எழுத்து
*Elongated verb (''Uyiralabedai'') உயிரளபெடை
*Elongated consonant (''Otralabedai'') ஒற்றளபெடை
*Shortened ''u'' (''Kutriyalukaram'') குற்றியலுகரம்
*Shortened ''i'' (''Kutriyalikaram'') குற்றியலிகரம்
*Shortened ''ai'' (''Aikarakurukkam'') ஐகாரக் குறுக்கம்
*Shortened ''au'' (''Aukarakurukkam'') ஔகாரக் குறுக்கம்
*Shortened ''m'' (''Makarakurukkam'') மகரக்குறுக்கம்
*Shortened ''Aidam'' (''Aidakurukkam'') ஆய்தக்குறுக்கம்

The alphasyllabic letters are formed by combining the consonants and the vowels. The duration of the sound is that of the inherent vowel. They are 216 in total. For example, the table below shows the formation of க் based letters.

|}

''Aidam'' is also known as ''thaninilai'' (stand alone). The aidam is always preceded by a single short letter (தனிக்குறில்) and followed by a hard alphasyllabic letter (வல்லின உயிர்மெய்). It takes half unit time for pronunciation.

''Uyiralabedai'' (உயிரளபெடை) and ''Otralabedai'' (ஒற்றளபெடை) are formed by elongating the duration of pronunciation of a letter to satisfy certain grammatical rules while composing poetry. In ''Uyiralabedai'', the intrinsic vowel of the letter that is elongated is written next to it, to indicate that the letter now is pronounced for 3 units of time. 

In ''Kutriyalukaram'', the duration of the short 'u' letters of ''vallinam'' category (கு, சு, டு, து, பு, று) is reduced to half units, when the letter is found at the end of the word, preceded by multiple letters or a single ''nedil''(long) letter. 

If a word with ''kutriyalikaram'' is followed by a word with 'ய'(ya) as the first letter, the ''u'' sound is corrupted to ''i'' sound and takes a half unit of time for pronunciation. 

In ''Aikarakurukkam'' and ''Aukarakurukkam'', the duration of the letters ஐ and ஔ are reduced to 1 1/2 units if they are the first letters of the word. If situated elsewhere it is reduced to 1 unit.

==Words==

In Tamil, a single letter standing alone or multiple letters combined together form a word. Tamil is an [[agglutinative language]].  Tamil words consist of a [[lexeme|lexical root]] to which one or more [[affix]]es are attached.

Most Tamil affixes are [[suffix]]es.  Tamil suffixes can be ''[[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] suffixes'', which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or ''[[inflection]]al suffixes'', which mark categories such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], etc.  There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of [[agglutination]], which can lead to long words with a large number of suffixes, which would require several words or a sentence in English.  To give an example, the word ''pōgamuḍiyādavargaḷukkāga'' (போகமுடியாதவர்களுக்காக) means "for the sake of those who cannot go", and consists of the following [[morpheme]]s:

Words formed as a result of the agglutinative process are often difficult to translate. According to Today Translations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todaytranslations.com/index.php/fuseaction/home.content/page/press]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[United Kingdom|British]] translation service, the Tamil word "செல்லாதிருப்பவர்" (''cellaathiruppavar'', meaning a certain type of [[truancy]] [[wiktionary:truancy|†]]) is ranked 8th in ''[[Words hardest to translate|The Most Untranslatable Word In The World]]

In Tamil, words are classified into four categories namely,
*Nouns ''Peyarcol''
*Verbs ''Vinaicol''
*Particles and Pre-/Postpositions ''Idaicol''
*Adjective and Adverbs ''Uricol''

All categories of nouns are declinable. Verbs are conjugated to indicate person, tense, gender, number and mood. The other two classes are indeclinable.  

==Nouns==

The nouns stand for the names of objects both animate and inanimate, and abstract concepts. Tamil is agglutinative language and can be declined. Nouns are the collections of names of Animate/Inanimate objects (பொருட்பெயர்), Places (இடப்பெயர்), concepts of time (காலப்பெயர்), Names of limbs of Animate/Inanimate objects (சினைப்பெயர்), qualitative nouns (பண்புப்பெயர்) and Verbal nouns (தொழிற்பெயர்). 

Nouns of place (இடப்பெயர்) stands for both conceptual names like ''town'', ''village'', ''heaven'' and real names like ''New York'', ''Amsterdam''. 

Nouns of time (காலப்பெயர்), includes units of time, names of days of the week, names of months and seasons. 

Nouns of Quality (பண்புப்பெயர்), includes the nature and quality of the abstract and tangible objects. Example: Names of tastes, shape, quantity, etc.

===Rationality===

The nouns are divided into two main classes based on rationality: The "high class" (உயர்திணை uyartiṇai ), and the "lower class" ( அஃறிணை aḵṟiṇai). 

All the rational beings fall under the category of "high class". Examples could be Adult humans and deities.
All the irrational beings and inanimate objects fall under the "lower class". Examples could be animals, birds, plants and things. Since children are considered to be irrational, the word ''kuḻandai'' (Child) is considered "lower class" ( அஃறிணை aḵṟiṇai) or neuter. 

===Gender and Number===

The grammatical gender of Tamil nouns corresponds to their natural sex. Nouns in Tamil have two numbers, singular and plural.

Grammatical gender in Tamil, known as ''pāl'' in Tamil, encompasses both the concepts of gender and number. Masculine and Feminine genders are only applicable to "higher class" nouns. Even though the genders of animals are marked in a sentence (Eg: பெண் நாய்,), grammatically they are handled as a neuter noun. Thus there are five genders in Tamil. Namely, Masculine Singular(ஆண்பால் ''āṇpāl''), Feminine Singular(பெண்பால் ''peṇpāl''), high-class plural (பலர்பால் ''palarpāl''), lower-class singular (ஒன்றன்பால் ''oṉṟaṉpāl''), lower-class plural (பலவின்பால் ''palaviṉpāl''). It is summarized in the table below.

==Pronouns==

===Demonstartives and Interrogatives===

{| class="wikitable floatright"
|-
!அவன் &lt;br&gt; ''avan''
|he, who is not near
|distant deixis, demonstrative particle
|-
!இவன் &lt;br&gt; ''ivan''
|he, who is near
|near deixis, demonstrative particle
|-
!எவன் &lt;br&gt; ''evan''
|who? (male singular)
|interrogative particle
|-
|}

In Tamil, the demonstrative particles are ''a''- (அ), ''i''- (இ), and ''u''- (உ)(archaic and has fallen out of use). These demonstrative particles display deictic properties. ''i''- (இ) is a near deixis form, which demonstrates the objects around/near the first person, while ''a''- (அ) has distant deixis form, which demonstrates things near the 3rd person. ''u''- (உ) was used indicate objects near the second person, but has gradually fallen out of use. In modern Tamil ''i''- (இ) indicates objects nearer and ''a''- (அ) indicates objects in a distance. Using these particles demonstrative pronouns are derived. The same set of pronouns is also used as personal pronouns in 3rd person. eg. ''avan'' (he), ''adhu'' (that object/being), ''andha'' (that)

''e''- (எ) and ''yā-'' யா are the two important interrogative particles in Tamil. ''e''- (எ) is used for deriving the interrogative pronouns. eg. ''evan'' (which one, 3rd person singular masculine), ''endha'' (which), ''edaṟku'' (for what?)

===Personal pronouns===

First person plural pronouns in Tamil, distinguish between inclusive and exclusive we. In Tamil, plural terminators are used for honorific addressing. It could be noted in both 2nd and 3rd persons. There are unique personal pronouns available for first and second persons while demonstrative pronouns are used in place of personal pronouns as well.

|-
|}

==Verbs==
Like Tamil nouns, Tamil [[verb]]s are also inflected through the use of suffixes.  A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of [[suffix]]es, which show [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]], as is shown by the following example ''azḥintukkoṇṭiruntēṉ'' (அழிந்துக்கொண்டிருந்தேன்) "(I) was being destroyed":

{| border="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"
|-
|align="center"|''azḥi''
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;

|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|align="center"|''koṇṭu''
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|align="center"|''irunta''
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|align="center"|''ēn''
|-
|align="center"|'''root'''&lt;br&gt;destroy
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|align="center"|'''voice marker'''&lt;br&gt;object voice
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|align="center"|'''aspect marker'''&lt;br&gt;progressive
|&amp;nbsp;

|align="center"|'''tense marker'''&lt;br&gt;past tense
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|align="center"|'''person marker'''&lt;br&gt;first person,&lt;br&gt;singular
|-
|}

Person and number are indicated by [[suffix]]ing the [[oblique case]] of the relevant [[pronoun]] (''ēn'' in the above example).  The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from [[grammatical particle]]s, which are added to the stem.

Tamil has two [[Grammatical voice|voices]].  The first - used in the example above - indicates that the subject of the sentence ''undergoes'' or ''is the object of'' the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence ''directs'' the action referred to by the verb stem.  These voices are not equivalent to the notions  of ''[[transitivity (grammatical category)|transitivity]]'' or ''[[Causality|causation]]'', or to the [[active voice|active]]-[[passive voice|passive]] or reflexive-nonreflexive division of voices found in [[Indo-European language family|Indo-European languages]].

Tamil has three simple [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] - past, present, and future - indicated by simple suffixes, and a series of perfects, indicated by compound suffixes.  Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same [[morpheme]]s which mark tense categories.  These signal whether the happening spoken of in the verb is unreal, possible, potential, or real. Tamil verbs also mark [[evidentiality]], through the addition of the hearsay [[clitic]] ''{{IAST|ām}}.''&lt;ref name="steeverevidentiality"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Sanford B. |last=Steever | editor-last=Güldemann | editor-first=Tom | editor2-last=von Roncador | editor2-first=Manfred | contribution=Direct and indirect discourse in Tamil |title=Reported Discourse: A Meeting Ground for Different Linguistic Domains |year=2002 |pages=91–108 | place=Amsterdam |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company   |isbn=90-272-2958-9}} at p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auxiliaries===
Tamil has no [[article (grammar)|article]]s.  Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number "one" as an indefinite article, or by the context.  In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between [[Clusivity|inclusive]] pronouns that include the listener and exclusive pronouns that do not.  Tamil does not distinguish between [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s - both fall under the category ''uriccol''.  [[Grammatical conjunction|Conjunction]]s are called ''iṭaiccol''.

[[Verb auxiliary|Verb auxiliaries]] are used to indicate ''[[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]'', a grammatical category which shows the state of mind of the speaker, and his attitude about the event spoken of in the verb. Common attitudes include [[pejorative opinion]], [[antipathy]], relief felt at the conclusion of an unpleasant event or period, and unhappiness at or apprehension about the eventual result of a past or continuing event.

==Sentence structure==
Except in poetry, the subject precedes the object, and the verb concludes the sentence.  In a standard sentence, therefore, the order is usually [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV), but [[object–subject–verb]] is also common.

Tamil is a [[null-subject language]]. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs and objects. It is possible to construct valid sentences that have only a verb, such as ''muṭintuviṭṭatu'' (முடிந்துவிட்டது) "It is completed", or only a subject and object, such as ''atu eṉ vīṭu'' (அது என் வீடு) "That is my house".

The elements that are present, however, must follow the SOV order. Tamil does not have an equivalent for the word ''is''; the word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning. The verb ''to have'' in the meaning "to possess" is not translated directly, either. To say "I have a horse" in Tamil, a construction equivalent to "There is a horse to me" or "There exists a horse to me", is used.

Tamil lacks [[relative pronoun]]s, but their meaning is conveyed by relative participle constructions, built using agglutination. For example, the English sentence "Call the boy who learned the lesson" is said in Tamil like "That-lesson-learned-boy call".

==Example==
A sample passage in Tamil script with an [[ITRANS]]-like transliteration.

[[File:Tamil language.png|center]]

''aasiriyar vakuppukkuL nuzhainthaar''.
''avar uLLE nuzhainthavudan maaNavarkaL ezhunthanar''.
''vaLavan mattum than arukil ninRu kondiruntha maaNavi kanimozhiyudan pEsik kondirunthaan''.
''naan avanai echarithEn.''

[[English language|English]] translation of the passage given above:
The teacher entered the classroom.
As soon as he entered, the students got up.
Only Valavan was talking to Kanimozhi who was standing next to him. I warned him.

&lt;small&gt;Notes:&lt;/small&gt;
# &lt;small&gt;Tamil does not have a [[definite article]]. The definite article used above is merely an [[wikt:artefact|artefact]] of translation.&lt;/small&gt;
# &lt;small&gt;To understand why Valavan would want to be warned, it is necessary to comprehend Indian social etiquette. It is considered impolite to be distracted when a person of eminence (the teacher in this case) makes an entry and the teacher may feel insulted or slighted.&lt;/small&gt;

A '''''verbum dicendi''''' ([[Latin]] for "word of speaking" or "verb of speaking"), also called '''verb of utterance''', is a [[word]] that expresses speech or introduces a [[quotation]]. English examples of verbs of speaking include [[Communication#Oral communication|''say'']], ''utter'', ''ask'' and ''rumble''. Because a verbum dicendi ("verb of speaking") often introduces a quotation, it may [[grammaticalization|grammaticalize]] into a [[quotative]].

The plural of ''verbum dicendi'' is ''verba dicendi''.

== Complement of a verbum dicendi: direct and indirect speech ==
A [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a verbum dicendi can be [[direct speech|direct]] or [[indirect speech|indirect]] speech. Direct speech is a single unit of linguistic object that is '"mentioned" rather than used.'&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Oshima, D. Y. (2006). Perspectives in Reported Discourse. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, indirect speech is a [[proposition]] whose parts make semantic and syntactic contribution to the whole sentence just like parts of the matrix [[clause]] (i.e. the [[independent clause|main clause]]/sentence, as opposed to an embedded clause).

Cross-linguistically, there are syntactic differences between direct and indirect speech, which include verbatimness, interpretations of deictic expressions, tense, presence or absence of complementizers, and syntactic opacity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The complement clause may or may not be verbatim ===

If a complement of a verbum dicendi is direct speech, it is presented as a faithful report of what the original speaker exactly said. In the following examples, (1)a entails that "I will go to Tokyo" was the exact sentence that John uttered. In (1)b, on the other hand, John might have uttered a different sentence, for example, "I'll spend my vacation in Tokyo."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(1)a. John said (to me): "I will go to Tokyo"&lt;br/&gt;(1)b. John said (to me) that he would go to Tokyo.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Indexicals in the complement clause may or may not be utterance-bound ===

If a complement of a verbum dicendi is direct speech, [[deixis|deictic expressions]] in the complement are interpreted with respect to the context in which the original sentence was uttered.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In (2)a, the embedded clause is direct speech; the first person [[pronoun]] ''I''  and the second person pronoun ''you'' in "''I''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; will give ''you''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; a hand" respectively refer to the utterer and the addressee in the context in which this quoted speech was uttered. In contrast, if the embedded clause is indirect speech, all deictic expressions in the sentence are interpreted in the context in which the matrix clause is uttered. In (2)b, the embedded clause is indirect speech, so all the occurrences of the first person pronoun ''me'' and the second person pronoun ''you'' in the sentence respectively refer to the utterer and the addressee in the immediate context in which 2(b) is uttered.&lt;blockquote&gt;(2)a. You&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said to me&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;: "''I''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; will give ''you''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; a hand."&lt;br/&gt;(2)b. You&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said to me&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; that ''you''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; would give ''me''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; a hand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sequence of tense ===
Some languages, including English, show difference in [[Grammatical tense|tense]] between direct and indirect quotes. This phenomenon is formalized as "[[sequence of tenses|the sequence of tense]] rules."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Complementizer ===
In some languages, the distinction between direct and indirect speech can be diagnosed by presence of an overt [[complementizer]]. Many languages, including English, have an overt complementizer (e.g. ''that'' in English) when the complement of a verbum dicendi is indirect speech, as seen in (1)b and 2(b) above. Some languages, such as [[Tikar language|Tikar]], on the other hand, use an overt complementizer to introduce indirect speech.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Syntactic opacity ===
If a complement of a verbum dicendi is direct speech, it is "syntactically opaque,"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; meaning that syntactic elements inside this embedded clause cannot interact with elements in the matrix clause.

For example, [[Polarity item|Negative Polarity Items]] (NPI) inside an embedded direct quote cannot be licensed by a syntactic element in the matrix clause.&lt;blockquote&gt;(3)a. ?Nobody said "we saw anything."&lt;br/&gt;(3)b. Nobody said that they had seen anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maier|first=Emar|date=2008-06-11|title=Japanese Reported Speech: Against a Direct–Indirect Distinction|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-00609-8_13|journal=New Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=133–145|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-00609-8_13|isbn=9783642006081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Note that (3)a is still syntactically well-formed but cannot communicate the same meaning as (3)b, in which the NPI ''anything'' inside the embedded indirect quote [they had seen anything] is licensed by ''nobody'' in the matrix clause.

Another example is that [[wh-movement]] out of an embedded direct quote is prohibited, as seen in (4)a below.&lt;blockquote&gt;(4)a. *What did John say: "I read _"?&lt;br/&gt;(4)b. What did John say that he had read _?&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In English ==

In English, verba dicendi such as ''say'' and ''think'' are used to report speech and thought processes.&lt;ref name="Buch"&gt;Buchstaller, Isabelle (2014). Quotatives: New Trends and Sociological Implications. Oxford. Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|9780470657188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 (1)a. If you touched a one they would '''say''' ‘wey you’re on’. (UK){{Fix|text=Is this English?}}
    b. And I '''thought''' ‘Well we need some more popcorn’. (US)&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt;

Such examples are prototypical, but many variants exist within an open class of manner-of-speaking verbs, such as ''ask'', ''shout'', ''scream'', ''wonder'', ''yell'', ''holler'', ''bellow'', ''grunt'', ''mumble'', ''mutter'', etc. These may be considered [[semantically]] more specific, implying a clause type (as in ''ask'') or indicating the intensity or [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of the reported material (e.g. ''shout'', ''mutter'').

[[Quotation]] indicates to a listener that a message originated from a different voice, and/or at a different time than the present. An utterance like “Jim said ‘I love you’” reports at the present moment that Jim said “I love you” at some time in the past. Thus, there are two distinct active voices: that of the narrator and that of the reportee.&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt;
Written English often employs manner-of-speaking verbs or verba dicendi in conjunction with quotation marks to demarcate the quoted content. Speakers use more subtle phonetic and prosodic cues like intonation, rhythm, and [[mimesis]] to indicate reported speech.

===Properties===
There are numerous [[syntactically]] and [[semantically]] relevant properties of verba dicendi and manner-of-speaking verbs, several of which are highlighted below:

i. They are so-called Activity Verbs. They may occur in progressive and imperative forms, among other tests:
 (2)a. He was '''shouting''' obscenities.
    b. '''Yell''' to George about the new quota.
    c. What John did was '''lisp''' French to Mary.&lt;ref name="Zwicky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zwicky|first1=Arnold M.|title=In a manner of speaking|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=1971|volume=2|issue=2|pages=223–233|jstor=4177626}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ii. The subject of verba dicendi is normally [[sentient]]:
 (3)a. '''My father''' howled for me to pick up the chair.
    b. *'''My desk''' howled for me to pick up the chair.&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt;

However, it is possible, at least colloquially, to assign the subject role of some verba dicendi to a non-sentient entity. An expression like ''When you're late, it says you don't care.'' could be one such example.

iii. Verba dicendi may have an [[indirect object]], which may be marked by ''to'' and which is also normally sentient:
 (4)a. Scream ‘Up the Queen’ (to '''the first person who passes''')
    b. *She will howl 'O my stars and garters' to '''the essence of friendship'''&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt;{{Fix|text=What does "to" mean here?}}
iv. Manner-of-speaking verbs may have a [[direct object]], which may be a [[noun]] describing the speech act itself, a desentential{{Fix|text=not a word?}} [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] (that-clause, indirect question or infinitive), or a direct quotation:
 (5)a. Hoffman will probably mutter '''a foul oath'''
    b. Martin shrieked '''that there were cockroaches in the caviar'''{{what|date=August 2018}}
    c. Regrettably, someone mumbled, “'''I suspect poison'''”&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt;
Further, the direct object of some manner-of-speaking verbs may be deleted, resulting in a sentence that does not indicate an act of communication, but rather a description of the sound made:
    d. My companion '''shrieked'''&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt;
Other verba dicendi do not permit this, however. ''Say'', ''ask'', ''tell'', for instance, cannot occur freely without an object:
    e. *Said John&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Chris|title=Quotative Inversion|journal=Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory|date=1997|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–41|jstor=4047860|doi=10.1023/a:1005722729974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Speak'' may occur without an object. In fact, its occurrence with an object is restricted. A that-clause, for example, is ungrammatical:
    f. Margaret spoke (to me)
    g. *Margaret spoke that there were cockroaches in the caviar&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt;
v. Some manner-of-speaking verbs may occur with directional [[adverbials]], which cannot co-occur with indirect objects:
 (6)a. He bellowed '''at us''' (*to Sam)&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt;
Other verba dicendi cannot occur in ''at'' constructions:
    b. *She {said/remarked/declared} (something) '''at me'''&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt;
vi. Some manner-of-speaking verbs may have a nominal (noun) counterpart which sounds the same, but which has no communicative content, such as ''mutter'', ''bellow'', ''shriek'', ''whine'' and ''whisper''. Notice that other verba dicendi do not have these [[homophonous]] nouns (e.g. ''speak''/''speech'', ''tell/tale'', ''declare/declaration'').&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt;
There are many such observations. Another property of verbs of speaking is the lack of so-called [[factivity]] effect; in other words, the speaker is not required to actually believe what they are saying.&lt;ref name="Faure"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faure|first1=Richard|title=Verbs of speaking and verbs of thinking|journal=HAL archives-ouvertes|date=2009|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00469813}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has implications for the [[truth conditions]] of quotative constructions:
 (7) Mary says that Paul is her friend.
Mary’s statement may be false, though it may be true that she actually said it. In fact, she may even believe it to be false. However, whether or not believing is part of speaking has been debated for some time.&lt;ref name="Faure"/&gt;

===Syntax===

The [[syntax]] of quotation and verba dicendi appears at first glance to be a straightforward case of [[transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]], in which the quoted material is interpreted as a direct object. In a case like
 (8) Jim said “I love you”&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt;
[[File:English Tree1.png|thumb|Phrase structure tree of embedded quotation as direct object&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt;]]
the traditionally held analysis takes the reported clause “I love you” to be the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of ''say''. Thus the quote is termed an [[Noun phrase|NP]] (noun phrase) and introduced as a direct object.

This analysis is supported by some of the typical syntactic tools for testing direct objects, such as moving into the focus of a question and [[clefting]].&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt; However, constituency, movement and replacement tests show that the quotative clause does not behave like a normal transitive construction. For example, [[clefting]] and [[passivization]] of these forms give marked (ungrammatical, or strange at least) results:
 (9)a. ?“I’ll call you” was said by Pat
       cf. The cat was held by Pat
    b. ?What Pat did with “I’ll call you” was say it
       cf. What Pat did with the cat was hold it&lt;ref name="Darcy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Arcy|first1=A.|title=Quotation &amp; advances in understanding syntacitc system|journal=Annual Review of Linguistics|date=2015|volume=1|pages=43–61|doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Quotation may also be less restricted than ordinary transitive verbs. They may occur parenthetically, unlike other verbs:
 (10)a. “I’ll call you” Pat said “and I hope you answer”
        cf. ?The cat Pat held and a book
     b. “I” Pat said “will call you and I hope you answer”
        cf. *The Pat held cat and a book&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt;{{dubious|date=August 2018}}
Another issue is that manner-of-speaking verbs are not always obligatorily transitive. Verbs like ''think'', ''laugh'', ''scream'', ''yell'', ''whisper'' may be [[intransitive]].&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt;
A different model has been proposed, which does not rely on transitivity, but rather an [[asymmetrical]] construction containing a reporting clause (head) and an independent reported clause.&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt; Note that the asymmetry arises from the fact that the reporting clause is dependent on the quoted content for grammaticality, while the reverse is not true.
 (11)a.*I said
     b.“I love you”
In this model, the dependent clause has a site of elaboration (e-site) which is filled by the independent clause:
  HEAD[Pat said      e-site]   COMPLEMENT[“I’ll call you”]
  HEAD[Pat thought   e-site]   COMPLEMENT[“I’ll call you”]
  HEAD[Pat was like  e-site]   COMPLEMENT[“I’ll call you”]&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt;

===Direct/indirect quotation===
Direct quotation is reported from the perspective of the experiencer: 
 (12) He said “I am leaving now”&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt;
However, indirect quotation is often paraphrased, and reported by a narrator from the perspective of the reportee. Verbs like ''ask'' and ''tell'' are frequently associated with indirect speech. English indirect quotation also shows a [[sequence-of-tense]] effect: a past tense reporting verb requires a "back-shift" in verb tense within the indirect quote itself&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt;
 (13)a. He '''said''' "I '''am''' leaving now"
     b. He '''said''' (that) he '''was''' leaving immediately&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt;
Indirect quotation is, in theory, syntactically constrained and requires that the quoted content form a [[subordinate clause]] under the [[Complementizer phrase|CP]] node.&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt; However, what is heard in speech does not necessarily conform to theory. The [[complementizer]] ''that'', though considered to be a marker of indirect quotation, is not obligatory and is often omitted. Further, it can (and does) occur with direct quotes in some dialects of English (e.g. Hong Kong, Indian).&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt; 
Verbs of speaking often employ the [[Conversational Historical Present]] tense, whereby actions in the past are referred to with present-tense [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. This is considered to add immediacy or authority to the discourse.&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt; However, it also illustrates the difficulty in differentiating direct and indirect quotation.&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt; 
 (14) So uh ... this lady '''says''' ... uh this uh Bert (‘)His son’ll make them. He’s an electrician(‘)&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt;

===Inverted constructions===
Sentences with verba dicendi for direct quotation may use the somewhat antiquated verb-first (V2) order of English syntax. Inversion of this type with verbs of speaking or thinking frequently occurs in written English, though rarely in spoken English. It is also possible to invert the clause without changing subject-verb order. This is not possible with regular English transitives:
 (15)a. “No no no” said Harry
     b. “You’re not drunk” she says 
     cf. *The cat held Pat (where Pat did the holding)&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt;
There are several restrictions, however. For example, [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s may occur to the right of the subject in a non-inverted quotative sentence, but not in an inverted sentence. They can, however, occur to the immediate left of the subject in an inverted sentence:
 (16)a.”We must do this again”, the guests '''all''' declared to Tony
     b.”We must do this again”, declared '''all''' the guests to Tony
     c.*”We must do this again”, declared the guests '''all''' to Tony&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;
Inversion and negation with verba dicendi may co-occur only if the reporting clause itself is not inverted: 
 (17)a.“Let’s eat”, said John just once
     b.“Let’s eat”, John didn’t just say once
     c.*”Let’s eat”, said not John just once
     d.*”Let’s eat”, not said John just once&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;
Other constraints involve subject position, [[Determiner phrase|DP]] direct objects, and movement, among others.

===Grammaticalization===
[[Grammaticalization]] is the attribution of grammatical character to a previously independent, autonomous word.&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt; There is significant cross-linguistic evidence of verba dicendi grammaticalizing into functional syntactic categories. For instance, in some African and Asian languages, these verbs may grammaticalize into a complementizer.&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt; In other East African languages, they may become markers of Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM).&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt; In English, the verb ''say'' in particular has also developed the function of a [[comment clause]]:
 (18)a. '''Say''' there actually were vultures on his tail
     b. What '''say''' he does answer?
     c. Buy a big bottle – '''say''' about 250 mils 
     d. If we ran out of flour or sugar, '''say''', we would gather up a few eggs and take them to Mr. Nichols’s general store
     e.“'''Say''', isn’t that–” Lance started, but Buck answered before the question was even asked
     f.“'''Say''', that’s our City,” bubbles Dolores
     g. Jump, I '''say''', and be done with it&lt;ref name="Brinton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brinton|first1=L.J.|title=The Comment Clause in English: Syntactic origins and pragmatic development (Studies in English Language)|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521886734}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In these examples, the verb ''say'' fulfils many roles. In the first two examples (a &amp; b), it means ‘suppose', or 'assume.’ In the third and fourth examples (c &amp; d) the meaning of ''say'' could be paraphrased as 'for example', or 'approximately.'  Example (e) uses ''say'' as an [[imperative mood|imperative]] introducing a question and connotes 'tell me/us.'  ''Say'' may also function as an [[interjection]] to either focus attention on the speaker or to convey some emotional state such as surprise, regret, disbelief, etc.&lt;ref name="Brinton"/&gt; Finally, example (f) uses ''say'' in an emphatic, often imperative way. This function dates from the (early) Middle English period&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt;

===Emergence of innovative forms: ''go'', '' be all'', ''be like''===
In addition to basic verba dicendi and manner of speaking verbs, other forms are frequently used in spoken English. What sets these apart is that they are not, semantically speaking, reporting verbs at all. Such forms include ''be like'', ''be all'', and ''go''.
 (19)a. Pat '''was like''' “I’ll call you.”&lt;ref name="Darcy"/&gt;
     b. [...]and then my sister'''’s all''' “excuse me would you mind if I gave you, if I want your autograph” and she'''’s like''' “oh sure, no problem.” 
     c. And he '''goes''' “yeah” and looks and you can tell maybe he thinks he’s got the wrong address[…]&lt;ref name="Barbieri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbieri|first1=Federica|title=Older Men and Younger Women: A corpus-based study of quotative use in American English|journal=English World Wide|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=23–45|doi=10.1075/eww.28.1.03bar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These forms, particularly ''be like'',  have captured the attention of much linguistic study and documentation. Some research has addressed the syntax of these forms in quotation, which is highly problematic. For example, a verbum dicendi like ''say'' may refer to a previously quoted clause with ''it''. However, this is not possible with these innovative forms:
 (20)a. “I don’t know if he heard '''it''', but I know I definitely '''said it'''
     b. *'''I’m like''' it
     c. *She '''was all it'''
     d. *I '''went it'''&lt;ref name="Vandelanotte"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandelanotte|first1=L|title=The Emergence and Structure of be like and related quotatives: A constructional account|journal=Cognitive Linguistics|date=2009|volume=20|issue=4|pages=777–807|doi=10.1515/COGL.2009.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Notice that these forms also don’t behave as basic verba dicendi in many other ways. Clefting, for example, produces ungrammatical forms like
 (21)a. *That’s nice '''was gone''' by me 
     b. *Um, yah, I know, but there’s going to be wine there '''was been all''' by her&lt;ref name="Vandelanotte"/&gt;
They also can’t participate in inverted constructions like other manner-of-speaking verbs:
 (22)a. *“Go home”, he '''was like'''
     b. *“I’m leaving”, '''was all''' John
Several other issues concerning these forms are the topic of much current study, including their [[diachrony]], or change in use over time. ''Go'', for example, dates as far back as the eighteenth century, in contexts like ''go bang'', ''go crack'', ''go crash'', etc.&lt;ref name="Buch"/&gt;
Research on these forms has also shown that ''be like'' in particular is associated with young people. However, this assumption is questioned on the basis of more recent findings which suggest that it is used by older speakers as well.&lt;ref name="Barbieri"/&gt; It has also been largely attributed to female speakers, especially white females in California (Valley Girls). However, it is regularly used by speakers of both sexes, and in dialects of English outside of the US, including Canada and the UK.&lt;ref name="Vandelanotte"/&gt; This is a topic of a great deal of research in current syntax and [[sociolinguistics]].

In Japanese, verba dicendi (発話行為動詞 [hatsuwa koui doushi] &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Kazunori|date=1991|title=Hatsuwa koui doushi no imi bunseki [Meaning analysis of speech act verbs]|url=https://doors.doshisha.ac.jp/duar/repository/ir/24006/?lang=0|journal=Core|language=ja|volume=20|pages=87–98|doi=10.14988/pa.2017.0000014882|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'speech act verb'), also referred to as verbs of communication&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or verbs of saying,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirose|first=Yukio|date=1995|title=Direct and indirect speech as quotations of public and private expression|url=|journal=Lingua|volume=95|pages=223–238|via=|doi=10.1016/0024-3841(94)00006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; include 言う''iu/yuu'' 'say,' 聞く''kiku'' 'ask,' 語る''kataru'' 'relate,' 話す ''hanasu'' 'talk,' and 述べる ''noberu'' 'state.'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/841170931|title=Direct and indirect speech|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|others=Coulmas, Florian.|year=1986|isbn=0899251765|location=Berlin|pages=161–178|oclc=841170931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Verba dicendi occur in the following construction: [_________] {と-''to,'' て-''tte''} Verbum dicendi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;と-''to'' has been described as a complementizer and a quotative particle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Historically, use of と-''to'' was restricted to reporting a statement by another speaker, but it has a much wider distribution in modern Japanese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In conversational Japanese, て-''tte''&lt;ref&gt;For syntactic distribution of て-''tte,'' see Hirose &amp; Nawata (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; is more frequently used, and it has been described as a quotative particle, a hearsay particle, a quotation marker, and a quotative complementizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsui|first=Tomoko|last2=Yamamoto|first2=Taeko|title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother–child conversation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|language=en|volume=59|pages=5–25|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirose, T. &amp; Nawata, H.|first=|date=2016|title=On the Quotative "Complementizer" -Tte in Japanese|url=|journal=Semantics-Syntax Interface|volume=3|pages=1–29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the above construction, the underlined phrase headed by {と-''to'', て-''tte''} can be a word, a clause, a sentence, or an onomatopoetic expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Like in English, verba dicendi in Japanese can introduce both direct and indirect speech as their complement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is contrasted with verbs of thinking, which only introduce indirect speech. An exception to this is a verb of thinking 思う ''omou'' 'think,' which can introduce a speech that is not uttered but takes place in one's mind as direct speech in the simple past tense; this use of 思う ''omou'' 'think' is called a "quasi-communicative act."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Direct or indirect speech: ambiguity ===
In Japanese, a complement of a verbum dicendi can be ambiguous between direct and indirect readings, meaning that the distinction can only be inferred from the discourse context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example,  in (1), [boku ga Tookyoo e iku], which is in the complement of the verb 言う ''iu'' (past tense: ''itta''), can be interpreted as either direct speech (2)a or indirect speech (2)b.&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) 太郎は僕が東京へ行くと言った。&lt;br/&gt;Taroo wa     [boku        ga       Tookyoo     e    ik-u]   to           it-ta&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taro   TOP  I(MALE)   NOM   Tokyo        to    go-PRS    QUOT   say-PST.&lt;br/&gt;(2)a. Taro&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said, "I&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; will go to Tokyo."&lt;br/&gt;(2)b. Taro&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that I&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; would go to Tokyo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Sentence_(1).png|thumb|475x475px|Phrase structure representation of (1)]]

One reason for this direct-indirect ambiguity in Japanese is that Japanese indirect speech does not involve "backshifting of tense"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; observed in other languages including English. In the English translations, the direct speech in (2)a has ''will'' in the tense of the embedded clause, but in (2)b, it has been "backshifted" to ''would'' so that it matches the past tense of the matrix clause. Tense does not serve as a diagnostics of direct-indirect distinctions in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakasono|first=Atsunori|date=1994|title=Inyoubun no dakiushisu--hatsuwa koui ron karano bunseki [Deictic Expressions in Quotations--An Analysis from the Viewpoint of Speech Acts ]|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110000425287/|journal=Gengo Kenkyu [Journal of the Linguistic Society of Japan]|volume=105|pages=87–109|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another reason for the ambiguity is that both direct and indirect quotes are introduced by {と-''to'', て-''tte''} in Japanese. Hence, presence of an overt complementizer cannot disambiguate direct and indirect speech either.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Diagnostics of direct speech in Japanese ===
Disambiguation of direct and indirect speech in Japanese depends on switches in deictic expressions and expressions of "speaker-addressee relationship."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One language-specific diagnostics of direct speech is so-called "addressee-oriented expressions,"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which trigger a presupposition that there is an addressee in the discourse context. Some examples are listed below:&lt;blockquote&gt;sentence final particles: さ -''sa'' 'let me tell you'; ね -''ne'' 'you know'; よ -''yo'' 'I tell you'; わ -''wa'' 'I want you to know'&lt;br/&gt;imperative forms: 「走れ！」''hashire'' 'Run!’&lt;br/&gt;polite verbs/polite auxiliary verbs: です ''desu''; ございます ''gozaimasu''; ます''masu''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, in (3), [Ame da yo] in the complement of the verb 言う ''iu'' (past tense: ''itta'') is unambiguously interpreted as direct speech because of the sentence final particle よ -''yo'' 'I tell you.'&lt;blockquote&gt;(3) 太郎は花子に「雨だよ」と言った。&lt;br/&gt;Taro  wa      Hanako  ni       [Ame  da     yo]   to           it-ta&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taro  TOP   Hanako  DAT   Rain  COP  ''yo''  QUOT   say-PST&lt;br/&gt;'Taro said to Hanako, "It is raining, I tell you."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Similarly, in (4), [Ame desu] in the complement of the verb 言う ''iu'' (past tense: ''itta'') is unambiguously interpreted as direct speech because of the polite verb です ''desu.''&lt;blockquote&gt;(4) 太郎は花子に「雨です」と言った。&lt;br/&gt;Taro  wa      Hanako  ni       [Ame  desu]   to           it-ta&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taro  TOP   Hanako  DAT   Rain  ''desu''   QUOT   say-PST&lt;br/&gt;'Taro said to Hanako politely, "It is raining."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Diagnostics of indirect speech in Japanese ===
One diagnostics of indirect speech in Japanese is presence of the reflexive pronoun 自分 ''zibun'' 'self.' It is a gender-neutral pronoun that uniformly refers to "the private self,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or an agent of thinking, as opposed to "the public self," an agent of communicating, expressed by various personal pronouns (e.g. 僕 ''boku'' 'I(MALE)'), occupational roles (e.g. 先生 ''sensei'' 'teacher'), and kinship terms (e.g. お母さん ''okaasan'' 'mother').&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For example, in (5), [zibun ga Tookyoo e iku] in the complement of the verb 言う ''iu'' (past tense: ''itta'') is unambiguously interpreted as indirect speech because of the presence of 自分 ''zibun'' 'self,' which is [[Coreference|co-referential]] with 太郎 ''Taro''.&lt;blockquote&gt;(5) 太郎は自分が東京へ行くと言った。&lt;br/&gt;Taroo&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; wa     [zibun&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;        ga       Tookyoo     e    iku]   to           it-ta&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taro   TOP  self           NOM   Tokyo        to    go    QUOT   say-PST.&lt;br/&gt;'Taro said that he would go to Tokyo.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;Note that (5) only differs from (1) in the subject of the embedded clause; (5) has 自分 ''zibun'' 'self' and (1) has 僕 ''boku'' 'I(MALE).'

=== Simultaneously direct and indirect speech ===
It has been reported that some sentences in Japanese have characteristics of both direct and indirect modes simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This phenomenon is called "semi-indirect mode" or "quasi-direct mode." It is also observed in a reported speech, and Kuno (1988) has termed it "blended discourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuno|first=Susumu|date=1988|title=Blended quasi-direct discourse in Japanese|url=|journal=Papers from the Second International Workshop on Japanese Syntax|volume=|pages=75–102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (6) is an example of blended discourse.&lt;blockquote&gt;(6) 太郎は奴のうちに何時に来いと言ったのか。&lt;br/&gt;Taro&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; wa [yatu&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-no uti-ni nanzi-ni ko-i] to it-ta no ka?&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taro TOP [he-GEN house-DAT what.time-DAT come-IMP] QUOT say-PST Q Q&lt;br/&gt;'&lt;u&gt;What time&lt;/u&gt; did Taro&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; say, [come to his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; house ______]?'&lt;/blockquote&gt;[yatu-no uti-ni nanzi-ni ko-i] in the complement of the verb 言う ''iu'' (past tense: ''itta'') appears to be direct speech because it has an imperative verb form 来い ''ko-i'' 'Come!'.

On the other hand, the third person pronoun 奴 ''yatu'' 'he' inside the embedded clause is co-referential with the matrix subject 太郎 ''Taro.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This means that this deictic expression inside the embedded clause is interpreted in the context in which the whole sentence (6) is uttered; cross-linguistically, this is considered to be a property of indirect speech.

Moreover, the wh-phrase 何時 ''nanzi'' 'what time' inside the embedded clause is taking matrix [[Logical Form (linguistics)|scope]], meaning that it interacts with the matrix clause to influence the meaning of the whole sentence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This sentence means that, for example, 太郎 ''Taro'' had said "Come to my house at ten o'clock!," and the utterer of (6), not knowing the content of "ten o'clock," is requesting for this information. Availability of this meaning is an indication of indirect speech because if the embedded clause was direct speech, it would be syntactically opaque.
